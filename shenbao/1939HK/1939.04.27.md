### The Great Significance of Shanghai's Anti-Traitor Movement - National Spiritual Mobilization in Occupied Areas

According to yesterday's special edition of this newspaper, "Shanghai's Anti-Traitor Movement," Shanghai, which has been occupied for more than eighteen months, has recently launched a National Spiritual Mobilization Movement. Not only the cultural circles, the press, and youth circles have had enthusiastic large-scale publicity, but also all occupational circles have actively risen to participate in this vigorous movement. In an area controlled by the * Japanese for a long time, and in the * Japanese-controlled International Settlement and French Concession today, the discovery of such an enthusiastic and stimulating patriotic movement is worthy of special attention.

Shanghai is the cultural center of Central China. The progress of its patriotic movement can not only maintain the anti-Japanese resistance forces in Shanghai, but also affect the entire Central China region and even various occupied areas in the north and south. Shanghai is not only a Chinese cultural center, but also a place where countries around the world pay attention to. Therefore, the rise and fall of Shanghai's resistance to Japan and defense of the country directly affects the belief of people from all countries in our determination to resist Japan, and the trust of governments of all countries in our strength to resist Japan. At the same time, Shanghai is also the most active area for * Japanese and traitor activities. * Japanese special agents and propagandists are mostly concentrated here, and big and small traitors also regard Shanghai as their main base of operations. If we can continue to launch the anti-Japanese and anti-traitor movement here, we can weaken the power of the * Japanese a lot. Therefore, the significance of Shanghai's patriotic movement is even greater.

Our anti-Japanese work cannot neglect the propaganda behind the * Japanese lines. This is an unbreakable principle. Soon after our retreat from Nanjing to Wuhan, many maritime cultural workers, such as Mr. Hu Yuzhi, strongly advocated that cultural workers go to the rear of the * Japanese, especially to Shanghai. Our government also paid attention to this. Therefore, the patriotic movement in Shanghai's cultural circles did not decline compared to normal times. Not only did publications promoting resistance to Japan not decrease, but they were also welcomed by all sectors. There, traitor newspapers cannot exist, and can only be distributed secretly from door to door. There, there are also thousands upon thousands of patriotic youths who continue to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the * Japanese and traitors at the cost of everything. Recently, we also received a private letter, which, in addition to describing the recent patriotic movement in Shanghai and its increasing danger, also said "Anyway, a person only dies once." What a great spirit!

Recently, the Wang Jingwei faction, out of embarrassment and anger, attempted a final struggle and concentrated in Shanghai, engaging in rampant and mad * treacherous and glory-seeking activities, on the one hand buying existing newspapers and magazines, and on the other hand publishing new publications themselves. The Wang faction also wants to organize some kind of "Anti-Communist Alliance." What a terrible and hateful act! People of all ages and all walks of life in Shanghai, filled with patriotic fervor, could no longer bear it. They disregarded the recent increase in * Japanese * in Shanghai and resolutely rose up to launch an anti-traitor movement. On every propaganda day of the National Spiritual Mobilization, there were extremely enthusiastic actions and expressions. Employees of the press issued a joint declaration, denouncing the fallacies and妄举 of the traitors, calling on all citizens to block all avenues for Wang Jingwei and his followers. Newspapers published special anti-traitor editions, schools issued the National Morality Mobilization Outline, and the Education Sector National Mobilization Association issued a "Letter to the Youth of the City." On the 21st, the cultural sector's propaganda day, all newspapers and magazines in the city unanimously mobilized to complete their missions. On the 22nd, the occupational sector's propaganda day, the Shanghai Occupational Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association was also established at this time and issued a declaration.

The greatest strength of our resistance is that the * Japanese cannot digest their occupied areas. We still control the lives of the * Japanese in the occupied areas. If the * Japanese cannot absolutely rule the occupied areas, then their depression and difficulties will increase with the expansion of their battlefields. The * Japanese war in China has reached the stage of blind "wolfish rampages." If we can expand the spirit of * Japanese hatred in the occupied areas and continue to work hard to resist Japan, the overall collapse of the * Japanese will be accelerated, and our final victory will come sooner. Patriotic compatriots across the country should deeply respond to the progress of the Shanghai Cloth Patriotic Movement!

### Popular Reading Materials in the Northwest

— Mei Wen

A Newspaper for the Common People

(Special Dispatch from Shanxi) Before the War of Resistance, culture in the Northwest was generally more backward than in other places due to barren land, impoverished people, and inconvenient transportation. However, since the War of Resistance began, cultural centers in the Southeast have successively fallen, and Xi'an in the Northwest has become one of the national cultural centers. The reporter will introduce to readers the "Laobaixing" ("Common People") newspaper, a model of popular reading material from Xi'an's publications and the most worthy of introduction for nationwide audiences.

"Culture Serving the Military," "Culture Going to the Countryside," and "Awakening the People" have already become the central tasks of the cultural circles during the War of Resistance. The "Laobaixing" newspaper in Xi'an was produced to meet this need. Because it uses a new approach to say what the common people want to say and tell the common people what they want to hear, catering to the tastes of the common people, it has already had great development in its short history, despite facing many difficulties.

The "Laobaixing" newspaper began publication in November of the year before last (1937), coming out once every ten days. In less than four months, in response to readers' requests, it changed from a ten-day publication to a weekly publication. The number of copies also increased from 600 to more than 5,000. It now sells 7,500 copies. The area of distribution initially only included Xi'an city. Now, there are more than 120 distribution points in southern Shanxi, northern Shanxi, Gansu's Gangu, Tianshui, Qingyang, Lanzhou, Xinjiang's Dihua, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi's Nanchang, Anhui, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, and even * Japanese-controlled Hebei Province and the northwest of Shandong. Shaanxi Province has the most sales. The Guanzhong area alone has 85 distribution points. The area along the Yellow River and Sanyuan, Fengxiang, and northern Shaanxi are also very common.

The content of the "Laobaixing" newspaper, in addition to the regular "Seven-Day War Situation," "Seven-Day Domestic Affairs," and "Seven-Day Major Foreign Affairs" in each issue, also writes about the heroic sacrifices of the people, the valiant resistance of the front-line troops, the various activities of the * Japanese rear-area volunteer army, self-defense forces, and guerrillas, the various good policies of governments at all levels, the patriotic movements of the people in various places, as well as scientific knowledge, biographies of famous people, etc., into various essays and ditties, instilling them into the common people. Those that have already been published include "Platoon Leader Wang Died Without Letting Go of His Machine Gun," "Living Bodhisattva Zhou Tai-tai," "The Story of Japanese Warlords in Southern Shanxi," "Song of Eternal Stink," "Anti-Japanese Yangko," "Anti-Japanese Lotus Drop," "Enticement Plan," "Why Revenge," "Son! Go Be a Soldier!", "Battlefield Song," "Hero Yao Zinian," etc. These kinds of essays and ditties, because they are written in the language and characters of the common people, have played a great role in encouraging and educating in the morning villages.

The "Laobaixing" newspaper does not just complete the matter by editing and publishing. It also has a direct relationship with its readers. There are more than 40 "Laobaixing Co-Reading Groups" in Shaanxi. In addition to gathering to discuss the issues contained in each issue of the "Laobaixing" newspaper, they also read the newspaper to women, workers, and idlers chatting on the street, and regularly report on their work and request guidance. Another kind of direct relationship is correspondence. Since the publication of "Laobaixing" to the present, it has received more than 1,000 letters from various places. These letters cover a wide range, such as county government issues, people's livelihood issues, education issues, conscription issues, apportionment issues, etc. These are all issues that the common people want to raise but cannot raise, want to publish but have nowhere to publish. Now, they are all published in "Various Local Communications" in "Laobaixing." Therefore, "Laobaixing" is actually a thing co-founded by the common people, so they cherish it.

The readers of "Laobaixing" include farmers, workers, students, primary school teachers, and soldiers. The influence it produces is also very great. For example, during the wheat harvest last year, the newspaper first proposed the "Wheat Harvesting Movement." At that time, students went to the countryside and soldiers left their camps to help farmers harvest wheat. Also, the indiscriminate collection of sugar tax at a certain ferry crossing along the Yellow River in Shanxi, and the inadequate treatment of a certain wounded soldier hospital in Shaanxi, have been considerably improved due to the newspaper's exposure. In addition, striking local bullies and resolving the salt shortage all speak the words that the common people want to say. To the point that soldiers and common people along the Yellow River regard "Laobaixing" as a play to sing. A certain division in southern Shanxi once expressed that it wanted to order a copy of "Laobaixing" for each transport, which shows its depth among soldiers and civilians.

The "Laobaixing" agency also publishes pamphlets, such as "Anti-Japanese Nation-Building Ditties," "Committee Members Going to the Countryside Song," "Chairman Chiang's Song to the Military and Civilians," "Three-Character Classic for Baojia Chiefs," "Old Man Wang Enlists," "Three-Character Classic for Outer Mongolia," etc., which are very popular among the people. Whether farmers are farming or walking, they can sing them casually. They sometimes even want to exchange chickens for the "Laobaixing" newspaper.

"Laobaixing" is edited using Shaanxi dialect. The editors are mostly former secondary school teachers retired from the military. It is not easy for them to support this thing in an extremely difficult environment. The editor-in-chief, Mr. Li Furen, is the former director of discipline at Xi'an Normal School. His consistently hard-working spirit is truly admirable. The "Laobaixing" agency also suffered during the recent * Japanese bombing of Xi'an, but it can still continue to support itself.

"Laobaixing" spends more than 300 yuan per month, while its income is only about 150 yuan. The remaining * is subsidized by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters with 80 yuan per month and the Department of Education with 5,000 yuan per month. If that is not enough, it relies on private donations. Therefore, it still feels economically difficult. It is not enough to publish the newspaper every month. The living expenses of the editors and all workers are of course not enough to supply. Therefore, the problem of people arises. In addition, there are some people who look at it with colored glasses, so they have to take some time to deal with personnel matters, so that "Laobaixing" cannot have many people focusing their efforts.

Based on the experience of the "Laobaixing" editors, they feel:

1.  The degree of popularization should be determined according to the level of knowledge of the local common people. In order to make the common people understand deeply, it may sometimes be "vulgar" or "banal" to match the actual life of the common people.

2.  The common people like to read * vernacular literature. This point can be proven by ancient proverbs, maxims, and visiting ditties. * Vernacular literature is easy for the common people to receive and will not be forgotten.

3.  The common people do not like long articles, but like short articles with concrete facts that are straightforward and speak frankly.

4.  The past "popularization" and "new enlightenment movement" neglected locality. Because China has different dialects and customs in different places, a single popular language and content cannot be suitable for every corner of China. Therefore, popular reading materials that are different in each place should be based on local dialects and customs to launch different "new enlightenment movements" and then gradually unify this movement.

5.  The common people like to hear the spoken language of their own people and read about their own affairs, so popular reading materials should use the words of the common people as much as possible and do not need to read profound theories.

6.  The common people do not like to read small characters. For example, the previous "Three-Character Classic" and "Hundred Family Surnames" were all printed in large characters.

7.  The common people themselves must have communications that can be published so that the common people know that they can also speak.

8.  Say what the common people want to say as much as possible, and do not be afraid.

9.  The words that the common people commonly use should be noted as strong * words to push the masses forward.

10. Authors must write from the standpoint of the common people in order to be popular works.

Xi'an's "Laobaixing" newspaper is still in the process of overcoming difficulties and continuing to grow. It is the vanguard of "awakening the people," "culture serving the military," and "culture going to the countryside" in the Northwest.

### On the National Covenant

In reason, a national's love for his country is his innate responsibility. If a country is encountering enemy aggression and its nationals cannot demonstrate their patriotic spirit and resolutely resist on the front lines, and are willing to be obedient subjects of the enemy country, this is a historical anomaly.

Japanese imperialism's invasion of China, under the evolution of its failed attempts at partition and nibbling, has reached the final scene of its current attempt to swallow it whole on its own. The night of September 18 in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) was the fuse for this swallowing policy. However, Japanese imperialism is a country with congenital deficiencies. Although it has the form of imperialism, its strength is actually very small. So, until now, under the cover of two million troops, it has opened its bloody mouth wide and has no way to close it again. This kind of ugly and embarrassing situation has already aroused the cold ridicule and sarcasm of the whole world. However, we can believe that before its bestiality is extinguished, it is really impossible to expect it to withdraw its demonic claws. The Chinese nationals on the isolated island have already heard and witnessed the atrocities of the invaders. If we are not vigilant about the pain of national subjugation at this time when the country is in extreme danger, I believe there will inevitably be a day when we want to cry but have no tears. If the Chinese nationals are determined to avoid this unnecessary pain of national subjugation, the only way is for everyone to arouse their spirit and shoulder the minimum responsibility of a national.

Chairman Chiang once declared to us: "In the first phase of the War of Resistance, spirit and matter are equally important. In the second phase of the War of Resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than matter. Therefore, we must raise the spirit of the national people and then we can overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and complete the mission of the War of Resistance." Now, our implementation of national spiritual mobilization is based on Chairman Chiang's proposition. Under the environment of national consistency in this spiritual mobilization, the best way to concretely express our love for the country is to faithfully abide by the twelve articles of the National Covenant.

Generally, people think that the twelve articles of the National Covenant are very ordinary and passive. In fact, these twelve articles of the National Covenant, on the surface, are passive, but in practice are more active than any exaggerated words. If every national can abide by the oath in good conscience, the greatness of this power is equivalent to * every national going to the front line, and equivalent to every national fighting and killing the enemy, enough to make the small country of the invader with its sixty million people kneel down under the resistance of our four hundred and fifty million people armed with spirit.

Why do I say that? This is in terms of the first article of the Covenant, "Do not violate the Three Principles of the People." If every national has this belief, then we know that the external aspect of the Three Principles of the People is to overthrow imperialism. Under the current state of affairs, all nationals must adhere to this belief, display the spirit of revolution, and give a head-on blow to the imperialism that is invading us. Therefore, the word "do not" in each article of the covenant should indeed be observed by everyone according to its meaning. But in terms of the reverse effect of our observance of it, it is enough to control the * Japanese's death and is a very powerful hand grenade. If every national can abide by the twelve articles of the National Covenant, it is as if every national is holding twelve hand grenades in his hand, standing in his own position, and can rush towards the * Japanese at any time.

Therefore, the National Covenant is not only to be passively observed, but also to actively unfold the posture of attacking the * Japanese. All our national masses should concentrate their minds on the twelve articles of the Covenant, use their own opportunities to display their power at any time, and thoroughly shatter the poison scheme of the aggressor's enticement and threat. From today onwards, I hope that all Chinese compatriots in the city will take the National Covenant, towards our national flag, our leader, and swear to carry it out without hypocrisy. In order to enable the masses of the city to have a full understanding of the covenant, I will write it down again for the attention of my compatriots: (1) Do not violate the Three Principles of the People; (2) Do not violate government laws and regulations; (3) Do not harm the interests of the nation and the people; (4) Do not be a traitor or an obedient subject of the * Japanese; (5) Do not participate in traitor organizations; (6) Do not be an official of the * Japanese and traitors; (7) Do not lead the way for the enemy and traitors; (8) Do not inquire about news for the * Japanese and traitors; (9) Do not work for the * Japanese and traitors; (10) Do not use banknotes from * Japanese and traitor banks; (11) Do not buy * Japanese goods; (12) Do not sell grain and all items to the * Japanese and traitors.

### Our Army Advances Rapidly Again in Jiangxi and Hubei - All Routes Respond and Strike Directly at Nanchang and Fengxin - Our Army Takes Advantage of Victory and Vigorously Attacks Chongyang in Tongshan

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] The Jiangxi battle continues to progress. We captured Gangshang Village on the shore of the Gan River and advanced to Shengmi Street. In a bloody battle with the * Japanese, we are fiercely fighting over the area between Gao'an and Fengxin counties, only 20 li away from Fengxin County. In the Wuning area, we are in a stalemate in Yinggang.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] All battlefields were stable on the 25th. The * Japanese forces gathered in Wuhan are being reorganized and replenished. The Jiangxi troops are exhausted and are still engaged in fierce battles in Wufeng Mountain west of Wuning, Chaping'ao, and Lianhua Mountain northeast of Gao'an City, as well as near the south of Nanchang.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] In the Jiangbei battle, the Chinese army is advancing towards Nanchang in two routes. One route is from Gao'an, which has passed about 20 kilometers northeast of the city, only about 50 kilometers south of Nanchang. The other route is attacking Fengxin, which is very smooth. In southern Hubei, the situation has not changed much. In addition, the defense works of the Chinese army in Changsha have been strengthened, it is said.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 26th] Several squadrons of Chinese bombers were spotted over Jiujiang on the morning of the 22nd of this month, fiercely bombing the Japanese army and its military equipment and ammunition concentrated there, and strafing with machine guns. After about two hours, they safely returned to their base. In addition, six Japanese planes bombed Fuzhou yesterday morning.

[Central News Agency, Shanggao, 26th Dispatch] Our troops attacking Fengxin from the south bank of * Water can encircle the * Japanese trapped in the city. On the morning of the 26th, the * Japanese counterattacked our positions in Baishanao, Zhushangang on the Fuan shore, trying to break through, but were intercepted by us and retreated into the city.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army operating in the southeast of Hubei Province and the Dasaka area of Tongshan has now advanced to the suburbs of Xianning City, and fierce fighting has broken out in the Tingsiqiao area. At the same time, another team of the Chinese army is advancing south from Tongshan, attacking Chongyang on the Hunan border, and fierce fighting is currently taking place at Baikuanqiao, twelve miles east. Tongshan, Da, Nanlinqiao, and Baiqiao are all in the hands of the Chinese army. The highway from Chongyang to Yangxin, an important communication route for the Japanese army, is now two-thirds in the hands of the Chinese army. Therefore, the Japanese army is trapped in Chongyang. At the same time, Chinese guerrillas are attacking the paper mill south of Wuchang, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers and destroying Japanese vehicles, ammunition depots, and storage places. In addition, after repelling the Japanese army's attack on Gao'an, the Chinese army in Jiangxi Province is now advancing towards Fengxin in two routes, approaching JuXin only half a mile away.

Senior Staff Officer of the Southwest Headquarters Discusses the Importance of Gao'an and Tongshan

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 26th Dispatch] The news of the recovery of Gao'an, Tongshan, and other places spread here, and the people of the whole city cheered and celebrated, their spirits greatly boosted. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited a senior staff officer of the headquarters yesterday to inquire about the importance of the recovery of the two major strongholds. He immediately told him in a very excited tone, "Our army has firmly grasped the throat of the * Japanese, causing their limbs to be separated and trapped in an inextricable quagmire." He continued, "Gao'an is the lock guarding Nanchang, and at the same time, it is also a shortcut for invading Chang * . The sinister strategy of the * Japanese is to exert all their efforts to occupy it. However, the phenomenon of the * Japanese being strong on the outside but weak on the inside has been fully exposed after the Nanchang battle. After our line of defense was deployed, we gave the * Japanese the most violent突击with our original strength and defeated them. Gao'an was thus recovered. The * Japanese in Nanchang are obviously under our control. Under the pressure of our effective power, they have lost their counterattack * power and are increasingly trapped in our encirclement, leading to the disaster of collapse. The capture of Tongshan by us was indeed beyond the expectation of the * Japanese, and it was also a strategic victory for us. Tongshan is the major axis of the * Japanese war in northern Hunan and Jiangxi. Horizontally, it is the transportation hub of Yueyang and Jiujiang, and vertically, it is the auxiliary of the Nanxun Road. Our army now used a surprise plan to recover the area, which is really equivalent to * inserting a fatal wedge into the axis of the * Japanese, cutting off the blood vessels and severing the limbs. Although the * Japanese are in an unfavorable position, it can be said without saying that the * Japanese's future crisis is serious in our army's continued fierce attack."

The * Japanese Army Redeploys Troops Again to Southern Guangdong - Xinhui and Conghua Become a Seesaw Battle

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] The * Japanese in southern Guangdong have redeployed a brigade from Shanghai and launched a fierce counterattack against us. We are still near Xinhui, Jiangmen, Zengcheng, and Conghua.

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guilin, 25th] The * Japanese are resisting stubbornly in various parts of southern Guangdong. We are still adopting攻劳. Xinhui, Jiangmen, Zengcheng and other places have become seesaw-shaped.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 26th Dispatch] On the 24th, more than 200 * Japanese landed in Danshuikou, Kaiping, and were met by our army. They collapsed and fled back to their ships. The * Japanese found in Xiaoguanshan, southeast of Heshan, were also repelled by us.

[Central News Agency, Yingde, 26th Dispatch] On the 16th, a certain unit of our army attacked the more than 30 * Japanese officers and soldiers guarding the bridge at Kengbeiqiao (north of Zengcheng), and all were wiped out. Kengbeiqiao was also blown up in two sections. On the 17th, * Japanese reinforcements rushed to the scene, but we had already withdrawn and vented their anger on the local residents, killing more than 30 people to vent their anger.

The * Japanese in Sui'anbei are Surrounded - The Puppet Army in Eastern Henan is Eliminated by Us

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] The * Japanese in Sui'anbei have been surrounded by us. More than 1,000 * Japanese in eastern Henan are engaged in fierce fighting with us in the Shilou East area northeast of Changying. The entire 400-man puppet army of Guo Dejun has been eliminated by us. There are currently more than 1,000 * Japanese in Tongxu. A part of them has also窜 to the north of Changying and is engaged in fierce fighting with us. The * Japanese in Kaifeng attacked Zhongmu again yesterday and were defeated by us again.

[Central News Agency, Shanzhou, 28th Dispatch] More than 300 * Japanese and two cannons in Wangzhen, southwest of Wen County, were pursued by a certain unit of our army on the morning of the 22nd. The * Japanese resisted stubbornly. After four hours of fierce fighting, the * Japanese could not hold on and collapsed towards Wen County. In this battle, more than 100 * Japanese were killed.

[Central News Agency, *yang, 26th Dispatch] Yesterday, our army in central Hubei attacked Pingjingguan, Haojiadian, Yingshan, Mapo, Zhehe, and other places, and made considerable progress. At the moment, our army is still attacking fiercely in separate directions, expanding the results of the battle. Our guerrillas on the Hanyi and Yuxiang roads launched surprise attacks, and the * Japanese were very panic-stricken. The * Japanese on the opposite bank of Panju and Shayang shelled us yesterday and the day before yesterday, and our army immediately returned fire.

### Our Troops Triply Assault Kaifeng, Annihilating Two Thousand Enemy Soldiers, Sweeping Freely as if Entering an Unoccupied Land, Heroic and Fearless, Astonishing Heaven and Earth

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 25th] Our troops' recent attack on Kaifeng, twice penetrating the city within a day and once entering the West Gate, demonstrates our army's exceptionally brave spirit, worthy of high praise. A summary of the three assaults on Kaifeng is as follows: The first assault began at 12:00 AM on the 10th. Our troops, numbering no more than two battalions, launched an attack from the southwest. They first occupied the outer city and then approached Cai Village and the railway station. Although the enemy resisted desperately, they could not withstand our army's sharp momentum. Fighting until dawn, our troops finally occupied the station and Cai Village. A detachment broke into the South Gate of the city, engaging in fierce street-to-street combat. They killed numerous enemy soldiers and destroyed the enemy's ammunition depot, burned warehouses, and destroyed the water tower. Instantly, fire blazed, floods spread everywhere, and explosions resounded through the clouds. This was a major victory for our army. The second assault occurred only one day later. Despite the enemy's increased vigilance, our troops re-entered Kaifeng on the morning of the 12th. This attack also involved only one battalion, each soldier charging with a spirit of hand-to-hand combat. Our troops swept through the city for five hours, destroying many important enemy pseudo-organs and killing countless enemies. When a large enemy force came to reinforce, our troops had already returned to their defensive positions. After our two attacks, the enemy transferred more than 6,000 reinforcements from Xuzhou within a few days, bringing the total number of troops to nearly 10,000. On the evening of the 20th, when our troops launched the third assault, they numbered no more than one battalion but were still able to break through the enemy's heavily fortified defenses, killing countless enemy soldiers and reoccupying the station. They also attacked and set fire to the enemy's pseudo-organs and food depot in the West Gate. Their heroic and fearless spirit is truly worthy of national praise. In these three attacks, approximately 2,000 enemy soldiers were annihilated, causing great panic among the enemy's pseudo-regime. Within a few days, they moved important documents and items eastward, and the pseudo-organization moved to Luowangzhai.

### Along the Coasts of Fujian and Guangdong, Foreign Vessels Continue to be Detained; Two Norwegian Vessels are Again Seized; British Vessel "West Cairns" Still Not Released

[External News from Hong Kong] The Norwegian ships "Borrosholm" and "Borre" have recently been seized by the enemy navy. Investigations show that the two ships were en route from Shanghai to Fuzhou. When approaching Fuzhou, they were intercepted by enemy ships, and enemy soldiers carrying weapons boarded the ships and hijacked them. Their whereabouts are still unknown. The Norwegian consul in Hong Kong has telegraphed the Foreign Ministry in his country, requesting that the Norwegian minister in Japan directly negotiate with Japan. Yesterday's reports that the Norwegian ship "Halligen" was seized by enemy troops were inaccurate. Also, news of the missing Taikoo ship "Kweiyang" arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, reporting its whereabouts. The Japanese side refuses to announce the reasons for detaining the two Norwegian ships. The grain on board the ships has been transported by Japanese troops in northern Fuzhou in small boats. As for the dates the two ships were detained, "Borrosholm" was detained on the 19th of this month, and "Borre" was detained within the past day or two.

[Hong Kong News] The British ship "West Cairns," chartered by Jardine Matheson & Co., was intercepted by a Japanese warship two weeks ago in waters between Xiamen and Shantou and escorted to the Penghu Islands. Although the British naval authorities have negotiated, it has not yet been released. The ship's captain and crew returned to Hong Kong on the 25th aboard the Japanese ship "Canton Maru." Regarding the detention of the "West Cairns," the captain and crew have been ordered not to comment. However, Williamson, the manager of Jardine Matheson & Co., issued the following written statement regarding the detention of the ship: "The captain and crew of the 'West Cairns' returned to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 25th aboard the Japanese ship 'Canton Maru.' Before leaving the Penghu Islands, the captain was notified by the Japanese military that the 'West Cairns' would be temporarily detained for inspection. However, the 80 tons of food on board were confiscated. All crew members were interrogated multiple times during their 14 days of surveillance in the Penghu Islands. The questions concerned the ship's nationality, cargo, and destination. The ship was flying the British flag and engaged in legitimate business, and there is no doubt about this. After news of the 'West Cairns' detention reached [Hong Kong], the British naval authorities immediately dispatched the British warship "Tenedos" to investigate. They found that the ship was under surveillance by the Japanese navy. Although the captain of the "Tenedos" negotiated with the captain of the Japanese destroyer monitoring the 'West Cairns,' requesting permission to send troops on board, he was refused. After the 'West Cairns' was seized, negotiations were held with the Japanese naval authorities, and a report was submitted to the British Foreign Office, which in turn protested to the Japanese government. The results have not yet been announced. However, because the Japanese warship detained the 'West Cairns,' an illegal act, further measures will be taken to restore the ship's freedom."

### Two American Warships Arrive in Shanghai from Hankou, Carrying Personnel from the Soviet Consulate and More Than 30 Foreign Nationals Simultaneously Evacuate

[Reuters, Shanghai, 26th] The American gunboat "Oahu" and the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet Commander, "Augusta," returned here this afternoon from Hankou. On board were 43 foreign passengers, including 13 personnel from the Soviet Consulate. They had wanted to leave after Hankou fell last October, but had no way to do so. In these months, they and other passengers, men and women in equal numbers, were mostly Americans.

### Propaganda Outline for Guerrilla Areas (II) Produced and Distributed by the Political Department of the Military Commission

Key Points of Battlefield Propaganda

(A) Common Propaganda Points. Although the content and methods of official propaganda cannot but vary depending on the target audience, there are also commonalities. To avoid repetition, the common points for two or more target audiences are listed below (mainly for troops and the public):

(1) Based on the historical facts of the Japanese invasion of China over the past sixty years, it should be made clear that Japanese imperialism is the only enemy of the Chinese nation. Make the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that we and the enemy cannot coexist. Only by driving the Japanese out of China can we live in peace.

(2) Promote the teachings of the Founding Father, elaborate on the Three Principles of the People, and make the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that implementing the Three Principles of the People is the most correct way to complete the War of Resistance and build the nation.

(3) The Third National Political Council unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to issue a nationwide order to the military and civilians, as well as the great righteousness declared by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in his December 26th speech last year (i.e., the speech refuting the near-mad statement). Strengthen their confidence, unify their steps, and be of one heart and one mind from beginning to end, to restore our sovereignty and administrative integrity, and to complete the task of resisting Japan. The military and civilians behind enemy lines must have a deep understanding of this.

(4) At the same time, it is necessary to provide theoretical and factual proof of the key points indicated in the above-mentioned instruction of the Supreme Leader, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the policies pursued by the Japanese are fundamentally incompatible with the survival and independence of our nation and the East Asian order and world peace. Deeply understand our national policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, and understand the various deceptive propaganda used by the enemy.

(5) Based on the Supreme Leader's past instructions on the War of Resistance, the Central Party Headquarters' appropriate proposals and resolutions for resisting Japan and building the nation, and the ministers' past speeches and instructions on the War of Resistance, clarify that our country's War of Resistance is not only to fight for national survival and national independence, but also to protect peace in East Asia and the world. (This point should also be promoted to enemy officers and soldiers.)

(6) Promote the central government's important measures for national politics, economy, culture, etc. based on the national policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, as well as the government's concern and expectations for the military and civilians behind enemy lines. Make the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand the progress in all aspects of our country and the attention of the central government to them.

(7) Publicize the facts and news of the unity of the country from top to bottom, the victories of our army on various battlefields, the heroic battles of the front-line generals, the large number of young men requesting to enlist in various places (such as Yong'an County and Dading County), the enthusiastic donations from the people of various places and overseas Chinese, and the active participation in the War of Resistance, in order to expose the enemy's rumors, encourage the enthusiasm of the military and civilians behind enemy lines for the War of Resistance, and strengthen their confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance.

(8) Publicize the enemy's situation, especially regarding the enemy's domestic political unrest, industrial decline, financial exhaustion, difficult living conditions, and rising anti-war sentiment, the enemy soldiers' fear of war, suicide, and anti-war mutinies (such as the enemy military incidents in Dagu, Jiangyin, and Guangzhou, such as the explosion of the Osaka gunpowder factory, and the constant defections of puppet troops), so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the enemy's defeat is inevitable.

(9) Publicize the international situation, trends, and news that are beneficial to us and unfavorable to the enemy (such as the recent growing closeness between the major democratic countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, the denial by Britain, the United States, and France in the same note of the enemy's so-called "New Order in East Asia," the affirmation that the Nine-Power Treaty is valid, the British and American credit loans to our country, the League of Nations' renewed request for a resolution supporting China against Japan, and the practical boycotts of Japanese goods and aid to China by the people of various countries, and the passage of aid to China by the International Anti-Aggression Movement Congress), all of which are to make the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the enemy is declining day by day, our country's international status is rising day by day, and deeply understand that the more we persist in the War of Resistance, the more we can lead the international situation towards anti-aggression.

(10) Publicize the fact that the enemy can only control points and lines in the places "occupied" by the enemy, and that the rest of the vast territory is still under our control, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines believe that if we work hard and fight, the enemy's power will shrink.

(11) Publicize the enemy's abuse of poison gas on the front lines, slaughtering our brave soldiers, slaughtering our people in the war zone, burning our residents, raping and looting, stopping at nothing, and bombing our undefended cities in the rear, deliberately destroying our charitable cultural institutions, in order to arouse the hatred of the military and civilians behind enemy lines.

(12) In the war zone, it is especially necessary to expose the enemy's various conspiracies and deceptive propaganda, expose the enemy's petty favors, and explain that these petty favors are only temporary deception, and warn the military and civilians behind enemy lines not to drink poison to quench their thirst and bring disaster on themselves.

(13) Expose the machines of the puppet organizations of traitors, the evil deeds of big and small traitors who betray the country and harm the people, and their arbitrary actions in the countryside, as well as their shameless acts of selling out the motherland and oppressing the people, in order to stir up the military and civilians behind enemy lines to hate the traitors.

(14) Publicize the facts of victories achieved through military-civilian cooperation in various places (such as the residents of Nanqiao Village in Feng County, Shanxi, cooperated with the army and completely eliminated more than 200 enemy soldiers), so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines deeply understand that "military-civilian cooperation is the only key to our victory over the enemy."

(15) Widely publicize and explain in detail the General Mobilization Outline for National Spiritual Mobilization and its implementation methods, the National Covenant and its oath, convene National Monthly Meetings for the military and civilians behind enemy lines on a regular basis, swear to abide by the National Covenant, and effectively implement spiritual mobilization, in order to establish an indomitable and unshakable national spirit, and to complete the main conditions for winning the War of Resistance.

### Tagore Denounces the Japanese Militarists; Feels Ashamed and Pity for the Deceived and Foolish People

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] TASS, New York Electric. The American magazine "Life" recently published a letter from the Indian humanitarian writer Tagore to the Japanese poet Noguchi. Noguchi's original letter requested Tagore to prove that Japan's attack on the Chinese people was justified. Tagore's reply sternly rebuked, saying: "When I reply to your letter, I feel more ashamed and pitiful for your deceived people than I feel angry." He also said, "You bombed universities with bombs, destroyed art and culture, and turned universities into ashes. This is to make the Chinese people live like animals."

### Enemy's Military and Material Replenishment Gradually Becomes Difficult; Anti-War Sentiment is Strong in the Military; More Than Ten Thousand Enemy Corpses Burned in Jiujiang for Days

[Central News Agency, Dali, 26th] According to prisoners of war recently brought from the Shanxi battlefield, the soldiers replenished by Japan this year are all reservists, with very little training, and mostly from the industrial and commercial sectors. Their original income was more than ten times higher than after enlisting, and they cannot endure the hardships. Therefore, the sentiment of war-weariness and anti-war is extremely strong in the military. At present, the replenishment of domestic military and material resources has caused panic. Women are mostly used as bus drivers. Steel mailboxes in Kobe post offices have all been replaced with magnetic ones. All metal items owned by civilians are forcibly requisitioned by the government, etc. Furthermore, the prisoners' attitude towards us recently is not as stubborn as in the past, which shows that the enemy's tyranny is collapsing.

[Central News Agency, Guancheng, 26th] Hundreds of trucks carrying enemy corpses were transported from Nanxun Road to Jiujiang for cremation. Each truck contained more than one hundred enemy corpses. It is said that this batch of enemy corpses were part of the enemy army recently killed by us in Gao'an.

### Military Commission Announces Weekly Battle Situation April 20th to 26th

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A spokesman for the Military Commission said that the results achieved by our army in various battlefields in the north and south this week (April 20th to 26th) are briefly described below:

Guangdong Front

The enemy in Zengcheng once sneaked into Futian and Jiaodong. After our army's fierce attack, they retreated back to Conghua. Since Xinjie was recaptured, the remaining enemies have been eliminated. The enemies in Xijiang are deadlocked with us near Guanyao and Sanshui. After repeated attacks, the enemy suffered heavy losses. Xinhua has been captured again this week. The enemy has continuously reinforced and counterattacked for days, but has been repelled. Jiangmen is being besieged more intensively. Therefore, the outer defense of the enemy in Guangzhou has been broken through by us. The order in the city is extremely chaotic. Enemy officers and soldiers and their families are retreating one after another. Large and small traitors are fleeing in a panic. Our army's vanguard is now approaching the urban area and once rushed in. The remaining enemies are like turtles in a jar and are extremely panicked.

Hunan and Jiangxi Front

The enemy in northern Jiangxi has become exhausted after invading Nanchang. This week, our army attacked Gaoke, Gao'an, and Gaoyou City, advancing to the vicinity of Wanshou Palace, occupying Songcheng, and besieging Fengxin, making it impossible for the enemy on the south bank of the Xiu River to gain a foothold, and they are now shaken. The enemy in Wuning has been trapped in the city walls and unable to move after our army captured Mao Gou Mountain and Chaping Ao in succession. Near the Fu River, our army entered Shihankou and Xiliang Mountain, and recaptured Xiangtang, making it even more difficult for the enemy to cope. As for the enemy's attempt to invade Changsha in northern Hunan, although it was very active, it was severely attacked by our attacking troops. Yuezhou is still under our siege. Another unit of our army suddenly attacked the other day and captured Nanjin Bridge, an important stronghold behind enemy lines in southern Hubei. Therefore, the enemy's rear transportation has been blocked.

Shanxi Front

The enemies in Taigu and Pingyao launched a large-scale invasion of eastern Jin last week. After days of fierce fighting, more than 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed. The remaining enemies fled in defeat from Gucheng to Nangang Town, and yesterday retreated to Zihong Town. Their attempt to invade the east was completely shattered. The enemies in southern Jin have been in a passive state since their failure to attack Zhongtiao Mountain. Our army attacked in multiple routes, attacking Yuandi County and Zhangdian, and attacking the city of Jiexian several times. In the battle of Nan Zhang Town near Wenxi, more than 1,500 enemy soldiers were killed. At the same time, ambushes were set up everywhere, making the enemy army encounter obstacles at every step. In particular, the ambush near the Fen River against the fleeing enemy army in Nan Chuan, in addition to those who fell into the Fen River, the corpses left on both banks alone reached more than 300. This made the enemy soldiers lose their courage and flee in disarray. As for our army in northern Jin, after recapturing Wuzhai, it advanced towards Jingle. At the moment, the county seat has been surrounded by us, and the remaining enemies can be wiped out.

Henan Front

The enemy in Kaifeng has been extremely panicked since our army rushed into the city walls twice last week. They have been actively reinforcing for days. This week, our army once again stormed the area around the West Gate railway station, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. Out of frustration, they repeatedly attacked Changying and Zhongmu, but were crushed in the counterattack. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, gaining considerable new results, and divided its troops to attack Huaiyang, once rushing into this pass, capturing many prisoners. The enemy in Xinyang repeatedly tried to stir up trouble, but scattered and fled after our army launched a fierce attack. At present, the county seat is still tightly surrounded by us, and the enemy soldiers in the city cannot move and are eager to escape. As for our army in northern Henan, it has been carrying out mobile tactics in recent days, attacking Jia County, spying on Qin County, and sweeping Baixiang Town, making the enemy restless.

In addition

The enemy armies in western Sui have been repeatedly defeated. The control of the Ping-Sui Railway, the recapture of Zhaoyuan in Shandong, the siege of Zhucheng, the once-attacked Nanrong in Hebei, and the pursuit in Tong County have all been sufficient to make the enemy panic. As for the activities of our army in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they have caused the enemy great pain. The Dingbei conquered Haimen, besieged Rugao, attacked [Qingpu] in southern Jiangsu, spied on Tianwang Temple, besieged Wukang in Zhejiang, forced Wu Xing, recaptured Wu Zhen, and attacked Xiashi. The number of casualties suffered by the enemy in the Jinghu area cannot be counted in numbers.

### Our Army Employs Mobile Tactics, Winning Successive Battles in Jin; Enemy's New Offensive in the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway Ends in Miserable Defeat; With a Long Front Line, the Enemy Appears Exhausted

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 26th Special Dispatch] Our great victory in southern Jin: On the night of the 24th, near Yuguo Town in Xia County, we completely annihilated two enemy regiments. Clearing the battlefield, a total of more than 1,500 enemy soldiers were killed, nearly 100 were captured alive, and a large amount of weapons, military supplies, and documents were seized. Wenxi, Xia County, and Anyi are all under our control.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 25th] Our army in southern and central Jin is powerful, which the enemy considers a major threat. A few days ago, they transferred the entire Hirayama Division south to occupy Linfen, Xia County, Anyi, and the Zhongtiao Mountains, in an attempt to coordinate with the Yajima Divisions to encircle and annihilate our main force one by one. We knew the enemy's tricks. Taking advantage of the enemy's mobilization, we severely damaged the railway north and south of Linfen. The section between Hongdong and Huo County was almost completely dismantled. Enemy transportation was suddenly cut off, making reinforcement difficult. Our army took the opportunity to attack the railway line from both the east and west sides. In recent days, battles have been fierce on both sides of the Fen River. The enemy tried to cross the river to the west, but was unsuccessful. On the 21st, most of the enemy army used heavy artillery cover and attempted to cross the river twice, but were bravely repelled by us, suffering four to five hundred casualties. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy did not dare to continue crossing the river and instead deployed defenses on the east bank. Under the enemy's close surveillance, our army has crossed the Fen River several times, approaching the railway and attacking the enemy. There have been repeated fierce battles along the line north of Linfen and south of Lingshi. Our army has been using mobile tactics to our advantage. In the direction of Heilongguan, the enemy has reinforced several times, attempting to invade west and contain our eastward advance. They were ambushed by us in the north and south valleys, and after a night of mixed warfare, the enemy army was defeated. At present, the enemy armies in Heilongguan and Tumen are tightly surrounded by us, and the road from Linfen to Heilongguan has been thoroughly destroyed, cutting off enemy communication. The battles have also been quite fierce in the Fushan area on the east side of the railway in recent days. Fushan was once captured by a unit of our army, but was later withdrawn for strategic reasons. The enemy reinforced four or five times before and after, attempting to encircle and annihilate us, but ultimately failed. The combat spirit of the enemy army in Fushan has been greatly reduced. Various strongholds in Hanjia Yi in the northwest of the city, Gecun in the north of the city, and the vicinity of the city are all in our hands. Therefore, the enemies in Fushan are very panicked. The enemy armies in northwestern Shanxi and southeastern Jin have also been actively operating in recent days to support the battle in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway. The enemy army in the direction of Pinglu took advantage of [the situation] to invade Pian Guan and attempted to invade Hequ. After our army bravely resisted the east, they are still holding each other near the pass. The enemy armies in Lishi and Zhongyang have not dared to move in recent days because they have been monitored by us, and have only patrolled near the suburbs with small units. The battles have been quite fierce in the Xizhai area in recent days. There have been repeated battles for Wangyu Beigang and Luohan, with our army gaining an advantage. On the southern Jin front, our army has been reporting successive victories. The enemy advancing along the Bai Jin Highway has been largely repelled by us. Shuling Pass, Wanghe Town, Pen Shi Town, and Gucheng Town (northwest of Wuxiang) have been captured one after another. At present, our various routes are still continuing to advance north. In short, the enemy has absolutely no ability to eliminate our army. The longer the front line, the weaker the enemy's strength. Therefore, the enemy is showing signs of exhaustion in the military.

Tongpu Railway Tracks Blown Up, Fierce Fighting in Huo County

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 24th] Our army previously destroyed the Tongpu railway tracks with hand grenades in Shaliwo Li, Yangjiazhuang, Houjiazhuang, Longhu Mountain, Jitou, Nanguan Town, etc. in Huo County, and used the sound of bombs to lure the enemy into an ambush. The two sides fought fiercely and achieved great results. On the 15th, the enemy stationed at Shizipo Di discovered the same method. The two sides immediately engaged in a fierce battle. However, the highway and railway in advance were destroyed by more than ten li, making it difficult for the enemy to move heavy weapons. A large number of them were annihilated by us. Our enemy force was particularly able to surprise and win, and captured especially many enemies. On the morning of the 17th, we fought fiercely for five hours with more than 500 enemy soldiers and four artillery pieces who attacked from Nanguan Lijia Mountain in the above-mentioned areas. Our soldiers fought valiantly and finally repelled the stubborn enemies. A total of more than 200 enemy soldiers were killed in various battles, and more than 80 of our officers and soldiers were also killed or wounded.

Our Army Breaks Through in Blood East and West of the Baijin Highway

Also, in the two areas east and west of the Baijin Highway, our army recently fought fiercely for seven days and nights with approximately 7,000 enemy soldiers from Taiyuan and Qixian, with more than 30 artillery pieces, starting at dawn on the 11th. The enemy division commander personally commanded the encirclement of a certain town near Mayukou. Our army responded, fighting without regard for their own safety, and was finally able to kill more than 1,000 enemy soldiers and more than 100 horses, and capture dozens of rifles, two machine guns, and countless military supplies. However, because the enemy was numerous and we were few, and the situation was disparate, in order to avoid being entangled and to contain most of the enemy army in the mountainous area, we transferred to the area east of the Baijin Highway on the evening of the 12th, leaving a part on the west side of the highway to attack the enemy from the side. On the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th, we again engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in Xizhuang, Donggou, and Dongxi Qingxiu. The casualties on both sides were extremely tragic. The battle of Xizhuang Donggou was particularly fierce. Our enemy brigade commander personally supervised the battle, fighting bravely for two days and nights, and repelling several attacks before successfully breaking out of the encirclement. However, both the enemy brigade commander and the enemy regimental commander were seriously injured in this battle. After suffering this blow, the enemy's momentum has gradually weakened in recent days. At the moment, the enemy has fled back to various strongholds along the Tongpu Railway to await reinforcements.

### Chamberlain Announces British Conscription: Mobilizing the Entire Nation to Confront Continental Pressure

[Urgent Dispatch from Reuter's, London, 26th] Chamberlain formally announced this afternoon in the House of Commons that Britain would adopt conscription.

[Reuter's, London, 26th] The British Cabinet held a meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning and passed a declaration to adopt conscription. Chamberlain and Halifax delivered speeches in the upper and lower houses respectively this afternoon. It is generally believed that this statement is entirely directed at Hitler's parliamentary address, urging more than ten small countries to quickly decide whether to join the Anglo-French front or align themselves with Germany and Italy, and at the same time correctly addressing the Soviet Union's doubts about Britain's determination to resist aggression.

[Reuter's, London, 26th] Reuter's parliamentary correspondent reported that Chamberlain would announce this afternoon that the government has decided to conscript those aged 20 to 21. This step is necessary to bring the country's defense into a state of full preparedness. The current defense is borne by volunteer troops, but in view of the delays that will occur when mobilizing volunteer troops, it is proposed that conscription is necessary. On this issue, a debate will be held in the House of Commons tomorrow. Chamberlain informed the leaders of the three parties today that the government is adopting conscription due to pressure from continental nations. These countries have defense agreements with Britain. The Prime Minister also said that the government will first call up young people aged 20 to 21 to serve in the regular army for six months, then transfer to the army reserve or local forces. Approximately 200,000 people will undergo the same training, regardless of rank.

[Reuter's, London, 26th] Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce in the House of Commons at 2:45 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) today that the government has decided to take conscription measures. The Cabinet held a meeting this morning that lasted for an hour and a half. After the cabinet meeting, members of the Trade Union Federation were invited by Chamberlain to 10 Downing Street to hear the government's decision on compulsory service. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Minister of Labour Ernest Brown were present at the meeting between Chamberlain and labour leaders. It is also learned that the government has decided that if the King and Queen should not take the battleship "[unclear]" to the United States, they will lease a mail ship for use. The most likely choice is the "Queen of Australia" of the Chang Yu Company.

[Reuter's, London, 26th] It is rumored that the British government has now decided to implement conscription. Today, all the local morning newspapers published this news in a prominent position on the front page. However, the news was released too late, and the editorials discussing the budget could not be changed. Regarding last night's cabinet meeting and Prime Minister Chamberlain's audience with the King, the political correspondents of the newspapers speculated with considerable consensus on what the government's plans would be. As for the age limit for conscription, the information obtained by the newspapers was not entirely the same. The "Daily Herald" and "Daily Telegraph" said from 18 to 20 years old. The "Daily Mirror" and "Daily Express" said from 18 to 21 years old. The "Daily Mail" said from 18 to 25 years old. Regarding other aspects, the newspapers all had the same information. The conscripted youth first enter the regular army, and after three or four months, they transfer to the local army for a period of about four years. According to the calculations of the "Daily Telegraph," there will be 450,000 people conscripted. The "Daily Express" mentioned statistics from 1931, when there were more than one million people in Britain aged 18 to 20. According to some reports, the necessary legislation will not go directly to the House of Commons, but will first be debated so that the opposition can be "appeased." The "Daily Herald" correspondent stated that the opposition is tense about Chamberlain's sudden abandonment of his repeated statements that he would never consider conscription in peacetime. In addition to the serious international situation, the government's decision was also influenced by foreign notifications, especially from France and army experts. The cabinet will hold a meeting tomorrow, and it is expected that the conscription issue can be completed. Chamberlain will meet with Labour Party leaders Clement Attlee and Greenwood after the cabinet meeting. Today's "Daily Mail" editorial gave a concise commentary on conscription, stating, "The government has decided on a step that the whole country will support. Compulsory service has long been expected to be necessary and will be accepted by patriots. The implementation of conscription is a warning from Britain to the world that Britain is determined to safeguard its imperial interests and support its promises." The "Daily Express" said, "Hitler is the real person who urged Britain to take these two steps (conscription and a large budget). When he responded to President Roosevelt's telegram on Friday, he should know where we stand. Conscription has been adopted, and there is no mistake, because this is the will of the people."

[Reuter's, London, 25th] The British conscription method has already been deemed inevitable. According to Reuter's, the cabinet has agreed in principle to this measure. The cabinet held a meeting today for two hours and considered submitting a special proposal to Parliament. The decision on this move will be announced to Parliament at the earliest possible time, and a bill will be quickly submitted to Parliament to grant the power to implement compulsory service. The cabinet meeting will hold its weekly meeting tomorrow. It is rumored that the first step in the government's conscription plan is to call up young people aged 18 to 20.

[Reuter's, London, 26th] The British Trades Union Congress held a meeting yesterday and reiterated its opposition to the government's implementation of conscription.

[Reuter's, Paris, 26th] French newspapers today gave high praise to Britain's decision to adopt conscription, declaring that Britain has made a great contribution to preventing the trend from moving toward war. "Le Parisien Libéré" stated that Australia and South Africa have followed Britain in taking this decision. They all sent troops to the French front during the European War. "Le Petit Parisien" stated that Poland and Greece view the decision of the United States as a reasonable measure to promise them aid, and the Soviet Union and Turkey will quickly conduct negotiations to establish their Eastern European defense line. "Le Journal" stated, "If Britain sends heavy troops to the mainland to help in the war from the beginning, just like the last Great War, the plans of Germany and Italy can be crushed, and the international situation has clearly created an absolute advantage for the Western powers and small allies."

[Reuter's, Berlin, 25th] German newspapers ridiculed the idea that Britain's implementation of conscription would make Germany feel something. The Nazi Party's official newspaper, Angriff, stated, "Germans are absolutely not concerned about how Britain organizes its national defense forces." The Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger declared, "If Britain wants to use warnings or intimidation to try to make Germany change its mind, it is a delusional thought."

[Reuter's, Rome, 26th] Local newspapers here have published reports of the British government's decision to adopt conscription, but have not criticized it, considering it an ineffective intimidation of Germany. They also expressed doubts about whether soldiers who can use new weapons can be trained in a few months, believing that Britain is still not a military power.

### Roosevelt Approves US Naval and Air Force Base Bill

[Reuter's, Washington, 26th] President Roosevelt yesterday signed a $66,800,000 naval and air force base bill, which has been passed by Congress.

### US Warship Leaves Yokohama

[Reuter's, Yokohama, 26th] The US warship "Astoria," which previously transported the ashes of the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Hirota, back to Japan, left here this morning at 10:00 AM for Shanghai and then Manila. Thousands of people saw it off, including representatives from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy.

### Hitler Receives Yugoslavian Foreign Minister

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 26th] The German leader met with the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister this morning and held a long conversation. The German Foreign Minister and the Yugoslavian Ambassador were present at the time. The Yugoslavian Foreign Minister laid a wreath at the Washington Military Monument and attended a luncheon hosted by the German Foreign Minister in Dahlem, near Berlin.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th] The Yugoslavian Foreign Minister arrived here by plane at 5:30 PM on the 25th, and held the first talks with the German Foreign Minister at 6:30 PM. A public statement was issued after the meeting stating that the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister at 6:30 this evening and had a long conversation on all relevant issues between Germany and Yugoslavia. The spirit was extremely harmonious, and as a result, the views on issues related to the two countries became more consistent. According to authoritative sources, the initial meeting focused on the issue of Yugoslav-Hungarian reconciliation and served as a prelude to Germany's cooperation with countries under the Anti-Comintern Pact. Therefore, it is generally speculated that the Yugoslav-Hungarian friendship agreement will be realized soon.

### Roosevelt Proposes Establishing Three New Organizations to Strengthen Democratic Nations, Guarantee the Existence of Free Governments, and Draft New Neutrality Act

[Reuter's, Washington, 25th] President Roosevelt today submitted a bill to Congress to establish three new organizations to manage 16 government agencies respectively, responsible for handling government lending matters, relief work, and social welfare undertakings. These three new organizations are the Federal Loan Agency, the Federal Works Agency, and the Federal Security Agency. Under the provisions of the new government reorganization law, if the proposal is not opposed by both houses, it can take effect after 60 days. Roosevelt said when submitting this case, "My sole purpose is to strengthen democratic nations for peace or war, and to guarantee the resolute existence of free governments. There have been repeated attempts to bankrupt democratic governments, and some people believe that democratic nations are inevitably weak, so it is easy to destroy them. This is a bold statement. This reorganization is a response to this attempt."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to stop hearing opinions from all parties on the Neutrality Act on the 6th of next month and begin drafting legislation. According to Pittman, "I understand that all parties intend to find a way to extend the 'cash and carry' method for two months before the Neutrality Act is fully reviewed."

### Belgian Prime Minister Speaks on Maintaining National Independence

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 26th] The new Prime Minister Pierlot recently stated that the government is determined to defend the independence of the country. The international situation is fraught with crises, and the government has taken various measures to strengthen the defense of the country and its colonies.

### Germany-Italy-Japan Axis: Sleeping in the Same Bed, Dreaming Different Dreams; Italian Foreign Minister Cancels Visit to Berlin; Japan Fears Joining Military Alliance

[Reuter's, London, 26th] The "Daily Mail" diplomatic correspondent listed today that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's originally scheduled visit to Germany, which was recently invisibly cancelled, is sufficient to prove that the negotiations between the Axis countries to revise the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance have broken down. The correspondent stated that he obtained information from authoritative sources in Rome that Ciano had cancelled his trip to Berlin to listen to Hitler's parliamentary address. According to reports, Japan is most hesitant, because naval personnel attach great importance to the US President's order to assemble the US fleet in the Pacific, and dare not hastily join the alliance. However, the German diplomatic side is still stepping up efforts to urge the Japanese government to change its attitude. At the same time, the "Times" Tokyo correspondent stated that although there has been no drastic change in Japanese policy recently, Hitler's speech on Friday still failed to announce that Japan is willing to fight for the Axis countries in the Pacific.

### Germany Deliberately Ignores British Ambassador; Hitler and Others Delay Meeting; Forcing Britain to Abandon Appeasement Policy

[Reuter's, Berlin, 25th] According to reliable sources tonight, Ribbentrop will meet with the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, tomorrow or on Thursday.

[Reuter's, Berlin, 25th] The British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, was originally scheduled to meet with the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today, but it did not materialize. It is said that the reason is that Ribbentrop had other appointments first, so he could not meet. When they will meet in the future has not yet been agreed upon. Therefore, if, as rumored outside, Henderson has a message from the British government to the German government, then no one knows when it will be submitted. However, German officials strongly disbelieve that the British Ambassador carries any message from the British government. Their view is based on the statement by British Prime Minister Chamberlain that Henderson's return to Berlin is a pretended visit to fill the vacancy. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt commented, "Judging from the remarks of the British newspapers, the British government's eagerness to repair old friendships with Germany is even more urgent than Berlin." Ribbentrop ordered the airport to welcome the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Maček, who will stay in Berlin until after Hitler's speech on Friday.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 25th] Nazi sources announced today that Hitler will disregard Britain's attempts to ease his Friday speech and is deliberately neglecting the British Ambassador in many ways. Sources are skeptical whether the German Foreign Minister is willing to meet with the British Ambassador before Friday. It is said that Ribbentrop is currently busy talking with the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, attempting to obtain political and economic cooperation between the two countries. Political figures here believe that Hitler may show a cold attitude when meeting with the British Ambassador, and his hope to moderate the speech is slim.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 25th] It is believed here that Hitler and Ribbentrop's refusal to meet with the British Ambassador is a deliberate humiliation. The British Ambassador has repeatedly requested to visit the German Foreign Minister, but has not received a reply, and the German side has not notified a postponement, which is deeply strange.

[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] People here believe that Hitler's refusal to meet with the British Ambassador and his disregard for Chamberlain's suggestions have led Britain's soft policy towards Germany to an end. Diplomatic figures stated that even if Chamberlain still wants to continue to promote his appeasement policy, the British people will inevitably be intolerable and will not agree. Then, Chamberlain will also be forced to be tougher on Germany, otherwise, he will only have to avoid the virtuous path in response to public demands. People here also pointed out that Germany's cold treatment of the British Ambassador proves that Hitler has always believed that Britain has not prepared for war for many years. The German side believes that even if Britain adopts conscription, Germany can still crush the anti-aggression front and plunder various small countries before Britain is ready, without causing war.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Departs for Turkey

[Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 26th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin arrived here yesterday morning from the border station Techina. The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a representative to welcome him, along with officials from the Soviet Embassy and a team of detectives. Shortly afterwards, Potemkin took a private car through Romania to Bulgaria and then to Turkey. It is rumored that he met with a senior Turkish official in Bulgaria. Also, when Potemkin passed through Romania, he held talks with the country's political leaders.

### British-Romanian Talks Continue: Wide Range of Discussion; Gafencu Does Not Yield to Germany

[Reuter's, London, 25th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and British Foreign Secretary Halifax continued their consultations in the Foreign Office today. The issues and scope of this discussion have not yet been disclosed by officials, but it is expected that a communiqué will be issued tomorrow outlining the discussion. According to Reuter's diplomatic correspondent, there is reason to believe that this discussion has given Romania convenience in terms of export credit plans to increase its exports of raw materials to Britain. The issue of Britain supplying Romania with arms was also discussed. As for the overall situation in Europe, the status of the Balkan Peninsula, and the situation arising from Britain's provision of guarantees to Romania, they were also discussed in detail. It is rumored that Romania does not necessarily have to make this guarantee reciprocal at this time. The ongoing British-Soviet negotiations and Romania's attitude towards accepting Soviet military assistance were also discussed. It is believed that Gafencu also reported to the British Foreign Secretary on the conversations he had with Hitler and Ribbentrop.

[Reuter's, London, 26th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu told Parliament member and "News Chronicle" diplomatic correspondent Bertie today, "I am determined to believe that we cannot obtain a common view to discuss the possibility of peace." Bertie said that among the foreign ministers who have visited Berlin in recent months, the Romanian Foreign Minister is the first person who has not been forced to sign a treaty that harms national independence. Bertie concluded, "We hope that the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister in Berlin can warmly remember this past fact."

### British Warships Begin Patrol of the Eastern Mediterranean Yesterday; Gibraltar Implements Alert; Indian Troops Will be Deployed to Egypt

[Haitong News Agency, Malta, 26th] The British Mediterranean Fleet sailed to the eastern Mediterranean on Friday for inspection and will visit various ports in Egypt, Palestine, Cyprus, and Greece.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] A Member of Parliament asked in the House of Commons yesterday about the defense of Gibraltar. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha stated that the authorities of the Gibraltar naval port have implemented an alert, and the government has continued to transport anti-aircraft guns to the area.

[Haitong News Agency, Cairo, 26th] According to the Arabic newspaper "Al-Ahram," a large number of Indian troops are boarding ships in Bombay, India. Although their whereabouts have not been announced, it is generally expected that they will be sent to Egypt to reinforce the strength of the British army camp there. Also, it was announced here today that road traffic in Egypt has been greatly improved, and a military road will be built from Aswan to Wadi Halfa in the north to connect Egypt with Sudan.

### Simon Reports in the House of Commons: Huge National Defense Budget; Increase Taxes to Meet Expenditures; Determined to Arm to Prevent Aggression

[Reuter's, London, 25th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon (see picture) gave a speech in the House of Commons today, giving a detailed report on the budget. A summary is as follows: Last year, the national defense expenditure paid by tax revenue was £254,500,000, and that supplemented by public debt was £128,000,000, totaling £382,500,000. Adding food and air defense equipment, the total reached £400,000,000. The most important issue in the new budget is the national defense surcharge. The supply budget is £675,000,000, the total air defense equipment expenditure is £42,000,000 (of which £37,000,000 will be paid by issuing public debt), and the food storage expenditure is £5,000,000. The total cost to be borne by tax revenue in the future is £923,000,000 (excluding the national defense surcharge). Larger plans for social affairs cannot be implemented temporarily. The highest budget of the current taxation system is £918,000,000, of which £223,000,000 can be allocated to national defense expenditure. The initial budget for national defense expenditure this year was £580,000,000, that is, tax revenue bearing £130,000,000 and public debt bearing £350,000,000, but the actual expenditure has increased by £63,000,000 and is continuing to increase. The shortfall should be remedied by issuing public debt. At the same time, tax rates should also be increased. On the tax revenue side, it is necessary to increase approximately £24,000,000. In other words, the total tax revenue will increase to £94,200,000. At the same time, £380,000,000 in public debt will be issued. Medical stamp duty will be abolished, and theater entertainment tax will be slightly reduced. Taxes will also be levied on the manufacture of photographic film and negatives, which will yield approximately £1,000,000 annually. Income tax will not be increased, but motor vehicle tax will increase sharply, from ten shillings to twenty-five shillings per horsepower. This example will be implemented from January. There will also be changes in surtax and property tax. Tobacco tax will increase from two shillings to eleven shillings and sixpence per pound (implemented tomorrow). From today, sugar tax will increase by one farthing per pound (a British small copper coin, worth one-quarter of a penny). According to this new system, the total tax revenue is £942,600,000. Simon believes that the national defense expenditure of £63,000,000 is a vast sum, enough to measure the strength that the British people should contribute and the determination of the people of the country. The issuance of public debt is difficult to classify as the easiest measure, but if tax revenue must have a certain limit, then the issuance of public debt must also have a certain limit. Although the burden of tax revenue is very heavy, due to the needs of the situation, further sacrifices must be made, and this cannot be handled entirely by issuing public debt, so in the end it is necessary to increase tax revenue by approximately £24,000,000. The government is making its best efforts to develop commerce, and it is believed that commerce will prosper, which can be expected. Therefore, any steps that have an adverse impact on industry, even if only psychological, must be avoided. Opposition Labour Party leader Attlee believes that Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon's words are not a real solution to the problem of huge expenditures. The burden of public debt will eventually be placed on the poorest people. Liberal Party leader Sinclair believes that this budget belongs to the mundane rather than the fantastic. He also believes that if taxpayers are convinced that the government is strictly handling the issue of expenditures, then Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon's words about the people's national spirit will definitely be greatly deepened. He also said, "We should now determine that the handling of huge military expenditures is very economical, and at the same time, private expenditures, especially those related to luxury goods, should not compete with national military expenditures. Although those who support the government want to implement conscription, there is no indication in the budget regarding mobilizing the country's wealth resources."

[Reuter's, London, 26th] According to Reuter's parliamentary correspondent, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon's decision not to increase income tax to heavily burden the people was unanimously praised by supporters of the government. Increasing tax revenue to meet the expenditure of national defense can be regarded as the British government's resolute posture. It is believed that foreign governments will also understand this situation. The method of strictly preventing avoidance is also praised. The parliamentary opposition believes that although the tax revenue has increased, the burden has not been increased. Some Labour Party members still believe that those with abundant income still have room to increase their income tax, so as to reduce tobacco and sugar tax revenue so that those who bear indirect taxes can be slightly eased.

[Reuter's, Paris, 25th] The impression here on Simon's budget speech is that Britain can rise up in time, and the impression here is very profound. This proves that Britain is determined to arm itself to prevent aggression.

Commentary

### Establishing a Sky Defense Line

Yesterday, the 26th, the Associated Press Chongqing reported that the French authorities have lodged a formal protest with Japan regarding the Japanese military aircraft that flew over Annam on April 13 to bomb Mengzi. The French authorities have declared that should Japanese aircraft violate their airspace again, France will take appropriate action.

This is a noteworthy piece of news.

Recently, Japanese military aircraft have continued to bomb indiscriminately everywhere, particularly in the southwest region. Recently, in addition to invading Annam and engaging in extensive threats against the Sino-Vietnamese border, they are also constructing an airfield in Taiping. Once this airfield is completed, aircraft can take off and reach Hong Kong in just ten minutes. Considering the recent Japanese military installations in Hainan Island and the Xinnan Islands, and the continuous threat to Eurasia aircraft and Imperial Airways aircraft in the skies over the southwest, it is even clearer that Japan's objectives are not only to wantonly destroy our southwestern international routes but also to actively prepare to further threaten British and French Far Eastern colonies!

We support the French authorities' protest against Japan. However, this is likely something the Japanese anticipated. Therefore, an effective solution requires the collaboration of British, French, American, and other nations facing aggression, working swiftly with Chinese and Soviet air forces to establish a sky defense line in the Far East to counter aggression. This will use actual force to prevent the illegal atrocities of Japanese aircraft.

In addition to promoting the establishment of such a sky defense line through public opinion, we must also intensify our publicity efforts, appealing to our compatriots and friendly nations to donate funds and assist China in purchasing aircraft on a large scale. We must call on technical talent to serve in the Chinese Air Force, while also encouraging and fostering the meritorious act of cultivating Chinese air force talent.

### Hull Delivers Speech, Warns Dictatorial Nations to Quickly Abandon War Intimidation, Jointly Maintain World Peace, U.S. Willing to Participate in International Military Cooperation

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] U.S. Secretary of State (see photo) delivered a speech today at the American Red Cross, calling for international peace and warning dictatorial nations that any dream of conquering the world has been shattered. Hull stated that it is not too late for dictatorial nations to quickly abandon the method of war intimidation. The United States is very willing to work to promote the joint participation of all countries in the world in peace negotiations, hoping that world peace can be achieved before major disputes break out. Finally, Hull said that if the peace desired by the United States cannot be achieved, "We are equally prepared to work hard to defend our national interests and our prosperous current political system."

[Associated Press, New York, 25th] U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace delivered a speech today at the World's Fair Committee, stating that in the event of a particularly urgent time, the United States may participate in short-term international military cooperation to jointly achieve the world peace that the United States desires. He cited George Washington's international political efforts in the past, proving that this move is very possible. Wallace said that the American people continue to demand respect for our rights, and we also respect the rights of others. Therefore, we can obtain and maintain world peace. Finally, he quoted Washington's famous saying: "We can decide war or peace based on interests, but justice is our guide. We must be willing to fully trust in short-term contacts to deal with particularly urgent events."

### Hong Kong Jiangzhe Chamber of Commerce, Raising Funds and Recruiting Members, Connecting Feelings and Jointly Seeking Industrial and Commercial Progress

(Special report from this newspaper) Jiangzhe compatriots in Hong Kong are aware that Hong Kong and Shanghai are the two major commercial ports for overseas trade. At this time of resistance and national construction, Jiangzhe people with aspirations are moving to Hong Kong to develop industry and commerce, either engaging in international trade of mainland products or establishing factories locally to develop industry. This is increasingly common. The establishment of the Jiangzhe Chamber of Commerce in the early days was modeled after other provinces' guild halls, with the meaning of a fellow-provincial association. Over the years, the spirit of unity and mutual assistance has been very remarkable. The Jiangzhe compatriots in Hong Kong have benefited greatly. At this time of Hong Kong's commercial development, talent is gathered. Jiangzhe people are discussing the idea of following the old rules, seeking to solicit funds in accordance with the articles of association to strengthen the foundation of the Jiangzhe Chamber of Commerce, recruiting members to promote the meaning of kinship and benevolence, uniting with overseas compatriots to jointly seek industrial and commercial progress, and jointly helping the country's construction. Internally, they are strengthening emotional ties, exchanging knowledge, and holding meetings.

Since the preparation, it has been decided to raise funds and solicit members, distribute donation booklets, send teams to solicit donations, and invite enthusiastic fellow villagers from other places to be special directors to facilitate contact. If the enthusiasm of fellow villagers can be obtained, accumulating bit by bit, a large sum can be collected to purchase a house as the association's office, or buy a cemetery for the preparation of fellow villagers for a hundred years. The colleagues of the association welcome fellow villagers to actively participate and share this undertaking.

### The Cause of the Tea Fragrance Room Blood Case Gradually Becomes Clear, The Deceased Had Slapped the Defendant Before, Women and Children Testified for the Defendant Yesterday Because of Injustice, The Judge and Others Went to the Scene of the Incident in Person to Investigate Yesterday Morning

The sensational Tea Fragrance Room blood case, the defendant Li Bingchun, was charged with murdering Japanese national Aihara Naomichi in the Tea Fragrance Room Restaurant at 81 Wanchai Lee Poetry Road on January 28 this year. This case has been heard in the High Court several times, but because the testimony has not yet been fully transcribed, the Chief Justice, McGilligan, convened jurors Oscar, Drachen, Johnston Huang, Su, Galla, and Chen Jintao yesterday morning at 10 o'clock for a continued hearing. Deputy Attorney General Wyatt prosecuted, and the defendant was defended by Barrister Sierra, who was transferred to Attorney Shearston.

Judge Inspects the Scene of the Incident

Before presenting witnesses, the judge, accompanied by lawyers from both sides, jurors, the defendant, and related witnesses, went to the Tea Fragrance Room in Wanchai, the scene of the incident, to inspect. After ten minutes, they returned to the court to begin the trial. Female waiter Chen Fang took the stand to testify. According to her answer to Barrister Shearston's question, when the incident occurred, she first saw the deceased reach out to grab the defendant, and then saw the deceased go to the third booth. At this point, Shearston immediately read out Chen Fang's testimony in the Preliminary Court, stating, "At about 11 pm on January 28 this year, the deceased came to the store, sat in booth number three, and ordered me to bring Longjing tea in Cantonese, and wrote 'rotten chicken wings' on a piece of paper. I immediately gave the slip to Huang Gen. Soon after, the customer in booth number two ordered me to settle the bill. After receiving the money, I put the small tip given by the customer into the cash box. At this time, I suddenly saw the deceased chase after the defendant and reach out to grab him. In an instant, the injured person returned to the third booth, and the defendant slashed him with a knife, etc."

Incited to Commit a Crime, Law Can Forgive

Next, Dr. Su took the stand to testify, answering Shearston's question, roughly saying, "When I examined the defendant that day, the defendant seemed very sober and could remember what he had done in the past, but he was too stimulated, so his attitude was unusually terrified. There is a law in law, 'If someone is stimulated to the point of mental deterioration, resulting in criminal behavior, the law allows considerable forgiveness.' I also know this example. If someone uses a fierce and terrifying attitude to deal with my family members, I would be extremely disgusted. Therefore, this is human nature."

The Deceased Did Slap the Defendant

Then, the woman Guo Dongxiaoqun took the stand to testify. According to her answer to Shearston's question, she said that she lived on the third floor of No. 5 Wong Nai Chung. At about 11 pm on January 28, she went to the Tea Fragrance Room with a male nephew named A Guang for a late-night snack. At that time, there was a fat customer in booth number three who slapped a waiter several times. She could still remember the appearance of the customer who hit the person and the person who was hit. The person who was hit looked like the defendant in court, and the person who hit looked like the photo on display (ie, the deceased). After the defendant was hit, he went to the booth and the roast chicken stand. The deceased walked out of the third booth, staggering as if drunk, and followed the defendant. When he was about to reach the roast chicken stand, the deceased reached out to grab the defendant's collar. Seeing this, she and her nephew were afraid of a fight, so they left the store without ordering food and drinks.

Child Witnessed the Defendant Being Beaten

At about 12 o'clock, the official ordered the hearing to be postponed to 2:30 pm. After the court opened in the afternoon, Chen Xiaoqun continued to answer Wyatt's cross-examination. Then, the child Hu Guang took the stand to testify. According to him, he was now 13 years old. Chen Xiaoqun was his aunt. At about 11 pm on January 28, his aunt took him to the Tea Fragrance Room for a late-night snack, sitting at the second square table near the wall on the left side of the entrance of the store. He sat in the chair near the kitchen. When his party called the female worker to bring tea, he saw a fat customer in booth number three opposite, sitting on the chair, slapping a waiter with both hands. Then, he answered Wyatt's question, saying that when the fat customer and the defendant were between booth number one and the roast chicken stand, there seemed to be a dispute. When the defendant approached the roast chicken person, the customer grabbed his neck tightly.

Daicheng Female Waiter Was Punched

After the testimony, Huang Simei took the stand to testify. According to her answer to Shearston's question, she said that she had been a female worker at Daicheng Restaurant in Wanchai for three or four years. She did not know the name of the person in the photo on display (ie, the deceased's photo) because the deceased occasionally came to Daicheng Restaurant. The deceased was fat and had a violent temperament. When she first worked at Daicheng, one day, while she was preparing boiling water at the charcoal stove, the deceased suddenly punched her twice in the back. She could only endure it and dared not say anything. The deceased must drink heavily every time he came to the store, and he must drink one or two bottles every time. After drinking, he would laugh and curse wildly. Then, she answered Wyatt's question, saying that when the deceased punched her back, although it did not push her down, the tongs in her hand had fallen to the ground. Later, the place where she was hit hurt for several days, and she applied medicinal wine to treat it. The deceased's expression towards people was extremely bad. Then, He Hongshu, a shareholder of the Tea Fragrance Room, took the stand to testify, saying that the defendant's temperament was unusually kind and he never argued with others. Then, Chinese police officer Li Huai testified, and the defendant's brother Li Yang repeated his relationship with his uncle. The official ordered the case to be postponed until 10 am next Friday for a continued hearing.

### Another Epoch-Making Movement, Welcoming the May Fourth Youth Day

— Qi Zhuo

Various youth groups held a symposium last night to prepare for the event.

"Re-evaluate all values"!

The "May Fourth" student movement in 1919 finally completed its epoch-making sacred mission. It was not just about promoting science and democracy (Science and Democracy). The movement to beat the traitors, the literary revolution, the women's roar... All anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary and cultural movements ignited the flames of the era.

The students themselves were also thoroughly aware that there was society outside of pen and ink, practice outside of books, and people outside of individuals. The rise and progress of students has fully symbolized that the Chinese nation is on the road to revival.

In previous revolutionary movements, especially the Northern Expedition of 1925, young students wrote brilliant historical pages with enthusiasm, strength, sweat, and blood.

In the few years when politics went on the curve of the "dark age", it was also the time when the student movement suffered misfortune. "Another May Fourth"—almost every year the cry of commemoration of the "May Fourth" was shouted out in blood and tears. This cry was not realized until the Lugouqiao Incident ignited the flames of the War of Resistance.

The facts are before our eyes: Our youth are bravely participating in the national liberation struggle on the front line and in the rear!

Our youth are laboriously launching the enlightenment movement of the new culture on the front line and in the countryside!

Our government authorities have fully sympathized with and enthusiastically cared for young students!

Especially young students have dug out their sincere hearts to support the government, support the national policy, and support the leader!

This miracle of changing from the "dark age" not only symbolizes the dawn of the student movement but also the auspicious omen that the War of Resistance will surely win and the country will surely be built.

Recently, in order to launch a strong youth movement, the Three People's Principles Youth League specially launched the China Youth Movement Week by the Central League Department. The dates are from May 1st to 7th. It has asked the Central Government to order youth in all parts of the country to implement it earnestly. The work of that week is: May 1st, to organize condolences to workers, launch youth to sew condolence bags and other labor services, increase production efficiency, etc.; May 2nd, to organize various cultural publicity; May 3rd, to organize condolences to wounded soldiers, condolences to the families of soldiers going to war, send off recruits into the camp, and promote military service work; May 4th, to hold commemorative meetings and parades, and the participating youth must be clean, neat, disciplined, orderly, and punctual, and be examples for the people; May 5th, to hold dramas, public performances, singing and recreational activities, and other relevant entertainment work; May 6th, to hold speeches, singing, essay competitions, and other academic work; May 7th, to hold ball games, mountain climbing, travel, boating, horse riding, and cross-country running and other youth sports. The content of various work during the Youth Movement Week must be closely related to the War of Resistance and national construction, and must be popularized in all villages and not limited to urban areas. It is said that the Central League Department of the Sanqing League has stipulated May Fourth as the Chinese Youth Festival.

This shows that the student movement is carrying forward a glorious history and launching another epoch-making movement.

Although the youth and student masses in Hong Kong are in a special environment and cannot launch sacred work as enthusiastically as their youth counterparts in the motherland, they are still struggling arduously within the possible range.

How is Hong Kong arranging to welcome the "May Fourth" Youth Day?

At 7 pm last night, various youth groups have already held a symposium at the Student Relief Association. Representatives from the Men's Youth Association, the Christian Student Federation, the Student Relief Association, and the Youth Tongle Society attended. As a result of the exchange of views, it was decided to launch a commemoration of the Youth Festival. In addition to the above four groups participating, they will also invite: the Women's Youth Association, the Huiyang Youth Association, the Youth Journalists Association, the China Youth Salvation Group, the Chinese Medical Association of the University of Hong Kong, and the China Youth Relief Association, a total of ten groups to jointly prepare. The first preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held at the Men's Youth Association Yaoxing at 2 pm this Saturday to discuss the outline of the Youth Festival commemoration, which is scheduled for: 1. The scope of participating youth groups; 2. The celebration method; 3. Pre-event preparation; 4. Venue layout. Therefore, the specific methods for the Hong Kong Youth Festival commemoration must be determined after the first preparatory meeting this Saturday. However, the work of the Student Relief Association has been arranged very well. According to Xie Yude, the vice chairman of the association, the Student Relief Association has decided on the following tasks to be launched on the Youth Festival:

First, is the work of fundraising: From "May 1st" to "May 3rd", mobilize students throughout Hong Kong to eat frugally and use sparingly. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 4,500 Hong Kong dollars can be raised to contribute to the country. During these three days, visiting teams will be organized to promote to various schools. The center of propaganda is to promote the "May Fourth" spirit of "removing domestic traitors and resisting foreign powers" to be coordinated with the current War of Resistance and national construction movement. Moreover, in the publicity, the existing organizations of various schools will be mobilized to strengthen their activities. Special attention should be paid to strengthening women's school groups.

Second, is to earnestly implement spiritual mobilization, starting from the 300 cadres of each section, and go deep into the student ranks of each school to make the lives of ordinary students serious.

Third, is to strengthen international propaganda and Sino-British cultural cooperation. In principle, it has been decided to establish close contact with all parties in the country and internationally.

Fourth, is to overcome its own shortcomings and change its style as a gift to commemorate the May Fourth Youth Day. Such as strengthening teacher-student cooperation, more closely connecting with student groups and other groups, and overcoming the past drawbacks of "isolated combat".

Fifth, is to launch a discussion on the Youth Festival issue, which is divided into: 1. The meaning of the Youth Festival; 2. How to improve the social status of youth; 3. How to strengthen the unity of youth itself; 4. How to improve the lives of youth. The above will be launched by students from various schools for extensive collective research.

These are all correct and practical plans.

We wish them all to be realized, and read that the Youth Festival shines with great and beautiful brilliance in Hong Kong.

### Prelude to the Huanghuagang Benefit Performance: Third Performance of the China Arts Troupe Begins Today at the Central Theatre Featuring "Di Si Niang," "In the Green Gauze Tent," and Other Plays

The China Arts Troupe, in conjunction with the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, the Guangdong Drama Association's Hong Kong-based members, has initiated a call to action for the entire Hong Kong drama community to raise funds for the families of fallen soldiers through benefit performances. More than forty drama groups are participating. In addition to providing all backstage work during the performances, the China Arts Troupe has also enlisted Jiang Ming, Dong Yue, Tang Qi, Qiu Hai, Ge Xin, and others as actors. The troupe's roving benefit performances are still continuing in various schools and community organizations. It is said that the troupe's roving benefit performances will soon be held in factories and on Shanghai-bound ships traveling between Hong Kong and Shanghai, so that workers and sailors will also have the opportunity to enjoy national defense dramas. In addition to performing the second and fourth acts of "Huanghuagang," the China Arts Troupe will also stage three major plays, "Di Si Niang," "For the Gentleman," and "In the Green Gauze Tent," to enrich its third performance. "Di Si Niang" is originally by the French writer Victorien Sardou, first translated as "Sick Man of East Asia" and originally titled "Monsieur Dimanche." Later, it was adapted and renamed "Di Si Niang" by Zhang Daopan, Vice Minister of Education. Ms. Yang Wei will play the role of Di Si Niang, in a deeply moving tragedy. "The Misanthrope" is originally by the French writer Molière, translated by Chen Zhice, a comedy containing a wealth of satire. "In the Green Gauze Tent" is a new national defense drama by Ouyang Yuqian, with a very complete story. The third performance of the China Arts Troupe will be held at the Central Theatre for three consecutive days starting today. It is said that after the third performance, the China Arts Troupe will devote all its efforts to the performance of "Huanghuagang" and continue its roving benefit performances.

### Another Armed Robbery in the New Territories Yesterday: Two Women Injured; Zeng Sanmei Stabbed While Resisting, Pan Simei Shot While Trying to Help

House number 321 in Lin Ma Hang Village, New Territories, was suddenly subjected to an armed robbery by five thieves at midnight yesterday. Resident Zeng Sanmei was stabbed, and Pan Simei, who lived across the street at house number 322, was also shot when she went out to help. The thieves escaped freely after the robbery. Lin Ma Hang Village is a prosperous village in the New Territories with hundreds of households. Zeng Sanmei, 321, who was robbed yesterday morning, is unmarried and lives opposite Pan Simei, 322. The houses are all Western-style, with large terraces. When the thieves committed the robbery, they pried open the inner door and sneaked in from the terrace, while another thief was on the lookout outside. This thief was holding a revolver. In addition to short guns, the thieves who entered the house also had swords. Everyone in the house was asleep at the time. Zeng Sanmei woke up and resisted the thieves, shouting for help. The thieves stabbed her with a sword. The thieves then rummaged through boxes and suitcases. After about half an hour, the thieves fled together. A total of 30 Hong Kong dollars, 150 silver dollars, and a batch of clothing were stolen. When Zeng Sanmei resisted the thieves, Pan Simei, who lived on the second floor of house number 322 across the street, suddenly saw a commotion in house number 322 and heard someone shouting for help. She went downstairs to investigate. As she was about to cross to the opposite house, she was spotted by the thief on the lookout, who immediately shot her. Simei fell to the ground. At this time, the thieves in the house heard gunshots outside, knowing that something must have happened, and fled in a panic. After hearing the gunshots, the neighbors thought it must be a robbery. After learning that Pan Simei and Zeng Sanmei had been injured by the thieves, they immediately telegraphed the Kowloon Hospital, asking them to send a car to rush to the scene and send them to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries are not serious and there is no danger to their lives.

### Over Twenty Enemy Warships Suddenly Increased in the Taiwan Strait; Panic-Stricken People in the Port Are Evacuating One After Another; An Enemy Assault on Danshui Estuary Was Repelled, with Forty to Fifty Killed; Deng Longguang Sent Troops to Reinforce the Defense and Ordered a Vow to Defend the Territory to the Death

[Zhongshan Express] On the 23rd, the enemy warship anchored in Beijie, Xinhui, suddenly sent out more than ten motorized boats towing rubber dinghies, filled with over two hundred enemy soldiers, who bypassed the waterway and attacked the Danshui Estuary, attempting to take our army's rear in Huicheng. Fortunately, our defending troops bravely fought back and drove them away. The details are recorded below:

Detailed Account of the Enemy's Attack on Danshui Estuary

Our army recovered Huicheng on the 21st and went straight to Jiangmen, putting pressure on the enemy. The enemy forces in the area of Chaolian Zhutoushan outside Beijie were about to be completely annihilated by us. The enemy entrenched in the Jiujiang River eliminated, in order to relieve the siege of Jiangmen, dispatched more than ten speedboats on the morning of the 23rd, carrying more than two hundred enemy soldiers, detouring along the Jiangmen River straight to attack Danshui Estuary. At that time, three enemy aircraft also flew to the area, flying low along the coast, strafing with machine guns, and covering the enemy speedboats to arrive. Our coastal defending troops immediately launched a resistance war. After a mixed battle until 2:00 pm, the enemy, seeing that our army was bravely resisting, continued to increase the number of speedboats and erected small steel cannons, firing artillery wantonly. At the same time, six more enemy aircraft sneaked in, fiercely bombing our position. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army was forced to retreat slightly. Some enemy troops landed, but our army took advantage of their foothold and continued to fight bravely, advancing one after another until dusk. The enemy who landed suffered half the casualties and fled back to the boats. However, they did not withdraw after nightfall, and there was an attempt to launch another operation. In this battle, forty to fifty enemy soldiers were wounded and killed by our army, and several speedboats were sunk.

Sanbu Imposes Martial Law and Residents Evacuate

According to military news on the 26th, on the 25th, several enemy boats were found harassing along the river, with the potential to attack Xinchang and Dixi. Along the coast of Guanghai and Chixi, the number of enemy warships has increased to more than twenty. On the 25th, four shallow-water warships sailed to the Yamen Estuary, patrolling back and forth, seemingly trying to break through our blockade line. At the same time, six enemy aircraft took turns sneaking into the area of Danshui Estuary, Gongyi, and Sanbu, hovering and spying. As a result, the situation in Sanbu suddenly became tense, and the people in various places evacuated to the interior one after another. Sanbu, which had just reported a restoration of prosperity, once again became heavily guarded. In order to prevent any enemy activities, the county authorities immediately ordered martial law. The ferries traveling to and from Sanbu have also been suspended for safety reasons, as enemy warships are also frequently appearing on the Yinzhuhai and Sanjiang River surfaces. It is said that Deng Longguang, after being informed, not only immediately ordered the defending troops to strictly defend, but also continued to dispatch a large army to Sanbu to reinforce the defense. If the enemy comes, he is determined to meet them head-on and give them a severe blow. As for Jiangmen, the enemy forces were suppressed by us. In the area of Chaolian Hetang Zhutoushan outside Beihai, fierce battles took place in the area of Dong Fort and Zhupaitou. The enemy, seeing the situation was critical, rushed to Jiujiang overnight to reinforce more than a thousand people. On the morning of the 25th, they used aircraft to cover the tanks and cavalry to charge at us. Our prisoners were outnumbered, and we were forced to retreat from Jiangmen. However, on the morning of the 26th, an enemy force broke through the encirclement and attempted to counterattack Huicheng along the Metropolitan Road, but they were intercepted by our security team near Shali and could not make progress. The enemy army in Jiangmen is still under our close encirclement and surveillance.

### No Change in the Battle in East River: Small-Scale Enemy Harassment: Only of a Reconnaissance Nature: An Enemy Transport Truck Ambushed and Captured

(Shenzhen Express) On the south bank of the East River, our and the enemy are still in a strict standoff. There have been no major battles in recent days, only occasional small-scale enemy harassment, but it is only of a bandit-style reconnaissance nature. Once intercepted, they flee like rats, so the defenses in various places are still peaceful, and the people are very calm. The situation in the past two days is recorded below:

Arranging Waterways to Prevent Enemy Harassment

After the enemy troops in East River were reinforced, in addition to building fortifications in Shilong, Wancheng, and Taiping to defend to the death, they also drove small groups to harass us in order to explore our military situation. However, these newly added troops have not undergone in-depth training and lack combat experience. With a little interception, they flee in a panic. On the 24th and 25th, the enemy entrenched in Shilong sent out twenty or thirty enemy soldiers to harass the area of Shangxia Youshan Paitou and looted food and livestock. On the 26th, more than a dozen enemy cavalry crossed the Long River and went straight to Shihu. She Zhongming, who was defending the area, immediately sent a team to block them after receiving the report. The enemy resisted slightly and then fled again. Chi Zhongkuan, the commander of the south bank of the East River, recently ordered the villages of Qishi Masi Longjiao Shangxia Nanyi, etc., on both the north and south banks to continue blocking the waterways, fearing that the enemy army would use speedboats to break through from the waterways. At the same time, he also arranged obstacles in a certain area to prevent the enemy army from suddenly attacking along the river.

Small Enemy Force Ambushed and Annihilated

The Shantang Highway has been busy with enemy transport for the past week. On the evening of the 24th, five enemy transport trucks loaded with war supplies and about forty enemy soldiers drove from Shitan along the Shantang Highway to Zengcheng. This was discovered by our guerilla team stationed secretly in Shitan, who destroyed the highway four or five miles away from Tingzigang in advance, and sent another team to ambush near Shangluogang. At about 9:00 pm, the enemy trucks drove up in succession. Because it was dark, they could not detect anything. The first truck fell into the trap and overturned. The trucks following behind, knowing that something was wrong, did not dare to move forward and turned back to Shitan. When they reached the vicinity of Shangluo, our team suddenly came out to intercept them. The enemy army did not dare to resist, opened the throttle, and fled in a panic. That night, we captured a truckload of war supplies and wounded and killed several enemy soldiers.

### Our Army's Counter-offensive Making Sharp Advances: Chaotic Situation in Guangzhou: Traitors Fearing Death Are Resigning One After Another: Large Numbers of Wounded and Killed Enemy Soldiers Are Transported to the City

[Guangzhou Express] As our army's counter-offensive in Guangzhou presses forward step by step, the enemy forces in the city are in a state of panic. News has been reported repeatedly. The recent situation is even more chaotic. The summary is recorded below:

Traitors Trembling, Many Resigning

The puppets in various pseudo-organizations in Guangzhou City are now in a state of panic as our counter-offensive military operations become increasingly tense. In recent days, hundreds of middle and lower-level puppets in the pseudo-police bureau, pseudo-tax bureau, pseudo-chamber of commerce, etc., have abandoned their posts and fled. It is said that rebels such as Lu Pengshang also moved their families to Hong Kong and Macau last week. Because they are afraid of being attacked by our lurking guerrilla teams in the city, they have now moved to the enemy warship in Baietan, hiding and daring not to move out, in a state of great embarrassment.

Preventing Traitors from Secretly Escaping

Because the puppets of various pseudo-organizations are fleeing one after another, and there is no one to handle affairs, the rebel Peng applied to the enemy generals for help. Soon, several measures to prevent the escape were discussed and promulgated to the traitors of various pseudo-organizations for compliance. The main points are: (1) All the puppets of the pseudo-organizations must supervise each other through joint guarantee methods and must not escape; (2) If they secretly escape, they will be punished severely once discovered; (3) Those who are willing to work in their posts will be treated as loyal to the Imperial Army. At the same time, ridiculous announcements were issued to confuse the citizens and make them live in peace. On the one hand, the exit issuing offices were ordered not to issue visas to young and strong citizens to prevent them from leaving the country, and enemy plainclothes teams were secretly dispatched to guard the outskirts of the city to prevent citizens from escaping secretly.

Large Numbers of Wounded Enemy Soldiers Transported to the City

Our army's counter-offensive this time is a sudden assault with rapid action. In the past ten days, we have repeatedly conquered famous cities on all fronts and annihilated many enemies. In recent days, large numbers of enemy transport vehicles have been found on the Yuehan Road and the northeastern suburbs, loaded with wounded and killed enemy officers and soldiers returning to the city. According to the people living in Xiaobei Huangsha, it is estimated that there are no less than two or three thousand people. These wounded and killed enemy officers and soldiers, except for the dead, were all sent to the military hospital established by the enemy in Shipai. The rest were sent to the Medical College of Zhongshan University, the Nan Di Boji Hospital, and the Dadaoshan Enemy Military Hospital. As for the corpses, they were cremated in a crematorium in the eastern suburbs. On the 19th, several enemy transport vehicles were found, fully loaded with black boxes labeled with "Ashes of Those Who Died in the Conquest of China by the Southern Branch Dispatch Army", etc., being unloaded at Tianzi Wharf and moved to enemy ships, ready to be sent back to their country. From this, it can be seen the heavy casualties of the enemy army.

### Huaxian Actively Carrying Out Pacification and Rehabilitation Work

The Provincial Relief Association Allocates 20,000 Yuan for Relief (Huaxian Correspondent) Since our army's recovery of Huaxian, we have swept away the remnants, eliminated the traitors, and actively carried out pacification and rehabilitation work. The defending army, together with the local self-defense corps, and local gentry and elders, have jointly issued announcements to appease the people, pacify the vagrants, and provide relief to the disaster victims. County Magistrate Cui Guangxi moved the county government to a certain place in the county some days ago to work. Now that the county town has been recovered, he also plans to move the county government back to the county town during the day, so that he can handle everything nearby. Therefore, after the efforts of the military and civilians in Huaxian City for the past ten days, it has presented a new look. In addition, the Fourth War Zone Headquarters and the Provincial Government sent cadres some days ago, carrying medicines and food with the army, to Qingyuan, Conghua, and Huaxian to provide relief to the refugees separately. It is now found that some of these cadres have arrived in Huaxian and convened local gentry to discuss ways to comfort the victims. After the fall of Huaxian, more than 120 of the 170 villages in the county were burned, looted, shelled, and bombed by the enemy. None of the more than 20 towns in the county were spared. The disaster situation is the most serious. The Provincial Relief Association has allocated 20,000 yuan of national currency for relief, which is said to have been remitted to the county government for distribution to the disaster areas in the county.

### Hua Zhenzhong Expresses His Determination to Defend Chaoshan: "Do not rely on the enemy's not coming, but rely on our being prepared."

[Shantou Express] Hua Zhenzhong, the Shantou Garrison Commander, took the oath of office at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th. The ceremony was performed according to the etiquette. After the supervisor gave a speech, Commander Hua gave an answer, which was impassioned and sincere. The following is a record of his answer, which briefly said: "Zhenzhong was ordered to garrison Chaoshan. Today, the swearing-in ceremony is held. Thank you to the supervisor for coming to give a speech, and to all the guests and comrades for their guidance. In addition to being grateful, Zhenzhong will accept everything with the utmost sincerity and will resolutely follow the instructions of the supervisor and all comrades in the future, step up practical efforts in the War of Resistance, and be sure to be honest and abide by the law, be loyal to our duties, absolutely adhere to the Three Principles of the People, and loyally support the supreme leader, obey the orders of the commanding officer, and be determined to fight Japan to the end to protect Greater Chaoshan and build a new Chaoshan. However, everything in the War of Resistance must be realistic. There is no invincible city in history, and there are no immortal soldiers. Therefore, in the military field, Zhenzhong has decided to supervise all armed comrades to actively carry out their work. At the same time, I hope that all party, government, military, and civilian comrades and compatriots will work together to make practical efforts in the War of Resistance. The Party must provide practical guidance, the government must cooperate in practice, and the people should be considerate of the government and love the people. I hope that they will have faith in the government's long-term war plans, unite and work together to achieve the meaning of 'preparedness averts peril' and 'do not rely on the enemy's not coming, but rely on our being prepared' as said in the art of war. Now Chaoshan has reached a critical moment. The arduous task of this War of Resistance is shouldered by every ambitious compatriot. In every aspect, especially in the military aspect, we must not just talk empty words or make a show. We must faithfully complete the preparations that each of our parts should have for the War of Resistance. Even in the current situation, we must not be lucky enough to think that the enemy will not come. We must be prepared at all times and deal with it in the same way when the enemy comes. That is, under the leadership of the commanding officer, we must truly make it so that when the enemy comes, we can deal with it with ease, have the power to resist the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and give the enemy a great blow head-on to protect our Chaoshan. We must all truly sit and act, grasp the reality, and then we can truly protect Chaoshan. The task of protecting Chaoshan cannot be achieved by empty words. It is Zhenzhong's duty to be led by our Party and all the superior officers, especially the commanding officer, and to unite with all the comrades and compatriots in Chaoshan, be faithful to the mission and duty of the War of Resistance, not count all the hardships, and continue to work hard in order to protect Greater Chaoshan, build a new Chaoshan, and truly complete the national policy of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction."

### Guangdong Party Headquarters Obeys Central Government Orders to Establish Nine Supervisory Districts: Each District to Have a Supervisory Commissioner: The Title of Former Inspector Abolished

[Qujiang Correspondent] In the past, in order to promote the work of the Party in various counties, the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters specially established four supervisory districts: Huimei, Chaoshan, Xijiang, and Qiongyai, and appointed Luo Hongshao, Huang Zhong, Gao Xin, and Zeng Sansheng as supervisory commissioners. Since the reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters in mid-March, the supervisory districts have been ordered to end. According to reliable information, the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters has recently received orders from the Central Government to add nine supervisory districts in order to effectively supervise the work of the Party in various counties. The region of each supervisory district is divided into administrative supervisory districts, and nine commissioners, including Commissioner Miao Peiji, are responsible for supervision. In addition, Chairman Li Hanhun has the commissioners supervise the districts separately. The title of inspector formerly dispatched by the Provincial Party Headquarters has been abolished.

### Amidst the Sound of the Counter-offensive in the Western Route: Commander-in-Chief Xia Returns to Zhao to Take Command: Due to Limited Military Strength, the Enemy Is Currently Only Adopting a Defensive Posture

(Xijiang Express) The counter-offensive military operations of our army in the western route are proceeding steadily and surely, while the enemy army, due to limited military strength, is only adopting a defensive posture, so the battles in recent days have been relatively quiet.

Xia Wei Returns to Zhao to Command

Commander-in-Chief Xia Wei of the Western Route returned to Guilin some months ago to meet Bai Chongxi, the Director of the Southwest Headquarters, to request instructions on the war. Later, because the military affairs were not completed, he did not return south. The military affairs of the Western Route were temporarily handled by Deng Longguang, the commander of the 64th Army. Now that the counter-offensive against Guangdong has entered the practical stage, and the military affairs will be developed in the future, he left Guilin this week and returned to Zhao to take command. He is planning the military affairs of the Western Route and has summoned senior officers to inquire about the situation.

Deng Defends the Lower Reaches of the West River

Since the return of Commander-in-Chief Xia Wei to the south, the military affairs in the lower reaches of the West River have been decided on a new overall strategy. In addition to his own command in Zhaoqing to coordinate the entire military, the enemy army in the lower reaches of the West River tried to contain our army's fierce attack on Sanshui. For the counties on the south bank of the West River, they are constantly seeking to advance. Deng Longguang, the commander of the 64th Army, has been specially designated to be responsible for guarding the rear. It is found that Deng has established a forward command post at a certain place on the front line in the lower reaches in order to facilitate military command.

### Strengthening the Strength of the War of Resistance: The Central Government Sends Personnel to Inspect Conscripts: Teams in Various Parts of Guangdong Intensify Training

[Shaoguan Correspondent] Since the War of Resistance began, the experience of the past has shown that the strategy of large-scale army positional warfare has become secondary. The extensive new guerrilla warfare strategy has become the fatal blow to the enemy. Therefore, in the later stages of the War of Resistance, guerrilla warfare in various provinces and battlefields has been very effective. The supreme military authorities have specially ordered all provinces to intensify the training of new soldiers in this area and to adjust the organization and institutions, adapt to the local environment, and strive for appropriate coordination to benefit the military. The reorganization of the guerrilla zones and changes in the training plan in Guangdong Province are also due to this. Under this strict supervision, all provinces have begun to implement the training of new conscripts, to prepare new soldiers for the struggle for the country and the nation. It is learned that the Military Commission has decided to dispatch senior officials to the provinces to inspect the organization and training of new conscripts throughout the country on May 1 this year. Our province has already received orders to prepare and will concentrate the inspection step by step to adapt to the wartime environment. It is found that a certain military officer will be appointed as the inspector of the new conscripts in our province. The counties have been ordered to intensify training and make up the number of conscripts by a certain date. As for these new conscripts, including the standing team, the social training general team, and the volunteer conscripts, the regulations on inspection can be issued during the day. At present, our province is not a war zone, and the training of new conscripts is always tense.

### The Enemy Purchases Camphor Wood to Manufacture Poison Gas: The Provincial Government Ordered a Ban on Exports Yesterday

[Shaoguan Express] The Guangdong authorities have recently received reports that the enemy has sent personnel to various parts of southern Guangdong to purchase camphor wood produced in Gaolei at high prices and transfer it to the enemy country. The price is three or four times higher than usual. Camphor wood oil can be used to make tear gas bombs. The Provincial Government specially ordered the commissioners of each district yesterday to inform the subordinate counties and cities to strictly prohibit the export of camphor wood to avoid helping the enemy.

### Movies and Theater William Keighley, Director of "Robin Hood," to Visit the East Warner Bros. Preparing a Welcome Keighley to Visit Shanghai Battle Site

William Keighley, the famous director of the Warner Bros. production "Robin Hood," one of last year's top ten blockbusters, has reportedly completed "Each Dawn I Die" (tentative translation), starring James Cagney and George Raft, at the end of March. He then left Hollywood with his new wife, Genevieve Tobiu, for a round-the-world honeymoon trip. They will arrive in Shanghai on May 2nd aboard the Japanese Empress from Kobe and stay for several days before heading to Hong Kong on the 5th and then flying to Saigon. Mrs. Tobiu played the aunt of Pan Li La in Keighley's film "Yes, My Darling Daughter," which will premiere at the Cathay Theater in Shanghai on the 11th of next month.

When the Keighleys arrive in Shanghai, they will stay at the International Hotel. Warner Bros.' Shanghai office is currently preparing a welcome. In addition to visiting famous Shanghai theaters such as the Grand Theater and Cathay Theater, and dance halls such as the Lido and Paramount, Keighley will also visit Zhabei to view the remnants of the Shanghai Battle.

Keighley has been working in theater for 22 years, 12 as an actor and 10 as a director. His rich experience has made him a famous director. Born in Philadelphia, USA, he loved theater arts from a young age. After completing his education, he joined a theater company and performed in Shakespeare's famous plays. At the time, touring companies used old scripts, but he was the first to write his own modern plays, such as "Just Suppose," and sold more than a dozen of them. Most of them were directed or acted by him. He spent two years in Paris studying French stage plays. After returning to New York, he directed "The Perfect Alibi" with Hopgood, and then directed several plays in London. After returning to New York, he directed "Penny Arcade," and discovered stars Joan Blondell and James Cagney. The rights to the play belonged to Al Jolson, who sold them to Warner Bros., so he went to Hollywood with them. There, he directed famous plays such as "Grand Hotel" and "Elizabeth the Queen," and directed "Tomorrow & Tomorrow" at Belasco's Theater in Los Angeles. He also translated and directed Rostand's famous play "Cyrano de Bergerac."

With such rich knowledge and experience, his reputation grew daily. Warner Bros. hired him, first as a script supervisor, then as a consulting director, to gain experience. After all, directing films and directing stage plays are slightly different. Five years ago, he began directing "Water Lily" on his own. Since then, he has directed many famous films, such as "Varsity Show," "The Beggar Emperor," "Sweet Music," "Gold Diggers of 1935," "Colleen," "G Men," "The Green Light," "Stars Over Broadway," and the upcoming "Yes, My Darling Daughter." "Robin Hood" is a masterpiece he created with Mici Curtis.

Last year (1938), he married Tobiu and lived in a modest but comfortable house in Brentwood. Recently, he built a swimming pool, so he doesn't have to go far to enjoy his favorite sport.

### Mulan Joins the Army Negotiations Resolved Moving to New Light Theater for Screening

Recently, Huacheng Film Studio and Shanghai Light Theater suddenly had a negotiation. The reason was that Huacheng's maiden work, "Mulan Joins the Army," still had daily ticket sales of over 2,200. The contract signed by Huacheng and Shanghai Light stated that the film could be withdrawn if daily ticket sales were less than 1,000 yuan. However, Shanghai Light also had a contract with MGM, because the screening period of "Mulan Joins the Army" was extended for more than a month. MGM's films, which came down from the Grand Theater, had accumulated six or seven films, resulting in considerable losses. To avoid complaints, MGM recently sent a letter of request to Shanghai Light. If MGM's films were not screened quickly, in addition to breaching the contract, Shanghai Light would have to compensate MGM for a loss of 60,000 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai Light authorities were in great difficulty and had to shorten the screening period of "Mulan Joins the Army," scheduled to end on the 20th. At the same time, a farewell message was published in the advertisement. Huacheng, in order to abide by the contract, had not yet reached the period for withdrawing the film, and believed that Shanghai Light had breached the contract. Therefore, Huacheng filed a negotiation with Shanghai Light and published a warning in the newspaper. Shanghai Light found it difficult to resolve this matter, so they specially consulted with Huacheng. It is said that as a result of Shanghai Light's sincere plea, Huacheng took into account Shanghai Light's predicament and accepted Shanghai Light's request. "Mulan Joins the Army" decided to be screened until the 20th, and from the 21st, it will be screened at the New Light Theater. The negotiation is considered to be over.

The New Light Theater is currently screening Tang Jie's "Mr. Wang Finds Eating Difficult" comedy film, which is doing very well at the box office. However, because "Mulan Joins the Army" is coming, it has to temporarily "give way." After "Mulan Joins the Army" is screened, "Mr. Wang Finds Eating Difficult" will be re-screened. Some people say that this is "Hua Mulan eating up Mr. Wang's gains."

### Happy Angel (12)

The next day, as soon as dawn broke, the passenger cars were ready, and everyone was rushing to leave. Halifa discovered that Irene had not obtained a passport, but Weibo was already sitting in the car.

"Good luck, darling," Halifa said sharply.

"That doesn't matter," she said indifferently.

"I will think of a way for you, don't worry, you will definitely be able to leave tomorrow."

She smiled vaguely, "You want to encourage me, but it's useless."

"I see it very clearly, you are stubborn, but you can't forget our friendship in Omohei."

"Are you going to stay in Omohei forever?" she asked wearily.

"I just want to help you, Irene," he said loyally, "Isn't there anything I can do?"

So, she said gently, "You are very kind and brave, but unfortunately, you can't change Ya Wei Chuan. He has already decided. I must stay here."

"Did he deliberately have someone keep you here?" Halifa asked in horror.

"Of course it's him. You think, I know too much about his way of making money."

"Everyone knows his way of making money," Halifa said contemptuously.

"Whoever dares to slander him, he will show them what's what. Last night, I told him the truth. Look, now, he's showing his tricks so quickly."

"Halifa!" A companion of Halifa rushed in and shouted, "The car is about to leave."

"Go, go," Irene also urged him, "You can't help me, no one can help me." She pushed him out the door, "If it can make you happier," she suddenly added, "I'll tell you, yes, in Omohei, I knew you. Now, goodbye, Halifa, we're saying goodbye again."

Halifa looked at her emotionally. She was so beautiful, brave, and so lonely. (To be continued)

### Hong Kong Football Interport Team to Depart for the Philippines Today A Group of Seventeen Will Play Three Matches Da Gausannu, Li Huitang, etc., Will All Go

…The Hong Kong interport football team to the Philippines is scheduled to leave Hong Kong at midnight tonight on the President Cleveland for Manila and is scheduled to arrive in Manila on the 30th of this month. Three matches will be played in the Philippines: (1) Hong Kong vs. Philippines international match on April 30, (2) Hong Kong team vs. Philippine champion La Salle University on May 2, (3?) Hong Kong team vs. the YOC Association, the champion of the current league, on May 4. The venues are all at the Black and Purple Sports Memorial Association Stadium. The referee for the first two matches will be Omar, a well-known Hong Kong referee.

…The Hong Kong team will have a total of seventeen people. Gao Fei, secretary of the Football Association, will be the leader, and Committee Member Jin will be the coach and manager. The list of all members is as follows:

Tan Junqian, Shi Han, Li Dasheng, Hou Sheng, Yishe Zhi, Liang Rongzhao, Bilu Duo, Feida Shi Da, Han Niweiluo, Hou Chengtou, Da Gausannu, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Ge Ni, Yan Ba Chen

…The three football matches in the Philippines will all be held at night under the lights, which is different from Hong Kong and is often unfavorable to away teams. Those with weak strength are even more affected. When the Philippine team came to Hong Kong on the first day of the Lunar New Year this year, they lost two out of three matches and returned in disgrace. This time, they are waiting at their leisure, and they have gained a lot of advantages in terms of time and place. There will definitely be a fierce battle, but in terms of artistry, the Hong Kong team should win.

…The Philippine Amateur Sports Advancement Association has already scheduled the three matches to adopt a seventy-minute system. If the international match is still tied at the statutory time, the match will be rescheduled for the next day. If it is still a tie, twenty minutes will be added, it is said.

…Currently, Philippine fans are very excited and want to see the skills of football stars such as Da Gausannu, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, and Li Tiansheng. Therefore, ticket sales are particularly brisk. After the matches are over, the Hong Kong team will return to Hong Kong by Tai Koo Company ship and return here on May (Wednesday) to allow the South China Athletic Association to play the Xuhe Cup final with the Navy on Saturday the 13th.

### Exciting Basketball Match Last Night Eastern Defeats Pui Ying Group B Reporter Unfortunately Loses to Morning Light Basketball Association Rescheduled for Tonight to Discuss Shenbao Cup

Last night's open men's basketball match was between Eastern and Pui Ying. Eastern is the strongest team in this competition, and although Pui Ying's strength is not as good as Eastern's, they had high ambitions to defeat Eastern, so they deployed a full lineup. When the two teams made contact, Eastern was strong and well-coordinated, and their defense was also exceptionally solid. Huang Dingfen launched surprise attacks, showing off his skills,

Skillful and Peerless

Feng Nianhua also showed ingenious techniques, Luo Jian had many good plays, Chen Shouqi defended well, and Sun Baoqing looked after the front and the rear. Pui Ying's Pan Jinhong made considerable efforts to score, and Qiu Guangxie had made some progress in the first half, but in the second half, he was closely watched by Chen Zongqi and made no progress. Looking at the performance of both sides, they were not nervous in the preliminary round, and later they were also pleasing. Pui Ying's coordination was not good, and the forwards

Mostly Missed the Mark

The progress only relied on Pan Jinhong's attacks, but every

Fierce Interception

Therefore, it was as difficult as ascending the road to Shu. In addition, Chen Zhetang was also unable to win the championship. The defense of He Rirong and Guan Zhitong was exceptionally weak. Therefore, Eastern's attack

Could Coordinate

Feng Nianhua also bluffed, and Huang Dingfen was able to go straight down and do whatever he wanted, defeating Pui Ying by a large margin of sixty-four to forty-five.

After the start of the battle, the two sides fought fiercely for a while. Feng Nianhua took the lead in showing his power. Qiu Qing's surprise troops rose up and recovered lost ground. Huang Dingfen refused to be outdone and rolled up his sleeves and stepped forward.

Movement and Battle Were Both Successful

Chen 　Tang broke into the heavy encirclement and had some gains. However, Luo Jian and Feng Nianhua worked together, and Chen 　Continued to work hard. Pan Jinhong also copied successfully. Eastern was tailgated by Pui Ying. Huang Dingfen, Feng Nianhua, Chen Zongqi, and Luo Jian launched attacks from four directions, and they succeeded immediately. The scores were tied at 19 to 14. Lin Wanli and Pan Jinhong launched counterattacks from two directions, but Huang Dingfen and Feng Nianhua fired from the left and right, and both hit the target. Pan Jinhong, Qiu Guangxie, and He Rirong charged from three directions, but the gains did not make up for the losses. The first half ended with 29 to 23.

Changing Fields and Fighting Again

Pui Ying tried to make amends. Pan Jinhong got on his horse and raised his spear. Eastern was looking forward to the fierce offensive and was prepared to wait. Soon they saw Sun Baoqing break through the barrier. Huang Dingfen, Feng Nianhua, and Zhong Guoneng fired continuous shots and were invincible. Pui Ying was in a precarious situation, and the entire army tried its best to resist. Pan Jinhong and He Rirong broke through and

Recovered Several Cities

Eastern knew their intentions early on and intercepted them closely, so they were in a desperate situation. Although Pui Ying added reinforcements, their morale was slightly boosted, but Wu Guoxiang and Lao Xiong were

Enlisted One After Another

The atmosphere was as depressed as if surrounded by enemies on all sides. Only Huang Dingfen's division went wherever it went and was invincible. Lao Xiong also raided Pui Ying. At this time, the songs of Chu were heard on all sides, and Lin Wanli also fired the last shot to show his sorrow, but it was of no help to the overall situation. When the gong was sounded to withdraw the troops, Eastern won by a score of sixty-four to forty-five.

First Match Group B

In the match between Morning Light and 　The Light, Morning Light had stronger attacking power, but the reporters lacked shooting skills. Forward 　Dianlian had made some effort, but his defensive power was not perfect, and the forwards' attack coordination was not consistent. Although Morning Light was not a strong team, the entire army went forward bravely. Zhao Shima and Ri Ming made many contributions, and they were able to take advantage of the reporters' weaknesses and launch fierce attacks. In the end, they lost by a score of forty-three to forty-seven.

In addition, the Basketball Federation originally convened a committee meeting last night to discuss holding the Shenbao Cup, but due to time

It was Changed to This (27th) Night to Hold a Meeting It Is Said.

### Open Tennis Tournament Stopped Due to Rain Yesterday Rescheduled for This Afternoon

The Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament Originally Was Going to Hold a Singles Final, with Xu 　Pei Against Li Huichang, Only Because It Rained in the Morning, and the Venue Was Slippery, So the Hong Kong Cricket Club 　Postponed This Match, to Be Played This Afternoon, the Originally Scheduled Doubles Semi-final of the Xu Brothers Against Lin Tiande and Huang 　Xi, Was Postponed to Next Week for a Reschedule, the Reason Was That Li Huitang Was to Leave with the Philippine International Football Team on the President Cleveland at 2:10 This Evening to Manila, So He Urgently Requested the Change to This Afternoon It Is Said.

### Swimming Guide - Methods for Practicing Entering the Water

Here, we will practice four types of water entries: flat dive, swan dive, forward bending dive, and backward dive. To further practice fancy diving, one must first master the above-mentioned water entries. This is because various difficult and wonderful water entries are based on these movements. Take somersaults, for example: whether it's a high somersault, a running somersault, a standing somersault, a forward somersault, or a backward somersault, and no matter how many times you somersault, it is related to the posture of the water entries mentioned above. If the posture of those four water entries is stiff, awkward, and ugly, not only is it difficult to expect any progress in fancy diving, but even the courage required for a proper water entry will be lacking. Learning to enter the water requires more courage than swimming. If you learn to swim without courage, you can still achieve something over a long period of time. But with water entry, it's simply impossible to even begin.

Entering the water greatly increases a swimmer's interest. Even watching others practice entering the water is enjoyable. This is because the movements of entering the water involve many considerations: how to leap into the air, how to perform and maintain the posture in the air, and how to insert oneself into the water. Movements involving both land and water are applied, so it has a great positive influence on the muscles. It is also more dangerous, so one must be brave and especially careful.

In application, among various water entry styles, besides the "high dive" and "standing" dive which are necessary, the others are not necessarily essential. Here, "standing" refers to the initial stage obtained before practicing the four aforementioned water entries. The so-called "high dive" is also related to performing various fancy styles. Fancy postures require considerable distance for performance. A high dive provides a long enough distance. Standing at the edge of the pool, starting initial water entry practice, leaping into the water, the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose inevitably suffer from impact with the water. This doesn't matter. The most painful thing is the upper body hitting the water surface flatly, causing the skin on the chest and abdomen to turn red and swollen. Why do beginners in water entry always have to suffer this? To explain the reason for this, it's not necessary to regret that you brought it upon yourself. When entering the water, the head must go down first. But standing at the edge of the pool, the head is often facing the sky. Because of the failure to use the strength of the feet and hands, the body feels very difficult to bend over. The body's initial intention when entering the water is already not very inclined. Panic sets in, further causing the water to slap against the head, and the person dares not bow their head down, resulting in the upper body hitting the water surface flatly. Thus, it is inevitable. This pain is not considered a big deal. Also, because the feet cannot point towards the sky when the body leaves the edge of the pool, the upper limbs, torso, and lower limbs form an arch. The pain felt on the water surface is even more severe in this state.

Having clarified the unnecessary difficulties in learning, besides first clearly understanding the depth of the water where you are practicing – at a minimum, it should be deeper than a Japanese person's height and have considerable technique as a prerequisite – the courage to learn must be possessed. This goes without saying. A little bit of fear is not allowed. Then the superiority of practice will continue. Beyond ordinary expectations, stand with your toes at the edge of the swimming pool, hands raised and clasped together, palms facing directly forward, fingers also clasped. Before entering the water, bend your knees slightly, leap forcefully, and because your head is also bowed, you are forced to enter the water in that posture. Once you are warmed up after this simple movement, the upper limbs are applied further. The posture is similar to the simple movement, except that the hands are hanging down behind you, the upper body is slightly leaning forward, leap with your toes at the edge, and extend both hands forward simultaneously, making it easier to bend the body into the water. When the standing water entry movement is quite familiar, there is still difficulty in correcting the posture of the lower limbs. The feet cannot be kept tightly together when the body leaves the edge of the pool until entering the water. This problem is very much related to daily lower limb movements. Doing lower limb exercises to bring them close together during morning and evening flexibility exercises is very helpful.

When the practice of standing water entry has achieved considerable results, start practicing the types of water entries where you leap into the water from a diving board. Place your body on the end of the diving board that extends over the water. It immediately produces a spring force. If you add the force of jumping on it, the spring force becomes even greater. The spring force of a standard diving board is not very large, and its increase depends on how the person entering the water uses it. An excellent diver can increase the length of the board itself. But the body is thrown not far from the tip of the board. The main key to this movement lies in the jumping ability of the toes. Needless to say, the amount of foot strength applied to the board is related to the strength of the feet themselves, and also depends on whether the jumps are well-timed. When jumping on the board, don't use too much speed, and don't make each step too small. The former will throw the body too far beyond the board, reducing the take-off distance. The latter weakens the jumping force.

The posture of a flat dive in the air is with all four limbs straight. If such a simple water entry style is not practiced well, it is difficult to advance to other styles. A beautiful flat dive posture is pleasing to the eye. If you can perform the flat dive beautifully while learning to enter the water, everything will be easy step by step. If the lower limbs cannot be brought together, it is a drawback that practitioners of flat dives cannot correct for a long time. Many flat dive postures are almost perfect except for the buttocks, a particularly prominent problem. The reason is mostly the failure to use the strength of the waist. The waist strength must support the shoulders and buttocks. The buttocks protrude forward, and the upper and lower limbs are extended, forming a slightly straight posture. When approaching the water, the head must be bowed down a little to increase the angle between the body and the water surface, so that less water splashes up. Why does the body either fall flatly or fall backward during a flat dive? The former is mostly caused by a weak jumping force. The latter is caused by the failure of the buttocks and upper limbs to make a balanced body, tilting the body backwards. Understanding this, the head must not be bowed down too much and the hands must be raised up.

After entering the water, when the feet are still outside, the upper limbs should already be facing the water surface. This will guide the body back to the water surface. In an excellent water entry, the splash is small, the sound is not loud, and the time it takes to emerge from the water is very short.

The swan dive is not much different from the flat dive, except that the hands are spread apart on both sides. This starts from the moment the toes leave the board, like the shape of the number eight. When entering the water, they are joined again, entering the water like a flat dive.

Forward bending: When the toes leave the board, the upper body bends down, and the fingers reach for the feet, much like the posture of a shrimp when it curls up. Before reaching the water, the limbs are straightened up again like in a flat dive. Backward jump: Stand at the end of the board, facing away from the direction of the jump. When the toes leave the board, the body somersaults into the water. The practice of entering the water to this point requires even more courage.

Economic Outlook

### Common Commercial Knowledge

— Fu Shi Sheng

(1) Business Acumen

The business acumen in commerce is like turbulent and unpredictable weather. As Mr. Long Ju Sheng said, "Everyone can do magic, but each has their own unique tricks." The transactions in our wool industry naturally differ from the changes and insider information in the yarn industry. Now, let's talk about the business acumen of wool transactions! Whether it's salespeople from firms or factories carrying samples around to peddle, in addition to the universally known brand new or cheap goods, they all claim to have newly arrived goods, new products, and new patterns. Once the buyer "selects what they want and discusses prices," they all say, "The stock is limited, and it's selling like hotcakes. A certain firm wanted to buy it all up but didn't because of the price. So-and-so has already purchased it twice. A certain customer bought so much, and the price was even five or ten cents higher." If they encounter old-fashioned patterns, they say, "The company didn't want to sell it cheaply at first. So-and-so and others offered such-and-such a price but we didn't accept it. Now, we urgently need money to liquidate the stock and seek profit. It's definitely a loss-making price reduction. Buying now is a great opportunity. The early bird gets the worm, so don't miss out." If the goods "have already been sold," they also say, "This price can't be calculated. We sold it to so-and-so for such-and-such a price, but we don't want to publicize it." For example, if they "buy one or two bolts," they say, "This is for your sake. According to the rules, we'll add some extra to the wholesale price per bolt." Also, if they tacitly agree to accept bank notes or use checks, they say, "If it were another company, it definitely couldn't be done without cash." Conversely, when a buyer/customer encounters something they like, they mostly say "I don't want it", putting on a show of indifference because their intention is to bargain down the price. In short, this kind of business acumen is full of mutual deception. Some even sell their personality and swear oaths to others. This shows the utter deceitfulness of "business acumen," which is full of mystification. Recently, with the great changes in the situation, everyone feels that this is not what commercial ethics should be. Superficial practices and bad habits should be eliminated. Sincere trust is the real "business acumen."

(2) Wholesale Goods

Wholesale original boxed goods are priced more fairly than individual bolt sales because a box of four or six bolts often has a fixed pattern composition that cannot be changed. Therefore, only large customers are willing to sell in smaller quantities. For wholesale goods, eight or nine times out of ten, after a transaction is made, the contract is first drafted, then payment is made before delivery. Funds are transferred according to the market exchange rate (or it is stated beforehand that only cash is accepted). However, there are also cases where goods are delivered first and then payment is collected, but these are very rare. After the lot number is written down, if the payment is not cleared within a week, a deposit must be paid. The invoice should state that the remaining payment is due in half a month or twenty days, otherwise the deposit will be forfeited. Conversely, if the goods are sold to someone else, the seller must compensate for the losses by paying one or two times the amount of the deposit. However, once the deposit is paid, failing to pay the remaining amount or selling the goods to someone else is really rare (however, if the deposit has not been paid and the market experiences good or bad sharp fluctuations, disputes often arise between the two parties). Recently, this kind of deposit-payment-within-a-limited-time arrangement has become impossible because in the current changing market, no one is willing to deliver lot numbers without receiving cash payment within one or two days.

(3) Individual Bolt Sales

Because colors can be selected, the price is adjusted about ten cents higher than the wholesale price per bolt. The seller often delivers the goods to the buyer. Regardless of the transportation cost, it is borne by the seller. Whether it's cash, check, money order, or return order, it is specified during the sale. The quoted price changes according to the type of cash payment, but cash transactions are of course the most advantageous. After the fabric is delivered, the meticulous buyers mostly want to re-measure the yardage. According to customary rules, if a bolt is shorter by more than half a yard, it is deducted. If it's shorter by less than half a yard, the buyer has to bear the loss. Because according to the rules of the ordering firm, original bolts have seals on both ends, and if they are shorter by less than half a yard, a cross cannot be marked. Because individual bolt sales often involve delivering the goods and preventing invoices (if the lot numbers have not been written down in advance), changes often occur. If the market is good and the price rises, the seller may sell to the highest bidder, or fail to deliver one color or one bolt, or even claim that the goods have already been snapped up by someone else, or that they have been reserved by someone else and the price needs to be increased (reputable stores usually don't do this). Because the buyer has no proof, it is difficult to argue. Conversely, once the goods have been delivered to the buyer and examined, sudden changes may occur, and the buyer may claim that the fabric is of poor quality, the color is slightly different, or the price is reduced or the goods are returned. This kind of procedure does not occur with wholesale entire boxes of goods. As the saying goes, "The food is already in your mouth, but you can't get it down."

(4) Spot and Forward Goods

The so-called spot goods are goods that are in the store or warehouse and are delivered immediately after the transaction is completed (it may also be that the customer delays for a few days). Forward goods refer to goods that have not yet arrived at the port but are sold in advance, stating that they will be delivered in about half a month or a month. A contract is drafted in advance with the lot numbers as proof. If the market changes or the agreed delivery date is missed, both parties often break their promises. Therefore, the wool industry generally lacks trust in forward goods transactions.

(5) Invoices

Except for commission agents who obviously get a commission and therefore issue inflated invoices, those who purchase directly from the store or factory naturally issue accurate invoices. However, there are often cases where they inflate the amount slightly. This is done to maintain a uniform price and avoid market chaos. Domestic factories often issue invoices like this because they often have secret rebates to deduct when settling accounts. There are also those who have good relationships and use an old method of payment, issuing an invoice with the word "照" (zhao, meaning "according to") to indicate "according to the previous market price." This refers to buying and selling among businesses in the same industry. Issuing invoices to retail customers is another matter because there are often customs duties on goods shipped to customers. Therefore, in addition to ensuring that there are no errors in the invoice and the actual goods, they also issue a fake invoice according to the customer's instructions.

(6) Price Protection

There is a precedent in the same industry for price protection on non-boxed goods and individual bolts. Price protection means guaranteeing that the goods will not lose money. There are verbal guarantees and guarantees stated on the invoice. Price protection usually lasts for five days (at most ten days). Within the time limit, if goods of the same quality, pattern, and brand are available at a lower price, the price must be adjusted accordingly. Price protection is considered a hard-earned profit, so they are unwilling to mention the word "price protection" unless absolutely necessary. Price protection is most common for futures contracts, followed by spot goods for common Chinese wool fabrics. Price protection for Western-style suit fabrics is extremely rare. (End)

### Reflections on the Flag Incident in the Shanghai French Concession

— Qian Li

Since our troops withdrew from Shanghai, the Japanese invaders have been pressing into the Shanghai concessions step by step. Although their attitude is not as outrageous as in Tianjin, their aggressive posture is not to be compared with ordinary cases. For example, repeatedly and without cause, they have assaulted European and American people, and interfered with the administration of the concessions.

The reasons why the Japanese invaders have adopted this posture are nothing more than two. First, they want to completely drive the European and American forces out of the Yangtze River region, in order to monopolize the market in central China. Second, they want to suppress anti-Japanese speeches and actions of the Chinese people in Shanghai, in order to strike at the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people in the occupied areas. In order to achieve the above two goals, the Japanese invaders do not hesitate to use all kinds of despicable and shameless means.

In principle, the British and French concession authorities in Shanghai should, for the sake of preserving their own interests and dignity, adopt a friendly attitude towards the righteous people of European and American countries, and fight together to resist the common enemy of tyranny.

But the fact is so paradoxical. The concession authorities not only succumbed to the pressure of the Japanese, and signed illegal agreements with the Japanese, allowing the Japanese to enter the concession to freely arrest patriotic elements, but even aided the evildoers, promulgating so-called emergency decrees, suppressing so-called terrorist activities, closing stores, newspapers, and arresting and handing over anti-Japanese Chinese people to the Japanese invaders. This kind of action of selling friends for self-preservation is already very hateful. However, now the concession authorities have even openly interfered in the matter of the Chinese people hanging flags, and even tore up the flags, causing unanimous indignation among the Chinese people in the concession, and leading to a general strike.

Such a reasonable protest, if the French concession authorities had been slightly self-conscious, should have returned the confiscated flags and apologized to console the public. However, the French authorities not only did not do this, but arrested more than a hundred citizens and beat the masses. At the same time, the French police, detective patrol cars, armored vehicles, etc., were all dispatched, as if facing a great enemy, to intimidate the people. The French authorities also published a public statement, claiming that the police's non-sand action of depriving the people of the freedom to hang flags was handled appropriately. The statement also stated that any political demonstration activities in this concession are prohibited, and if necessary, the troublemakers will be expelled. This kind of tyrannical oppression is really no less than what the Japanese invaders directly do to our Shanghai citizens. Fortunately, the citizens in the concession were united in resisting the tyranny, and went on strike, and only after two days of contention did the French authorities release the arrested citizens and return the flags.

In this incident, I can't help but have two feelings. First, in doing anything, especially the great and arduous cause of saving the country, we must have collective action, unity, and the determination to fight to the end. If the compatriots in the French concession in Shanghai had not expressed such resolute and united opposition, not only would the arrested comrades not have been released immediately, the flags would not have been returned, and the pressure and treatment of the citizens in the concession would undoubtedly worsen. Because these people have always been bullies who are afraid of the strong and bully the weak. If you endure everything, then you will get worse treatment. Why did foreigners in Shanghai treat the Chinese so cruelly in the past? There is no other reason, but because the Chinese people were too tolerant. To remedy this evil, there is only stubborn struggle, especially group struggle, so that people will not dare to bully you at will. To save China, there is only one way to unite and fight together. For example, why does the Japanese enemy, which is in a superior position, repeatedly express its desire for peace with us? It is because we are able to fight and rise up to fight stubbornly. Otherwise, it would have wiped you out long ago. Why would it express its desire for peace with you? Therefore, we should not talk about peace at this time, but fight to the end.

Secondly, from this incident, we can see that capitalist countries are unreliable and shameless. They only bow to the strong and oppress the weak. They have always been bullied by the Japanese, but they have turned around to please the Japanese and suppress the victimized Chinese people. So-called justice, so-called sympathy, cannot be discussed with capitalist countries. In fact, not only is this incident like this, but in fact, they were already like this in the Spanish incident and in the Czech incident. Wasn't Spain his ally? Wasn't Czech even more his ally? However, he can do it for his own interests, or to put it mildly, be cowardly, and instead help their common enemies, Germany and Italy, placing Czech Zara Spain in a position of powerlessness and helplessness and disarmament, crushing them to death, and even though this is very unfavorable to himself, he still did it with a bad conscience.

Therefore, we must not think that just because he is now slightly friendly to us because of his own interests, we will entrust our lives to him. This is absolutely impossible. To save China, we must rely on ourselves. It doesn't matter whether it is the United States, Britain, or any country, relying on others will not work. If there is a slight difference in interests, he will immediately turn around and even cooperate with your common enemies to put you to death. Therefore, I want to say again, to save China, we can only save ourselves, only ourselves are the most reliable people. Chinese people, unite together!

### Fulfilling the Mission from Our Own Position

— Xiao Chun

Comparing the material conditions of military equipment, it was originally going to be extremely difficult for China to fight an aggressor who had been scheming for ten years. However, since the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, China has been engaged in a fierce battle with the aggressor for twenty-one months amidst hardship and difficulty. Not only has the main force of the resistance not been defeated, but the overall situation is also trending towards improvement. This cannot be said to be anything other than spirit overcoming matter, and also a great testament to the spirit of the Chinese nation.

"A sheet of loose sand," this is a traditional insult from Westerners towards the Chinese nation, and the aggressor is also relying on this "sheet of loose sand" assessment, harboring aggressive ambitions, and full of hope to swallow up this large China in a short period of "three months" or "half a year." Unexpectedly, our Chinese nation, under the influence of revolutionary doctrine, has long been tempered from "a sheet of loose sand" into a bronze wall and iron fortress. In the current environment, everyone knows that to obtain international freedom and other things to complete the revolutionary mission, we must break free from hardship and difficulty. Therefore, although the material conditions are simple, our spirit of striving is becoming more and more prosperous with the war—before the aggressor's ambitions are abandoned, the Chinese people will never kneel before the artillery fire—

The facts tell us: the greatness of spiritual power has consumed a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the aggressor in the past twenty-one months, putting it in a dilemma. Logically, everyone should be convinced and without doubt that the final victory is assured. However, a small number of Japan-fearing people, such as Wang Jingwei and his ilk, still despise the greatness of spiritual power, and do not hesitate to sell their fighting spirit and personality with servile flattery, repeatedly publishing his arguments for peace, which is truly madness. This time, the central government is promoting a total mobilization of spiritual strength in all aspects, which really requires our compatriots across the country to reflect on themselves: are all our words, actions, and lives serious and in accordance with the provisions of the eleven National Covenants? At the same time, on the other hand, it requires every Chinese compatriot to shoulder the mission of saving the country. First, thoroughly eliminate the pseudo-resistance fighters in our own ranks, then unify our steps, and then launch a general counter-offensive against the aggressor. Therefore, in his speech on the 17th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek regarded the implementation of this national spiritual mobilization as "the most important event related to the survival of the nation, the vitality of the race, and the success or failure of the war of resistance."

However, after we implement the spiritual mobilization, all compatriots across the country launch a counter-offensive posture, the collaborators and aggressors, in their panicked emotions, will inevitably show the dying struggles of extreme behavior. In this situation, we should strengthen our beliefs, not be tempted by profit, not be afraid of threats, and not give up the mission of our own position. Cultural figures should be steadfast and persevering, and with the spirit of not fearing death, not fearing hardship, and not fearing difficulty, do everything possible to condemn and attack the aggressor and traitors, completing the mission of our own position.

Shanghai has always been the center of culture. Although surrounded by evil forces, a small number of dregs in the cultural circles are engaged in treasonous activities, recognizing the enemy as their father. However, the arduous struggle of the majority of cultural figures is also an undeniable fact. The traditional spirit of intellectuals who "would rather break their heads than bend their will" is still being gloriously upheld. However, we cannot be complacent and relax our responsibilities. We should redouble our efforts to complete the glorious mission of our own position.

### Pearl Buck's New and Old "Patriots"

— Chen Donglin

Pearl S. Buck is the winner of this year's Nobel Prize in Literature. She is famous as a "China expert." At a time when China's resistance is in full swing, the Nobel Prize has selected this writer who takes China as her theme. International attention, in terms of literature, is also focusing on this laboring, struggling China. At this time, Pearl Buck produced a work with the theme of China in the War of Resistance, "The Patriot," which will soon be available to readers in various countries around the world.

"The Patriot" has differences in subject matter from her previous novels with Chinese backgrounds; its background has even expanded to Japan, with extremely detailed descriptions of Japanese customs and folklore. The general reader will definitely find her understanding of Japan interesting. What is particularly pleasing to our Chinese readers is that even Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will appear as a character in the work before the readers.

The protagonist of "The Patriot," Wu Yiwan, is the son of a Shanghai banker. This rebellious son hates everything about his family. He hates his father's wealth, hates the shackles of family ethics and education, and he has a resentful attitude towards his surroundings. Under this pain, he is finally led by his distressed female classmate and joins the Communist Party in school, doing propaganda and leading the masses, and he finds inner comfort. But as an idealist, he believes that there is only "good" and "evil" in this world, and as long as "evil" is simply removed, an ideal world will definitely appear. That was when the flames of war were burning all over China, and he placed great hope in the revolution, believing that as long as the revolution was successful, the world he was thinking about would appear. But the revolution was not yet complete, and the KMT and the Communist Party suddenly split, followed by a purge, leaving our Yiwan with nowhere to stand in China. So, with the help of his father, a powerful banker, he escaped from danger and fled to Japan in the east.

His hopes were shattered, and he felt despair for everything. In Japan, he lived in the home of his father's friend, Muraki. Here, he saw that although Japan seemed very peaceful on the surface, the freedom of these people had been completely deprived. Everything was brutally controlled, maintaining the so-called extreme peace and order. Later, Yiwan gradually fell in love with Muraki's daughter, "Zhu." In the vortex of love, the shadow of turbulent China unexpectedly rose in his heart. The September 18th Incident, which happened suddenly and ended quickly, did not fail to greatly move him, and while the newspapers were talking about peace, Yiwan married Zhu. Their marriage was very happy, and soon Yiwan became the father of two children. The sweet family life made him forget all his hopes, and he had melted into this other environment. But soon, the sound of artillery fire at Lugouqiao resounded in the north, awakening the people of the whole country; finally, it also made our protagonist rise up in anger, and the subsequent cooperation between the KMT and the Communist Party gave Yiwan an unexpected opportunity. So, he abandoned everything and resolutely went to the motherland alone, determined to sacrifice everything and dedicate himself to the cause of saving the Chinese nation. Returning to China, he was sent by Generalissimo Chiang to the northwest corner of China, where he reunited with Enlan, his classmate, who was already an officer in the Eighth Route Army. He joined their ranks and launched guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army on the vast plains. In his work, Yiwan regained his original revolutionary ideals.

### A Death That is Not Lonely

— Liu You

Life is like a drama, it always has an end.

Countless people are born in silence, and they will die in silence!

Life and death are like one body. With life, there will be extinction. Life is like a budding flower, cherished by people. Death, however, is terrifying in the darkness, and the living do not need this rest!

But death also has a brilliant splendor, sung by people, and praised by people, it has amazing brilliance.

This is a magnificent historical drama, created for liberation, for freedom.

This death drives away monsters from the living world and builds justice for living human beings.

The honorable death is singing: "This is not an ordinary death. This is life, without darkness: these hundreds of thousands of deaths have created the light of this world!"

Death appeared in the raging fire, and that brief heroic cry awakened all the people!

Death appeared in the pool of blood, it wore a beautiful smile, scaring away all the enemies of mankind!

Death, brave death, great death!

Let us not shed tears for the dead, or regret them, let alone remain silent and mourn for them!

Sing for the dead, cheer for the dead, this spirit of willingness to die will never fade away.

This death is not lonely!

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Hmph, friendship!" She used her cleverness, and said heavily, "Friendship is temporary, hatred is eternal!"

"Then you still hate me?"

"I not only hate you, I also want to beat you to death!"

From last night to today, between him and her, there have been countless, elusive and even unimaginable changes, clarity and obscurity, hatred and friendship, joy and sorrow, as if giving them a summary of life's emotions.

He cautiously walked over, just like a sapper probing for landmines, he still tentatively asked her:

"You still want to beat me to death?"

"Of course, of course."

"Then, here you go——"

Following that, he took out the pistol from last night from his pocket and handed it to her, and he even showed her:

"Be brave."

She looked at the pistol, saw that he was holding the body of the gun, and leaving the handle for her. At this time, the pistol was waiting, lonely and empty, she closed her mouth tightly, took the pistol——her courage and pride, she immediately had a long breath, broke through her tightly closed lips, her manly spirit dissipated, just like that. The pistol was humiliated, and trembled with her hand.

He knew that a pistol in the hands of the weak often suffers humiliation. He also knew that the weak have brave words, but rarely have brave actions, especially since her hatred of him from last night had already been somewhat resolved.

A pistol in the hands of the weak is sometimes not a weapon, but a useless burden; so it was dropped by her on the ground and became a piece of abandoned waste.

Then, he picked up the pistol and handed her the handle again, intentionally, mockingly asking:

"Can't use it? I'll teach you."

She shook her shoulders and turned her head to the side, rejecting the pistol.

"Do you want the dagger you used last night? I can return it to you to use."

Her crying, which had not yet stopped, increased in volume. This meant that she still harbored a kind of resentment: but, this resentment, could neither be avenged nor tolerated, so, in the end, it could only torment herself.

"You don't hate me anymore?"

"I'm telling you, hatred is hatred." (49)
