### Total National Mobilization and Spiritual Mobilization (1)

Foreword - Achieving True Victory in the War of Resistance

China's war of resistance is a just war against aggression, a war of self-defense and liberation. Its purpose is to resist Japan's attempts to control and enslave the Chinese people, to protect the Chinese nation and state from Japanese aggression, and to strive for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation and people. China's war of resistance is being carried out with the support of the entire nation. Such a war - a just, anti-aggression, self-defense, and liberation war - will inevitably gain the support of the entire nation, and the entire nation will inevitably and should support such a war. Therefore, the question is how do we wage this war to achieve true victory in the War of Resistance.

"War is a continuation of politics." This famous historical saying should be the starting point for deciding how we will conduct this War of Resistance and how we can achieve true victory in the War of Resistance.

Ilyich once said:

"War is a continuation of politics. One should study the pre-war policies, the policies that caused the war and the policies that have already caused the war. If the policy is one of protecting the interests of financial capital, a policy of plundering and oppressing various places and other countries, then the war arising from such a policy is also a war. If, however, the policy is one of national liberation, that is, a policy expressing the liberation movement against national oppression, then the war arising from such a policy is a war of national liberation."

A nation that has been invaded, starting from its policy of national liberation, the resulting war of national liberation, it must adopt a policy of national liberation in order to achieve the true victory of the war of liberation. The policy of conducting a war of national liberation, generally speaking, is the total mobilization of the entire nation, and the total mobilization of the entire nation includes the mobilization of the entire nation's military, political, public, financial, economic, educational, and diplomatic aspects. Spiritual mobilization is also a part of this total national mobilization and is based on the total national mobilization.

The policies that should be adopted for waging war and the policies that should be adopted to ensure victory in war must be inseparable from the policies implemented by a certain country or group before the war. A country that has been invaded, a people that has been invaded, adopting a policy of opposing aggression in the long before the war, adopting a policy of seeking its own national liberation, in order to ensure the victory of this war when the war has already occurred and is underway, it must adopt a policy that is adapted to anti-aggression and seeking its own national liberation. Ilyich once said:

"War is the continuation of policy by other means. Any war is inseparably linked to the kind of political system that produces the war. A certain country, a certain class within that country, the kind of policy that it has been pursuing for a long time during the war inevitably and unavoidably this class will continue that policy during the war. Only the form of activity is changed." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 3)

Our Chinese nation, our Chinese people, the policy adopted in the long-term movement against aggression and seeking national liberation is the policy of national liberation. Now, as the national liberation war against aggression is already underway, we must implement a true policy of national liberation in order to guarantee the true victory of this war.

The "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline" recently promulgated by the Supreme National Defense Council has aroused concern and attention from all parties. This is an inevitable result, because the people of the whole country are paying attention to and concerned about the fate of their nation and the victory or defeat of China's War of Resistance at all times, because the people of the whole country are always expecting to implement a true political system of national liberation that can guarantee the victory of the War of Resistance. Our government is a government leading the War of Resistance, and none of its measures and decrees is without a direct and indirect impact on the fate of the people and the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the people of the whole country not only express concern and attention to the "National Spiritual Mobilization," but also hope that the government can take progressive and active measures and decrees to ensure the true victory of the War of Resistance.

Therefore, we would like to explain the policy of national liberation that guarantees victory in the War of Resistance - the total mobilization of the entire nation, to explain the relationship between "spiritual mobilization" and total national mobilization, and to explain the content and significance of "spiritual mobilization," which is particularly necessary.

(1) The Relationship Between Total National Mobilization and "Spiritual Mobilization"

China's War of Resistance is a war of national liberation waged by an invaded nation, that is, a revolutionary war. The key to victory in the war of national liberation and the revolutionary war lies in:

"... revolutionary war, when it truly attracts and moves the oppressed laboring masses, when it makes the oppressed laboring masses realize that they are against the exploiters, this revolutionary war will arouse supernatural perseverance and ability." (Ilyich)

It is obvious that the Chinese anti-Japanese national liberation war, in order to defeat Japanese , it is necessary to have this condition, it is necessary to have this condition. This condition is the most reliable guarantee for the true victory of the War of Resistance. To enable this condition to be realized is the total mobilization of the entire nation.

As early as two years before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Chinese proposed the call for "total mobilization of the entire nation" in the "August 1st Declaration," and under this call for total mobilization, specifically put forward the slogans "those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength," "those who have guns contribute guns," "those who have knowledge contribute knowledge," etc., which are becoming the guiding principles for mobilizing the people to participate in the War of Resistance today.

When the War of Resistance broke out, the Chinese again proposed in the declaration against the Japanese invasion of North China: "Implement the total mobilization of the Chinese people." Shortly after the outbreak of the War of Resistance (August 1937), it was proposed in the "Outline for Striving for Victory in the War of Resistance": "Total military mobilization" and "Total mobilization of the entire nation." After the fall of Nanjing, in a declaration on the current situation, it was again proposed: "Mobilize the military, manpower, intelligence, financial resources, and material resources of the entire China to continue the long-term war of defending the territory."

The Chinese has always believed that the guarantee of victory in China's War of Resistance must be the total mobilization of the entire nation. Spiritual mobilization, or political mobilization, is a part of the total national mobilization. It must be coordinated with the total national mobilization, then spiritual mobilization can play its due role in the War of Resistance, as stated in the "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline":

Now war is a war of total national mobilization, so not only should all the materials and manpower in the country be mobilized, but also the spirit of the people of the whole country must be mobilized. To mobilize the spirit of the people of the whole country to enrich the national strength of the War of Resistance, it is not in the mobilization, but especially in the organization. Organized spirit, combined with organized manpower, utilizing organized material resources, is sufficient to meet the current needs of the country.

Therefore, spiritual mobilization must be based on the total mobilization of the people, the mobilization of materials, and the mobilization of manpower. Therefore, spiritual mobilization must aim at exerting the power of organization.

Helping the Total Mobilization of the People

Spiritual mobilization occupies a very important role in the War of Resistance, and it is of great significance for adhering to the protracted war, adhering to the united front, and striving for final victory. Therefore, the Chinese, in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session, stated that the first urgent task of the entire Chinese nation is: "Highly promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, resolutely resist the war to the end, and overcome pessimism and despair - only for surrender and compromise." Before the War of Resistance, the Chinese estimated the important role of national spirit in launching the sacred anti-Japanese war, and has always opposed national defeatism and national pessimism, and opposed the "fear of Japan disease" that loses national self-confidence and self-esteem. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it has repeatedly pointed out the need to improve the national spirit, improve national self-esteem and self-confidence, stimulate every Chinese person's hatred for the nation, advocate the spirit of sacrifice for the country and the nation, advocate the spirit of sincere unity, advocate the spirit of democratic cooperation, the revolutionary spirit of serving the nation loyally, and the spirit of striving for the thorough realization of the Three People's Principles for the founding of the country through the War of Resistance and for the final victory of the War of Resistance.

In the current stage of the War of Resistance, because of the betrayal of the traitors, the open surrender to Japan, planning to bomb Chinese cities for Japan, planning to attack China, and acting as Japan's running dogs. Because some frustrated politicians, officials, warlords openly acted as Japan's puppets, betrayed the Chinese nation, lost national integrity, and corrupted national morals: because some compromisers and surrenderers lost confidence in the War of Resistance, and openly or secretly undermined China's war effort and undermined the cause of unity and unification, they wanted to sacrifice the interests of the nation to surrender to Japan. Due to all these circumstances, it is really very necessary to intensify spiritual mobilization at present, to crush all the actions of traitors, puppets, etc., and to expose all ideas of compromise and peace through spiritual mobilization.

In the current War of Resistance, due to the intensification of the political disintegration plot by people, and because people's "quick war and quick decision" strategy has been broken, and the "quick peace and quick knot" conspiracy has repeatedly failed, people will inevitably take more political conspiracies to provoke the unity of our nation, disintegrate the unity of our nation, and shake our determination and confidence in victory in the War of Resistance, in order to achieve the poisonous plan of subjugating our nation and destroying our nation. As the outline clearly states: "Today, the people know that military strength is not enough to subjugate us and achieve their purpose of quick decision, so their recent plan is to shake our will and threaten our spirit in various ways."

There is no doubt that people are using various political conspiracies to undermine our country's War of Resistance, and there is no need to prove it.

The question that arises here is whether there are fundamental principles and methods of difference in the total national mobilization of the invading country and the invaded country? Yes, and there certainly will be, because there is a difference in the fundamental principles and the fundamental nature between the war of aggression and the war against aggression.

Because the war waged by aggressors is unjust and aggressive. Its purpose is for the benefit of financial capital. Its purpose is to invade and enslave other countries and other nations. At the same time, it is also to deepen and prolong the enslavement and oppression of the people within its own country. Therefore, such a war is bound to be resisted by the people at home and will not receive the sympathy of the people at home. In order to oppress and coerce the people at home to wage a war for the benefit of financial capital, aggressors must implement an extremely anti- policy at home to carry out total national mobilization.

From the "Japanese National General Mobilization Law" and "Spiritual Mobilization" implemented by the Japanese in the war of aggression against China, it can be fully seen that the implementation of the Japanese General Mobilization Law is to squeeze the last drop of blood and sweat from Japanese workers and peasants and the laboring masses. Under the "gathering of national defense workers," military labor service is implemented on Japanese workers. Under the "National Mobilization Law," farmers' horses, rice, wheat, forage, etc. are plundered, large numbers of people are drafted, taxes are forcibly increased, paper money is issued indiscriminately, and public bonds are forcibly apportioned. Under the "Spiritual Mobilization," a large number of Japanese professors, students, freelancers, and cultural figures are arrested, and a large-scale massacre and suppression of Japanese anti-war groups and anti-war figures is carried out, and a large number of social science books and all books containing opposition to war are searched and burned, and all speech organs that sympathize with China and are dissatisfied with the war are closed down. "Japan's National Mobilization Law" and "Spiritual Mobilization" are carried out under the whip, bayonet, massacre, prison, arrest, and closure. The mobilization of Japanese fascist aggressors has not only aroused strong resistance from Japanese workers, farmers, laborers, and freelancers, but has also aroused resistance from small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and part of the liberal bourgeoisie. The whips, bayonets, massacres, prisons, arrests, and closures of Japanese fascist aggressors cannot make Japan's total national mobilization go smoothly, cannot prevent the increase of the Japanese people's anti-war movement, and cannot prevent the Japanese people's movement against the "Mobilization Law." The reason why Japanese fascist warlords want to adopt this method to implement total national mobilization is determined by the nature of its war of aggression.

China's War of Resistance is a just, anti-aggression, national liberation war. Its purpose is for the benefit of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people. Its purpose is to protect its own nation and its own people. Its purpose is to resist the aggression of Japanese fascism and resist the enslavement of the Chinese people by Japanese fascism. Therefore, this kind of war will inevitably gain the unanimous support of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization that we want to implement must be in line with the policy of national liberation.

We want to implement total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization on the basis of the unanimous support and participation of the people of the whole country in the War of Resistance, so as to further promote and help the people exert more strength to contribute to the country and the nation, in order to obtain the victory of the entire War of Resistance. The interests of the War of Resistance are in line with the interests of the entire nation and the people, and the interests of the War of Resistance are the highest interests of the entire nation and the people at present. Therefore, the total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization carried out in our China are absolutely not and will not be carried out under the whip, bayonet, massacre, prison, arrest, and closure like Japan, but are completely opposite to the methods carried out by Japan. The method of carrying out total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization in our country is that under the leadership of the government and with the help of the government, the people of the whole country voluntarily participate, and actively participate, just as the "Mobilization Implementation" method in the outline says: "The implementation of spiritual mobilization is mostly conducive to the self-consciousness of the conscience of every citizen. Mutual encouragement and inspiration are the means to help their self-consciousness. As for the determination of laws and disciplines, it should only be used to assist the deficiencies of enlightenment and encouragement, so the main work is to focus on the suitability of advocacy and propaganda education." This principle based on self-consciousness and voluntariness, enlightenment and encouragement, advocacy and propaganda is the basic principle and method for our country to carry out total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization. This principle and method of mobilization is only possible in a just war, and a just war must adopt this principle and method of mobilization.

From this point of view, because the nature of the war is completely different, the total national mobilization, including spiritual mobilization, in principle and method are fundamentally different. Ignoring this difference is equivalent to ignoring that China's War of Resistance is a war of liberation and a war of revolution, and is equivalent to ignoring the difference between a just war and an unjust war.

Some people suggest that the spiritual total mobilization we are carrying out should refer to the spiritual total mobilization carried out by people. These achievements are due to sticking to the preconceived notion of imitating others in everything, or due to not understanding that the anti-Japanese war carried out in China has a fundamental difference from Japan's war of aggression, but in any case, the total national mobilization we are carrying out does not need to refer to the total national mobilization carried out by Japanese fascists under the whip, bayonet, massacre, prison arrest, and closure, which is beyond doubt. We will carry out total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization in accordance with the policy of national liberation, which will certainly achieve smooth progress, achieve certain results, and achieve the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance.

2. The Significance and Content of Spiritual Mobilization

After explaining the importance of spiritual mobilization in the current War of Resistance, after explaining the relationship between total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization, after explaining the role of total national mobilization in guaranteeing victory in the War of Resistance, after explaining the fundamental differences in principles and methods between total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization due to the different nature of the war, it can be seen that the significance of spiritual mobilization lies in concentrating the various different wills and thoughts of the people of the whole country on a common goal - the cause of the War of Resistance and national construction, which lies in uniting all levels of classes, all parties, all occupations, all nationalities, etc., and complementing different ideas to oppose a common enemy - Japanese . The introduction to the outline points out:

"The so-called national spiritual mobilization, from its literal meaning, is to concentrate all personal consciousness, thinking, wisdom, and spiritual power on one direction and improve its use, and for the entire nation, it is to concentrate the spiritual power of the people of different ages, occupations, thoughts, and lives on a common goal and jointly encourage them to increase it, organize and regulate it to exert it, and determine the center of organization to enhance the efficiency of its exertion."

From this, it can be seen that the significance of spiritual mobilization lies in uniting together, regardless of party affiliation, class, occupation, belief, age, gender, nationality, etc., and concentrating the various different thoughts of these different groups of people on one direction - opposing Japanese , on a common goal - the War of Resistance and national construction, "and improving its use," "and jointly encouraging it to increase it."

Now let's explain the content of spiritual mobilization in the War of Resistance. The "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline" announced by the Supreme National Defense Council has a general description. This outline lists "common goals," "morality of saving the country," "faith of building the country," "spiritual reform," "mobilization leadership," "mobilization implementation," and other items. Among the common goals are: "(1) National supremacy and national supremacy. (2) Military first and victory first. (3) Concentration of will and concentration of strength."

In an unprecedented sacred war of national liberation, in an invaded country, in a semi-colonial China, national thought and national concept have revolutionary significance for national independence and liberation, especially in our country, some people are confined to personal interests, and even have no concept of national state at all. They often go to the road of being traitors and sellouts for the people. Therefore, it is very necessary to highly promote the national spirit and highly promote the patriotic spirit. Only this is the true meaning of "national supremacy and national supremacy." Without a high degree of national spirit and patriotic spirit, it is impossible to carry out a long-term and victorious war of national liberation. Without national thought, there will be no national liberation movement. Moreover, the War of Resistance we are waging is against a powerful Japanese . To defeat this most oriental aggressor, everything must be for the front line and everything must be for victory, which is the true meaning of "military first and victory first." Similarly, we must be able to win victory in the War of Resistance in the long-term War of Resistance, we must concentrate all our will and mobilize all our strength to strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance, which is the true meaning of "concentration of will and concentration of strength."

Under this common goal, carrying out the spiritual mobilization of the whole country is a method of strengthening the mobilization of the strength of the War of Resistance. Hold on to the determination to resist the war to the end, adhere to the confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, highly promote the national spirit and patriotic spirit, improve the nation's self-esteem and self-confidence, contribute their strength to the strength of the country, everything for the front line, everything for victory, for the improvement of politics, for the development of the mass movement, for the establishment of wartime life, concentrate all will, mobilize all strength to strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance, the absolute integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation, and the establishment of the Three People's Principles of a new China.

In order to grasp the central content and make a correct understanding of the "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline," to deeply understand the masses, and to make this movement easier to carry out, I would like to generalize the content described in this outline as follows:

(1), Determination to adhere to the War of Resistance;

(2), Confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance;

(3), National self-confidence and self-esteem;

(4), Improvement of politics;

(5), Development of the mass movement;

(6), Establishment of wartime life.

(1) As far as the determination to adhere to the War of Resistance is concerned, it is a center of our spiritual mobilization, because the purpose of national spiritual mobilization is to achieve the determination to adhere to the War of Resistance to the end. Some against the war, surrender and compromise, they fundamentally have no determination to adhere to the War of Resistance. They have opposed the War of Resistance from the first day of the War of Resistance, or they have wavered about the War of Resistance. Such as the national traitor, from the beginning of the War of Resistance, there was no decision on the War of Resistance, and whenever the War of Resistance encountered difficulties, he openly advocated surrender, and finally openly betrayed the Chinese nation and surrendered to Japan. Some who wavered about the War of Resistance constantly expressed opposition and doubt about the national policy of adhering to the War of Resistance, and wanted to take various methods to move towards the road of peaceful compromise. As the outline says: "The establishment of national spirit must be persistent and unswerving. If it is swayed by external oppression and temptation, then this spirit is still insufficient to complete an extraordinary cause." Firmly establishing the determination of the people of the whole country to resist the war is an important task of spiritual mobilization. How can we achieve the determination to firmly resist the war? The central point here is to be able to explain the situation of the War of Resistance universally and deeply, and the center of the explanation is to have a "Japan is our person" in everyone's mind, which is to promote the spirit of "having without me" and "irreconcilable hatred," so that the people of the whole country understand that until Japan is eliminated, our responsibility for the War of Resistance will not be fulfilled, and our determination to resist the war cannot be abandoned for a day.

(2) As far as confidence in the War of Resistance is concerned, this is a necessary condition for strengthening the determination to resist the war. If the War of Resistance has no future, if the War of Resistance has no prospect of victory, then it is naturally difficult to adhere to the determination to resist the war. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must make detailed and concrete explanations of the conditions and prospects for China's War of Resistance to achieve victory, which is what the outline says: "To seek victory in the first place and victory in the first place," "The sole purpose of the military is to seek victory, then the people must establish a belief in certain victory to achieve the purpose of final victory." "The purpose of our War of Resistance is to achieve the victory of the War of Resistance. With confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, the determination to adhere to the War of Resistance will be more consolidated. (To be continued)

### × Plane Indiscriminate Bombing of Chongqing Incident

On May 3rd and 4th, × planes indiscriminately bombed Chongqing, causing an unprecedented tragedy in human history. Gazing from afar in Xindu, thousands of our compatriots suffered the misfortune of being smashed to pieces, and tens of thousands of compatriots suddenly endured the pain of losing their families and fortunes. Truly, one knows not where to turn for tears! Moreover, foreign embassies, consulates, and friendly nations' people also suffered unwarranted disasters. For us, this evokes particularly unbearable feelings! Nevertheless, regarding this unprecedented catastrophe in Chongqing, it is necessary to make further observations.

The reckless bombing of Chongqing, our wartime capital, by the × people this time is by no means a simple military act, but contains a rather significant political conspiracy. The purpose of this × act by the Japanese × is firstly to use it to flaunt that the Japanese army still has the power to continue attacking and destroying everything, and attempt to ××

×× to make the British side underestimate our country's resistance and value the Japanese ×'s power of threat, change their aid-China policy, mediate the war of resistance against Japan, and pressure our country to yield. The second is to use this × act to threaten and subdue our government and people, to embark on the road of 'anti-communism' and 'peace talks' for those × and others who surrender and betray the country, and to embark on the road of subjugation and national destruction through 'peace' and 'mediation'. Therefore, if our resistance war does not stop for a day, if China does not perish for a day, then this kind of × act by the Japanese × will certainly continue and intensify day by day. The crazy bombing of Chongqing is only the beginning; the successive tragic bombings of Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Chaozhou are also due to the same reason. In the future, the Japanese × may have even more ×× and ×× acts. As the Japanese Navy Ministry spokesman said on the 6th, "Japanese planes have attacked Chongqing and other strongholds three times and will continue to do so and will intensify" (Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 7th).

However, every Chinese who is unwilling to be a slave has already recognized clearly, and every international person of insight has also recognized clearly that the Japanese ××ist invasion of China has suffered twenty-two months of strong resistance and has begun to enter a state of major difficulty. Now the Japanese invasion of China 'enterprise', whether military speculation, adventure, or political 'anti-communism', 'peace' and 'mediation', has been attacked by the Chinese government, army and all the people. The power of this attack is still increasing day by day. Along with the strengthening of this anti-Japanese force, the internal crisis of the Japanese invaders, especially within the army, is becoming increasingly serious, and the international position of the Japanese invaders is becoming increasingly isolated and precarious. Under this new situation, the Japanese invasion of China 'enterprise' can only enter a disastrous defeat and lead to eternal ruin, which is a fact that can be known without divination. In order to save this doom, the Japanese × people stop at nothing and take more ×× means. Therefore, the tragic bombing of Chongqing and other places cannot be taken as evidence that the Japanese military power has not suffered a greater blow, and even less as evidence that the Japanese military power can still boast, as it did in the first phase of the war, of 'advancing straight in and being invincible everywhere'. On the contrary, it proves the Japanese ×'s desperation! Every one of our compatriots who is unwilling to be a subjugated slave will not only not be worried and fearful, but will instead increase their hatred for the Japanese × and increase their confidence in winning the war. We believe that people of friendly nations will also have this kind of understanding and will strengthen their determination to aid China and restrain Japan.

What we still want to particularly point out here to overseas Chinese readers and leaders from all walks of life is: First, this kind of × act by the Japanese × will have more ×× and ×× and ×× performances, along with the gradual completion of the military stalemate and with the gradual aggravation of the military and political difficulties of the Japanese × invasion of China! Therefore, on the one hand, we must step up the relief work in Chongqing and other places, and on the other hand, we must step up all preventive work. Regarding the former, we should immediately carry out condolence and fundraising relief work, etc. The condolence work must be enthusiastic and widespread, and the fundraising work must be conscientious and effective, and be handled publicly by the national bank and accounting institutions. Regarding the latter, we should step up the mobilization of young people and experts to return to the country to serve, strengthen the front-line forces, and strengthen rear defense; we should especially step up the donation movement, enhance our country's air defense and anti-poison tools, and cultivate a large number of air defense and anti-poison talents. Second, this kind of × act by the × people, especially the tragic disaster suffered by the embassies and consulates of various friendly nations in Chongqing this time, is a fact, and cannot be concealed by any defense from the × people. This kind of × act is not only a threat to the Chinese people and international people, but also a threat and insult to all righteous mankind! Therefore, we must collect concrete materials, especially the tragic situation of the bombing of our Chinese people and foreigners' properties, expand international publicity work, and strive for greater international sympathy and assistance.

Finally, we respectfully express our boundless sympathy and boundless respect to the compatriots in Chongqing and other places who were bombed, to the people of friendly nations, and to the various newspapers such as Ta Kung Pao, New China News, New Sichuan, and Sichuan! We firmly believe that your sacrifice and pain today have a huge price, and that all the people of our country, all overseas Chinese, and all righteous people in the world will be your most loyal and enthusiastic supporters!

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 7th] Anze and Fushan are still under siege by our forces. In order to reduce the threat to their flanks, the × regiment mobilized more than a thousand × puppet troops from Hongdong starting on the 30th of last month and raided the central and eastern areas of Anfu. One route, about 500 people with five cannons, approached Dongxiang Village from Gutou and encountered our ambush. After six hours of fierce fighting, more than 100 were killed or wounded. Another route, more than 200 people with two cannons, fled from Quting Town (southeast of Hongdong) to Guluo (east of Quting). After being intercepted by us, they retreated to Shijiatan Lijiahuan (one li southeast of Gu*). Another route invaded Dahongyuan from Zuocun for more than a day. On the morning of the 1st, they were ambushed by us and retreated to Rijia Gou (ten li west of Gu*), and then joined the × of Guluo. On the 2nd, they invaded and occupied Gu County Town (east of Hongdong). Currently, there are more than a thousand × stacked in Gu County Town, seemingly continuing to attack eastward.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 7th] In the mountainous area northwest of Hejin, there have been repeated fierce battles since the beginning of last month. On the 28th of last month, more than 100 × were killed or wounded near the 80th Pass (northwest of Guzhen). On the evening of the 29th, a group of × fled to Donggou inside Sheli (north of Gutie 4), where they were surrounded and annihilated by us, killing 48. The battle was especially fierce in the east, with × vying for the high ground and fighting fiercely all day. The × suffered more than 200 casualties. More than 100 × at Xi Ai Kou (north of Hejin) attacked our positions at noon on the 2nd, but were bravely repelled by us. The × who attacked north of Xinjiang and Jishan a few days ago were defeated by us in the Guanzhuang Bei Dong area, with 150 casualties, all transported back to the city in large carts and mules. According to reports, Lieutenant Colonel Fukuda, the commander, was wounded and died immediately after being transported to Xinjiang.

[Min Ge Agency, Xingji, 7th] According to reliable information from the front, General Sugiyama, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army stationed in North China, has moved to Baoding in view of the repeated failures in the Shanxi war. Shinozuka, the commander of the 10th Division, is also directing operations in Shijiazhuang.

[Min Ge Agency, Wuyuan, 7th] On the 19th of last month, six planes suddenly bombed Liang He Fan Town south of us, killing or wounding more than 70 merchants and residents, and scattering the Ta Kung Pao and Xinhua News, which called for anti-Party, anti-Communist, and peaceful coexistence. Afterwards, the advisor of Tuoketuo County said that it was our planes that carried and scattered them, and that they were trying to lure our people by giving each person 50 yuan to console the people killed or injured by the × planes. After investigation by our ×, the fragments in the bombs had the words "Showa 12 Osaka". The scattered newspapers were also small 16-page newspapers, the content of which was purely in the tone of the × people, showing the position of the × puppet. It was obviously forged by the × people, intending to alienate our people's hearts. Moreover, the Japanese planes flew very high at that time, and some people found that the wings still had the red sun type, and the fuselage was gray, which fully proves the desperation of the Japanese ×. We express our admiration and congratulations for the victory of our anti-Japanese war.

### Dozens of British Members of Parliament Telegraph General Chiang to Express Admiration and Congratulations on the Victory of Our Anti-Japanese War.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] Four members of the House of Lords and 32 members of the House of Commons recently jointly telegraphed Chinese General Chiang today, expressing their admiration. The telegram stated briefly, "The Chinese people's army is united in mind and action in fighting to maintain national independence, and has recently taken the offensive and won repeated victories. We hereby telegraph our congratulations on China's resistance war, which has greatly benefited the world's anti-aggression struggle and Europe's efforts to maintain peace. The British nation is filled with admiration. We firmly believe that any peace treaty that can be established by democratic countries should include China."

Members of the House of Commons include Sir Weigwood Kirkley Pers and other important figures in the Labour Party.

### Chinese Newspapers in Shanghai Not Subject to Censorship. Suspension of Publishing Some News During Government Negotiations.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 6th] Editors of various Chinese newspapers in Shanghai have decided that for any news that is easily censored, rather than submitting it to the Shanghai Municipal Council in the concession to seek permission to publish it, they would rather voluntarily suspend the publication of such news temporarily. They have also submitted a request to the government to lodge a protest with the British and American sides.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] A Shanghai dispatch states that the Shanghai Evening Post editorial commented that, from a legal point of view, it is questionable whether the police station has the right to inspect foreign publications or the right to publish and sell them. Furthermore, even if there is a major provocative incident, it should be resolved in accordance with the laws of various countries. According to American law, even if this incident occurs, there is no reason to be punished in fact. From other aspects, we should also have great sympathy for the difficulties currently encountered by foreigners in the two concessions in Shanghai. However, if the Municipal Council authorities interfere with the appropriate publication of news and fair commentary on speeches, we will regard this improper restriction as serious and consider resisting. In other words, we would rather stop publishing in Chinese. The English Shanghai Evening Post and the Chinese Shanghai Evening Post will not be censored.

### American Nationals Witness × Planes Bombing Chongqing and Refute Japanese Side's Unreasonable Sophistry. British and American Embassies and Consulates Far from Military Zones Have No Reason to Be Bombed. Japanese Spokesperson Uses Alarming Words to Shirk Responsibility and Attempt to Cover Up Mistakes.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 7th] The Navy Ministry spokesman here stated yesterday that the Japanese side will continue to intensify the indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing and other Chinese military locations until the National Government collapses. Regarding the bombing of the British Consulate, the Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai stated that, according to the Domei News Agency, Japanese planes saw about 50 anti-aircraft guns located near the British, French, and German consulates, with dense artillery fire, so bombing was necessary. But they added that it was inevitable to accidentally drop bombs during bombing.

[Local News] According to the English-language "Sunday Post," American Chaffers, a sales representative at the Hong Kong office of Pan American Airlines, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Chongqing on a Meiya aircraft. Before leaving Chongqing, he witnessed the bombing by × planes and strongly refuted the × side's sophistry. According to him, the British and American consulates are located in the residential area on the opposite bank of the city center of Chongqing. The residents of this residential area are mostly foreigners. There are very few Chinese residences near the two consulates, and there are absolutely no offices of Chinese military and political authorities. The French Consulate office is on the opposite bank of the British and American Consulates and is closely linked with the Chinese government office.

Embassies and Consulates of Various Countries.

There is absolutely no reason for the bombing of and near the British Consulate. According to reports, many bullets hit the area of foreign embassies and consulates in Chongqing, killing 25 Chinese and wounding 50. Mr. John Teou Diaon, the private secretary of the British Ambassador to China, was also injured while participating in the emergency rescue of the dead and wounded. According to Chaffers, he observed from the roof of the Pan American Airlines office in Chongqing that the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery equipment was very sparse. He had never heard the sound of anti-aircraft artillery, only machine guns set up in high places firing at the × planes. As for protection, the machine guns were useless. They fired a row of machine gun bullets every five minutes, but they were far from the target. The altitude of the × planes was 8,000 feet. From his professional point of view, he said that the × planes had absolutely no reason to bomb near the British and American consulates, because there were no military targets nearby, nor were there any anti-aircraft machine guns firing nearby. The streets of Chongqing are winding and narrow, and the houses are close together. Although residents have been evacuated one after another, thousands of poor people still have to stay there and do not want to leave unless they have to. Therefore, many of them also died in this attack by × planes. As for the number of deaths and injuries, he said he really did not know.

Number of Deaths and Injuries

According to the information he obtained, the number of deaths on the first day of the bombing was at least 3,000, and on the second day it was 7,000, with a total of 10,000 deaths in two days. However, this information may be exaggerated (according to yesterday's news from Chongqing, the number of deaths and injuries was between 7,000 and 8,000). In addition, there were countless people who were injured, crushed, or burned. As of the day he left Chongqing, no foreigners had been killed. The Pan American Airlines staff of three men and one woman were all safe and sound. He believed that in the short term, the number of foreigners in Chongqing would be reduced to the lowest limit, and those who could afford to leave were all preparing to leave the country. He did not know the exact number of attacks by × planes in the past two days. According to what he saw, there were 20 on the first day and 18 on the second day. There were also 20 Chinese Air Force planes that took off to respond. When the third attack came, he took the opportunity to fly to Hong Kong. The staff of the Pan American Airlines office in Chongqing will leave Chongqing in the short term. It is understood that the company is the representative in China of the American Curtiss-Wright Airplane Company and the Wah Chang Trading Corporation. The military products of both factories are world-renowned.

### More Barbaric Than Two Centuries Ago. New York Times Commentary Condemns the Brutal Acts of the × Army.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch, according to a telegram from New York on the 5th, the Democratic New York Times commented on the repeated bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes, saying that the military actions of the time of Genghis Khan have now reappeared. The only difference is that the battlefield has changed from the ground to the sky. This kind of combat method is not only seen in the Sino-Japanese War, but is almost the same in all modern wars. In comparison with two centuries ago, it is certainly more barbaric, but in comparison with a thousand years ago, it may not be more civilized, and in comparison with the combat methods of barbarian nations, it cannot be said that the level of civilization is superior to theirs.

### American Flight Instructor Crashes in Chongqing While Evading × Bombers.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 10th] It was learned here today that American pilot Mr. Wiegel of the International Bombing Squadron died in an accident here on Thursday night. After the International Bombing Squadron disbanded, Mr. Wiegel remained alone in the Chinese team. On Thursday night, upon hearing that Japanese planes were attacking Chongqing, Mr. Wiegel immediately took off in a trainer plane. When he made a small turn, the plane malfunctioned and crashed, and Mr. Wiegel died on the spot.

### Japan Lacks Steel, Shipbuilding Plans are Obstructed.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The US Department of Commerce issued a telegram from the Vice Consul in Kobe stating that Japan's shipbuilding plans have been hindered due to a lack of steel and other metals. The Japanese government is now planning to nationalize a certain iron mine, which shows the Japanese government's concern about this issue. It is said that Japan needs 7.5 million tons of raw materials this year, but the country only produces 2.6 million tons.

### Li Xiaqing Slightly Injured While Flying in the United States.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] A special dispatch from Washington on the 6th states that Chinese female aviator Li Xiaqing was slightly injured while flying today and will recover within days.

### Spokesman for the Tianjin × Army Threatens Concession Authorities.

[Haitong Agency, Beiping, 7th] Yesterday, on Saturday, the spokesman for the Japanese military authorities stationed in Tianjin lodged a serious protest with the British and French concession authorities, saying that the concessions have failed to make efforts to suppress anti-Japanese and Communist elements, causing frequent disturbances in the consular districts, concessions, and foreign military garrisons in Tianjin and Beiping. If the concession authorities continue to harbor anti-Japanese organizations, the Japanese army will have no choice but to take appropriate steps to defend itself and maintain peace and order. If such things happen, the concession authorities should bear full responsibility.

### Foreign Ministry Sends Personnel to Console Embassies and Consulates in Chongqing After Bombing. British Diplomatic Personnel Helped Us Rescue the Wounded When × Planes Rampaged on the 4th.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 7th] The details of the tragic bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes on Thursday were sent in a telegram by Reuters' correspondent in Chongqing that evening, but it was only received today. The telegram confirmed that the British Ambassador was not in the British Consulate at the time of the bombing, but at the Foreign Ministry residence west of the consulate. It was not until night that the British Ambassador returned to the British Consulate to survey the damage. At the time of the bombing, acting Chinese Counselor Peng Boting, First Secretary Greenway, and Consul General Du Lou and his wife were all in the Consulate and witnessed everything. Two bombs hit the building where the British diplomatic corps resided, but the bombs slid from the roof to the ground before exploding. All the glass windows were shattered immediately. The house where Du Lou and his wife lived was hit by four bombs and completely exploded, causing considerable damage, but Du Lou and his wife were both unharmed. Diplomatic corps and consulate officials used dim lights to try their best to rescue the injured Chinese. Duan Maolan, secretary of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited the embassies and consulates of various countries today to express condolences on behalf of the Chinese government.

### Battle for Gao'an

— Fan Shizhi (Part Two)

A Unique Color in the Second Phase of the War of Resistance

× After suffering setbacks in its fierce attack on Zhanggu'nao, it shifted its main force to attack Gaoyou City, ten li southeast, while using a part of its force to attack Yunhua Mountain, twelve li northwest of Xiangfu Temple. Gaoyou City was breached by × at 2:20 PM. In the Lianhua Mountain area, × engaged in hand-to-hand combat with us, throwing hand grenades at each other, and its casualties were more than double ours. ×, out of shame and anger, also released tear gas and suffocating poisonous gas, poisoning more than 150 officers and soldiers. Battalion Commander Li Shi, realizing the lack of gas masks, took advantage of ×'s attack stalling and launched a counterattack. As a result, although we suffered more than 350 casualties, including Battalion Commander Li being seriously wounded, ×'s casualties exceeded 500, and we finally repelled them.

From 3:00 AM on the 31st, × repeatedly attacked the Xiangfu Temple area but was repelled each time. At noon, × infantry of over a thousand, with four cannons, launched another fierce attack on Yunhua Mountain, occasionally releasing poisonous gas. After fierce fighting until 9:00 PM, all the officers of one of our companies were killed in action, but the soldiers still held their ground, repelling ×. This kind of calm and resolute fighting spirit is truly a unique color in the history of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance.

Squad Leader Ren Refuses to Retreat Until Death

On the same day at 6:00 PM, × simultaneously released large amounts of poisonous gas at Dongtang, three li east of Xiangfu Temple, and Liubu Mountain, three li north of Lianhua Mountain. Many of our officers and soldiers were poisoned. × then launched a large-scale attack. Our troops braved the poison to meet them. At the closest range, they concentrated the firepower of light and heavy machine guns, sweeping back and forth, killing over a hundred × soldiers. × finally retreated, but we also lost two company commanders, including Liu Mingxi, and one company commander, Zeng Xianting, was wounded. Fourteen platoon leaders were killed in action and thirteen were wounded, and 384 soldiers were killed or wounded.

After failing to capture Lianhua Mountain and Xiangfu Temple, × increased its forces by over a thousand and, at 10:00 PM on the 31st, taking advantage of the moonlight, shifted its full force to the area between Xiangfu Temple and Lianhua Mountain, launching a fierce attack along the ancient road towards our Yangjiafang position, four li northwest of Xiangfu Temple. They concentrated artillery fire, released poisonous gas, and used seventy to eighty tanks to approach our position along the ancient road, concentrating their fire. The officers and soldiers of Li Lin'yun, who were defending the area, suffered heavy casualties, leaving only seven men, and the company commander was also killed in action. × then occupied the high ground west of Yangjiafang. At this time, Staff Sergeant Squad Leader Ren Jun'an, who was defending the opposite mountain, still led six soldiers to hold the position without retreating, while sending troops to report and firing. As a result, even after breaking through our position, × was still unable to sweep left and right. Later, ××× Brigade Commander received the report and personally led a reserve team to counterattack, fighting fiercely throughout the night, and × was unable to advance further.

At dawn on April 1st, × continued to implement its sweeping plan, attempting to expand its gains. × Brigade Commander again personally led his troops, fearlessly charging into the front lines, bravely sweeping through the enemy. × suffered over a thousand casualties, and we also suffered heavy losses. Suddenly, a dumdum bullet was fired from ×'s position, seriously wounding × Brigade Commander in the leg. × managed to break through with another seven to eight hundred men, accompanied by seventy to eighty tanks. Fortunately, the other positions had not been shaken, and only Yangjiafang was in a state of melee. One side was able to reinforce its troops and drive out the × soldiers who had broken through, while the other side ordered ××'s troops to deploy a second line of defense.

×'s advance was greatly delayed due to our pincer attacks from both flanks and the frontal melee. After a long and arduous battle until evening, it was finally difficult to block them. Especially in northeastern Gao'an, the earth mounds were visible to each other, with continuous and sloping ravines, making them easy to climb. Tanks could move everywhere. In order to avoid a decisive battle with the communists, we retreated to the area five li west of Gao'an City on the 2nd according to the established plan. × did not gradually enter the city until the morning of the 3rd.

From the 4th, although × repeatedly harassed westward, they were repelled with losses. On the 6th, we took advantage of the transfer of a part of ×'s forces and launched a sudden counterattack. On the morning of the 7th, we pressed on to the outskirts of Gao'an City. × tightly closed the southwest and north gates, leaving the east gate half-open. Residents and travelers could only use the north gate.

Why ×'s Casualties Were More Than Double Ours

This battle lasted a total of eight days. × suffered over three thousand casualties, while our casualties were only over three hundred. There are reasons why ×'s casualties were more than double ours.

(1) × attacked while we defended, and the casualties of the attacker are often greater than those of the defender.

(2) The × 106th Division suffered a disastrous defeat in De'an last October. Although it had been reorganized for four months, its combat effectiveness was far weaker than last year. Even its use of light and heavy machine guns was mostly continuous firing, lacking knowledge of intermittent firing, proving that its training was still lacking.

(3) ×'s artillery was mostly used to capture Nanchang. Only twelve cannons were used in the Gao'an area. Due to continuous cloudy and rainy weather, the aircraft's ability to operate was limited, so it had to rely on large amounts of poisonous gas, releasing it more than twenty times in succession. However, the victory or defeat of poison gas warfare is not decisive. On the contrary, it increases the morale of our soldiers against the enemy.

(4) The high morale and strong fighting spirit of our troops, their calm and brave combat, are truly admirable and praiseworthy. For example, Liu Daming, the deputy regimental commander, bravely charged with his troops and continued to serve while wounded; Platoon Leader Liu Chaochang took the lead and commanded calmly; Staff Sergeant Platoon Attaché Li Jun of the communications company carried out the telephone switchboard even when surrounded by ×; Staff Sergeant Squad Leader Wei Shijie led his soldiers to recapture the lost high ground during the battle of Xiangfu Temple, allowing the position to turn from danger to safety; Staff Sergeant Squad Leader Yu Junming firmly held his position for two days and nights even when surrounded by ×'s artillery and poisonous gas and suffering heavy casualties; Private Liu Yonghai took command of the entire squad and firmly held the position without retreating after the squad leader was wounded and the fortifications were completely destroyed; Lieutenant Platoon Leader Pang Songshan firmly held his stronghold and calmly responded to changes, stabilizing the situation after the company commander was killed in action. These heroic deeds are the biggest reason for the massive elimination of ×× in this battle, and also the biggest guarantee for winning the final victory.

××'s westward advance after occupying Nanchang only reached Gao'an. This may be ××'s strategic decision, but its failure to expand its gains and continue westward is also due to the unexpectedly large setback suffered by the ×× army in the Battle of Gao'an. (Note: Gao'an was recaptured on April 23rd. This letter was sent out five days later, so it does not mention it.) April 28, 18th year. (End)

### Financial Center Shifts Inward, Banking Industry Flourishes in Southwest, Cooperation Among Provinces Gradually on Track, Using Idle Funds to Develop the Interior

[Shanghai Correspondent] Shanghai has always been the financial center of the country. After the war, the center shifted to the southwestern provinces, especially Chongqing and Kunming in Sichuan and Yunnan. The reserve funds of the four major banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank) have long been moved to safe areas. The number of branches in West China and South China has increased sharply. In order to concentrate their strength, the banks have proposed merging their operations. Details are as follows:

Distribution of Wartime Banks by Region

Banks are divided by the geographical distribution of their headquarters and branches: East China has 87 headquarters and 573 branches, North China has 16 headquarters and 347 branches, Central China has 11 headquarters and 279 branches, West China has 17 headquarters and 195 branches, South China has 12 headquarters and 199 branches, Northeast has 30 branches, Northwest has 3 headquarters and 26 branches, Overseas has 12 headquarters and 42 branches. In total, there are 158 headquarters and 1,691 branches, totaling 1,849. Compared with before the war: (1) The number of headquarters decreased by 3 in East China, 1 in West China, and 2 in South China; (2) The number of branches decreased by 12 in North China and increased by 1 in East China, 12 in Central China, 28 in West China, 29 in South China, and 6 overseas.

Sharp Increase in Branches in Chartered Provinces and Cities

Bank classification: (Headquarters) Commercial savings banks decreased by 3, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, specialized banks decreased by 2; (Branches) Central and chartered banks increased by 23, provincial and municipal banks increased by 33, commercial savings increased by 7, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, specialized and overseas Chinese banks each increased by 1. The following are the records of various banks in the past two years: (1) Central and Chartered (Previous Year) 4 headquarters, 491 branches; (Last Year) 4 headquarters, 514 branches; (2) Provincial and Municipal (Previous Year) 26 headquarters, 464 branches; (Last Year) 26 headquarters, 497 branches; (3) Commercial Savings (Previous Year) 73 headquarters, 408 branches; (Last Year) 70 headquarters, 415 branches; (4) Specialized Agricultural, Industrial and Overseas Chinese (Previous Year) 61 headquarters, 264 branches; (Last Year) 58 headquarters, 265 branches.

Paid-Up Capital of 400 Million Yuan

In terms of the paid-up capital of banks, provincial and municipal banks increased by 300,000 yuan, commercial savings banks increased by 100,000 yuan, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 80,000 yuan, and specialized banks decreased by 140,000 yuan. The following are the records of paid-up capital in the past two years: (1) Central and Chartered (Previous Year) 167.500 yuan; (Last Year) 167.500 yuan; (2) Provincial and Municipal (Previous Year) 76.884 yuan; (Last Year) 79.884 yuan; (3) Commercial Savings (Previous Year) 83.248 yuan; (Last Year) 84.248 yuan; (4) Agricultural and Industrial (Previous Year) 29.486 yuan; (Last Year) 28.686 yuan; (5) Specialized (Previous Year) 19.539 yuan; (Last Year) 18.139 yuan; (6) Overseas Chinese (Previous Year) 57.645 yuan; (Last Year) 57.645 yuan. The above units are in thousands of yuan. As of 1938, the total paid-up capital of all banks was 436.1 million yuan.

Concentration of Power, Merged Operations

In the past, the problem with banking operations was that they competed with each other instead of cooperating with each other. As a result, financial power had several negative impacts on the social economy. Before the implementation of the new currency system, they competed in real estate, bid for public bonds, and speculated in foreign exchange. Only after the implementation of the new currency system did they gradually move towards a proper path. In order to concentrate power, the banking industry proposed merging the operations of various banks. The actual implementation occurred successively with the merger of the Jiangzhe Bank and the Zhonghui Bank, the merger of the Taiping Bank and the Guoji Bank, and the joint operation of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank and the Jiangsu Bank. After the war, the ChuanKang Bank, the Chongqing Civilian Bank, and the Sichuan Commercial Bank merged to form the ChuanKang Civilian Bank. Guangdong Industrial and Sichuan Silk Industry merged with the Guangdong Provincial Bank.

Using Idle Funds to Develop the Interior

After the war, banks in Shanghai all had a surplus of idle funds. Therefore, banks in Shanghai and other places reduced deposit interest rates to lighten the burden. However, the banks, entrusted by the depositors and for their own future, after repeated and careful consideration of the use of funds, believe that using idle funds to develop the interior is the most appropriate way at present. At the same time, it can assist the government in completing the construction of the interior and developing the rich resources of the southwest. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Fujian Provincial Bank have successively established agricultural departments to develop agriculture in the interior with all their strength, so as to increase their agricultural products and facilitate the export of local products. Some banks have also established trust departments to handle trust matters in order to adapt to the complex economic structure. As for the closure of banks after the war, there were actually only three, but Hengli has already resumed operations.

### Full Text of Anglo-Turkish Agreement to Be Released Today, Anglo-Soviet Negotiations in Critical Stage, France Declares Maintenance of Franco-Soviet Agreement

(Associated Press, Ankara, 6th) Reports from Angola state that the Anglo-Turkish agreement has been completed, cooperating to maintain security in the Mediterranean. The terms of the agreement will be announced simultaneously in the Turkish National Assembly and the British House of Commons on Sunday. All developments have been notified to the Soviet government at all times. The Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister, carrying new government instructions, hurriedly left for Moscow this afternoon. Before departing, he held secret talks with various leaders.

(Central News Agency, Paris, 6th) News has just been received here from the Turkish capital that Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin of the Soviet Union discussed the defense of Central and Eastern European countries with the Turkish authorities. The signatory countries of the Eastern Locarno Pact, namely Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan, recently held a meeting in Tehran and resolved to authorize Turkey to represent them in diplomatic initiatives. The Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey are adjacent to each other, and there is a relationship of mutual support.

(Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 7th) Potemkin arrived in Germany from Turkey yesterday and will arrive here at 1:00 PM today. After visiting the Bulgarian Prime Minister, he will travel to the Romanian capital at 10:00 PM tonight.

(Central News Agency, London, 6th) It is claimed here that the United Kingdom will lend a large sum of money to Greece. Anglo-Greek trade negotiations are scheduled to begin in Athens on May 13. The British delegation will be headed by Leeds Ross.

(Haitong News Agency, London, 7th) The British reply to the Soviet government was delivered to Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday afternoon.

(Associated Press, London, 6th) According to official announcements, the purpose of the United Kingdom's new proposal is to recruit the Soviet Union into the Anglo-French security front. Its issuance has been delayed because "a second consideration is necessary." Although it was previously reported that it had been delivered to British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds, this is not the case. However, it will be sent out soon. Chamberlain himself will revise the note and draft it again. The original note did not accept the Soviet proposal for a military mutual assistance agreement, but still retained room for a final military agreement.

(Associated Press, London, 6th) A few minutes after the Soviet Ambassador left the British Foreign Office today, Halifax went to the Prime Minister's residence to discuss the recommendations of the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee and the discussions with Maisky. Before lunch, the Foreign Minister also discussed the situation with Undersecretary of State Cadogan. Political sources say that the United Kingdom's final revised reply to the Soviet Union seems to have a conciliatory tone. The United Kingdom still insists that the Soviet Union should independently agree to assist Eastern European countries that are invaded. If the Soviet Union agrees to this, a three-power military alliance may be possible.

(Reuters, London, 7th) Today's editorials in various newspapers and reports from various diplomatic correspondents all focus on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Most opinions believe that the negotiations have reached a critical stage because the British government is only willing to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union to provide assistance when the Baltic and Balkan countries are attacked. However, the Soviet Union insists that the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union form a military agreement and that the small countries of Eastern and Western Europe be attached to it. The "Sunday Times" diplomatic correspondent stated that unless the Soviet Union is prepared to compromise, these talks will be in danger of breaking down. He also stated that "the final conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is critical to the Anglo-Soviet negotiations." The "Observer" diplomatic correspondent added, "The Soviet Union has consistently stated that small countries have high expectations, hoping that the peace group is truly effective and reliable, and this cannot be achieved without a full military alliance of the three major powers. If the three countries continue to hesitate, the small countries may be in danger at any time. The difficulty for the United Kingdom is that it believes that a formal military alliance is sufficient for Germany to regard it as a pretext for an encirclement policy, which in turn may trigger a crisis that it is trying to avoid. At the same time, the Soviet Union believes that without a full alliance, a crisis may also be triggered. Therefore, this issue has become a stage of mutual maneuvering." The "Observer" editorial stated, "As the organization of the peace group is now beginning, the British government must answer this question: Is a halfway measure effective or will it make the current situation worse than before?"

(Associated Press, Paris, 6th) Officials here expressed disappointment with the United Kingdom's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal to form a military alliance and resist Hitler. At the same time, France reiterated its maintenance of the 1935 Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. It is reported that Moscow has informed France that the Soviet Union has no intention of adopting isolationism or compromising with Germany. According to France's opinion, the United Kingdom's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal does not mean that the actions of the United Kingdom and France to jointly guarantee the territorial integrity of the countries surrounding Germany have failed.

(Associated Press, Paris, 6th) The French Foreign Minister reported to the French Cabinet today on the negotiations with Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, and Turkey to form a peace front; and explained the United Kingdom's counterproposal to the Soviet Union's proposal to form a three-power military alliance; and reiterated the Pope's efforts for peace. The French Cabinet passed six decrees, signed by President Lebrun. The decrees include national defense preparations and banning foreign newspapers in France.

### Large Numbers of German Bombers Concentrated Near Polish Border, Hitler to Watch Reaction of Britain and United States, Poland to Convene Parliament Tomorrow

(Reuters, Paris, 6th) According to reliable reports, large numbers of German bombers are concentrated near the Polish border. Although the news has caused great shock in French public opinion, there is still hope that a further increase in tension can be avoided. The French side has a strong tendency to hope that Italy will serve as a mediator. The French side hopes that because Mussolini is unwilling to wage war against Poland, he can automatically persuade Hitler to adopt a more moderate strategy. In addition, close attention is also being paid to the issue of Slovakia. Military movements are extremely frequent in the Slovak territory close to Poland's industrial center. There are two reasons for this emphasis: (1) the threat to Poland's vital point, and (2) today's rumors that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are jointly discussing the partition of Slovakia by Germany, Italy, and Hungary. The latest intelligence regarding the German army is summarized as follows: Aircraft and other supplies have been concentrated in large quantities on the Polish border. It is understood that the Polish side has also made preparations. However, the number of German troops concentrated on the Polish border is not extremely large, so a direct invasion of Poland may not occur immediately.

(Reuters, Berlin, 6th) Wilhelmstrasse has so far refused to express Germany's attitude towards Beck's speech. There is not a word of commentary in the Nazi newspapers. Beck's speech and Poland's reply to Germany's memorandum on the abolition of the German-Polish agreement are currently being studied in detail. It is understood that Hitler will observe how Britain and the United States react to this before expressing his personal opinions. However, the Nazi Party and political circles have particularly raised four points for discussion: (1) They particularly emphasized the right of the people of Danzig to self-determination; (2) They refused to accept the view that Poland has great interests in Danzig because Danzig is located at the mouth of the Vistula River; (3) They believe that the German-Polish agreement stipulates that neither contracting party may freely unite with other countries to oppose the other contracting party; (4) They expressed disagreement with Beck's statement that Germany's proposals were not delivered to Poland in full.

(Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th) German attention is not focused on Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech, but on the activities of Wilhelmstrasse. Its countermeasures to the current European situation can be expressed as "breaking the British encirclement." Germany's foreign policy places everything else in a secondary position, focusing exclusively on diplomatic struggles with Britain. This has become increasingly clear. In order to achieve this goal, Germany's foreign policy may unexpectedly change its course. However, everything depends on the outcome of the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Ribbentrop visited Hitler at his mountain villa in Munich last night before setting off for Italy.

(Reuters, Berlin, 6th) According to sources in political circles here, there will be no major decisions regarding the Danzig issue at present. However, there are also those who advocate holding a plebiscite in Danzig, believing that the return of Danzig to Germany or the maintenance of the status quo of the Free City should be decided by the people themselves. Well-informed sources have barely confirmed that Hitler did meet with the leaders of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Greiser and Forster, yesterday. This means that Ribbentrop had already learned the wishes of the Danzig leaders and carried Hitler's instructions when he went to Milan.

(Reuters, Warsaw, 6th) The "Daily Newspaper" here wrote, "The world has unanimously recognized that if Germany wants to seek understanding with Poland, it should provide concrete evidence. Now that Poland has made its attitude clear, it is time for Germany to speak." The "Polish Daily" also said, "Berlin must now choose one of two paths, and one of the paths is the path of peace." The "Sas Newspaper," the representative newspaper of the conservatives, said that the return of German Ambassador Moltke to Warsaw yesterday may mean that the German side has made some suggestions. The Polish Parliament has scheduled a plenary session for the 9th to discuss the granting of privileges to the President to promulgate appropriations to strengthen national defense. The Senate is scheduled to convene a plenary session on the 11th.

### Pope's Broadcast Yesterday, Praying for Peace; Rumored to Have Taken Diplomatic Steps to Assist in Resolving the German-Polish Dispute

[Reuters, Vatican City, 7th] The Pope delivered a broadcast speech today in Algiers to the French National Eucharistic Congress, briefly stating that mankind earnestly desires peace. The Pope said that in mid-May he would do his utmost to offer extensive prayers, hoping that the Holy Mother would grant us peace from Heaven. We are now earnestly hoping that erroneous policies and turmoil will end soon, and that the peace of souls and the peace of the world will flourish together.

[Reuters, Vatican City, 6th] Although the nature of the Pope's broadcast speech tomorrow is unknown, local sources suggest that the Vatican's representative in Germany's visit to Ribbentrop is specifically related to the German-Polish dispute. The Holy See is eager to see a peaceful resolution to this matter and is reportedly making every effort to mediate with all parties to open up avenues for negotiation and prevent their interruption. Although the Vatican's efforts cannot be said to have had any real effect, it continues to exert its diplomatic activities in various European centers, striving for peace. It is generally speculated that the Vatican has resumed contact with Berlin, aiming to achieve mutual understanding between Germany and the Holy See.

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] The Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Verdier, will make an important statement at the Eucharistic Congress to be held in Algiers tomorrow.

[Reuters, London, 6th] According to reports from Paris today, the Vatican is currently making its utmost efforts to mediate peace in Europe. Another report states that the French Foreign Minister reported to the Cabinet on the visit of the Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Verdier, yesterday. Simultaneously, the Archbishop of Berlin also visited Hitler, further strengthening the belief in the Pope's intervention for peace. The Pope may make some mention of this effort in his broadcast speech to the Eucharistic Congress in Algiers tomorrow.

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Since the French Foreign Minister presented a report to the Cabinet, it is believed here that the Pope has taken diplomatic steps to assist in peacefully resolving the German-Polish dispute. After the Vatican's representative in France visited Bonnet yesterday, the Vatican's representative in Germany also visited the German authorities. It is believed here that this action is related to the Pope's intervention in the Danzig issue.

### German and Italian Foreign Ministers Continue Talks, Discussing General European Issues; Italy Hopes for German-Polish Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Milan, 6th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held talks at the Governor's Office here, from 4:45 PM to 7:10 PM. Afterwards, they went out together, and the crowd, who had been waiting nearby for a long time, cheered and paid their respects. Foreign Minister Ciano then gave a statement to the newspapers, saying that the talks were very harmonious and that all issues concerning the European situation were discussed, with particular emphasis on issues related to the connection between Italy and Germany. Well-informed Italian sources also stated that the two sides shared the same views on all issues and that all matters to be discussed had been completed today. A joint communiqué will be issued tomorrow morning.

[Reuters, Milan, 6th] Today's talks between the Italian and German Foreign Ministers are believed to have focused on the Danzig issue.

[Reuters, Rome, 6th] The official newspaper "Diplomatic Information," in discussing today's consultations between Ribbentrop and Ciano, said that the Milan talks would not result in any surprising events, but would reaffirm the Axis powers' determination to resist the policy of encirclement. This should not be seen as an element of war, but rather as an instrument of peace.

[Central News Agency, Milan, 7th] According to Fascist sources, Italy still maintains that German-Polish negotiations should continue in order to resolve the Danzig issue. Mussolini believes that the hope for a German-Polish understanding has not been extinguished by Beck's speech. It is widely believed that both Mussolini and the Pope intend to mediate the German-Polish dispute.

[Reuters, Rome, 6th] The newspaper "Il Tempo" commented today that Italy hopes Germany will show moderation, just as it hopes Poland will. It said: "To seek the upholding of justice, both sides must eliminate the idea of hegemony. In fact, an agreement is already halfway to being reached, and both sides have expressed a desire for a speedy peace."

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th] Italian newspapers, based on the official attitude, compared Beck's speech with the tone of German newspapers and concluded that the door to negotiations is not yet closed. One newspaper even said that Beck stated, "Germany only makes demands and has no concrete suggestions." This is an invitation for Germany to provide suggestions. If Hitler can accept this invitation, then negotiations can proceed, and all relevant countries can feel satisfied.

### Danzig Student Unrest: Polish Students Strike, Demanding Equal Treatment

[Reuters, Gdansk, 6th] The Gdansk University of Technology, which experienced an anti-German movement this spring that was later resolved, is now facing renewed disputes. Polish students claim that their unequal treatment has not been rectified and have unanimously gone on strike.

### The King and Queen's Entourage Embark on a Long Sea Voyage; The "Queen of Australia" is Equipped as a Special Ship, Providing Comfortable and Spectacular Settings

[Reuters, London, 6th] A Reuters correspondent on board the "Queen of Australia" sent a wireless message stating that all facilities and comfortable settings on the ship were fully prepared when the King and Queen boarded. Over a thousand craftsmen transformed the passenger ship into a royal vessel in a very short time. The King and Queen's rooms are filled with flowers, creating a spectacular atmosphere. However, all facilities are based on practicality and comfort, without extravagance. The colors are mostly pale gray and cream. All interior amenities, even the smallest details, are complete. The King's electric razor has a special mechanism, and there is also a radio with a detailed list of shortwave broadcasts from across the empire. Tonight, after the King and Queen dined with the royal staff, they listened to a classical music concert. All personnel on board have been properly accommodated and are embarking on a very pleasant voyage. At the time of departure, the King and Queen watched the farewell ceremony of the Atlantic Fleet on deck. The cheers of the fleet personnel could be clearly heard as the special ship passed by, and the band of the battleship "Rodney" played the national anthem. The special ship left the Atlantic Fleet at 6:30 PM and immediately increased its speed to 17 nautical miles per hour, which will be maintained throughout the night. Three warships are escorting: the "Glasgow" and "Sandown" flank the sides, and the cruiser "Repulse" patrols behind. The farewell between the King and Queen and the two princesses was also very pleasant. First, the two princesses accompanied the King and Queen on a tour of the ship, and then they took a group photo together. When saying goodbye, Princess Elizabeth immediately embraced and kissed the Queen.

### French Newspapers Reveal German Attempt to Swallow up the Soviet Union: Two Proposals Rejected by Poland; Poland Hopes to Ally with Lithuania

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Local sources say that in his recent speech, Polish Foreign Minister Beck mentioned Germany's proposal to Poland for a joint German-Polish attack on the Soviet Union, which Poland rejected, believing that such a war would only shrink its territory and be surrounded by a powerful Germany.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 6th] The moderate "L'Ordre," the Radical Socialist "L'Oeuvre," and the right-wing "Le Figaro" all reported that Germany had suggested to Poland in March this year that they jointly attack the Soviet Union and divide its territory. "L'Oeuvre" also reported that the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Republic and Transcaucasian Republic would be assigned to Germany, while the Little Russian Republic and the Baltic coastal area would go to Poland. "Le Figaro" also said that German Air Minister General Goering had made this proposal while hunting with Polish officials in the Bialowieza Forest in Poland.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 6th] Regarding the two proposals by the German leader to Poland for a joint attack on the Soviet Union, after some newspapers in Paris revealed this matter, well-informed sources here have now confirmed it. The first time was in February last year, when German Air Minister Goering came here on a mission. The second time was in March this year, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made a suggestion to Foreign Minister Beck. On both occasions, Germany promised that after defeating the Soviet Union, it would assign the Ukrainian Republic, the Belarusian Republic, and part of the territory of Lithuania to Poland, but this was rejected by Foreign Minister Beck. Tracing back to February of last year, after General Goering returned to his country from here, the dispute between Poland and Lithuania arose, fortunately not escalating into armed conflict. The two sides have now restored diplomatic relations and have gone from being enemies to allies. At this time, there are even discussions about concluding an alliance treaty.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 6th] Today, the Polish military newspaper stated that Poland hopes to form an alliance with Lithuania and share weal and woe, saying that Lithuania's neighbors Estonia and Latvia are both friendly to Poland. Poland can guarantee the security of these three countries, adding that time is pressing and fleeting, and a decision should be made as soon as possible.

Several stops will be set up along the route to store fuel and radio beacons. According to Mazuruk, he has conducted several test flights and, based on the results of the tests, believes that this is the safest route year-round.

Brief Commentary

### May 9th

May 9th is the day the Japanese ××ists first branded the Chinese nation with the mark of ×!

For more than twenty years, the Chinese people have struggled under double oppression to eradicate this shameful imprint. It was not until after the "July 7th" and "August 13th" incidents two years ago that national cooperation was achieved, realizing unprecedented unity between the central and local governments, the government and the people, and all ethnic groups and social strata; it was through national cooperation that the entire Chinese nation unanimously launched the War of Resistance Against Japan.

However, eradicating the imprint cannot but involve immense suffering, and in the process of this painful struggle, the wavering of those with weak wills and the shrinking back is inevitable, and the submission of unscrupulous elements to the threats and enticements of the × people is unavoidable. Therefore, as we commemorate May 9th, this day of painful shame, more than twenty years later, we must, in addition to jointly resisting the invaders, also make every effort to oppose those who dream of becoming Yuan Shikai II, and especially to guard against the "anti-communist peace" and other conspiracies orchestrated by the likes of Wang ××!

The invaders and their lackeys are most afraid of us eradicating the imprint and becoming free and independent among civilized humanity! The invaders and their lackeys are most afraid of our unity and solidarity in persisting in the War of Resistance, enabling the entire nation to become free and independent from shame and suffering! They are using military adventures, political conspiracies, and the mad bombing and ×× to further brand us with the mark of shame and cruel oppression! This is what we must be doubly vigilant and doubly strive for on this anniversary of the shameful imprint. We must, on May 9th next year, celebrate this "Day of Atonement" enthusiastically!

### More Than Thirty British Members of Parliament Send Telegram to Chairman Chiang to Pay Respects

Today's news reports a Reuters dispatch from London stating that Lord Listowel and four other members of the British House of Lords, and Mr. Pain and thirty-two other members of the House of Commons, sent a telegram to our Chairman Chiang to pay their respects. The telegram especially announced their sympathy and respect for the struggle of our entire people and army for national independence, unity, and freedom; the telegram also especially declared their public recognition that China's War of Resistance against Japan is in fact the main force in the world's anti-aggression struggle, and also protects peace in Europe. Therefore, they further expressed their deep sympathy and respect.

From this telegram, we can further recognize how our twenty-two months of persistent resistance have raised the international status of the Chinese people and the leaders of the Chinese government! We can further recognize how our twenty-two months of persistent resistance have benefited the world and influenced the world! We believe that in the future, this kind of international sympathy, aid, and contribution to the cause of world peace through persistent resistance will have even greater achievements! Here, we must strengthen our determination to support the leader's persistence in the War of Resistance, and we must make even greater efforts to advance the international anti-fascist and anti-aggression front. We must know that the increase in international sympathy and aid is, in fact, an increase in the power of resistance against Japan, and will bring forward the arrival of the final victory!

### Mussolini to Deliver Speech on the 14th, Emphasizing Italian-French Relations

[Central News Agency, Rome, 6th] Political figures recently declared that Prime Minister Mussolini will deliver an important speech in Turin on the 14th, the content of which will particularly focus on Italian-French relations.

### Random Talk on the International Situation (Continued)

— Liao ChongSheng

According to the opinion of the isolationists, the American head of state, anyone who advocates actively participating in world politics, under the constraints of the constitution, still has the risk of leading the country into a dangerous state of actual war without the formal procedure of Congress. With the qualification of Commander of the Army and Navy, the president has the right to instruct his soldiers and fleets to go to any region at any time. In today's trend of undeclared war, this right may inevitably be misused, this is one. The original purpose of the Neutrality Law was to cleanse oneself, so as to avoid being involved in the vortex of international war. However, even in terms of the articles of this law, the US president can declare that a certain country is in a state of war, even for a country that has not declared war, as a reason to sever contact with it, and as a result, it may provoke criticism or hostile behavior from that country towards the United States, this is two. According to the tariff laws, under certain circumstances, the US commander can use tariff retaliation to cause the interruption of trade between the United States and other countries, this is three. If the president deliberately interferes in world politics, whenever he comes into contact with foreign representatives, he can accept certain obligations or deliberately provoke the anger of the other party. Once the incident occurs, the people of the country will naturally have to support him in order to maintain national dignity, this is four. Although the above words are the pretext for the isolationists to advocate weakening the president's power, objectively they adequately reflect the considerable greatness of the US president's external power. We believe that President Roosevelt, with his foresight, will be able to make good use of his power to alert the aggressors. 、 The Soviet Union is blessed with unique advantages. Since the successive implementation of the three Five-Year Plans, its resources have been considerably developed, and its heavy industry has made rapid progress. Among the great powers, the only ones that can talk about economic self-sufficiency are the United States and the Soviet Union. Its role as a major factor in world politics is obvious here.

The greatest mistake of the Munich Conference was alienating the Soviet Union and hoping to realize the so-called four-power agreement in a vague and ethereal space. This is exactly what the Axis countries, especially Hitler, were seeking. In other words, among the international covenants, the one that Hitler was most worried about was the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact established on May 2, 1935, because as long as this pact was not abolished, if a European war broke out again, Germany would inevitably be attacked from both sides, and this was also a major reason why it failed in 1918. No wonder Hitler was determined to abolish this pact as soon as possible.

Now, the preciousness of Soviet-Russian friendship has not only been repeatedly declared in the mouths of British and French officials and common people, but also the exchanges between the envoys of both sides are becoming more frequent. To recover the water that has been spilled, it is necessary to completely abandon the suspicion of Russia. However, as things have changed and feelings have shifted, whether the Soviet Union's attitude remains the same is a prerequisite for cooperation.

The Soviet Union's diplomatic attitude is extremely clear. In short, in addition to being prepared to cooperate with democratic countries at any time according to the principle of collective security to serve as a guarantee for world peace, it will absolutely not make the slightest concession or retreat from the aggressor countries' clumsy tricks of using the threat of war to achieve their great desire for exploitation. However, it is willing to tolerate and accommodate democratic countries, and to make compromises to seek perfection. In 1927, when British-Soviet and French-Soviet relations were tense, Stalin publicly stated: "The Soviet authorities must implement their peaceful policy, even if external stimuli may damage national dignity, we will definitely ignore it." This kind of firm and far-sighted proposition has not changed so far. For example, although there is a close mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union, France, and Czechoslovakia, the Munich Conference deliberately neglected the Soviet Union. On the eve of the signing of the German-French friendship declaration last winter (December 5), the French authorities only notified the Soviet Union of the original text. These "stimuli" are not tolerable for strong countries, but Soviet Russia still remains silent, which proves that its original intention to maintain peace is still the same as before.

### Promoting the "May Fourth" Spirit: Hong Kong Youth Organizations Held a Grand Celebration of Youth Day Last Night; More Than a Thousand Youth Representatives Attended a Meeting at the Confucius Hall; Zhong Tianxin Encouraged Youth to Strengthen Self-Cultivation and Mobilize the People

Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper

"Youth Day" is a new creation of China this year, a groundbreaking new era for all countries in the world. How did it come about? What mission does it bear? The answer is very simple: it was won through the struggles of youth groups since the May Fourth Movement, and its mission should be to promote the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, serving as pioneers and pillars in the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

The process of establishing "Youth Day" involved the Three Principles of the People Youth League petitioning the central government to designate "May Fourth" as "Youth Day" and to designate the period from May 1st to May 7th – the most critical week of the tragic May – as Youth Movement Propaganda Week. The program of this week's movement includes "May 1st" for launching labor services to increase production efficiency; "May 2nd" for promoting various cultural propaganda; "May 3rd" for promoting conscription work, etc.; "May 4th" for holding commemorative meetings, emphasizing cleanliness, discipline, and punctuality, and striving to be role models for the people; "May 5th" for promoting healthy recreational activities; "May 6th" for launching academic work; and "May 7th" for advocating youth physical education. All the work content is closely related to the war of resistance and national reconstruction and must be popularized in all villages to deepen and strengthen it.

From this, we can understand the transition from "students" to "youth," from "local movements" to "strengthening youth self-cultivation" and even to "participating in the national liberation struggle." Continuing this path, the significance is so great, and youth are so glorious! We deeply congratulate the country and the nation!

Although Hong Kong youth are limited by their environment and cannot launch great works as vigorously as those in the mainland, they are still struggling arduously within the possible scope.

Regarding the "May Fourth Youth Day" student relief association and the actual actions of various schools and youth organizations, details have been reported in previous newspapers. As for the joint commemoration of Youth Day by all Hong Kong youth organizations, it was held last night – the last day of Youth Movement Week and also the anniversary of national humiliation – at the Confucius Hall.

Just as dusk was falling, a group in front, a team behind, marched straight towards the road on 加里連山 (possibly a transliteration of a foreign name), singing, laughing, walking and jumping, brimming with innocent enthusiasm and the vitality of life.

The upper and lower floors of the venue were filled with more than a thousand young friends, mostly students, and many representatives from various youth organizations. All the students of the School of Journalism also participated, hoping to strengthen their self-education in collective life. Holding the "Message to All Hong Kong Youth" distributed by the conference, the Student Relief Association's "Special Issue Celebrating Youth Day," and the "Self-Renewal Movement Covenant," they read silently and accepted with a smile.

At 8 o'clock, the seven representatives of the presidium – the Student Relief Association, the Youth Journalists Association, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Huiyang Youth Association, the Christian Student Federation, and the Youth Recreation Society – took their seats and solemnly proceeded with the opening ceremony. Chairman Li Zhengyao spoke about the glorious history of the May Fourth Movement and how Hong Kong youth are also progressing in this great era. Then, he explained the significance of the conference: first, to support the leader, unite the youth, and participate in the national liberation struggle; second, to improve the lives of youth – especially students – so that everyone becomes serious and moves forward. As for the responsibilities they should bear: (1) to intensify relief for refugees; (2) to strengthen international propaganda; (3) to practice thrift; (4) to promote Sino-British cultural cooperation; (5) to strengthen the great unity of youth; and (6) to raise the social status of youth.

Next, Mr. Zhong Tianxin delivered a speech. He spoke calmly about many things that should be said to the youth; everyone listened quietly.

Only when "young people" can be as "mature" as adults are they good young people, which was the standard by which China used to praise youth. Mr. Zhong believes that this is completely wrong. Reviewing China's past history, from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the revolution to the current war of resistance, youth have made indelible achievements and great contributions. The meaning of Youth Day is to commemorate the glorious history of the past and to encourage future struggles for the country and the nation.

Next, Mr. Zhong encouraged the youth with the following four points: "Be the first to worry about the world's troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures; wield knives and axes to increase national wealth and hold shields and spears to defend the country." If they do not strengthen their self-cultivation in this way, they will lose the qualities of youth and fall after a period of time. – These are very pertinent words.

Finally, he said: Today marks the anniversary of national humiliation. How should we commemorate national humiliation by celebrating Youth Day? The conclusion is to mobilize youth, enrich youth cadres, youth will definitely go to mobilize the people, and the people will definitely generate great power to strive for the early arrival of final victory. – This is Mr. Zhong's experience in mobilization work and his emphasis on youth and the people. Everyone responded with warm applause.

With the interlude of singing, the atmosphere of the venue changed from solemn to lively. "The Chinese nation will not perish!" "The Chinese nation will not perish!" "..." shouted from everyone's hearts, touching everyone's hearts.

After the harmonica performance, Mr. Jiang Wenhan, Vice Chairman of the World Christian Student Federation, gave a speech. He came from working in the mainland and spoke very movingly: first, to recognize that this era is a great era; second, spiritual mobilization is the foundation of all mobilization work; and third, to recognize one's own position and task.

After another round of singing, Zheng Dechao introduced the "Youth Self-Renewal Movement Covenant," encouraging everyone to abide by it together: (1) Improve interest levels and choose healthy entertainment; (2) Strengthen group life and promote the spirit of discipline; (3) Increase research interest and cultivate scientific minds; (4) Eliminate extravagant habits and develop thrifty habits; (5) Deepen spiritual cultivation and enhance service effectiveness. The full text, with a total of twenty-eight articles, was detailed in yesterday's newspaper. This is a concrete standard of spiritual mobilization for youth self-cultivation. Everyone applauded enthusiastically and agreed. Let's meet again in action! – The meeting ended happily at around 10 o'clock. (Qi Zhuo)

### Another Pirate Attack on a Cargo Boat in the Waters of Sam Mun Tsai Yesterday; One Boat Companion Was Shot and Injured Before Being Thrown into the Sea; Wood Oil and Other Items Were Robbed, Resulting in a Loss of More Than Three Thousand Dollars

In the waters near Hong Kong, piracy is rampant. Cargo boats and fishing boats passing by are often robbed by bandits. Recently, it has become more and more fierce, almost without a day passing without incident. On the 6th of this month, in the waters of Sam Mun Tsai, another cargo boat was robbed by more than twenty pirates who fired guns. One boat companion was injured and thrown into the sea. Goods worth more than three thousand dollars were looted. Afterwards, the boat owner returned to Hong Kong and reported the case to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station. The details are as follows:

Sam Mun Tsai Waters: Suddenly Encountering a Bandit Boat

The robbed cargo boat was T2126H. The boat owner, Fang Er (38 years old), reported to the police station that the boat set sail from 甲子 (Jiazi) in the Chinese territory on the afternoon of the 4th of this month to transport goods to Hong Kong. At about 8 o'clock in the morning on the 6th, when the boat was in the waters of Sam Mun Tsai, a speedboat suddenly appeared and sailed obliquely from the bay, chasing after the cargo boat like an arrow. Everyone on the boat knew they were not good people, so they raised the sails and rowed hard, hoping to escape, while preparing for battle. However, in the blink of an eye, the bandit boat had caught up. They saw that the boat was carrying many pirates, all holding long and short guns, with a fierce momentum, and ordered them to stop. The boat ignored them and continued to sail forward. Then, they heard the bandit boat fire several fishing cannons as a threat, but none hit the target. They continued to sail forward. Seeing that the demonstration was ineffective, the bandit boat fired dozens of gunshots in succession, shooting at the cargo boat. Bullets rained down, and the cargo boat was hit several times. They returned fire to resist, while trying to escape.

Boat Companion Injured; Significant Loss

The boat companion, Fang Binglai, was unfortunately shot and injured in the chaos and fell into the cabin. The bandit boat quickly caught up. Twenty pirates swarmed onto the boat, ordered the boat companions to gather in a corner, and began searching the boat. They robbed for about half an hour. All the items on the cargo boat were moved to the bandit boat. When the bandits were about to leave, they became even more ferocious and threw Fang Binglai into the sea before returning to their boat and roaring away. Fortunately, the injured man was quite familiar with the water. Despite his serious injuries, he was still able to float in the vast waves and drift to the waters of 虎頭門 (Tiger Head Gate). Fortunately, another boat arrived in time, rescued him, and sailed back to Hong Kong. It was not until the afternoon before yesterday that they arrived. The goods robbed this time included 212 cans of wood oil, worth 3,392 dollars, two live pigs, and 25 geese, worth a total of 100 dollars, totaling 3,492 dollars. After the police received the report, they filed it and telegraphed all district police stations to cooperate in apprehending the bandits. The injured man was sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment.

### The Youth Relief Association Service Corps Held a Flag-Granting Ceremony Yesterday; All Eleven Team Members Will Depart to Serve in Dongjiang

The China Youth Relief Association held a flag-granting ceremony for the departure of the first return-to-country service corps at the fourth floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM yesterday.

The list of all eleven team members is as follows: Li Bingxin (Team Leader), Tao Guozhang, Yan Guohui, Chen Zuyin, Wang Zhongyi, Zeng Guangfa, Lai Hanguang, Chen Zhe, Chen Ying, Liang Huanhui, and Hu Ze.

### The Air Defense Authorities Have Decided to Suddenly Implement a Blackout This Week; Residents Must Be Prepared to Turn Off the Lights Immediately Upon Hearing the Air Raid Siren; Implementation Is Possible at Any Time Starting Today

The Hong Kong Air Defense Committee has held several air defense drills and blackouts since last year, but the results of each drill have not been as good as the air defense authorities had expected. The reason for the failure is largely due to the residents' failure to fully cooperate with the air defense authorities. At the same time, due to the insufficient number of sirens, some residents did not even hear the sirens during the previous air defense drills and blackouts, which was also enough to affect the effectiveness of the drills. Now, the air defense authorities have purchased several new sirens from the United Kingdom and placed them in various appropriate locations. They were tested a few days ago, and the results were very good. Residents can rest assured that they will be aware of the sirens in future drills. It is understood that all previous blackouts were of a general nature, and the time of their implementation was announced in advance by the air defense authorities, so that residents could be prepared and not be caught off guard. As for wartime air defense drills, they have never been conducted. Now, in order to increase residents' awareness of air defense, the air defense authorities have decided to hold a wartime air defense drill this month. It has been decided in advance not to announce the time of the drill, in order to test whether residents can calmly respond to an air raid once it occurs. Also, in previous air defense drills, residents often liked to form groups and travel on the streets during the drills, which also reduced the effectiveness of the drills. This time, the wartime air defense drill will be sudden, which should reduce this undesirable phenomenon. If there are fewer pedestrians on the streets, the degree of tension will naturally increase, and the situation is expected to be less lax than before. It is heard that the air defense authorities cannot reveal the exact date for this wartime air defense drill, but according to reliable sources, it should be within the middle of this month. Implementation is possible at any time starting today. The air defense authorities hope that residents will prepare themselves fully in advance so that they will not be caught off guard when the time comes.

### The Theater Community Celebrated Ou-Yang Yuqian's Birthday; "Huanghuagang" Decided to Stage Another Charity Performance

--Bai Shui

Regularly Hold Spiritual Mobilization Oath-Taking Ceremony

Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper

The sensational "Huanghuagang" joint performance, which was staged for three consecutive nights from May 3rd to 5th, has once again written a glorious record and an immortal history for the Chinese theater scene.

At around 1 PM yesterday, the Hong Kong theater community and the "Huanghuagang" Performance Committee held a meeting at the Chinese Children's Academy to discuss various issues. Representatives from various theater troupes and officials from various departments of the conference attended, numbering more than fifty.

First, each department reported on the work situation and other matters of this performance. Then, several very meaningful discussions began.

Everyone has been working very hard in this joint performance, especially several working cadres who have devoted their greatest spirit and sacrificed their precious time to complete this massive task. However, if this has affected their own lives or careers, we should give them great sympathy and assistance.

Therefore: Since Mr. Zhan Ge's dismissal was related to his public service, the conference decided to send Hu Chunbing and Li Hua to explain and seek understanding with an official letter from the conference.

This matter has demonstrated the collective and indestructible power of the theater community!

The income from the "Huanghuagang" performance will reach nearly 3,000 dollars, but due to various reasons, the audience could not be popularized, which is a pity. In order to promote propaganda work more widely and increase income, re-staging at a lower price is a consistent requirement. As a result, after everyone's discussion, they all agreed to re-stage "Huanghuagang" in cooperation with the Hong Kong Eye Federation.

In the midst of this, Mr. Li Shulun put forward a very valuable suggestion, which is that Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday is approaching, so it would be best to make this re-staging a charity performance to celebrate Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday.

Speaking of Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian, the pioneer of the Chinese theater movement, he has the most glorious history in the Chinese theater scene. For more than thirty years, he has been fighting with a stubborn and resolute attitude. May 20th of this year is the fiftieth birthday of this great artist. In order to celebrate our theater pioneer and to provide a deep learning experience for a wide range of followers, this suggestion was immediately met with enthusiastic approval, and it was decided to re-stage "Huanghuagang" on the day of his birthday. At the same time, a "Hong Kong Theater Community Celebrating Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian's Fiftieth Birthday Charity Performance Committee" will be organized to be responsible for future work and to coordinate various aspects to move forward together.

Finally, Mr. Li Hua put forward a similarly meaningful suggestion, which is the spiritual mobilization oath-taking ceremony of the entire Hong Kong theater community. Everyone was very excited and solemnly agreed, and decided to convene the entire Hong Kong theater community at 9 AM on May 14th (next Sunday) to hold a spiritual mobilization oath-taking ceremony, and to organize a unified and sound theater community organization in Hong Kong.

This is really too exciting! In the blood-stained May struggle, Hong Kong theater workers will respond to the call of the motherland in the war of resistance with heroic and decisive actions.

### The Number of Registered Foreign Residents in Hong Kong Has Reached 5,000; Those Who Do Not Register on Time Will Be Punished; The Registration Forms for Chinese People Are Still Being Printed

The personal registration of foreign residents in Hong Kong is progressing smoothly. As of now, 5,000 people have been registered, reaching 50% of the target foreign population in Hong Kong. The authorities hope to complete the registration by the end of next week. For the convenience of foreign registration, in addition to the Central District Registration Office, the General Post Office and the Hong Kong Tourist Association at Tsim Sha Tsui Pier have also been designated for registration. Both locations have various forms available. The authorities are no longer issuing warning notices, as foreign residents who do not register on time will be punished. The authorities are now asking shop owners to fill out forms reporting the employees who will continue to work in emergencies so that they can be assigned work when the time comes. The registration forms for Chinese people are currently being printed and will be available soon.

### Modern Urban Artery: The Active Transportation Lines of Hong Kong and Kowloon

Vehicles like flowing water, boats like swimming dragons, everything is available.

Regardless of whether the inner workings of Hong Kong are truly as so-called "civilized," the definition of "Hong Kong as a modern civilized city" has long been unconditionally accepted by the general public. Because it is "civilized," people of all classes are particularly keen to pursue luxury and vanity, and material enjoyment is especially "complete" and "flawless." Now, let's first talk about the transportation facilities in Hong Kong and Kowloon, which are related to it. However, this is only one of the thousands of material enjoyments.

Although there are still many things in the transportation facilities of Hong Kong and Kowloon that need to be criticized and improved in terms of spirit, in terms of material, there is indeed nothing to criticize. In terms of transportation, the larger scale and huge projects include mountain-climbing cable cars and trams running on flat ground, followed by public buses (referred to as "buses" in Hong Kong, similarly hereinafter), and rickshaws. These are several more popular ones. As for the so-called "aristocratic" ones, in addition to the private cars exclusively owned by the rich, there is also the "taxi": however, this is only an enjoyment for the bourgeois class, and the general public does not easily enjoy it. Furthermore, if you want to seek a different flavor and don't want to exert your honorable feet, you can also leisurely and arrogantly ride the "bamboo sedan chair" carried by two people, progressing in a "snail" style, allowing you to slowly appreciate the scenery; in fact, it is no longer a means of transportation.

Since the transportation here is so perfect, as long as your wallet has money, you can easily reach your desired destination without exerting your honorable feet. Therefore, those who are familiar with Hong Kong often proudly say to others that no matter how you walk in Hong Kong, you will never get "lost." However, this statement is only their personal "experience." In fact, newcomers to this "noble land" are still like lonely boats in the mist, at a loss. Especially since the start of our motherland's sacred war of self-defense against Japan, a group of compatriots seeking refuge have been added here. Most of them come from the north and southwest regions, and many of them have never even been to Hong Kong in their lives. Their understanding of Hong Kong is particularly distant and naive. In a situation where they are unfamiliar with the place and people, it is certainly a very difficult task to understand the complex social situation. However, even just understanding the general transportation situation is probably not easy without someone to guide them. "The Transportation Lines of Hong Kong and Kowloon" may be written specifically for them. In the eyes of old Hong Kong residents, this is naturally "showing off one's slight skill before an expert," but I think if it is seen by the general public who are unfamiliar with the place, it is exactly what they are looking for!

First, let's talk about Hong Kong. The "buses" here are operated by the China Motor Bus Company, with a total of seven routes: Route 1 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Happy Valley Line, passing through Connaught Road, Murray Road, Queen's Road Central and East, Arsenal Street, Wan Chai Road, Morrison Hill Road, Wong Nai Chung Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 2 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Taikoo Dockyard Line, passing through Connaught Road, Murray Road, Queen's Road East, Arsenal Street, Lockhart Road, Percival Street, Hennessy Road, Causeway Bay Road, and King's Road. Route 3 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Hong Kong University Line, passing through Battery Street, Des Voeux Road Central, turning onto Garden Road, Caine Road, Bonham Road. Route 3A is the Yau Ma Tei to Mount Davis Line, passing through Battery Street, Des Voeux Road Central, turning onto Garden Road, Caine Road, Bonham Road, Pok Fu Lam Road, Mount Davis Road. Route 4 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Queen Mary Hospital Line, passing through Battery Street, Queen's Road Central and West, and reaching the entrance of the newly built Queen Mary Hospital on Pok Fu Lam Road. Route 5 is the Kennedy Town to Tai Hang Line, passing through Sands Street, Queen's Road West, Central, and East, turning from Wan Chai Gap Road, Morrison Hill Road, Leighton Road, Caroline Hill Road, and reaching Tai Hang Tung Lo Wan Road. Route 6 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Stanley Line, passing through Battery Street, Queen's Road, and Queen's Road East, turning onto Stubbs Road, Repulse Bay Road, and Island Road. Route 6A is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Repulse Bay Line. Route 7 is the Yau Ma Tei to Aberdeen Line, passing through Connaught Road Central and West, turning into Eastern Street, passing Queen's Road West, turning onto Pok Fu Lam Road, and Island Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 7A is the Aberdeen to Stanley Line, passing through Island Road, Repulse Bay, and other places. The above routes have already interwoven and connected the entire Hong Kong area. As long as you have money, you can go anywhere you want. As for whether you want to take the "bus," "tram," "cable car," "rickshaw," or "taxi," that's entirely up to you.

Now, let's talk about Kowloon. The public transportation there is not as numerous as in Hong Kong. There are no trams, and there are no cable cars to climb the mountains. The most important ones are "buses" and "taxis," followed by rickshaws. The "taxis" there are divided into two sizes, the large ones are the same as in Hong Kong, and the small ones are limited to three passengers, but the fare is reduced to three corners per mile. This is probably for the economic considerations of passengers traveling alone or in groups of three. This is worth emulating by the "taxi" companies in Hong Kong. The buses running throughout the Kowloon and New Territories areas can be divided into the following routes - Route 1, Route 2, Route 2A, Route 3, Route 3A, Route 5, Route 6, Route 7, Route 8, Route 9, Route 10, Route 11, Route 13, Route 15, Route 17, Route 18, etc., a total of sixteen routes. The bus terminus is located at the Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordan Road Ferry Pier. The areas through which each bus line passes are divided into Route 1, Tsim Sha Tsui to Sham Shui Po, passing along Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, and Lai Chi Kok Road, and reaching the terminus of Sham Shui Po. Route 2, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Lai Chi Kok, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, Castle Peak Road, and with Lai Chi Kok as the final point. Route 2A, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Yau Tsim Mong, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, and reaching Yau Tsim Mong. Route 3, starting from Tsim Sha Tsui, passing through Salisbury Road, Chatham Road, Wuhu Street, Tak Ku Street, Ma Tau Chung Road, Kung Lok Road, Prince Edward Road, Kowloon City, Sai Kung Road, and reaching Ngau Chi Wan as the final point. Route 3A, starting from Tsim Sha Tsui, passing through Salisbury Road, Chatham Road, Wuhu Street, Tak Ku Street, Ma Tau Wai Road, Kung Lok Road, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road, and reaching Kowloon City as the terminus. Route 5, from Tsim Sha Tsui to the Jordan Road Memorial Arch, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Carnarvon Road, Kimberley Road, Austin Road, Austin Crescent, and ending at Jordan Road. Route 6, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon Tong Line, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 7, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon Tong Line, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Waterloo Road. Route 8, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon Tong Line, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Argyle Street, Waterloo Road. Route 9, from Jordan Road Pier to Yuen Long Line, passing through Jordan Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, Castle Peak Road, and reaching Yuen Long Market in the New Territories. Route 10, from Jordan Road Pier to Ngau Chi Wan Line, passing through Jordan Road, Shanghai Street, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road. Route 11, from Kowloon City to Lai Chi Kok Line, passing through Sai Kung Road, Prince Edward Road, Ma Tau Wai Road, Tak Ku Street, Wuhu Street, Chatham Road, Gascoigne Road, Jordan Road and Pier, Shanghai Street, Lai Chi Kok Road, Yau Tsim Mong Street, Castle Peak Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 13, from Jordan Road Pier to Ngau Chi Wan Line, passing through Jordan Road, Nathan Road, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road, and turning into Ngau Chi Wan. In addition, there are Route 15 from Yuen Long to Kam Tin Line, Route 17 from Yuen Long to Fanling Line, and Route 18 from Fanling to Sha Tau Kok Line. However, these three lines are already in the New Territories and are not within the scope of this article's discussion.

The "buses" running on the above lines are entirely operated by the Kowloon Motor Bus Company, which has a total of more than 130 vehicles of various sizes.

The land transportation is so perfect and complete. The sea transportation is also very satisfactory to us. Whether you are in Hong Kong or Kowloon, you can go to Tsim Sha Tsui or the United Pier, then the destination you need can be resolved immediately. The evolution of mankind is endless. Perhaps in the near future, Hong Kong and Kowloon will also have an aerial transportation network. (New)

### × Large Number of Amphibious Aircraft Arrive in Guangzhou, Attempting to Threaten Our Counteroffensive with Crazy Bombing, Heavy Losses in Gaoming and Heshan in Continuous Crazy Bombing, Jiangmen and Xinhui × Troops Hold Secret Meeting to Strictly Prevent Our Counteroffensive Military

[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] The × troops invading Guangdong are sinking deeper and deeper, facing a dilemma. Recently, due to the smooth progress of our counteroffensive, they were forced to seek help from Tokyo. It is heard that × has increased the number of amphibious aircraft coming to Guangdong in multiple batches, carrying out crazy bombing everywhere, attempting to threaten the northern counteroffensive military. Today (7th), at 8:00 a.m., under slight rain, one × aircraft risked flying to Qingyuan, Yingde and other places for reconnaissance for two hours, and retreated without dropping bombs. Also, after × captured Jiangmen and Xinhui, they have not given up their plan to invade the west. They continue to increase troops from Jiujiang, advancing along the Jiangmen-Foshan road towards Shaping and Longkou, attempting to invade Yangmei on the border of Gaoming, and planning to capture Hecheng first. Because they were discovered by our local troops, they launched separate attacks. Longkou and Shaping were gained and lost several times. The × troops of Sanzhou, Zhu Liuhe also made no progress. In recent days, they have sent × aircraft to frantically bomb the border of Gaoming and Heshan, attempting to reduce our resistance forces. According to information here, Shaping has been tragically bombed by × for days, several times a day. More than a thousand shops in the entire market have been reduced to ruins. Currently, only more than forty dilapidated houses remain. More than ten thousand refugees have no homes to return to, and the situation is extremely miserable. On the 5th of this month, Longkou Market, Yangmei Market, and Sanzhou Market were all ravaged by × aircraft. More than a dozen bombs fell near the market in Longkou Market, and two bombs fell in the first market. Sanzhou Market and Yangmei Market are important transportation routes between Gaoming and Heshan. This is the third time they have been bombed, and the disaster is even more tragic. More than a hundred civilians were killed or injured. Gaoming City has been bombed seven times. Most residents in the city go out early and return late, and all shops open for business at 4:00 p.m. Although they have been bombed this time, there were not many civilian casualties, it is said.

It is also reported that our main force, led by Division Commander Zhang and commanded by Division Commander Chen of the Guangxi Army, advanced along the Xinhui-Heshan and Xinkai roads, launching a counteroffensive against Jiangmen and Xinhui, and has approached various places in Fozi'ao, Da Xiaomei, and Shatidiqiao. × has increased its troops by more than a thousand, rushing to the outer line for reinforcements to defend against our counteroffensive. In order to cope with our main force's counteroffensive and maintain the two strongholds of Jiangmen and Xinhui, partnering with the Shun Tak × army to gradually implement the so-called policy of pacification, on the evening of the 5th, the Jiangmen and Xinhui × chieftains held a military conference in the × Army Club on Changdi Road in Jiangmen, discussing strategies to defend against our main force's counteroffensive, and preparing to build defensive fortifications when street fighting occurs in an attempt to resist stubbornly. The meeting was presided over by the Jinmaru Regiment Commander of the × Wujiu Mountain Division, with the participation of the Branch Commander of the 8th Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kazuki, Team Leader Fujita, and the manager of the × Shang ×× Foreign Firm. In addition to actively deploying defenses against our counteroffensive, they are also preparing to implement enslavement education, it is said.

### Our Main Force Advances in Separate Columns: Heshan and Other Places Have Been Recovered One After Another: Ou Jian Calls on District Chiefs to Handle Post-War Affairs

[Zhongshan Quick News] The × launched a large-scale invasion of Heshan, and successively captured Shaping, Hecheng and other places with a fierce momentum. For a time, the entire territory of Heshan was almost covered by ×. Later, our main force, together with local troops, advanced in separate columns and recovered the lost land in turn. Currently, except for a few remnant × troops on the Xinhui-Heshan Road, there are no × traces in the rest of Heshan. Ou Jian, the magistrate of Heshan County, specially moved the county government back to ×× and actively handled post-war affairs. According to a telephone call from Heshan on the 5th, Magistrate Ou of Heshan, considering that Shaping and Hecheng were tragically bombed by × aircraft, causing severe disasters, and that post-war disaster relief for refugees was urgent, specially summoned district chiefs in batches for talks, discussing the post-war work steps in various districts. The Heshan County Self-Defense Corps's universal training team has also been reorganized and supplemented, and is still sent to the front lines of Gubao, Gulao, and Haikou for garrison and alert, to prevent × from crossing the river again to invade, it is said.

### A Meeting with Yang Qianji, Commander of the 7th Security Regiment, a Hero of the Bloody Battles in Jiangmen and Xinhui

— Lin Ling

(Minge Society Jiangmen and Xinhui Frontline Correspondence) I went to the front line of Jiangmen and Xinhui twice, but I regretted not being able to meet Yang Qianji, the commander of the 7th Security Regiment who was fighting hard. This time, I went to the front line again, waited all night, and waited another half day. Fortunately, I met our glorious Commander Yang.

After more than a month of hard fighting, more than a month of exposure to the sun and rain, more than a month of mental strain, Commander Yang in the reporter's imagination must be thin and tired. However, after meeting him, the facts proved that the reporter's speculation was completely wrong. Commander Yang was still that tall, fat man, and his upright and broad face glowed with a slight red light. His two big eyes were rolling around nimbly, without any fatigue.

After shaking hands, the reporter expressed his infinite respect to Commander Yang, who was fighting for the people and the country. Commander Yang immediately interrupted the reporter's words and said,

"There, just as the old saying goes, 'raising soldiers for a thousand days is for use at one time.' If soldiers don't fight, then why does the country waste national funds to raise soldiers?"

Very good, the reporter respectfully asked about the course of the Jiangmen and Xinhui battles. Commander Yang graciously showed the map and explained in detail, briefly as follows:

"Our regiment was ordered to leave for the front line of Jiangmen and Xinhui on March 30. On April 1, we were ordered to counterattack Jiangmen. Immediately, the first and second battalions were sent to deploy defenses in the area of Duhu, and contact was made with the new special task force. Several regiments were assigned to the right wing, and the new Shun Task Force was assigned to the left wing. At about 2:00 p.m. on the 2nd, the New Shun Special Task Force was broken through by the × people. I immediately sent two more battalions to take over. In the end, because the × people concentrated their firepower and attacked fiercely, they retreated to the area of Guifeng Mountain and Ma Mountain. In the afternoon, the × people again used aircraft to cover and launched a joint attack on our position with tank vehicles, artillery, cavalry and infantry units. In order to avoid heavy sacrifices, we fought hard until 4:00 p.m. and took advantage of the heavy rain to retreat to the area of Dawan Liantang."

Speaking of this, a service soldier came to report and called Commander Yang to answer the phone. About ten minutes later, Commander Yang continued,

"After the 3rd, our army fought in the area of Pingdi Ridge and Da Xiaomei Mountain. On the 18th, our two battalions attacked the × people from both sides and recovered the Duhu area. On the morning of the 19th, we began to counterattack Duhu City again. The 7th and 9th companies attacked and entered Hougang, capturing two × artillery pieces. Because the × army counterattacked from Jiangmen and our reinforcements failed to arrive in time, we hastily destroyed the two artillery pieces with hand grenades, captured a telescope, and safely retreated back to the original position. The × casualties in this battle were particularly heavy. An artillery team leader was killed in battle, and Xie Yifan, the battalion commander of our 3rd Battalion, was injured. On the same day, another part of our troops rushed into the North Gate of Xinhui, killing many × people. There was fierce fighting in the Xinhui area on the 19th, and I once again rushed into Xinhui. For the next few days from the 20th to the 23rd, the fighting in Xinhui was still in a stalemate. On the 22nd, Zhong Yushu, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion, was also injured. In the more than twenty days of fighting, the regiment suffered 178 injuries and nearly 100 deaths, including two or thirty officers."

The service soldier came to report again. After the report, the reporter asked,

"What are the estimated casualties of the ××?"

"About four hundred people," Commander Yang replied.

"What is the comparison between × and our forces?" the reporter asked.

"At first, the × people had only about two thousand people, but later they gradually increased to four or five thousand people. As for our army, the New Shun Special Task Force and our regiment were the first to participate in the battle. But the number of people in the New Shun was very small. After being dispersed by the × people in the battle on Gangzhou Road, they rarely appeared on the front line. The reinforcements that arrived successively were the 3rd Security Regiment and the 10th Security Regiment. In addition, several main force regiments also arrived at a certain place on the front line," Commander Yang replied.

"Commander Yang, what do you think of the × people's ambition to invade Jiangmen and Xinhui?" the reporter asked.

"In my personal opinion, the only ambition of the × people is to seize Danshui Port, attack the West River, and threaten Guangxi. But the West River is heavily guarded by our army, and there are extremely many water mines along the river. It is difficult for the × people to cross it."

Speaking of this, Commander Yang handed a cigarette to the reporter. When the cigarette was lit, there was a moment of silence in the room. After a while, the reporter asked about the reasons why the counterattack on Xinhui could not be completed entirely. Commander Yang replied,

"Poor coordination between friendly forces is a major reason."

Following that, talking about the issue of cooperation between the military and civilians, Commander Yang said,

"The new people's movement work is not done well enough. Fighting in this area not only does not get the help of the people, but it is also difficult for our army. Also, there are especially many traitors here."

The service soldier came in again and handed a piece of paper to Commander Yang. After Commander Yang wrote a piece of paper, the reporter asked again,

"From this battle, how are the morale of our army and the × army?"

Commander Yang's reply was:

"Our officers and soldiers are brave in battle and regard death as home. The × are panic-stricken and extremely afraid of death in battle. There are many facts that can prove this. First, in combat, the × army retreats when our army charges twice. Also, there is a second more real example. Once, two brothers from the 8th Company ambushed in the Qizi Pit area and fought them, supported for three or four hours, repelled the × people, and returned safely. At that time, I saw it very clearly on the top of the mountain with a telescope. Later, each person was awarded three silver dollars." After a pause, the reporter asked,

"How is the supply for this battle?"

Commander Yang pondered for a moment and replied,

"The supply of food is not a big problem, but we still have two major difficulties at present. First, we lack medicine, so that soldiers who are injured have no medicine to apply, which increases a lot of suffering. Second, we can't buy rubber shoes with money. It is not good to walk without rubber shoes, which has a great impact on combat. We urgently need to solve this problem."

After finishing speaking, Commander Yang touched the pistol on his belt, loosened his belt, and asked the reporter with a smile,

"When will Mr. Lin return to Hong Kong?"

"I plan to go back in the next three or four days. What do you want to tell me?" the reporter replied.

"Nothing, but I hope that after you go back, you will appeal to the Hong Kong compatriots on my behalf that we are in urgent need of medicine and rubber shoes."

"Of course, this is my duty!"

Speaking of this, the reporter asked Commander Yang to write an inscription as a souvenir. Commander Yang said,

"My calligraphy is not good. I'll give you a photo instead."

Commander Yang wrote the following two sentences on the bottom of the photo he gave to the old reporter:

"If I die, the country will live; if I live, the country will die."

Comparing Commander Yang in the Jiangmen and Xinhui War with this inscription, it truly shows that Commander Yang is a hero of the War of Resistance. On the 3rd of May, 28th year of the Republic of China, at a certain place on the Jiangmen and Xinhui front line

### Twenty Hours in Shanghai with the Great Director William Keighley and His Wife

Mr. and Mrs. Keighley are on their honeymoon trip. However, they have been married for nearly a year. They departed from Hollywood, and the first country they visited was Japan. They arrived in Yokohama by ship and then proceeded to Tokyo. Their stay there lasted only two full days before they returned to Shanghai by the same ship. Yesterday afternoon, after disembarking, they stayed at Room 401 of the International Hotel. The staff of Warner Brothers Pictures in Shanghai warmly welcomed them. In the early afternoon, they, along with a Chinese gentleman, Mr. Feng, visited the war ruins in Zhabei. Around 4 p.m., they returned to Nanjing Road to purchase some Chinese goods. At 5:30 p.m., they returned to their residence. By that time, over twenty Chinese and foreign reporters, whom he had scheduled to meet at 5 p.m., had been waiting for a long time. At 7 p.m., they attended a dinner hosted by Warner Brothers. At 8 p.m., they went backstage at the Golden Theatre to watch Zhang Eyun's makeup session. Then, they returned to the front of the stage to watch a performance of "Yanmen Pass." At 11 p.m., they visited the Paramount, and Casanova, all three dance halls. The Hollywood trip was canceled, and they rested after midnight. This morning at 6 a.m., they boarded a U.S. naval vessel to catch up with the Empress of Japan, bound for Hong Kong. There, they will switch to a plane for a tour of the inland. He did not reveal the destination, but it is likely Yunnan and Sichuan. They will stay for a maximum of one week and then proceed to Saigon and Singapore before heading to various European countries. They are expected to return to New York around the beginning of July. This is his itinerary. His stay in Shanghai was only twenty hours, a truly fleeting visit.

Impressions of Japan

Mr. and Mrs. Keighley were surrounded by reporters! It was difficult to say a few words to him. We asked him about his general impressions of Japan, and he spoke cautiously, avoiding sensitive topics everywhere. He looked carefully at our faces and asked, "Are there any Japanese reporters here?" We answered, "No." He then said with relief, "When we met with the Japanese press for the first time in Tokyo, their first question was whether it was true that Hollywood stars boycotted Japanese silk stockings. I could only say that I was not very clear about that. I visited various film companies and found the equipment to be quite good. The costumes for historical dramas were beautiful, but the costumes for contemporary dramas were too poor, which I did not approve of. I don't want to say much else."

Visiting the War Ruins

Keighley had decided to visit the war ruins in Shanghai a long time ago, showing his great concern for the Sino-Japanese conflict. Yesterday, he spent three hours viewing the scorched earth remains of the resistance in Zhabei and Jiangwan. He did not express any specific feelings, but his tone conveyed pity, regret, and sympathy. In particular, when passing through a certain foreign concession, he felt very miserable seeing countless refugees being searched by the hideous faces of the invaders. He wanted to capture it on film but was strictly prohibited, which he deeply regretted.

Love for National Opera

Because his time was limited, we did not press him with many questions. We only asked three points: (1) Which of his past films was he most satisfied with? (2) What new films will he produce upon returning to the United States? (3) What are his views on Chinese cinema and drama? His answers were quite simple: (1) It does not depend on the nature of the film but on the quality of the script. I am more satisfied with "The Beggar Emperor" because both lead brothers were very good. (2) What film I will direct upon returning to the United States is yet to be determined. (3) I am very interested in Mei Lanfang's opera. I remember seeing his performances in the United States, and I felt that the music, costumes, and expressions were all very good. It is a pity that I don't understand it very well. This trip is too rushed, and I was unable to visit a Chinese film studio, which I regret. He also said that he used to know over forty Chinese characters, but now he only remembers "人" (person) and "田" (field). We laughed together, and after this, we shook hands and said goodbye.

### Representative Works of Hollywood Movie Stars

Deanna Durbin: Deanna Durbin has only made four films: "Three Smart Girls," "One Hundred Men and a Girl," "Mad About Music," and "That Certain Age." Among them, "One Hundred Men and a Girl" is the most perfect, as both the performance and content are vivid and meaningful. The music and singing, with Stokowski and Durbin, also have outstanding achievements. It is unknown how her fifth film, "Three Cheers for the Boys," will fare.

Baby LeRoy: Movie fans all know that since "The Milky Way," Baby LeRoy has not had any outstanding works. However, in terms of the overall achievement of his work, his debut, "A Son of the Stage," is even better than "The Milky Way."

Mickey Rooney: Mickey Rooney has a grand presence. Since "Captains Courageous," he has mostly starred in Hardy family films, including "You're Only Young Once," "Love Finds Andy Hardy," and others. "Love Is a Headache" is the third film in the Hardy series. Mickey's amazing talent, along with Shirley Temple, will be watched by movie fans worldwide. His most successful work is undoubtedly "Boys Town," which he starred in with Spencer Tracy not long ago. Hollywood cannot find a second child who can handle the role in this film.

Freddie Bartholomew: Freddie Bartholomew has acted in quite a few films, but the one that is firmly remembered by fans is "David Copperfield." In addition to discovering Tyrone Power, it is also the work that made this child star famous. Freddie's best work is undoubtedly "Little Lord Fauntleroy."

Shirley Temple: Shirley Temple has nearly twenty works. The most outstanding in terms of performance are "Little Miss Marker" and "Curly Top." Compared to the former, the latter is even better.

Norma Shearer: Norma Shearer is a first-class superstar. She makes one film a year. Any male star who can co-star with her considers it an unparalleled honor. Robert Taylor and Tyrone Power have both been selected once. In the general audience's impression, her most recent work, "Marie Antoinette," is the most tear-jerking.

Greta Garbo: Greta Garbo has also acted in many films, with "Camille" being the most touching.

Janet Gaynor: In the past, "Seventh Heaven" and "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" from the silent film era were considered Janet Gaynor's best films. However, recently, her collaboration with Frederic March in "A Star Is Born" is the only work that has restored her past reputation.

Bette Davis: "Jezebel" and "All About Eve" are both award-winning works for Bette Davis. If compared strictly in terms of acting, the latter is even better than the former. (To be continued)

### Husband, Wife, Friend

(5)

"Oh, Leanora, I can't! Hugo is coming here soon, and he's bringing a manager."

"Who?"

"A manager, dear, someone to prepare my travel arrangements."

Leanora said to her, "But—this—I thought it was over like this. I thought that's all you needed."

"But Leanora, do you think I should give it up when I've achieved such success?"

Leanora stared, thinking that she bore full responsibility for this "success"! He saw Byle in the corner, shaking his head worriedly. Mrs. Byle said, "Leanora, you should know that from today onwards, Doris no longer belongs to you, but to America."

Leanora left the dressing room in shock and returned to his office. Meek saw him enter and handed him the phone, saying, "There's a call."

The call was from the beautiful Madame Cavalleri, though he didn't know that she was indeed a very famous singer. If he really needed an expert's opinion on his wife's singing, she would be happy to provide it. She had attended the concert and asked if he really needed it.

"Of course, I want to hear your insights!" Leanora said. (To be continued)

### Public Baseball Game: Chinese Team Gets Off to a Bad Start, Chen Lunying Makes a Big Mistake, Losing 4-6; The Strength of the Minidianu Team is Equal to the Chinese, But Each Player's Hitting is Very Accurate

[Our Newspaper Special] The sun is lovely and also terrible. If you encounter it when its blazing heat is overwhelming, it will make anyone feel uncomfortable. It was just like yesterday when it showed its fiery face, shining on everyone and scorching the skin painfully. However, the leisure class did not take it to heart, only the general working masses who earn a living were troubled.

However, the general sports athletes are not afraid of the heat. Yesterday, among the ball games that were noteworthy, there was baseball and football. One by one, they were active under the umbrella-like friendly sun, devising and striving to win their victory. Many general fans also resisted the heat of the sun with their skin, standing or sitting in that uncovered place to watch, still not thinking it was bitter.

That baseball game started at 10:00 a.m., with last year's champion, China, playing against the Minidianu American sailors. These two teams are quite strong, and once they encounter each other to compete for the top spot, there will definitely be a fierce battle. Therefore, the "friends" of this sport all wanted to see what was going on and see who had the higher skills. The not-so-large viewing platform was packed with high-ranking guests, which was quite lively.

In the Chinese lineup, most were last year's champion figures, only missing Chen Dayao and Luo William, two famous generals, and replacing them with a few new players. Based on this, the strength is still abundant. Most spectators also thought that they would not lose to the Min team. Unexpectedly, the result of the competition was that they lost 4-6. They suffered an unfavorable start in their first expedition. Could it be that the prestige of last year's champion would disappear?

The biggest problem with China's loss was that in the second inning, while in the defensive group, Chen Lunying made a big mistake, which caused the promising situation to fall into a state of irretrievability. The hitting skills of each player also seemed less accurate than the American sailors. However, in this game, China scored seven hits, including one triple and two doubles, while the Min team only scored six hits and one single. In comparison, the so-called hitting was slightly worse than the Min team, but not entirely. In short, the blame for this defeat lies with Lunying.

Pitcher Huang Rongjun was the best performer in the whole game. When defending, he was able to control it properly. Every ball he threw caused the opponent's batter to swing and miss, resulting in nine strikeouts. Although there were also some walks, there were only two. It is a pity that these two walks were made in the second inning when things were difficult. Because of Lunying's big mistake, the team lost three points in a row in this inning, and the defeat was based on this. If fate is so, who can complain?

Rongjun's defensive advantages have been described above. When he attacked, he only batted three times, and all three times he got hits, one triple, one double, and one single. Such feats are truly commendable.

Catcher Lin Ye is most willing to use his brain. Every action reveals his intelligence. He also has agile steals. Therefore, although the battle was lost, it has nothing to do with the pitcher and catcher. In fact, these two were meritorious and without fault.

Lunying took first base. In the entire defense, except for the big mistake in the first inning, there were no other mistakes. However, he ran very slowly. Several times when he was the batter, the ball he hit was knocked out before he could run to first base. If he were more agile, he would not have been rejected three times. Surely at least once he could have reached a safe place.

Second baseman Hu Zhengqu's hitting was not calm enough, but his defense was quite meritorious. Third baseman Galahari is a Chinese expatriate who returned from Canada, so he uses this name. In terms of his skills, he is not very sophisticated, but only made one out, which cannot be taken as a definite conclusion. Let's see how he performs next week.

Shortstop Chen Fang has a good grasp of hitting skills, but has not improved in defense. Although he has arm strength and can throw the ball far, because the target is inaccurate, he made the mistake of a wild throw back to first base.

Left fielder Zhong Qiansen is a veteran with rich experience. He usually catches the ball well in the field, but who knows that in the sixth inning of yesterday's battle, he was deceived by the ball and went in the wrong direction. Not only did he not catch the ball, but he also allowed Elu to score a hit. It was truly unexpected. Center fielder Cai Bingfen also had a similar thing happen in the same inning, which can be said to be extremely coincidental. As for the two's hitting skills, Lao Cai is better, often using his rich experience to get to first base.

Right fielder Zheng Limen missed catching the ball once, but his hitting was quite good, without the disadvantage of striking out.

In my opinion, the hitting skills of the Chinese players are unquestionable, but they still need to work hard on defense. If they maintain it properly and reduce mistakes, I believe that one day they will have the possibility of defeating any team.

The Min team's pitcher, Lu Elu's skills, are really below Rongjun's, but the whole team's defense is tight, with second baseman Zha's being the best. First baseman Dejishili, because of his height and long arms, catches it with few leaks.

The competition process: In the first inning, the Chinese team was the defensive group and did not lose anything. When it was China's turn to be the offensive group, Chen Fang scored one point. At the beginning of the second inning, Rongjun failed to catch the ball, and first base was occupied. Then Rongjun threw two walks, so that all the bases had enemies. Unfortunately, Tali hit, and Lunying made a big mistake, so three people occupying the bases ran back, losing three points in a row. When it was China's turn, they did not gain anything. In the third inning, the Min team increased by one point. In the fourth inning, China relied on Rongjun's triple to return to position, returning a point of color. The fifth inning was a blank inning. In the sixth inning, the Min team scored three hits and gained two more points, while China relied on Rongjun's single to send Lin Ye back to position. In the seventh inning, China regained one point with a score of 1-0. The total score was 4-6, and China lost. The results are as follows:

### Public Lawn Tennis Singles Finals: The Xu Brothers Quarrel, See Who Will Be the Leader Tonight

[Our Newspaper Special] The All-Hong Kong Open Lawn Tennis Singles Final will be held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club at 4:45 p.m. today. The opponents are Xu Nuopei and Xu Runpei. The two are brothers. This time they encounter each other to compete for the championship, and fans mostly expect that there will be no quarrel between them, or that they will have a spirit of courtesy. However, those who know say that the two will definitely not just play a "romantic ball." Because the older brother has enjoyed a great reputation for a long time, but the younger brother has not yet had a taste of success. Therefore, he cannot help but covet the singles championship. However, ambition and ability cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Whether the younger brother's ambition can reach a successful path today remains to be seen how their struggle will end.

It is still remembered that in last year's hard court tennis match, the two of them also got the right to the final like this time. Therefore, when it came to the championship battle, many people thought that the older brother would show mercy and give the younger brother a chance to ascend the throne. However, as a result of the final, the older brother was better in skill and finally won the championship, and did not use sentimental feelings.

This time, they have again jointly advanced to the position of competing for the championship, so even though they are brothers, it is predicted that there will be fierce competition. However, how much is the younger brother's skill still inferior to the older brother's? Based on this speculation, the older brother is more likely to win. However, the two's ball skills have reached a wonderful realm, so after the competition, there will definitely be many wonderful actions to satisfy the fans' eyes. (East Lang)

### Repulse Bay Beach: Swimmers Can Still Set Up Tents

The rumor that the government prohibits citizens from setting up private swimming sheds and tents on Repulse Bay is still rampant. The swimming season has now arrived, and this issue is of concern to people who like to swim in Repulse Bay. According to the Secretary of Public Works, Mr. Kirk, the government has not made this decision. Although the swimming season has already started on the 1st of this month, the beach committee has not yet completed its work. The last meeting may be held in a short period of time. According to well-informed sources, the committee will not make the construction of prohibiting the establishment of private swimming areas, because this decision will inevitably cause repercussions from all parties. However, it is believed that the construction site of Repulse Bay's current swimming sheds will be relocated this year.

### Tonight's Basketball Court: Continuous Good Show, Four Strong Teams Meet: Starlight Island Meets South China, Bell Sounds Fights the East: The Question of Victory or Defeat, the Prospect of the Championship is Extremely Important

......[Our Newspaper Special] This year's men's basketball game has now entered the stage of intensive preparations. Tonight's order includes two games in Group A and one game in Group B. At 6:30, the Bell Sounds team in Group B will fight Huaxiong. At 7:30, the Starlight Island team in Group A will meet South China. At 8:30, the East team will fight the Bell Sounds team.

......After defeating the East team, the Starlight Island team has a great chance of winning the championship. Judging from the current situation, the only team that can compete with Starlight Island is South China. Therefore, the meeting of the two armies tonight is no less than a championship final. If Starlight Island can defeat South China, then the championship seat will be stable. If not, then the night will be long and dreamy. Who the championship belongs to will still have to be determined in the future. Therefore, this battle is related to the matter.

......In terms of the strength of both sides, Starlight Island has many generals, and they are all powerful members of last year's champion Youth Association team. They also have the advantage of location, and the connection is pure and skillful. Even the powerful East team was defeated by them last week. South China's fighting power is also very abundant. They have always emphasized connection in combat and are a team with wonderful strategies. Compared to Starlight Island, there is no distinction, but the bottom-line attack is not as fierce as Starlight Island's. Tonight, when the two heroes meet, and because the relationship between victory and defeat is important, they will inevitably fight hard with each other, so it is not possible to predict who will die.

......In the last game, the East team fought the Bell Sounds team. The strengths of both sides are also equal, and the importance of the question of victory or defeat is no less than that of the second game. Because the winner has great hope for the runner-up seat. For this reason, this battle must also be fierce.

......Although the East team was once defeated by Starlight Island, its strength is strong and well-known. However, the Bell Sounds team is also a strong team. Its previous victory over Starlight Island was its most proud masterpiece. Tonight, it will negotiate with the East team. Each wants to take the victory. The fierceness of the competition is expected, and it is difficult to predict who will win.

......In the Group B battle, the strengths of the two armies are equal, and there is also something to watch. However, Huaxiong's shooting is more accurate, and it is more certain to win.

......The Basketball Association believes that the four strong teams will meet tonight, and the audience will definitely be crowded. In order to maintain order, the tickets will be increased uniformly. The downstairs seats are one dollar, limited to 200 tickets. The upstairs is 50 cents, limited to 400 tickets. Except for the six teams of that night and the honorary certificates that can enjoy free visits, the remaining team members can purchase half tickets to enter the venue. (Upstairs is 20 cents, downstairs is 50 cents.) The lineups of the four strong teams are as follows:

Starlight Island: Zhong Ziqiang, Liang Guofeng, Pan Yaojun, Chen Shibin, Dai Fucheng, Li Peiyan, Li Peichi, Xin Zhongjian, Lu Zhenxuan, Li Shijie,

South China: Xiao Jiemin, Lu Enjing, Shi Zhenzhi, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xinqiu, Qian Jinghui,

Bell Sounds: Chen Ruzheng, Shen Ruiqing, Guo Zhihong, Zhang Rensheng, Li Hengfen, Su Bohui, Guan Yun, Fou Foqiang,

East: Diao Nianhua, Xu, Sun Shiqing, Huang Fen, Chen Zongqi, Luo Jiyan, Lao Xiong, Guo Neng,

Yesterday's Results

In yesterday's three Group B games, Chenguang abandoned the game in the first game, and Lingying won without labor. In the second game, the International team defeated Guanlei by seventy-five to fifty-two. In the last game, Chunfeng defeated the Qing team by fifty-two to eight.

### Chinese Staff Association: Organizing a Special Sports Committee, Adding a Women's Department

The Chinese Staff Association believes that members are immersed in hard work in the office all day, and their mental consumption is great. Therefore, they pay special attention to sports to protect the health of members and wash away the shame of sick men. Currently, the board of directors has appointed Lu Yan, Liang Kunpei, Huang Ruihe, Li Shengguang, Ye Jinzhen, Liang Zhicheng, Song Guoming, Zhang Chaoyun, Zhao Ziping, Chen He, Huang Ruixian and other eleven people as members of the special committee.

In order to facilitate the promotion of women's work, a women's department has been specially set up. The board of directors yesterday appointed Huang Lvping and other three people to draft the regulations of the department.

### Yesterday's Football Exhibition Match Was Lackluster: Eastern Wins Against Australian League - Australian Team Lacked Coordination, Lost 2-1

The match between this year's football league runner-up, Eastern team, and the Australian League team took place as scheduled yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM at the Hong Kong stadium. Although the Australian team came with the confidence of defeating the Manila Inter-Port team and the Singapore Chinese team, intending to easily defeat Eastern, the runner-up's strength proved to be formidable, showcasing true skill. In the first half, they took the lead with a score of 1-0. The second half ended 1-1, resulting in an overall victory of 2-1 for Eastern.

The weather that day was sunny and warm, with lush green grass. Chen Lanfang performed the opening kick-off ceremony to signify the importance of the event. Football fans, considering it a noteworthy occasion, were eager to witness the match. Ladies attended, creating a market-like atmosphere, and ticket sales were quite impressive.

Ho Cho-sheng, the Chinese interpreter and player for the Australian team, was originally scheduled to come to Hong Kong with the team. However, due to a left leg injury sustained while representing the Hu Ke team in a friendly match against the British Navy last Wednesday afternoon, he was unable to participate. With its lineup incomplete, the Australian team negotiated with Eastern, requesting Jiang Shan-jing to play for the Australian team. Meanwhile, Zou Wenzhi, who was originally scheduled to assist Eastern, unfortunately suffered from a carbuncle and was unable to attend. Li Deqi's foot injury had just recovered, and although he played, he still felt discomfort while moving. Consequently, Zheng Yingquan was called upon to fill the left midfielder position, and Huang Wengui was hired as the left winger.

Reviewing the strengths of both sides during the match, Eastern proved to be superior. Han, Zeng Zhongyun, and Luo Weiquan all performed steadily, with a good midfield line. Although the forward line showed occasional flair, their coordination was extremely disjointed, especially Yu Qia Xing.

On the Australian side, apart from Shen Dushi replacing Ya Maipeng and Shan Jing replacing Zuo Sheng, all other players started as planned. Goalkeeper Jia Hualu's performance was average. Inside defender Luo Badu outperformed Shan Jing. Midfielder Ya Luoshu was the best, being a standout figure in the whole team. However, the left and right midfielders were weak, lacking cooperation with the forwards, and frequently making aimless passes. The two wings of the forward line were quite lively, and center forward Ji Lilu was also fierce and agile. However, all players lacked shooting skills, and their coordination was inferior, leading to defeat.

The match itself was uneventful and lacked intensity. Initially, the Australian team attacked quickly and aggressively, but their front line failed to respond effectively, often missing opportunities. Later, Eastern recognized the opponent's weaknesses and attacked strongly. Qi Xiang scored a goal, ending the first half.

The second half was also uneventful, with both sides exchanging attacks. There was much running around, but only messy play. Over ten minutes into the half, Yu Qia Xing scored a goal in front of the goal, breaking the deadlock. The Australian team, having lost again, launched a strong counterattack and eventually scored a goal by the center forward, ending the match with a score of 2-1. Eastern won against the visiting team. The teams were as follows:

(Eastern Team)

Liu Han, Luo Weiquan, Zeng Zhongyun, Zheng Yingquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shidu, Huang Wengui, Yu Qia Xing, Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu

(Australian League Team)

Jia Hualu, Luo Badu, Jiang Shan-jing, Ke Tuohua, Ya Luoshu, Sousa, Xiao Luobi, Shen Dushi, Ji Lilu, Gao Lasu, Li Gu

### On the Youth Self-Renewal Movement

— Wen Yu

The celebration of this great Youth Day by the student community throughout Hong Kong on "May 7th," and the launch of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement, is an epoch-making event, a battle song of all Hong Kong youth!

Perhaps, does the "self-renewal" of youth mean that youth have committed sins and must "repent"? No! Youth, a generation young and innocently pure, are inherently clean and bright. They possess vitality, passion, and ideals, and naturally, they also have shortcomings. No one is a god, and everyone has flaws, but there are no sins. The so-called "self-renewal" means discarding the old and establishing the new. The Self-Renewal Movement is a conscious movement of discarding the old and renewing the new. Therefore, we must first affirm that the Youth Self-Renewal Movement throughout Hong Kong is not a short-lived and unsustainable action following the tail of politics. The Youth Self-Renewal Movement should be regarded as a cultural movement throughout Hong Kong, responding to the new enlightenment movement in the motherland, and serving as an exchange for the new enlightenment movement.

The Youth Self-Renewal Movement, as the name suggests, is a self-renewal movement of youth from all levels of society, not only encompassing young students but also including the broader youth community outside of it. However, we cannot deny that it is proposed and led by young students themselves, acting as the mainstream of the movement.

Judging from its guiding principles, the content of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement naturally involves eliminating bad habits, overcoming backwardness, and striving for progress. This progressive action requires the self-awareness of youth, the arming of youth minds, and the enlightenment of youth thought, which can only be achieved through enlightened progress.

Therefore, in this process of resistance war and national reconstruction, all Hong Kong youth, in order to obtain the new life they deserve, develop their strength to advance the giant wheel of resistance war and national reconstruction, and prepare to serve as the true masters of a free and new China, should regard the Youth Self-Renewal Movement as an opportunity for ideological cleansing and enlightenment, which is the current priority!

Historians point out that the two major characteristics of the European Renaissance were: "the discovery of man" and "the discovery of the world." Now we demand: to know the world, to know ourselves.

The unfolding of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement is a manifestation of the increasing self-awareness of youth, a new endowment of the times, and it is inevitable rather than accidental. It should be a development with a future rather than a fleeting moment. During the resistance war, every youth in the motherland is watching and caring about the resistance war, and being educated and awakened under the flame of the resistance war!

To care about the motherland's resistance war is to understand the motherland, to understand the present of the motherland is to understand the past of the motherland, and from understanding the past and present of the motherland, to see clearly the future of the country. This is the ideological arming that youth should have. However, China is China of the world. The world is facing a struggle between two major camps and a contradiction between two major groups of people. The motherland's resistance war is also one of them. There are forces of light growing in the world, and there are also demons wreaking havoc, and all of these are interacting with the motherland. Therefore, to understand China, one must understand the world, and regard China as a part of the world. The times are moving and leaping forward rapidly. The progress of one second is dozens or hundreds of times faster than before. We should understand the world, grasp the times with reason, in order to keep up with the times, not fall behind, and move forward as the vanguard of the times!

Being able to understand the world allows one to understand oneself; being able to understand oneself even better allows one to understand the world, and to elevate and develop one's own strength. Youth, the youth of semi-colonial China, the youth of China in the struggle for freedom and liberation, must understand themselves. The youth of Hong Kong, apart from a progressive few, the Youth Self-Renewal Movement must renew youth, breaking free from all superstitions, ignorance, dogmatism, and the quagmire of blind obedience, returning to the pure self, recognizing the self, and seeing clearly the self's historical mission at present!

The Youth Self-Renewal Movement should be a continuous cultural movement, not a short-lived, superficial, or window-dressing movement.

The Youth Self-Renewal Movement should enable youth to know themselves and the world. Only with ideological reform and arming can they discard the old and renew the new. Only through ideological cleansing and enlightenment can they develop reason and overthrow all superstition, ignorance, dogmatism, and blind obedience - only such a Youth Self-Renewal Movement can enable the vitality of youth to be developed and become worthy of being the masters of the new China!

We hope that the leaders of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement will expand their work extensively and work together with the cultural community!

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Luan

She looked at a corner of the room, muttering to herself. She fell into the garbage heap of the two, quick glory and pain, light and darkness. She chose one of them.

"What do you think?"

She did not answer.

"Hell?"

She shook her head, expressing denial.

"Heaven?"

She silently acknowledged.

"Then stand on our side," and discard your father's side—"

Although she still had some reservations, after receiving her father's reply in the evening, she made a firm decision. Because her father's reply meant this: if he did not reduce the amount of money, he would not hesitate to sacrifice his daughter. In fact, her father's words may not have been resolute, and it seemed only to threaten Yu Wen and his comrades to reduce a portion of the loss. In her opinion, she was uneasy. She felt an unprecedented hatred for her father.

"Traitor... traitor, no wonder people all scold you like that! You deserve to be scolded... a traitor loves money, not his daughter!... You are not my father, I have no father -- the daughter of a traitor has no father!"

She repented of the past, why did she live in a disreputable family? Why was she implicated by her father, the traitor of the motherland, and caused others to hate and be unfortunate? Why did she realize so late until now? She thought, cried, she seemed to be growing up in tears forever.

Yu Wen was by her side, explaining her father's reply to her, telling her that her father would come to redeem her.

"I know my father loves money. What if he doesn't redeem me?" (59)

### A Rainy Day Smile

— Kuangsha

The road was beaten into a mud dragon by water droplets, lying prostrate, crawling under the low eaves, extending to the end. The shadow of this reptile disappeared, revealing a wasteland - no, now it should be said to be a puddle. Some raised places have become small islands, on which are built houses mixed with broken bricks and broken pieces of wood. A moldy, humid smell, mixed with the stench from the gutter, makes it hard to believe that life can also reside here.

A somber and suffering face was pressed into the sound of rain, and a pair of hopeful eyes peeked out from the broken gaps. He looked at the blurred footprints on the muddy road, and he believed that his brother would run back from the muddy road.

If the weather were clear, he would also be a little hero. He could also roll around in the Suzhou River, scavenging for floating vegetable stalks and the like: climbing on the rafts to peel the bark off the trees, checking out tin cans in the trash cans, and secretly sneaking through the barbed wire to pick up coal cinders. The rain imprisoned his little soul. His father pulled a rickshaw, and his mother? Where did she go? It was said that she went to work, but she never came back. Anyway, as soon as he was born, his mother was gone, and she never comforted him or held him. He and his brother were a team, and he couldn't leave his brother.

I don't know how much water there is in the sky. The rain is falling non-stop, as if it's going to break the ground. The mud dragon is already lying in the water, and the puddle is slowly rising to the edge of the cave.

Rain, rain, rain, mixed with the heavy sound of trucks, rumbled past outside the barbed wire, carrying tall cargo, like a majestic beast, splashing the mud high.

He remembered these things very clearly: his brother had the ability to chase after the trucks and quickly poke a hole in the large burlap bags loaded on the truck, and quickly pull out a pile of cotton. The workers on the truck gave him a thumbs up and praised him:

"Good kid."

A pile of cotton sells for one cent in the small shop. If he has the chance, he can also earn a few cents.

The police came. His brother was whipped, and the cotton that he had earned with his life was confiscated.

"Brother, when we grow up, we will also become police officers."

"No!" his brother was a little angry, "Who cares? We want to do something else."

"We'll pull rickshaws, like Dad."

"I don't like it - I want to be a road construction worker and build all the muddy roads."

"Brother, I'll go too. We'll build all the roads, and we'll build this muddy dragon road especially well, as smooth as if it were paved, so we can walk on it easily."

Bare feet stepped on the mud dragon, leaving a mark. This footprint was deep, powerful, and rapidly expanding.

"Brother, brother, you're back!"

Raindrops hit his sparse hair.

### Embezzlement, Occupation, Theft and Others

— Zhang Zhenshan

In an unsound social system, the畸形phenomena that arise must have their objective factors. In other words, a person's wrongdoing is not innate. The growth of all sins is based on the deformed inducement in the real society. In a city where good and bad are mixed, people who generally lack the power of reason to control themselves are often confused by certain things, and take certain balls and objects as objects to realize their desires or entrust their emotions, so that they produce irreversible evil consequences. This is an undeniable general reality.

Shanghai City was originally a source of sin. Using cunning and deceptive methods to obtain material things is everywhere. The number of gambling dens that have moved to western Shanghai, and the impact they have on people with weak wills, have deepened the speed at which Shanghai creates sins, which really makes people shiver.

In recent months, when opening the social news section of newspapers, there have been daily reports of embezzlement, occupation, theft, and other consequences that occurred due to entering gambling dens, especially among salaried classes.

These salaried classes enter gambling dens. Besides a portion of gamblers who overestimate themselves, I think they must have a fluke mentality. In the present time of rising prices, the lifestyle of salaried classes is naturally quite poor. To expect to increase the enjoyment of material things is equivalent to 'drawing a cake to satisfy hunger.' Therefore, they open up other paths, hoping to enrich their lives with the acquisition of windfall wealth, and enter gambling dens. Unfortunately, the tragic consequences are simply blurred and vanish without a trace in their minds.

However, after entering the gambling den, no power can stop the growth and spread of sin, and no method can avoid producing evil results. They take their small salary income and go in, but not only do they have no hope of winning money by luck, they don't even have enough to stake. As soon as they lose, they are wiped out. Therefore, they want to recover their losses after losing, but the capital for doubling the bets is bound to be lost. Again and again, and again, they sink deeper and deeper. All the money they rely on to live is exhausted, and their lives cannot stop without food and clothing. Under such heavy pressure, distorted thoughts and actions are bound to arise as a result. Not long ago, there were reports in the newspapers that a bank clerk's embezzlement was discovered, a shop assistant's occupation was discovered, an accountant's deficit was a certain amount, and even wives and daughters' jewelry and clothing were pawned and damaged, and there were endless quarrels. Recently, it was also reported that a partner of a silk shop stole a number of rolls of silk and was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The roots of these phenomena are all the same, because of reporting to gambling dens. Some even use this money to gamble: as a result, they have tasted the flavor of iron windows, caused harm to their wives and children, and harmed society. The power of gambling dens is truly terrible!

This is still a visible fact. Other facts that have not been announced by the newspapers are even more numerous. The number is several times more than those sentenced to several years or several months of imprisonment, right? This kind of social evil is partly due to the畸形social system, and partly due to the general lack of determination, the inability to dominate themselves, knowing that there will be no good results, but still 甘不韙try. What's more, this kind of gambling den is still cultivated under the enemy's forces! For the sake of the present, it would be good to fundamentally eradicate this gambling family that kills people without using a knife. Secondly, I also hope that people will be vigilant and not be too obsessed. At the same time, I hope that employers will pay full attention to the poverty-stricken lives and actions of their employees, so that they can prevent problems before they occur, and not try to remedy them after the event, which is a win-win method. If embezzlement, occupation, theft, etc. are caused by entering and exiting gambling races, and they are clamoring in society, the personal personality and reputation will be bankrupt, and the employer's side will also inevitably expose the shortcomings of imprecise management and unsound internal organization.

### My Song

— Jinxi

From a sea to an island,

My worn-out clothes

And my open chest!

The breath of a wanderer

Deeply dyed on my body.

I am not afraid of wind, not afraid of rain,

Not afraid of winter and cold frost and snow.

A burst of fire, a burst of thunder,

A burst of frenzy, a burst of cries,

Burning in my heart;

Like burning,

I persevere, loving those

Wandering, homeless

Melancholy, poor,

Those injured and humiliated by × people,

The vast compatriots,

In the moonlit night, in the daytime,

I swear, I shout,

I am a friend of truth,

I am an enemy of robbers,

I am a wanderer, I am

A lover of justice, a lover of the weak.
