### The Political Implications of the Japanese Invasion of Hainan Island

In recent months, rumors have spread in society that Japanese spies have begun infiltrating the Hainan Island area. Those who are paying attention to the Sino-Japanese war situation have asserted that Japan will soon attempt to invade the island. It is generally understood that before any military action, Japan first establishes a network of spies, and at the same time, espionage work becomes particularly active. Sure enough, the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island at dawn on the tenth. Japanese militarists attempted to invade Hainan Island once before in June of last year, but the British and French governments jointly issued a serious protest. At the same time, France deployed a substantial fleet to stand guard. Japan, recognizing that the international situation was unfavorable to it, temporarily retreated in the face of difficulties. When the German-Czech crisis was at its most severe last September, it also concentrated its fleet, attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to invade. However, with the conclusion of the Munich Agreement, the European war was 'quelled' invisibly, and its conspiracy was therefore not realized. But why did it dare to rashly invade this time? Our observations suggest that its functions and reasons include the following points:

First, after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese army, on the one hand, was weakened by its troop strength, and on the other hand, was busy replenishing and reorganizing. For these past three months, military operations have been almost at a standstill. Recently, although there have been attempts to attack the Northwest to cut off the Sino-Soviet international route, and to attack Beihai, invading Nanning, and severing the Guangxi-Vietnam transportation lines, our side had made thorough arrangements in advance, and their cunning plan ultimately failed. Now is the time for the opening of the 74th session of the Japanese Diet. For nineteen months, the Japanese army's invasion of China has been unsuccessful, its finances are on the verge of bankruptcy, and its diplomacy is trapped in a situation of being besieged on all sides. The end of the war is nowhere in sight, and at present, it is truly a case of "unable to fight on, but unable to stop." The Japanese people feel extremely frightened and anxious, gradually moving from the stage of war-weariness to the stage of anti-war sentiment. The intensification of the revolutionary crisis deepens day by day. For example, recently, anti-war actions by Japanese soldiers on various battlefields have gradually become more active. In this session of the Diet, Seiyukai party member Kono and others have launched fierce attacks against the Hiranuma Cabinet, even openly criticizing the "Hiranuma Cabinet supported by military fascism as the most unpopular cabinet in Japanese history." All of this indicates that the Japanese people have lost confidence in the war, and the military government is on the verge of collapse. Under these circumstances, the Japanese military's proposed huge budget of 725 million yen for this year will inevitably provoke fierce debate in the Diet, which is difficult, there is no doubt. Therefore, the Japanese militarists had to seize this opportunity to create a new incident, on the one hand, to stimulate their demoralized national spirit, and on the other hand, to make it easier for the military budget to be passed in the Diet. This is one of the reasons why they invaded Hainan Island. In particular, the navy, since the July 7th Incident, has repeatedly advocated southward invasion in order to overshadow the army's achievements. In addition, this year's naval budget is only one-third of the army's. In order to increase the budget, the navy is even more impatient and proactive than the army in invading Hainan Island.

Second, strategically, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island can control Hong Kong, threaten French Indochina, Singapore, and the Philippines, and cut off the communication lines between Britain, the United States, and France with the Far East. Therefore, the attempt to invade Hainan Island has been carefully considered by the Japanese headquarters for more than a day. In the past, although there have been several attempts, no active actions have been seen because the diplomatic strategy adopted by Japan towards Britain and the United States during the war was the so-called appeasement of the United States and rejection of Britain. Once Hainan Island is occupied, it will not only cause a great backlash from Britain and France but may also arouse the antipathy of the United States because the Philippines is threatened. This is a major reason why they have hesitated to take risks for more than a year. On December 4th of last year, President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the 76th session of Congress, advocating that democratic countries should jointly sanction aggressor countries, followed by advocating the amendment of the Neutrality Act and the establishment of a defense of Guam. American merchants also refused to sell airplanes to Japan. The cooperation between Britain and the United States, which was considered difficult to achieve, has gradually become more concrete with the changes in the international situation. The joint action of democratic countries seems to have reached a mature stage. It can be seen that Japan's appeasement diplomacy has failed. In addition, British and American loans to China have become more active. The Japanese militarists, finding themselves in this situation of being unable to advance or retreat, simply hardened their hearts and took a great risk, dreaming that if they could achieve their threatening goal, Britain, the United States, and France might make concessions and cut off assistance to us. This is also one of the reasons why they invaded Hainan Island.

Third, since Barcelona fell into the hands of the rebel army supported by Italy and Germany, Italy's position in the Mediterranean has become increasingly dominant. Mussolini's demands for French territory have become increasingly tough. Observing the recent Italian military buildup in northern Libya, one knows what its intention is. As for Germany's movement for the return of its colonies, it has not been relaxed, and the promotion of the eastward expansion policy is still very active. In order to implement the international aggression policy of the German-Italian-Japanese axis, echoing Germany and Italy in the East and West, Japan had no choice but to carry out the attempt to occupy Hainan Island. From the Japanese army's invasion of Hainan Island, it may be that a more serious crisis than that of last September will soon break out in Europe.

On the tenth, a Japanese naval spokesman said: "Japan's occupation of Hainan Island has two purposes: (1) to strengthen the blockade of military supplies, and (2) to defeat China as soon as possible and end the war." This is just a self-deceiving trick and not its true intention. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam and Guangxi-Vietnam routes, our country has two other routes for foreign communication, namely the Sino-Soviet and Yunnan-Burma routes. If it is said that occupying Hainan Island can block China's import of military supplies and defeat China as soon as possible, then that is simply a daydream!

### The Youth Salvation Movement in Chaoshan

— Zhang Wenqiang

The local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside, relying on feudal forces, run rampant in the countryside, extorting from the people. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, they have not restrained themselves in the slightest. The tyranny of the local bullies directly oppresses the people, so that the people in the rear who have not yet been devastated by Japan feel that the abhorrence of the gentry power is even greater than that of the Japanese. The unconscious behavior of the local bullies in the countryside is an obstacle to mobilizing the people.

In order to consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese national united front, the youth of the west, the struggle against feudalism, can only be carried out within the limits of destroying the united front. For the gentlemen in the countryside, try to avoid unnecessary occasions, often endure and deal with them, hoping to improve their political awareness and use their superior position to call on the people to fight to the death against Japanese traitors. However, avoiding friction should also have a limit, and the salvation movement should not be allowed to be destroyed in order to avoid friction. If someone wants to destroy the salvation movement, the salvation workers should deal with him with a spirit of struggle that is suitable for the environment. For the extortion and oppression of the unconscious squires, the salvation youth, in order to exert the anti-Japanese strength of the people, cannot but prevent it passively or actively. Therefore, the Qing Dynasty Movement, the feudal forces, it is inevitable to conflict. In the countryside, the considerable strong opposing forces have become an obstacle to the Qing Dynasty Movement.

Factional prejudices have not yet been eliminated in Chaoshan. Due to the lack of propaganda, the truth of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is still not clearly understood by many people in Chaoshan. When it comes to the Communist Party, some people still want to talk about tigers changing color, so the squires often put the "red hat" on the heads of the salvation youth as a means to destroy the Qing Dynasty Movement. The Qing Dynasty Movement is referred to as the activity of a certain political party. This kind of slander has indeed delayed its development a lot. Fortunately, the obstruction of feudal forces has gradually decreased with the expansion of the united front and the intensification of Japanese attacks.

Mobilizing the people is such a gigantic task. This kind of work, in Chaoshan, is mostly to be borne by the youth. Because the work is too heavy, I feel that my strength is too weak, especially the lack of cadres.

Before the War of Resistance, because the political environment did not allow the open development of the salvation movement, very few active elements in Chaoshan youth participated in the salvation movement. In the great era, only a few youths with a history of work can afford the cadre work, so the lack of cadres is felt everywhere in the broad Qing Dynasty Movement. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, although many strong cadres have been cultivated in the actual struggle. However, the salvation work has also become more difficult with the progress of the War of Resistance, and the scope of work has become wider and deeper. The difficulty of the lack of cadres still exists.

Financial constraints are also a not small difficulty, which has prevented the progress of the Chaoshan Qing Dynasty Movement. Most of the members of the Qing Dynasty Resistance Association in various places are unemployed and out-of-school educated youths. They do not attach importance to personal interests and contribute all their energy to the salvation work. They cannot maintain their own lives and can only pay extremely light membership fees. Except for a few foreign affairs work that have achieved relatively good financial success, most of the Qing Dynasty Resistance Associations in various places have financial difficulties that have prevented the progress of the work. For example, the Qing Dynasty Resistance Association in various places wants to open night schools to educate the people, but they cannot raise money to buy ink, water, and paper, so there is no way to proceed. Many, many jobs often stagnate because there is no money. Financial difficulties are indeed a considerable difficult problem in the Chaoshan Qing Dynasty Movement.

The Central Task of the Present Stage

Chaoshan is the front line of national defense. After the fall of Guangzhou, it can also be said to be the rear of the Japanese. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Chaoshan, under the threat of the Japanese Navy, has revealed a serious crisis. Following the development of the situation of the War of Resistance, Chaoshan is increasingly approaching the crisis of war.

In the first stage of the War of Resistance, our military authorities have decided to implement a comprehensive strategy, that is, to launch extensive guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, maintain an enlarged area, and not fight with the Japanese for points and lines. There are no important cities or important military strongholds in Chaoshan. If the Japanese come to attack, we should not fight with the Japanese in positional warfare and regular warfare, but use guerrilla warfare to exhaust the Japanese, eliminate traitors, and defend Chaoshan.

As the War of Resistance expands further, Chaoshan will become a guerrilla area for burying the Japanese. The people's salvation movement in Chaoshan should take the preparation for guerrilla warfare as the central task, and the Qing Dynasty Movement, which is the central force of the people's salvation movement, should also fight for the preparation for guerrilla warfare. Based on this understanding, the Chaoshan Youth has actively prepared to launch guerrilla warfare, as the central task of the current stage.

When the Japanese come to attack, if the people are not fully prepared, they will inevitably present an abnormally flustered and chaotic state. In the chaotic state, it is possible to immediately launch the armed people's guerrilla warfare. The current preparatory work has an urgent need, and its achievements are sufficient to determine the future guerrilla warfare.

Chaoshan has several excellent guerrilla bases, such as Nanshan between Chaozhou and Huiyang counties, Fenghuang Mountain between Anxi and Jieyang counties. The Sangpu Mountain, which stretches between Anxi and Jiexi counties, and Tongziyang in Raohe County, are all Red Army bases during the civil war, which can be used as the general camp of the guerrilla team in the future Anti-Japanese War in Chaoshan. The Chaoshan Youth has already carried out the work of arranging the above-mentioned several future guerrilla team bases. The current people's movement work especially focuses on the training and organization of the people near the various bases, in order to consolidate the periphery of the various bases. The Shantou Qing Dynasty Resistance Association has sent out three working teams to the vicinity of Sangpu Mountain to carry out the people's movement work. The Qing Dynasty Resistance Association in various places also carries out its work according to the same policy.

The more deeply the salvation work of the Chaoshan Youth goes into the people, the more difficulties it encounters increase in degree; cadres are more lacking, the obstruction of feudal forces is more increasing, and the funds are also more difficult. The Chaoshan Youth is currently fighting to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties. First, intensify the training of cadres. Although the training of a strong cadre must go through work training, the cultivation of basic knowledge is also necessary. The Qing Dynasty Liaison Office and the Shantou Qing Dynasty Resistance Association once opened a short-term training class to train cadres, giving lectures on guerrilla tactics. The three subjects of international politics and the Three Principles of the People, increasing the basic knowledge of the trainees, can enable them to take on more work, receive more training, and become shrewd cadres more quickly. Second, promote the expansion and consolidation of the united front. After the warning of the rumbling artillery and the rattling machine, the Chaoshan people will definitely be able to recognize the meaning of being in the same boat even more. The Chaoshan Youth can take this opportunity to eliminate all internal friction; to make it more smooth. After the work of promoting the expansion and consolidation of the united front has achieved results, the problem of financial difficulties will be easily solved. If the enthusiasm of the youth's work has won the sympathy of the entire society, and people from all walks of life can recognize the value of the youth's work, then it will not be difficult to raise funds for how much work to prepare.

The Chaoshan Youth is making the greatest efforts to prepare for guerrilla warfare. The future fate of Chaoshan is largely determined by the preparatory work of the youth today. The Chaoshan Youth is making double efforts to intensify the struggle!

### Foreign Merchants Arrive in Hong Kong to Talk About the Recent Situation in the Old Capital. Toxic Substances Fill the City and Food Prices Soar. The Printing of Paper Money Is Rampant, and Its Use Is Forced.

[Hong Kong News] A foreign merchant from the Old Capital said yesterday that the recent situation there, according to the report, is that the puppet provincial government is actually a mere shell, and the Japanese army's power cannot go half a step outside the city gate. All the power in the city is in the hands of the Japanese army, and the soldiers are at odds with each other, seemingly united but actually divided, fighting openly and secretly, and not giving way to each other. The most intense competition among them is among the four giants, namely, the North China Garrison, the Japanese Military Special Forces, the Military Police, and the South Manchuria Railway Garrison. Personnel of the puppet organizations are in the middle, and they are often blamed no matter what they do. The Chinese army guerrillas ambush on the four outskirts of Peiping, attacking secretly from time to time, which is difficult to defend against. The Japanese army only dares to lie dormant in the city to seek safety, using the Japanese army, which calls itself new and scientific, to defend this ancient city for thousands of years, which is ridiculous and pitiful. The Japanese army is also worried that the guerrillas will attack the city, so it has stationed heavy troops at the four gates of the city. Once it is dark, the city gates are tightly closed, and there are times when they dare not open them during the day, such as Deshengmen. Since the Japanese army occupied Peiping, it has not been opened. Martial law can be declared at any time and anywhere. Whenever important Japanese military officials come to the city, the traffic in the city must be cut off for four or five hours. Military police search people's homes and have almost become a daily routine. Even in the middle of the night, they still push open the door and search. Moreover, the Japanese military police often do not enter through the front door when searching houses, but climb over the wall when people are unprepared. As for searching pedestrians, it is all-encompassing. They often use the excuse of inspection and . In November of last year, the Japanese army's military warehouse was burned. Afterwards, anyone nearby who had matches was suspected of arson and was arrested and interrogated severely. The Japanese-established puppet Federation in North China is preparing to , and the amount of paper money issued is difficult to estimate. There is no guarantee at all. Citizens are forced to use it painfully under their guns and swords. Prices on the market are extremely expensive, especially sugar. The price of chicken eggs is soaring, because the Japanese army has captured and killed almost all the chickens inside and outside the city, and the Japanese goods that fill the market, the citizens hate, most do not want to buy. All the large-scale businesses in Peiping have been confiscated by the Japanese. Opium dens are everywhere, and such toxic substances as heroin and white powder are even more readily available. The Japanese have also established Japanese residential areas around the city. All houses and shops within the scope must be sold to the Japanese, and the price is freely estimated by them. The news media are as silent as cicadas under their iron hooves. The news published all comes from the Japanese side. The telephone company has become a Japanese military espionage station. Any telephone conversation that is slightly suspicious will be traced and arrested. Therefore, the citizens are all afraid of suffering unwarranted disasters, and most have had their telephones cut off.

### Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Inspects Kailuan Coal Mines

### The Battle for Hainan Island Will Cause Serious International Disputes. Wang Zhengting Talks About the United States' Policy of Assisting China. Britain and France Continue to Discuss How to Deal With the Situation in the Far East.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] The French Foreign Ministry confirmed the saying that French warships are anchored near Hainan Island, saying that French warships went there to find out the situation on the island and the actual situation of the Japanese army's occupation. French officials claimed that the French warships near Hainan Island have no demonstrative nature. It is not unusual for French warships to travel between their territory of Guangzhou Bay and Tokyo Bay. It is reported that Britain and France are still continuing to discuss how to deal with Japan.

[Associated Press, London, 11th] Regarding Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, the British government will announce its attitude when the House of Commons meets on Monday.

### Intense War in Northern Qionghai, Large Force × Flanking from Mountain Side, × Commander Kondo Arrives at Haikou

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 12th] The war north of Qiongshan is fierce, our troops are fighting valiantly, and reinforcements continue to land on the 12th, flanking Qiongshan from the side. Furthermore, Commander Kondo, Commander of the 3rd Destroyer Fleet, has arrived at Haikou.

Xinjiang Steamer Arrives in Hong Kong from Haikou, Shipowner Discusses × Invasion Situation

[Local News] Fierce battles continue to erupt on Hainan Island. Yesterday, the 10th and 11th, over twenty × warships gathered north of Qiongzhou, engaging in intense artillery battles with our Xiuying Fort. From morning till dusk, the sound of cannons roared without interruption. This news was brought by the Taizhan Shipping Company's Xinjiang vessel. The ship departed from Haikou at 1:00 PM on the 11th and arrived in Hong Kong at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Our reporter boarded the vessel to inquire about the situation in Haikou. According to the shipowner, the vessel arrived in Haikou from the sea at 7:00 AM on the 10th and anchored in the port. There were about twenty Japanese warships present. After 8:00 AM, they began an artillery battle with the Chinese military's fort. Simultaneously, over ten aircraft soared through the sky, and the sounds of bombing could be heard in Haikou. However, detailed information must be reported to the naval authorities before it can be disclosed. He redirected the reporter to inquire with the crew for more detailed information. However, he denied rumors about other ships, stating that the Xinjiang vessel was never questioned by × warships via radio in Haikou, and that it was communicating with the navy. The reason why cargo could not be loaded and unloaded was not due to any obstructive actions by Japanese warships, but rather because of the danger of artillery fire. Furthermore, the ship's clerk, Chen Xufang, told the reporter that the Xinjiang vessel arrived in Haikou early on the 10th. Haikou originally had no pier, so the vessel anchored in the port, which was very close to Xiuying Fort. There were over twenty × warships, among which about seven or eight were transport vessels with three smokestacks, each carrying around 500 × soldiers. The Xinjiang vessel arrived at 7:00 AM, and after 8:00 AM, the × warships began bombarding the Xiuying Fort. Our fort also returned fire. Simultaneously, × aircraft flew in to assist in the battle and bombed Haikou City. Until 11:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), the sound of cannons could still be heard. The × warships fired approximately over a hundred rounds. The Xinjiang vessel's initial anchoring point was very close to the × warships. Later, after the × warships began bombarding the land, they notified our vessel to move away, but our vessel ignored them. A × destroyer then sailed around the Xinjiang vessel's side before leaving. Our vessel used the radio to contact the Hong Kong office for instructions. It stayed overnight in Haikou and left for Hong Kong at 1:00 PM on the 11th. Due to the intense artillery fire, it was impossible to approach Haikou, so cargo could not be loaded and unloaded, and passengers could not disembark. According to another crew member, when the artillery fire stopped on the morning of the 11th, it was believed that × troops had already landed near the fort. Furthermore, the Xinjiang vessel arrived in Beihai from × Jiapo on the 8th and departed on the afternoon of the 9th. During these two days, × aircraft had been bombing the urban area of Beihai in shifts, several times a day, and the people there had already fled. It is reported that the Xiuying Fort in Haikou was built by Zhang Zhidong. The fort occupies a large area and has tunnels carved through the mountain as fortifications, with seven large cannons. In recent years, it has been greatly renovated and is quite strong. The fort is located in the fourth district of Haikou City and remotely controls the entrance to the Haikou port.

### Another Assassination in Shanghai

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 11th] In Shanghai, at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Yuping Road in western Shanghai, another shooting occurred on the 11th. The victim was Luo Yi, the owner of a certain coal company. In addition to being shot twice, his head was also violently hacked several times, so he died before he could be sent to the hospital. The government requested an explanation from Japan regarding the purpose of the Japanese military occupying Hainan Island and the time frame for occupying the island. Currently, the British and French governments are continuing to exchange opinions on whether to issue a joint protest, which will depend on Japan's response. If the response is the same as that of the French side, Japan's purpose in occupying the island is to cut off the flow of military supplies into China. Japan is only using this as an excuse. Continued attacks on France, but French officials two previously declared that no military supplies from Annam border, imported into the Chinese mainland,

### French Newspapers Comment: Japanese Military Invades Hainan Island, British and French Attitudes Will Change

[Reuters Dispatch from Paris, 11th] Last night, all evening newspapers vigorously stated that the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island has further complicated the situation in the Far East. "Times" stated, "Now, the question increasingly hinges on whether Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is temporary or permanent. If Japan attempts to permanently occupy the island, its violation of the spirit of the 1907 Franco-Japanese Agreement will be clearly evident. The Japanese military's occupation of the island has drastically changed the situation in the Far East, damaging France's interests, which cannot be ignored. France will naturally seek to address this. We greatly desire that Japan's intentions be clearly expressed as soon as possible, otherwise the British and French governments will inevitably be forced to change their attitudes towards the Sino-Japanese War."

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Paris, 10th] After news of Japan's landing on Hainan Island in China reached here, French newspapers immediately engaged in discussions. This move by the Japanese military is sufficient to create new problems in Franco-Japanese relations, because in the future, the Chinese government will be willing to maintain Hainan Island's status quo and never cede it to a third country. If the Japanese military occupies the island, the situation will inevitably change. Although Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy, provided assurances, stating that his country has no aggressive intentions towards French territories, French Vietnam feels threatened by the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island. To verify the actual situation, or regarding Hainan Island, Japan previously used the excuse that the French and Japanese governments did not establish any agreement, but in reality, the island belongs neither to France nor to Japan, so how could either side enter into an agreement regarding it? However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly exchanged opinions, and the Japanese authorities have repeatedly provided assurances, declaring that they have no intention of occupying the island. Now that the Japanese military has landed on the island, it has broken this promise and violated the diplomatic policy announced by the Japanese authorities, which aimed to preserve the interests of all countries in the Far East. After the French punishment, trust in Japanese actions has been greatly diminished. In light of this, Japan's request to send a new ambassador to France will inevitably become more difficult.

### Italian Newspapers Comment: Hainan Island's Position is Important, Territories of All Countries are Controlled

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Rome, 11th] The matter of the Japanese military landing on Hainan Island is currently being discussed by Italian newspapers. They assert that this move is sufficient to affect the interests held by major powers in the Far East. The official newspaper "Italian Daily" stated that after the Japanese military occupies Hainan Island, the territories of Hong Kong Island and the French-leased territories of Guangzhou Bay will be rendered useless. "Jiang Zeng News" stated that the Japanese government is calmly and resolutely awaiting any diplomatic actions by major powers. According to "News" (the newspaper of Foreign Minister Ciano), the nature of the Japanese military occupying Hainan Island is more significant than the capture of Dalian and Guangzhou City. The fall of Tianjin and Guangzhou only affects the economic interests of major powers, while the occupation of Hainan Island can alter the entire situation.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Remarks: Exposes ×'s Ambition to Control the Pacific, Points Out Hainan Island's Military Importance

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 11th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at the request of foreign journalists on the morning of the 11th, expressed his views on the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island as follows:

(1) Question: What is Japan's true intention in invading Hainan Island this time? Answer: Regarding the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island, we should observe it from the perspective of the entire Far East maritime situation in order to recognize its significance and the magnitude of its impact. Hainan Island is a major strategic center in East Asia for the Pacific and Indian Oceans. If the × military occupies the island, it will not only completely block traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore, cut off communication between Singapore and Australia, but also subject the Philippines to its control. This not only directly threatens French Annam, but is actually the beginning of completely controlling maritime power in the Pacific. If the island falls into the hands of the Japanese military, the Japanese navy can look to the Mediterranean Sea westward through the Indian Ocean, and cut off communication between Singapore, Hawaii, Pearl Harbor, and British and American naval bases to the east. Therefore, this move by the Japanese military is clearly a response to the US naval vessel's visit to Singapore last year.

(2) Question: Why is Japan's move the beginning of controlling maritime power in the Pacific? Answer: We all know that Japan has three most important strategic locations in the Pacific. In the north is Sakhalin Island, in the west is Hainan Island, and in the east is Guam. If Japan wants to obtain complete control of the sea, it cannot forget any of these three places. If all three fall into Japan's hands, the Philippines and Hawaii will be equivalent to being occupied by Japan. Now Japan already occupies half of Sakhalin Island, and now it is attempting to occupy Hainan Island to cut off the British navy's contact with the United States to the east. If this plan is not stopped, Japan will further seek to control Guam. This will not only prevent the US navy from moving westward, but also cut off communication with the Philippines. Japan has been plotting for thirty years to create a communication line between these three major bases in order to carry out its southward policy and dominate the Pacific. When Japan fabricated the so-called North Sea Incident in 1936, its intention was to use it as an excuse to invade Hainan Island. However, due to concerns about other countries, it did not dare to launch an attack. Now it has resolutely disregarded everything and openly invaded Hainan Island. If it is not intentionally provoking a world war, it is the last risky move in its military aggression against China. It has been delayed for decades, but once it is decisively implemented, it is not only the first and greatest event since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, but also the sole key to changing the Pacific situation in the last thirty years. Since Japan does not hesitate to reveal its ambition, countries that have the deepest ties with the Far East cannot allow this dangerous scheme to proceed unimpeded. It should be understood that in the entire naval force of Japan, Hainan Island is the second gateway for Japan in the western Pacific, while Guam is its second gateway in the eastern Pacific.

(3) Question: Then what is Japan's first gateway, that is, its most forward position, in the east? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek smiled and replied: This is already clear to Europeans and Americans. Americans must know it, so there is no need for me to say more.

(4) Question: How will Japan's occupation of Hainan Island affect peace in the Far East? Answer: To answer this question, it must be known that Japan's invasion of Hainan Island on February 10 of this year (1939) is equivalent to the occupation of PanYang on September 18, 1931. In other words, Japan's attack on Hainan Island has created a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific. The regions may differ between land and sea, but the impact is exactly the same. Recalling the Shenyang Incident, except for the then US Secretary of State Stimson, the authorities of other countries did not take any measures, so Japan was able to continue to expand its aggression. Up to now, eight years later, it has created a situation in which it brazenly dominates East Asia, increasing its arrogance in conquering the world. Now Japan is attacking Hainan Island again. If it is allowed to occupy and control it, I predict that in less than eight years, the naval and air force bases in its design will be initially completed. Then the situation in the Pacific will suddenly change drastically. France wants to establish a naval base in Annam, and even if the United States wants to engage in fortification on Guam, it will not be able to wait. Therefore, Japan's resolute southward advance is not intended to end the Sino-Japanese War, but to prove that it will not hesitate to take risks in the future to create the beginning of the Pacific War.

(5) Question: What arrangements does China have for Hainan Island? Answer: China lacks naval power, so it cannot exclusively defend the coastline, but it has long prepared all land arrangements, and will do its best to fight the × military on the island and will never allow it to easily occupy it. As for the Japanese military's invasion of Beihai, we have long had thorough arrangements and precautions, and will give it a strong blow. Furthermore, this move has no significance in the ×'s own war of aggression against China, and will only put it in a more unfavorable position, as is understood by general military observers.

(6) Question: How will the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island affect the Sino-Japanese War? Answer: The Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island will not have much impact on our country's resistance war, because the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War will depend on land military operations. The occupation of an island or not is fundamentally unimportant.

### China Orders New Fighter Planes from the United States: Extremely Fast Speed and Combat Power, the Best of Modern Fighter Planes

[Local News] Yesterday, the English weekly newspaper stated that according to reliable sources, the Chinese government has ordered a large batch of the latest "rocket-type" fighter planes from the United States. This new aircraft is the latest invention of scientists. The aviation industry calls it the "Bullet Plane" because of its bullet-like shape. It is produced by the famous Curtiss-Wright company. The speed and combat power of the new aircraft are the best of the fighter planes of various countries. Even the US Air Force has not adopted this type of fighter plane. With the Chinese Air Force obtaining this, its strength will be increased and it will be enough to control the × aircraft. Upon investigation, the structure of this new aircraft is based on the advantages of rockets and destroyers. The engine reaches 1,000 horsepower, the wings are 35 feet, and the total combat weight is only 4,000 pounds. The combat length is 26 and a half feet. The pilot's seat is inlaid with bulletproof steel plates. Its climbing power is very fast. If × aircraft attack, it can fly into the air within three minutes and fight with the ×. Within the first one minute and two seconds, it rises 5,000 feet, within two minutes and eight seconds, it rises to 10,000 feet, within four minutes and two seconds, 15,000 feet, and within six minutes, 20,000 feet. According to past experiences in China and Spain, aircraft usually drop bombs from an altitude of 7,000 feet, and rarely reach 20,000 feet, so the new aircraft's ability is sufficient to control and eliminate bombers. As for its speed, it can reach 300 mph at an altitude of 17,500 feet. However, this record is only based on official reports. Its maximum speed is definitely more than this. However, the US aviation authorities strictly maintain secrecy. The fuel storage capacity is 96 gallons, and it can support a flight of 600 miles at normal speed.

### Bombing in Transit Through Zhuzhou

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya

Re-meeting the old place of Xiangtan, I felt particularly cordial and interesting. As soon as I entered the city, I was full of hope and ran to the county government to find acquaintances, but they had all changed careers to serve at the front; but I didn't feel disappointed, but rather happy and congratulatory! Looking at the notices in front of the county government, the newly appointed County Magistrate Wang Jihui had only taken office for a few days. Mr. Wang is a respected local gentleman with a reputation for fairness. He has great aspirations to have a local person serve as a local official, and plans to mobilize all the able-bodied men among the county's 1.1 million people, give them strict training, and fully arm them to make a great contribution to protecting the country and defending their hometown. This is not a matter of temporary expedience, because the county's able-bodied men have been trained in the past, totaling × × tens of thousands of people, and their strength is already considerable. However, their age is 25 to 35 years old. In the future, it is planned to increase the age limit to 18 to 45 years old. In this way, the county can mobilize more than × × tens of thousands of able-bodied men. The public's anti-× sentiments are very high. Things like donating money and goods, comforting wounded soldiers, and supplying military orphans are all met with unanimous response and enthusiastic participation. The general public's life can generally maintain a petty bourgeois state. Laborers have increased job opportunities and increased wage income. For example, rickshaw pullers can earn about two yuan per day, and boatmen and porters can earn more than one yuan. Military orphans can get at least five jiao, so their lives are more comfortable than usual.

——The above piece of simple and unpretentious information was told to me by a county government clerk who was experienced in the ways of the world. Although this clerk's speech was a bit clumsy, his manner was very cautious, and he was a mature and prudent person who knew how to "manage a county." This conversation, although without any high-level discussion, gave me a very deep impression. I was waiting in a hall-style reception room in the county government. The clerk, wearing a leather robe, strode in confidently, first bowing deeply to me from a distance, then introducing himself by his surname and sitting down. A tall, strong man then followed in. The clerk seemed to want to introduce him, first looking at me, then looking at him, but in fact he did not introduce him. Instead, he calmly stood up, reached into his clothes, and after fumbling for a while, took out a foreign dollar, and asked the strong man to buy a box of cigarettes and several betel nuts to entertain me—none of which I was lucky enough to enjoy, especially the extremely spicy betel nuts (made with lime and spicy medicinal materials). I had the experience of eating one and breaking my lips and teeth when I came to Hunan before (but the locals like to eat them like tobacco and alcohol, and they can help digestion). I politely declined. When the conversation began, at a crucial point, the clerk, with an attitude of "courtesy first, then force," asked me serious questions, saying that the county government had not received any official documents when I went to the county government to interview. So I quickly took out my "protective charm"—not a "thousand-person seam" but a military certificate—to show him, which cleared the clouds and allowed me to continue the conversation. At the same time, he waved his hand, and the strong man also disappointedly retreated.

It's no wonder he had to be so overly cautious; because in the previous month, someone impersonated a Shen Bao salesman, promoting Shen Bao in Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, and Shaoyang, saying how the Shanghai Shen Bao maintained its inherent spirit and resumed publication, and how the Hong Kong Shen Bao struggled to expand its content. In order to make it easier for readers in the mainland to subscribe, they specifically sent people to promote it, and so on. The reason was quite convincing, so some institutions and schools directly subscribed to it. Only after not receiving the newspaper for a long time did they realize they had been deceived. The reporter immediately drafted an advertisement, explaining that this newspaper never sent people to sell it alone, and sent it to the local newspaper for publication to prevent future troubles.

I stayed in a hotel overnight, and there were actually "uninvited guests," singing prostitutes, who successively entered the rooms of travelers, using the excuse of livelihood difficulties, and asked to sing to cheer them up. One traveler couldn't refuse and lost his temper, saying: "What livelihood difficulties or no difficulties? This is simply like Wang Jingwei's plea for peace, deceiving yourself and others, who cares about your tricks!" This gentleman was quick-witted and cursed the prostitute, even dragging Wang Jingwei along with him. It can be described as ingenious; however, I feel sorry for the sweat of Wang Jingwei!

It is convenient to travel from Xiangtan to Changsha by water and land. I wanted to go to Miluo to inspect first, so I took the train east to Xiangqian to Zhuzhou, and then transferred to the Han train north. The Xiangqian Road to Zhuzhou is connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road. The two roads have one direct train to each other every day, which can smoothly pass through Jinhua, Zhejiang to the east, and will reach the Qianbian × × to the west. Zhuzhou is the central station of the north-south and east-west main lines in central China, so it is naturally inevitable to be bombed and harassed by the × people. The station has been bombed into ruins and walls, and the repair shop has also moved elsewhere. Dozens of nearby hotels and shops have been burned and bombed, leaving only a pile of rubble and ashes. The shops and residential buildings here are mostly built of wood. Once they are bombed and burned, the disaster is extremely tragic! However, although × aircraft are constantly wreaking havoc in Zhuzhou, the bombing is aimless and has never hindered the transportation on the two roads. Moreover, our general railway employees (not only Zhuzhou Station) are able to work diligently and have a spirit of sacrifice. As soon as they learn that the track, bridge, or roadbed has been bombed, they immediately transport and repair it according to the principle of repairing it as soon as it is damaged, and rush to repair it in a very short time. The train is also equipped with a radio to listen to the alarm at any time, so that the train can be stopped (if it is near a cave, it will retreat into it), so that passengers can take refuge in the mountains and fields. Therefore, the result of the × aircraft's threat to the two roads for 18 months has no impact on the military on both sides, but it only exposes its brutal behavior and inspires our hatred of the enemy.

While waiting for the train at the station, I unexpectedly met three wounded soldiers who had just arrived from Shanghai. So we chatted under the weak morning sunlight. They were subordinates of Hu Zongnan who were severely injured during the Battle of Shanghai and only recently recovered. They were taken care of by the × × Relief Committee, who disguised them and sent them to Wenzhou by boat, and then they took a car to Jinhua and transferred to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi train to safely arrive here. They were determined to return to their team in × × Province to continue the war of resistance. They said: "After our army moved west from Shanghai in the winter of the year before last, there were about 20,000 wounded soldiers left in Shanghai and the concession. Except for the very few who went missing or died of illness, the rest have been treated and sent to various war zones in batches. However, the number of people who took the initiative to find ways to join the Jinghu guerrillas nearby is also very considerable. Of course, they were injured in the battle in that area, so they are particularly familiar with the terrain. Now they have joined the already powerful guerrillas, and it is not a boast, it is really 'adding wings to a tiger.' No wonder the general × army and traitors are so frightened that they still have to touch their heads in the middle of the night to see if their heads have moved!"

Just as we were talking with great interest, we suddenly heard a long and majestic alarm. This seemed like an alert and loving hen, discovering that a fierce and incomparably ferocious bird of prey had flown into the sky, and quickly called to protect her innocent chicks, and sent all of us scattered people into the solid air-raid shelters!

Inside the shelter, we actually heard "bang bang bang" sounds six or seven times, but when we came out after the all-clear, we only saw that a pile of salt on the platform had been bombed a little, and two or two empty civilian houses outside. In addition, a few old bomb craters were leveled. As a railway supervisor said when he went to check, speaking in a Henan accent: "× his sister! What's the point of bombing Zhuzhou all day long!" The implication was that it was superfluous to even bother to come and check.

### Germany Invites French Foreign Minister to Negotiate European Issues; Spanish Cabinet Continues to Discuss the War Situation; Rebel Forces Advance Towards Valencia

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] The German government has once again invited French Foreign Minister Bonnet to visit Germany in the near future for discussions with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on general European issues, particularly Central European issues, the Spanish issue, and Italy's natural desires. The French government previously dispatched Coulondre to Germany last week for talks with Ribbentrop. Coulondre has now returned, and regarding the report on the discussions, it is said that the German Foreign Minister stated that he had previously come to France to sign the Franco-German non-aggression declaration, and Bonnet's visit should therefore be a natural consequence.

[Associated Press, Perpignan, 11th] The Spanish government cabinet convened a meeting in Valencia to discuss the ongoing war situation and other important issues, and to strive for aid from Britain and France, as well as international sympathy.

[Central News Agency, Madrid, 12th] Various responsible authorities of the Republican government have already returned here, and Spanish officials have expressed a warm welcome. The residents here are extremely calm.

[Reuters, Madrid, 12th] The Spanish cabinet held a meeting yesterday afternoon, but what was discussed is unknown. Foreign Minister Del Vayo estimates that approximately 400,000 Catalan refugees have now fled into France.

[Reuters, Burgos, 12th] The political situation in Spain has now been replaced by military developments. The recent major victories of the rebel forces have created the main reason for their establishment of power. A spokesperson for the rebel side told a Reuters reporter: "Everything will continue to be proven by facts. As in Catalonia, we will treat the enemy fairly, without bias. Sooner or later, when the people of Madrid and Valencia thoroughly understand our wishes, the war will naturally end." Declarations by important Spanish government figures vowing to fight to the end are met with skepticism here, but the rebel side also seems unwilling to compromise. The rebels express satisfaction with the legal recognition of the Franco government by Britain and France. They say that this recognition is most appropriate at the present time, without waiting for the complete annihilation of the government forces and the complete withdrawal of Italian and German volunteers.

[Reuters, Barcelona, 11th] The Spanish rebel authorities have announced that the port of Barcelona is open, and the sunken ships in the port (bombed by rebel aircraft) have been cleared. They also stated that the Argentine government has decided that the Negrín government no longer exists.

[Associated Press, Perpignan, 11th] Franco is currently commanding a large army to advance towards Valencia, hoping to crush the last resistance of the government forces in one fell swoop, and has sent heavy troops to attack the Gaohan area to cut off the traffic lines between Valencia and the central areas. The rebel forces have also dispatched aircraft to continuously bomb, causing much damage to houses. The British ship "Fortune" was also hit. Although the government forces are determined to resist to the end, the general public believes that the future situation is quite dangerous.

[Haitong Agency, London, 12th] According to unconfirmed reports from Madrid yesterday afternoon, the British ship "Fortune," with a deadweight of 1,250 tons, was hit and sunk during a rebel air raid on Valencia.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 12th] Approximately 300,000 Spanish Republican government soldiers and civilians fled to France last week, including over 160,000 militiamen, who are currently detained in concentration camps in Argelès-sur-Mer, Saint-Cyprien, and Villegailles. There are also 18,000 in the Bram camp. Another 15,000 militiamen are currently crossing the mountain roads of Arles and Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste and will arrive in French territory. The additional motorcycle guards and gendarmes dispatched by France have gradually begun to withdraw since Saturday and have been transferred to various concentration camps to take responsibility for surveillance.

### US Navy Begins Exercises Today; New Battleships to Participate; Situation More Comprehensive Than Last Time

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The largest naval exercise in American history will begin on the 13th to test America's defense capabilities against an attack on America from Europe and Africa. The exercise area extends from the Caribbean Sea to the Amaxon River estuary in South America. 140 warships and 600 aircraft will participate. The ships and aircraft are concentrated in Guantanamo and are scheduled to depart for designated locations tomorrow morning. A portion of the fleet will attack the Panama Canal and other strategic locations. All countries passed by the American fleet are presumed to be either friendly, neutral, or enemies. How they are designated has not been announced. The results of this exercise attacking Panama will serve as the basis for strengthening Panama's military fortifications. A naval authority stated that the difference between this exercise and the previous large-scale Atlantic exercise is that everything has been improved. In the large-scale exercise held in 1934, because America's new shipbuilding plan had just begun to be implemented, very few new battleships participated. Now, America has added 435 new warships, so the situation has completely changed.

### Public Memorial for the Pope Begins Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Rome, 12th] The grand ceremony for the enshrinement of Pope Pius XI was held here yesterday. The sacred remains were placed next to Pius X.

[Associated Press, Vatican City, 11th] The remains of Pope Pius XI are currently lying in state in St. Peter's Basilica. All Catholics are permitted to enter to pay their respects. The Pope's remains are covered with a deep red sleeveless cloak, dressed in a white woolen bishop's robe, draped with a white and gold papal stole, wearing a gold mitre, and with a bishop's ring on his finger. When the Pope's remains are moved, diplomatic personnel from various countries and important officials will line up in the shape of a cross to lead the procession. The period for paying respects has been set for nine days, starting today. 50,000 people are waiting outside the basilica to enter and pay their respects. Vatican sources say that the successor will be a "religious figure" rather than a figure with political leanings.

### Dutch Defense Minister Drafts Military Expansion Plan; Strengthen Border Garrison Units; Construct Fortresses and Build Ships Extensively

[Haitong Agency, The Hague, 12th] According to an official report yesterday, Dutch Defense Minister Van Dijk has drafted a memorandum on a military expansion plan, which has been submitted to the Upper House. According to its contents, the units of the Dutch border garrison must be strengthened. New defense line projects and fortress construction will continue. Its form will not imitate the heavy artillery fortresses of the Maginot Line. However, due to the nature of the land, the construction of local airports has been realized. Regarding the defense issues of the Dutch East Indies, the Netherlands has decided to follow the major naval powers such as Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Italy, Japan, and Russia, and build ships on the largest scale. Efforts will be made to expand and modernize the naval air force. The light fleet will also be greatly enhanced, and civilian merchant ships will be increased, as in wartime preparations, so that they can be converted into auxiliary cruisers. The government is also striving to support industrial development for military equipment production. Small-caliber guns and artillery will be manufactured domestically. Storage depots for food and military supplies will be protected from air raid damage.

### US Defense Budget Delayed in House Due to Death of Roman Pope

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The House of Representatives, due to the death of the Pope, decided to postpone the discussion of President Roosevelt's proposed $552,000,000 defense budget until the 14th.

### The Danger of Japan

— Translated by Bao Ren

New York INTERNATIONAL PRESS

Author J.H.ROBiNSON

If we can observe even a little, anyone would know that the situation of life-and-death opposition between China and Japan has undergone drastic changes. After Guangzhou and Hankou were successively occupied by the Japanese army, China's attitude towards resistance became even more resolute than before. This bloody war has aroused the roar of the Chinese people; the whole country can unite as one to protect their country. Millions of farmers and young students, under the guidance of the Chinese command, are carrying out mobile warfare and flanking warfare. They have already received large-scale training and organization in this art, which makes Japan lose all important meaning in the land it occupies in China. Therefore, the occupation of new land only increases Japan's difficulties at the front and in the rear, making its aggressive steps against China more and more frantic and chaotic. Here, we will expose the dangers and weaknesses of Japan.

The greatest danger of Japan during wartime lies in the economic aspect, and the most obvious phenomenon in the economic aspect is the contradiction between Japan's domestic light industry and heavy industry, which is becoming increasingly acute due to the war. The so-called light industry here refers to textiles, papermaking, canned food, etc., most of which can be called civilian-needed industries. The so-called heavy industry refers to guns, artillery, airplanes, etc., most of which in Japan can be called military-needed industries. In the past ten years, in order to compete with the great powers and realize its ambition of continental policy, Japan had to accelerate the development of its heavy industry. The main reason for the previous armed occupation of North China was also to seize raw materials for military manufacturing. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japan's need for these raw materials has become even more urgent, and it has had to spend a large amount of gold to purchase them from abroad. Light industry has been hit hard by the abnormal development of domestic heavy industry, and it has declined sharply, like a river flowing downhill.

During the Hayashi Cabinet era, the government actively developed the military-needed industry, so this period can be called the preparation-for-war period. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it gradually changed to the all-out-war period. Until the appointment of Itagaki as Minister of the Army, he declared that the Sino-Japanese War might have to be extended to ten years, and Vice-Minister Tojo, based on the instructions of the Tokyo Imperial Conference on December 20, stated even more clearly that Japan was eager to prepare to deal with the Soviet Union. From the above facts, we can know that Japan's current situation actually contains the dual nature of all-out-war and preparation-for-war. Because of this reason, the new slogan of "national defense and military needs" of the Japanese is more clamorous than before, and the abnormal development of its heavy industry is like a blind man riding a blind horse, with the danger of collapse at any time. In the past, during the Hirota Cabinet era, Japan wanted to implement the policy of both people's livelihood and military preparations, but it failed. The Hayashi Cabinet obliterated people's livelihood and focused on military preparations, but it was only a temporary solution. Although the Konoe Cabinet was able to continue to obliterate people's livelihood under the pretext of war, this method is by no means a long-term solution for stability. The main reason for the recent resignation of the Konoe Cabinet and Finance Minister Ikeda is nothing more than a reflection of Japan's economic difficulties.

From the Mukden Incident to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, in the short span of six years, the increase in capital of Japan's civilian-needed industries decreased from 65% to 38%. During the same period, the increase in capital of Japan's military-needed industries increased from 35% to 62%. After the outbreak of the war, the Japanese authorities more actively encouraged investment in heavy industry. In September 1937, 2.1 billion yen of private investment was designated for heavy industry, and of this amount, 62% had been invested in purely military-needed industries by the end of last year. As for the war expenditure allocated by the Japanese government, at least 30% was consumed on raw materials for heavy industry. The current government has set the following amounts for war expenditure: 1937...2,530; 1938...4,850; 1939...5,000 (in millions of Japanese yen).

In addition to the war expenditure, there are also the regular expenses of the Army and Navy Ministries, which account for 50% to 60% of the Japanese government's budget. A portion of these regular expenses is also invested in purely military-needed industries.

Because the military-needed industry is encouraged by the government and at the same time promoted by the war, the total value of profits of Japan's domestic military-needed industry has also increased dramatically. According to the statistics published in the December 1938 issue of "Japan Review," the total value of profits of various military-needed industries in the first half of 1938 increased by 38% compared with the first half of 1937. Among them, the profit margin of the hemp industry increased by 48%, the shoe industry increased by 43%, the metal industry increased by 42%, the chemical industry increased by 41%, and the profits of the mining and machinery industries each increased by 34%.

Because Japan's heavy industry is abnormally expanding and light industry is gradually declining, the people's livelihood in the country is deteriorating, and complaints are rife. The people, seeing the military's aggressive atrocities and the suffering caused by the war, all hate war. The following two tables can show the general situation of the Japanese people's lives during wartime.

National Expenditures

1930-1932 1,588,800,000 Japanese yen

1937-1938 2,870,000,000 Japanese yen

Military Expenses

1930-1932 470,000,000 Japanese yen

1937-1938 2,400,000,000 Japanese yen

National Tax Revenue

1930-1932 805,000,000 Japanese yen

1937-1938 2,300,000,000 Japanese yen

National Debt

1930-1931 6,000,000,000 Japanese yen

1937-1938 10,000,000,000 Japanese yen

Short Commentary

### Strengthening Air Combat Capabilities

Our country does not have a strong navy, which has created the tragedy of thousands of miles of coastline being completely blockaded. However, the characteristics of our country's economy and society enable us to continue to support the war of resistance without being threatened by the complete blockade of the coastline.

Our country does not have huge air combat power, so in the nineteen months since the war of resistance, although our young air force has built world-shattering feats, due to the limitations of material conditions on the replenishment and development of the air force, it has not only failed to fully achieve the goal of assisting the army in repelling the Japanese army, but also failed to reduce the losses and sacrifices of the people in the rear, so in the new stage of the war of resistance, how to actively consolidate and enhance the air combat power is really one of the major tasks of the entire nation.

According to a Chongqing telegram from this newspaper on the 12th, our country is currently negotiating to increase the direct air routes between China, the Soviet Union, and France, and the air route between China and Britain will be realized at the latest by the beginning of next month. According to Hong Kong news, in order to replenish the air force, the new-style fighter planes purchased in the United States will be shipped here in the near future. It is also said that the anti-Japanese movement in France has been increasingly fierce recently, and the first batch of 18 aviation talents is already on their way east. What exciting news this is!

Our country's war of resistance is inseparable from the international anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement, especially with the current interests of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are completely consistent, and the outbreak of the Japanese attack on Hainan Island can further prove this point. Today, we must not only intensify the protection of the international transport lines on the southwest and northwest mainland, but also quickly realize and increase the air contact lines with democratic countries such as the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. And the mutual aid work of the anti-aggression air forces should also be promoted. We hope that the people will warmly support the government's policy of strengthening air combat power, and use action to promote this policy.

### Denouncing Recognition of Spanish Rebels

It is reported that the rulers of the United Kingdom and France are about to recognize the Spanish rebels and their puppet National Army government, and this will become a reality.

The democratic Republican government of the Spanish Popular Front is the universally recognized legitimate government; the Spanish rebels and the puppet National Army government are tools of the German and Italian aggressive countries that violate the general will of Spain and the will of the democratic countries of the world. We don't know where these rulers who are preparing to recognize the Spanish rebels and the puppet National Army government will place themselves?

However, it is difficult to blame these rulers for reason and justice, given that they proceed from the class interests of their financial capital leaders! What we want to solemnly point out is that the illusion of these rulers maintaining Spanish development rights and transferring the direction of the aggressors under the influence of Italy and Germany is just a nightmare. This nightmare will put Britain and France under the direct attack of European fascism. This nightmare will allow the oriental aggressors to take the opportunity to promote their "New Order in the Far East" and "Pacific Hegemony War"! This nightmare will further intensify the anti-movement within Britain and France, and make these rulers reap the consequences!

Our task, the task of all the world's righteous progressive people and the working masses, is not to sit back and watch these rulers reap the consequences, but to intensify our unity, unification, consolidation, and development of our own strengths, to use action to awaken this nightmare that endangers the world and mankind, and to use action to prevent the formation of these evil consequences.

### Renowned American Reporter Ernest Hauser Arrives in Hong Kong, Discusses Global Opinion Sympathetic to Our Resistance Against Japan; Transferred to the Philippines Yesterday to Investigate Various Parts of the Far East

During his few hours in Hong Kong, Mr. Hauser conducted a thorough investigation of the Chinese and foreign press in Hong Kong.

### Shantou Has Become the Only Import and Export Port in Southwest China: Trade Between Hong Kong and Shantou Has Increased Greatly; Cargo from Jiangxi Via Guangdong Is Completely Concentrated in Shantou; Trade with Hong Kong Has Increased More Than Fivefold

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Since the outbreak of the war in South China, Xiamen in Fujian and Guangzhou in Guangdong have unfortunately fallen successively, and the transportation and trade between the Southwest and the international community have been greatly affected. The only direct transportation lines between Hong Kong and the mainland are Fuzhou and Shantou. In terms of location, Shantou is closer to Hong Kong and has more frequent ship schedules. Therefore, trade between Hong Kong and Shantou has made great progress after the war. According to a prominent Shantou merchant in Hong Kong, Shantou has now become the economic hub of the three provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Fujian. All imports and exports of goods from the three provinces must be transshipped through this port. All the trade that used to be in Xiamen and Guangzhou is also concentrated in Shantou. Therefore, Shantou is concentrating the trade of three places in one place. Due to the impact of Shantou's economic prosperity, trade between Hong Kong and Shantou has also increased. The total trade volume has increased more than five times. In the past three months, goods transported from Hong Kong to Jiangxi via Shantou have reached more than 10 million yuan. The numbers for Shantou itself and various places in northern Guangdong are similar. Although Fujian is slightly less, the development of trade can be seen from this. Therefore, in the four months since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou's turnover has exceeded the total number of the previous year. Most of the goods transported from Hong Kong to Shantou and then to various places are daily necessities and foreign goods. At the same time, many local products from the mainland are also gathered in Shantou for shipment to Hong Kong. In recent months, all foreign goods in Jiangxi Province have been in short supply. Merchants in the province have rushed to Shantou to purchase goods to meet the demand. Since the fall of Xiamen, merchants in southwestern Fujian have also asked Shantou to replenish their goods. Therefore, Shantou's commerce is also booming. During the intense bombing of Shantou, the population once dropped to 40,000 to 50,000. At present, it has returned to its original state, and even increased. The current population of the city is about 130,000, and more than 10,000 passengers travel to and from the city every day.

### Hong Kong and Kowloon Residents Association Requests Authorities to Protect Businesses and Schools, Restrict Landlords from Forcing Evictions and Avoid Unreasonable Oppression

Since the Hong Kong authorities promulgated the regulations to protect tenants and prevent landlords from forcing evictions, the trend of forced evictions has been slightly curbed, and ordinary people do not have to suffer from displacement. However, the regulations only apply to people's residences. If businesses, schools, and offices are forced to relocate, the suffering is very serious, and some even lose their homes because of this. For this reason, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Residents Association held a standing council meeting last night and decided to petition the government to promulgate special chapters to protect schools, businesses, and offices. The matters discussed included (1) reporting matters, (A) announcing the previous resolution, (B) regarding the association's address, as the one found is not applicable, and it is necessary to choose another one, and (C) the petition to the government to protect businesses, schools, offices, and social groups. It was resolved that the association's general affairs director, Liao Bingquan, would consult with the association's legal advisor to submit the petition. (2) Proposed items (A) organize member publications to make members aware of relevant laws in Hong Kong, (B) discuss the number of members solicited for the first time and the extent of the association's constitution and budget, (C) association matters, roughly to petition the government, and it was resolved that the association's general affairs director, Liao Bingquan, would consult with the association's legal advisor to submit the petition.

### Fisheries Association Submits to Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Requesting Permission for Employed Fishermen to Return to Hong Kong Freely: Those with Badges May Be Exempt from Showing HK$20

Most of the Hong Kong fishermen are from the mainland. It is natural for them to miss their families at the end of the year. However, they mostly go to the mainland via Macau. Now there are many fishermen who are worried that they will not be allowed to land when they return due to Hong Kong regulations unless they have HK$20. Yesterday, they jointly complained to the local Fisheries Association and requested a solution so that they would not be refused entry when they returned to Hong Kong after returning home. The Fisheries Association submitted a report to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, requesting that from the 19th to the 26th of this month, all fishermen coming to Hong Kong from Macau who have a Fisheries Association card with a photo that matches their identity or wear a Fisheries Association badge be exempt from showing HK$20 and be allowed to land. The approval of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs is still pending.

### A Letter from Home Is Worth a Fortune! Mail Delivery to the Northern Guangdong Area Has Resumed: Transported to Shantou and Hong Kong Via the Shao-Mei Highway; All Areas in Western Guangdong Can Also Be Reached

Since Guangzhou fell into enemy hands, mail delivery between Hong Kong and the mainland, which passed through Guangzhou, has been interrupted. The two sides are cut off from each other, and those who miss their hometowns are saddened. According to a reporter's investigation, mail delivery between Hong Kong and the mainland, which could not be reached, has now been restored through the efforts of our postal authorities and the Hong Kong authorities. Areas in eastern and western Guangdong that have not fallen can now be reached. As for the northern Guangdong area, mail delivery was also interrupted due to the fall of Guangzhou, and news was completely cut off. Now the central postal authorities are making every effort to make it accessible, using the Mei-Shao route to transport mail. A trial run has been successful. After that, mail to the northern Guangdong area, such as Yingde, Qingyuan, Qujiang, Wengyuan, Qiannan, Xinfeng, Ruyuan, Yangshan, Lechang, Shixing, Renhua, and Lianxian, can be transported to Shantou and then to Hong Kong via the Shao-Mei Highway. Hong Kong mail can also reach northern Guangdong via this route. In order to ensure that mail arrives safely, our authorities have specially dispatched military postal officers to inspect and manage everything. From now on, news between Hong Kong and northern Guangdong will not be completely cut off.

### Hong Kong Authorities Expanding Volunteer Armored Car Unit to Enhance Defense Capabilities: Acquiring New Armored Cars and Assigning Commissioners to Train

With its refined skills and under the direction of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, the company is expected to make an even greater contribution.

### Four Pirates on Jiao Xi Sea Area: Disguised as Passengers, Hijacking Hong Kong-Sai Kung Ferry: Brandished Guns Mid-Journey, Threatening the Owner to Change Course to Ma Shi Wan: Stolen Cash and Goods Worth Over Three Thousand Yuan

The unrest on the river is now even worse. There have been repeated reports of cargo boats and fishing boats being robbed at sea. It was thought that the banditry had subsided, but during this Lunar New Year, there was an even more shocking incident. Four people dared to hijack a ferry traveling between Hong Kong and Sai Kung. Although the crew and passengers were safe, the value of the cash and goods stolen was over three thousand eight hundred yuan. The details of the hijacking are as follows:

Hong Kong-Sai Kung Ferry Threatened Daily

The Hong Kong-Sai Kung ferry travels between Hong Kong Island and Sai Kung in the New Territories. The ferry's berth in Hong Kong is in Sai Wan. It departs at 10 a.m. every day, arrives in, drops off passengers and cargo, sails out of Lei Yue Mun, and goes straight to Sai Kung. After arriving in Sai Kung, it returns to Hong Kong at 2:30 p.m. There are a total of eleven crew members on the ferry. The owner's name is Zheng Hanzhou (28 years old). The ferry carries about 30-40 passengers every day. The cargo coming to Hong Kong is daily food items such as live pigs, firewood, and vegetables. It has always been safe.

Disguised as Passengers, Brandishing Guns to Threaten

The day before yesterday (11th), the ferry sailed as usual. After unloading cargo in Sai Kung, it loaded passengers and cargo and returned to. In addition to 31 passengers, there were also a lot of salted fish, firewood, conch, live pigs, and other miscellaneous goods. After departing from Sai Kung, at around 3 p.m., it arrived at. Suddenly, on the Jiao Xi sea area, a middle-aged man wearing black shirt and trousers walked into the wheelhouse and immediately pulled out a short-barreled revolver, threatening the owner Zheng Hanzhou and his assistants, forcing them to ring the bell and turn the boat northeast. Mr. dared not resist and had to obey. At the same time, there were also three robbers on the deck. Two of them pulled out short-barreled revolvers, threatening the passengers and sailors in the boat. The other robber seized the kitchen knife on the boat to assist. These four robbers spoke with Cantonese accents and were extremely fierce.

Fishing Boat Arrives to Pick Up the Thieves

Before long, it arrived at Huoshi Island in Ma Shi Wan. The robbers ordered the boat to stop and immediately drove all 42 passengers and crew members into the hold, searching them one by one. All the cash, gold, and silver jewelry were looted. Passengers were also forced to hand over their slightly more valuable clothes. At this time, a fishing boat sailed over and docked next to the ferry. The people on the fishing boat then helped the robbers to move all the cargo and other stolen goods on the ferry onto the fishing boat. They immediately set sail towards Ma Shi Wan.

Loss of Money and Goods Reaches Over Three Thousand

Before leaving, the robbers fired shots into the air to demonstrate, claiming that they must not be chased, otherwise they would sink the ferry. After the robbers left, everyone dared to return to the deck. The ferry then sailed back to Hong Kong. It was already 10 p.m. It was still a long way from Hong Kong. Before long, when it sailed to the sea near Xie Po Chau, it saw police boat No. 1 sailing towards it. It signaled the Sai Kung ferry to stop. The detectives in the boat immediately boarded the Sai Kung ferry to investigate. The owner Zheng Hanzhou reported that they were robbed by pirates on the way. They then continued to sail back to Hong Kong. At around 11 p.m., it sailed to the Hong Kong sea area and reported the case to the Tsim Sha Tsui Marine Police Station. The total loss from this hijacking, including cash and ornaments such as bracelets and gold rings, was estimated at 3,000 yuan. The goods were worth about 800 yuan. The total was about 3,877.20 yuan.

### Air Defense Exhibition to Be Held in Peninsula

The Hong Kong Air Defense Authority held an air defense exhibition in August last year to raise awareness of air defense knowledge among people from all walks of life. It is heard that the bureau is planning to hold a larger exhibition in the Peninsula during the day and has appointed several committee members to be responsible for organizing everything. The date, location, etc. will be announced soon.

### Establishing a "Writers' Symposium" - Literary Workers Unite

— Tie Guang

Hong Kong's literary and art workers are now flourishing like bamboo shoots after rain. These literary and art workers are partly transplanted from mainland China and partly newly grown locally. Under the mutual reflection of the literary fruits transplanted from the mainland and those grown locally, Hong Kong's new literary movement will have a more solid future. But this requires the arduous efforts of literary and art workers.

Recently, a group of progressive literary and art workers in Hong Kong responded to the Chongqing "Literary Association's" general call for unity among cultural workers, and many comrades have since provided many practical suggestions. As a result, the issue of unity among Hong Kong's literary workers has sprung from the hearts of every literary worker. It is not only springing from their hearts, but also many active and enthusiastic individuals are working separately. Although there are no concrete reports on the progress of these activities, the steps are proceeding smoothly. As objective conditions mature, this undertaking of unity among literary workers will inevitably succeed.

Now, the first thing worth reporting to literary workers is that a group of active literary workers have begun preparations to organize a "Writers' Symposium." This "Writers' Symposium" will be a powerful institution for promoting the new literary movement and will bloom as a fighting flower of art on this desolate literary island. It is hoped that everyone will gather here and surround it.

The organizational staff of the "Writers' Symposium" only require that a person is able to write, and supports the War of Resistance and unity. It does not matter whether they are famous or unknown, old or young, or belong to any party or faction.

The central tasks of the "Writers' Symposium" are to study writing theory and techniques, study the new situation and new problems, and enrich the cultivation of each author. At the same time, it will strictly criticize and denounce all cultural work that is harmful to the War of Resistance, recognize and implement the new tasks of each new situation and new problem, intensify individual work and self-criticism, monitor cultural conspiracies, and strive to win over backward literati and readers in Hong Kong. In addition, it will establish close ties with domestic literary and art organizations. And resolutely eliminate the incorrect style of "drinking tea and talking idly."

The atmosphere of literary resistance from the motherland is about to circulate. Soon, the "Writers' Symposium" will be seen performing its due work.

### Old Conspiracy in New Guise

— Chen Shaoyu

Speech at the Yan'an People's Anti-Japanese Rally

(I) Wang Jingwei is a Loudspeaker of the Enemy

Comrades! Fellow compatriots from all walks of life!

Today, five or six thousand compatriots in Yan'an are holding an Anti-Japanese Rally here! Why do we link anti-Japanese with betraying the country? Because Wang Jingwei, who was previously known as the leader of the pro-Japanese faction, has now openly, according to recent news from various domestic and foreign news agencies, escaped from Chongqing privately, hiding from the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Government. He first fled to Kunming, and then from Kunming to Hanoi. In the first few days of his departure, fearing capture en route, he feigned illness and uttered deceptive lies. However, after publishing his telegram to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters on December 29 in Hong Kong and Guangzhou last year, Wang Jingwei's betrayal was completely exposed! What did Wang Jingwei say in his telegram to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters? He simply repeated the so-called "Basic Policy for Adjusting Relations between China and Japan" issued by the enemy Konoe on December 22 last year; at the same time, he shamelessly and openly stated that the National Government should immediately use the principles of the Konoe statement as a basis to exchange sincerity with the Japanese government in order to restore peace. What is the content of the "Basic Policy for Adjusting Relations between China and Japan" mentioned in the Konoe statement? It is the so-called "China, Japan, and Manchukuo will establish a new order in East Asia, mutual neighborliness, common anti-communism, and economic cooperation as common goals in the future." Wang Jingwei's proposal to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters is precisely to use the two principles of "harming neighbors, being friendly to Japan, jointly fighting communism, and economic cooperation" as the basis for peace talks. Because Wang Jingwei is merely a loudspeaker and echo of Konoe, as long as we refute the arrogance of the Konoe statement, we will completely refute the fallacies of Wang Jingwei's circular telegram. The most complete and powerful document refuting the Konoe statement is Chairman Chiang's instruction at the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Chongqing on December 26 last year. Chairman Chiang's historically significant instruction not only exposed all the enemy's conspiracies to destroy China thoroughly but also sentenced Wang Jingwei's December 29 circular telegram to death in advance.

(II) The So-Called New Order in East Asia Means the Destruction of China

Please listen to how Chairman Chiang refuted Konoe's ranting about the so-called "Establishment of a New Order in East Asia":

Chairman Chiang said:

"The establishment of a 'New Order in East Asia' is the slogan and practice that the Japanese pride themselves on the most. According to the explanation of their Foreign Minister Arita on December 19, 'The New Order in East Asia means the close connection and mutual assistance of Japan, Manchukuo, and China in politics, economy, and culture to prevent the Red Menace, uphold Eastern civilization, remove economic barriers, and liberate China from a semi-colonial status to achieve stability in East Asia.' Konoe also said in his conversation on the 14th: 'The ultimate goal of the China Incident is not only military victory but also the rebirth of China and the establishment of a new order in East Asia. This new order is based on the cooperation of Japan, Manchukuo, and China after the rebirth of China.' Everyone should pay attention to the fact that the so-called reborn China is to eliminate independent China and create another enslaved China to be dominated by them for generations to come; and this new order is based on China becoming a slave state, closely linked with Japan and the 'puppet state of Manchukuo' created by them. What is the purpose? In the name of preventing the Red Menace, they control China's military; in the name of upholding Eastern civilization, they eliminate China's national culture; in the name of removing economic barriers, they exclude European and American forces and dominate the Pacific. Furthermore, with the tool of an 'economic unit' or 'economic group' of Japan, Manchukuo, and China, they control China's economic lifeline. Everyone, think about what kind of sinister intentions are hidden beneath the seven characters of 'Establishing a New Order in East Asia.' In simple terms, this is a general name for overthrowing the international order in East Asia, creating a slave China, and thus realizing their attempt to dominate the Pacific and control the world."

Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The so-called "New Order in East Asia" that the enemy talks about and thinks about is, first and foremost, a new order established on the basis of destroying and enslaving China.

What is the content of the so-called "neighborly friendship" that the enemy Konoe talks about and the so-called "good neighborly friendship" that Wang Jingwei talks about? This is the paragraph in Wang Jingwei's circular telegram that he particularly proudly says: "Japan has no territorial demands on China, no demands for war reparations. Japan not only respects China's sovereignty but will also, following the precedents of the Meiji Restoration, return concessions and abolish extraterritoriality under the condition of allowing freedom of residence and business in the mainland, so that China can fully achieve its independence." Chairman Chiang made a righteous and solemn exposure of the enemy's deceptive conspiracies and Wang Jingwei's clever sophistry in his instructions. Please listen to how Chairman Chiang refuted the enemy and the traitor's sweet words and cunning schemes that Japan has no territorial demands on China, no demands for war reparations, and will return concessions and abolish extraterritoriality! Chairman Chiang said:

"In his (i.e., the enemy's - author's note) mind, the so-called territory is naturally the territory he controls; resources are also the resources in his meaning. Since he has swept them away, why should he ask for any trivial territorial cessions and indemnities? What he asks for is the entire land and people. With great desires in front, he is naturally happy to use the cunning words of not wanting territory and not wanting compensation to deceive the world. In fact, from China's point of view, to talk about war compensation, we must first clarify the responsibility for the war. This time, it is clear that he launched troops to fight on our territory, and the responsibility for aggression is obvious to everyone. His statement is naturally not worth considering. As for extraterritoriality, if he controls China's entire sovereignty, then it is even the skin of the skin. The so-called returning concessions is like a rare commodity. Not only has his public opinion advocated managing the concessions of other countries on his behalf, but he wants to take back China's concessions and make them Japan's exclusive large concessions; and in fact, if China recognizes his 'New Order in East Asia' and the 'cooperation of Japan, Manchukuo, and China,' it will turn the entire territory of China into a large concession owned by Japan. In this way, if China does not become his slave state, it will also be reduced to a protectorate, and in fact, it will be merged into Japan. He says he wants to make China a completely independent country, isn't that just like Korea in the Treaty of Shimonoseki?"

(III) Chairman Chiang's Refutation is Righteous and Forceful

Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The enemy obviously sent troops to occupy the entire Chinese territory, yet shamelessly says he has no territorial ambitions! The enemy obviously wants to occupy all of China's resources, so of course he doesn't need to talk about any compensation! At the same time, it is indeed true that Chairman Chiang said that if we talk about compensation, we want the enemy to compensate us for all war losses because the enemy started the war and the enemy should bear the actual responsibility for the war. Since the enemy is determined to destroy China and turn China into a Japanese colony, then what use is there for extraterritoriality and concessions! Chairman Chiang's refutation of the enemy and the traitor's request to allow the Japanese to have freedom of residence and business in the Chinese mainland is righteous, forceful, and sincere. Chairman Chiang said:

"In addition, he further proposes that China should grant Japanese citizens the right to freedom of residence and business in the mainland. This seems to be very ordinary, but he does not know what a deep and widespread impression the Chinese people have of the crimes committed by Japan in China in the past. To be honest, as soon as the Chinese people mention Japan, they will think of its intelligence agencies and the Japanese adventurers who do evil; they will think of selling opium, morphine, manufacturing heroin, selling heroin, gambling, prostitution, private arms trafficking, aiding bandits, raising hooligans, creating traitors, and all conspiracies to disrupt our order, corrupt our people's morals, poison us, and turn us into bandits. Therefore, opening up the mainland for freedom of residence and business can be discussed with other countries after China's legal and political systems are completely independent; but for Japan, unless our country is willing to be poisoned and disrupted by it, unless our country is willing to abandon the right to maintain law and order, unless we are willing to have our good customs corrupted by it, and our economic cream and blood sucked by it, no one will agree to it. The Japanese should not be forgetful. Isn't the so-called freedom of residence and business in the mainland the same as the so-called commercial and rental rights in the Northeast back then? When the current Foreign Minister Arita, in his capacity as the Director of the East Asia Bureau, came to Nanjing to negotiate at the behest of his cabinet Prime Minister Tanaka in the 18th year of the Republic of China, we resolutely refused and were unwilling to agree to this commercial and rental rights request. We would rather have them use military force to occupy our Northeast than sign this unequal treaty that would harm the country and betray its sovereignty. Why? Because the impression that Japan has given us is too terrible. Wherever they reside, the police power and economic power will be lost along with it. If the Japanese have freedom of residence and business, the Chinese in the same place will have no freedom, even to the point of not being able to stand their ground. The commercial and rental rights issue at that time was only a local matter in the corner of the Northeast, and we were still unwilling to agree to it. Now they have expanded it and extended it to our entire territory, and under the slogan of the so-called 'New Order in East Asia,' I ask my people if there is still any room for consideration?"

(IV) The So-Called Sino-Japanese Joint Anti-Communism is Actually Reducing China

What is the content of the "joint anti-communism" that the enemy and Wang Jingwei talk about? Chairman Chiang also made a clear exposure in his instructions. Please listen to how Chairman Chiang exposed the enemy and the traitor's conspiracy of the so-called "joint anti-communism"! Chairman Chiang said:

"We can say that it is only in the name of joint anti-communism that they first control our country's military, and then control our country's politics, culture, and even diplomacy. This is a major reason why they have been resentful for not succeeding in their previous requests before the July 7th Incident. Because we were unwilling to fall into their trap, we would rather endure all kinds of hardships, and at the final juncture, we would rather sacrifice the entire country to resist the war. If this joint anti-communism request could be agreed to, would we have to wait until today? The general opinion in the world may be that the so-called anti-communism by Japan is actually meant to prevent Soviet Russia; in fact, the purpose of Japan's so-called signing of an agreement for joint anti-communism is neither to prevent communism nor to prevent Russia, but to use this name to destroy China. Even if there is a meaning against Russia in it, it only accounts for a small part, and the greater part is to destroy China. Otherwise, if it were for national defense or truly for relations with Russia, then why did its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu Aoi, act so contemptibly and yield during the military conflict at Zhanggufeng in July and August this year? This shows that its so-called anti-communism to our country is just a cover to deceive the world and the people, and to seek a pretext to station troops in North China and Inner Mongolia from China. To be honest, if the stationing of troops in North China could be allowed and Inner Mongolia could be designated as a special zone, we would not have had the July 7th Incident."

Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The enemy and the traitor's so-called Sino-Japanese joint anti-communism is actually to destroy China, to completely place China's military, politics, economy, culture, and diplomacy under the control of the enemy, and to make China a Japanese slave state. At the same time, Chairman Chiang pointed out that the enemy and the traitor's purpose of so-called anti-communism, "even if there is a meaning against Russia in it, it only accounts for a small part, and the greater part is to destroy China." Chairman Chiang's instruction not only thoroughly exposed the enemy's false mask of joint anti-communism, but also gave a head-on blow to those confused people or those with ulterior motives who shouted wildly that "China's resistance is fighting for the Soviet Union" and disrupted the war effort.

(V) The So-Called Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation is Just a Replay of Japanese-Manchukuo Economic Cooperation

Finally, what is the content of the "economic cooperation" or "economic partnership" that the enemy and Wang Jingwei talk about? Chairman Chiang also made a clear exposure in his instructions. Please listen to how Chairman Chiang exposed the enemy and the traitor's conspiracy of the so-called "economic partnership" or "economic cooperation"! Chairman Chiang said:

"The so-called 'economic unit' and 'economic group' have been advocated by Japan for many years. Recently, this conspiracy is still being carried out vigorously. This is the main link in the 'East Asian Cooperative Body.' They are constantly changing slogans, sometimes calling it economic partnership, sometimes calling it economic cooperation, and their government's declaration on November 4 refers to it as 'economic ties.' At the end of November, Japanese newspapers published 'Japan, Manchukuo, and China will establish an economic unit and share weal and woe in the future'; then, on December 19, Arita said in a speech: 'Japan has decided to hold an economic conference to seek close integration of the Japanese, Manchukuoan, and Chinese economies and to strengthen the 'economic unit.'' This type of economic relationship is called an 'economic group' by the world. In fact, the 'North China Development' and 'Central China Revitalization' companies, which serve as tools for economic annexation, have already been established. Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo economic talks have been held more than once. Their so-called Planning Agency also formulated a 'Plan for Expanding the Productive Capacity of Japan, Manchukuo, and China' on the second day after the recent statement. This so-called economic group not only wants to control our country's customs and finance, monopolize our country's production and trade, and monopolize Asian hegemony, but gradually extend it to the point where they restrict our Chinese people's freedom in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and kill or spare us as they please, making the entire Chinese nation slaves, beasts of burden, and wiping out our nation's survival under their whips and sucking."

Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The actual content of the enemy and the traitor's so-called Sino-Japanese "economic partnership" or "economic cooperation" is the replay of the so-called "Japanese-Manchukuo economic cooperation" that the enemy has already implemented. Land, forests, mines, banks, railways, customs, taxes, and factories are occupied and controlled by the enemy. Internal and external commerce is monopolized by the enemy. The people's lives are plunged into deep water and hot fire and the miserable state of beasts of burden and slaves. This is the true situation that the enemy talks about, thinks about, and does in Korea, Taiwan, our Northeast provinces, and all occupied areas.

(VI) Spreading the Fallacy of Betraying National Policy at a Time of Urgent Resistance

Precisely because the true content of Konoe's statement is so sinister and vicious, Chairman Chiang estimated Konoe's statement in his instructions as "the enemy's entire self-confession of his arrogant conspiracy to annex China, dominate East Asia, and attempt to conquer the world, and also the exposure of the entire plan to destroy our country and exterminate our nation." After running away, Wang Jingwei actually copied a portion of Konoe's statement directly and disguised another portion cleverly as his own proposal to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters. The Central Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang therefore decided to permanently expel Wang Zhaoming from the party and remove him from all positions. This is absolutely correct. Please listen to an important excerpt from the full text of the Chinese Kuomintang's resolution to expel Wang Jingwei from the party:

"Wang Zhaoming, bearing the heavy trust of this party, at a time of urgent resistance, left his post without authorization, hid in a foreign land, and spread the fallacy of betraying national policy. Recent telegrams even advocated using the enemy Prime Minister Konoe's fundamental and arrogant statement to destroy our country as a basis to seek peace with the enemy. On the one hand, he published it in newspapers for wide distribution, using the name of suggesting to the Central Government to show off his skills of swaying people's hearts. Moreover, the content of his telegram was everywhere artfully decorated for the enemy's demands, not hesitating to reverse right and wrong to speak for the enemy, and even going further to help them deceive the world. In terms of this action alone, it is purely seeking surrender by colluding with the enemy, and its impact is directly intended to shake the foundation of the country. Our country launched the War of Resistance for national salvation and survival. The deaths and injuries of more than a million soldiers and the sacrifices of millions of compatriots are all intended to fundamentally eliminate the enemy's poisonous plan of aggression and to permanently preserve the lives of our nation and generations to come. For more than a year, the people have united with sincerity, and the soldiers have bravely risked their lives. All people are united under the leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek of this party, determined and unyielding, with the confidence of certain victory. Now, the enemy's ambition to plot against us is becoming more apparent, and their tricks are becoming more vicious, which makes our national indignation even more intense and our determination even firmer. What Wang said is not only abhorred by the Central Government but also intolerable to the people of the whole country. It is found that during the war, any citizen must absolutely not violate the decision of the wartime national policy and determine his own position. The party's discipline absolutely does not allow exceeding the official resolutions of the party, violating the party's rules, and publishing his opinions as an individual. Wang Zhaoming's actions of violating discipline and endangering the party and the country are already obvious. Where righteousness lies, there can be no leniency. He is hereby permanently expelled from the party and removed from all positions to rectify party discipline and correct public opinion..."

I can say with complete certainty that not only the thousands of people attending the meeting today, not only the people from all walks of life in Yan'an, not only the nearly one million people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, but also the 400 million compatriots in the whole of China and all just people in the world warmly support President Chiang Kai-shek's speech refuting Konoe's statement and unanimously support the Chinese Kuomintang's resolution to permanently expel Wang Jingwei from the party. Since the publication of the circular telegram on December 29 last year, Wang Jingwei, from the position of leader of the pro-Japanese faction, is not only forever unqualified to be a member of the Kuomintang but also forever unqualified to be a citizen of the Republic of China! Therefore, we not only vehemently support the Kuomintang's resolution to expel Wang Jingwei from the party but also wish to see the National Government issue a decree to strip Wang Jingwei of his citizenship. Therefore, the telegram from front-line generals Chen Cheng, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, He Pan, Wei Lihuang, Zhang Fakui, Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Li Hanhun, Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua, and Long Ling calling for a public arrest warrant for Wang Jingwei, and the proposals from local governments and Kuomintang party headquarters at home and abroad calling for punishing Wang Jingwei with national law will surely be responded to and supported by the compatriots attending the meeting today and the people of the whole country.

(VII) Wang Jingwei's Behavior of Flattering the Enemy and Surrendering is Not Accidental

Comrades! People from all walks of life!

Economic Column

### The Sterling Revolution and Its Impact

London is the capital of the world's gold market and the center of international finance. This superior position has historically given the pound sterling its leading status in the world currency market. However, this status may now become one of the major factors trampling on the pound. Because world gold prices have soared due to the war preparations of various countries, the pound, held back by the exchange rate umbrella, has been unable to keep pace. This is tantamount to a fall in the domestic value of the pound. In addition, the British Treasury has turned from surplus to deficit in recent years, and foreign trade and international balance of payments have all shown deficits. The external value of the pound itself is also severely weakened. How can it withstand this kind of pressure from the rising gold prices?

Recently, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Simon, has requested the Parliament to revalue the reserve value of the Bank of England and decided to estimate it once a week according to the market price. The income generated from the valuation will be used as a foreign exchange fund. As for the bank's banknote issuance quota, he requested it to be reduced from 400 million pounds to 300 million pounds, and this would be fixed without increase or decrease.

This approach is indeed a major revolution in the British monetary system. The Bank of England's reserves have been calculated according to a statutory price of 85 shillings per ounce, and this has never changed in more than 200 years. Now, not only is this statutory price abandoned, but it is also estimated once a week according to the market price. Therefore, the higher the gold price, the greater the value of British reserves or foreign exchange funds, which can naturally make the position of the pound more solid. The London Times called this approach the "market price gold standard," which is poised to become a brand-new term in modern currency science.

Furthermore, the Bank of England's banknote issuance has always increased or decreased according to the amount of cash reserves. If the reserve amount is estimated according to the market price, and the gold price continues to rise today, the banknote issuance is bound to increase. With increased banknote issuance, gold prices will naturally be affected by the increased currency supply and rise. Therefore, now it has been decided that the total amount of banknote issuance should not exceed 200 million pounds. Thus, the total amount of issuance has become fixed, while the issuance reserve amount, conversely, is shifted by the price of gold to determine the amount of banknote issuance, which is the opposite of before. This is truly a new revolution for the pound.

What impact will this revolution have on gold prices and exchange rates in the future? In our view, it can generally stabilize the soaring gold prices and the weakening pound exchange rate for a while.

Because the Bank of England's banknote issuance has now been reduced to 300 million, it can first benefit from contracting the currency supply, strengthening the pound and suppressing gold prices. Moreover, the revaluation directly strengthens the foreign exchange fund and indirectly enhances Britain's financial credibility. The position of the pound can naturally be expected to improve. As a result, those who doubt the pound and rush to buy gold can be reduced, and the speculative fever in the gold market can naturally be reduced. Therefore, the London gold market should be able to stabilize temporarily.

### St. Joseph's Relentless Attack, Eliminated by Police, 4-3 Police Win Silver Shield Final Right, Group B Scots Eliminate Public Works Bureau 7-2

[This Newspaper Special] Yesterday, the only Senior Division football match in the city was the special Silver Shield single act between the Police and St. Joseph's, which was staged at the Navy Ground. Hundreds of Chinese and Western spectators attended, and the scene was not too deserted. After ninety minutes of competition between the two teams, the score was still tied at 3-3, and the winner was not decided. The war god then extended his stay for another twenty minutes, giving a final opportunity for the two teams to settle this football account. As a result, the Police, relying on six points of luck and four points of personnel, unexpectedly had the originally worst-performing Moore score a valuable goal at the moment the overtime match was about to end, ending Joseph's life and completing this victory with a score of 4-3, winning the final right. Most spectators initially thought Joseph's would not fail, but the facts were the opposite, and thus there was such an ending.

The reason for Joseph's defeat was not related to individual skills. What shortcomings were not as good as the Police that led to them deserving to lose? The most fatal blow was that in the second half, when they held a 3-2 advantage, Ha Xian suffered a foot injury and withdrew and then re-entered, his movements were not agile, and he reluctantly played, forcing the central defender to change to the stone wing, and Si Ma Kwei Shi was transferred to the right inner midfielder to support the team's important stronghold at that time, namely Da Gao Shan Nu, and acted as the central defender, replacing Ha Xian. However, the attacking power of the front line was weakened due to this adjustment. The absence of Bi Lu Du due to illness was also a pity. If he had participated, this change might not have occurred. However, the number of successes or failures is not only related to the participation of the players. Moreover, to be defeated by the Police, whose strength was originally not as good as their own, the reasons must be complicated. However, the Police players became more and more courageous as they fought, which was enough to put the injured and defeated Joseph's in a bitter battle, and their morale was greatly affected, and they had to abandon the city and flee.

Joseph's, in the previous replay, had Da Gao Shan Nu, Bi Lu Du, Lei Mi Di and other players exert their strength, and the lineup was renewed, eliminating the invincible Navy and being promoted to a higher level, with great ambition. They were confident that they would capture the Police in one fell swoop in the semi-final, and hoped to win the championship one day. How did they know that man's plans are not as good as Heaven's plans, and they were defeated by the Police, and their efforts were abandoned halfway, and all previous efforts were in vain. This unending hatred, to whom to tell? It also shows that this championship cannot be won entirely by relying on people, and in addition to manpower, it also depends on luck.

The four goals won by the Police were half created by chance. For example, the second goal was a penalty kick, and the fourth goal was scored by Moore because Ma Kwei Shi's vision was blocked. Therefore, their current half-championship is due to luck. In terms of their actual strength, they are very ordinary. They have overcome the difficulties yesterday, and they don't know how many lives they have cultivated. However, they do not have the appearance of a champion, and they do not seem to be one. When they compete with the winner of South China against Eastern for the championship, it is敢 to be concluded that the champion seat does not belong to them.

In this match, the three Chinese players in the Police lineup all made very good contributions. Compared with the Western players, they were much more outstanding. Left inner midfielder Chen Guang Ge had enough power in his feet and defended tightly. Da Gao Shan Nu stumbled forward several times when he encountered him. Huang Wen Gui played the most brilliantly in the second half, and Pa Ni La and Su Sha were repeatedly threatened and felt quite a headache. Fan Gui Cai was also good. Among the Western players, Pa Jia was considered good at exerting his strength. Although Hou Lu Moore did not have any good points to show, both of them gained something, and their merits cannot be ignored. In short, the Police's ability to win was mostly due to luck.

In the Group B Silver Shield semi-final, Scots eliminated the Public Works Bureau 7-5. Scots and Mi Du both won the right to the final. The situation of the Group A match is recorded as follows:

(Police)

Mai Ha Di

Chen Guangyu Bi Li Ban

Nuo Fu Bi Li Dun Pa Jia

Moore Hou Lu Fan He Hua He Ya Huang Wen Gui

(St. Joseph's)

Ma Kwei Shi

Su Sha Lei Mi Di

Pa Ni La Ha Xian Jia Shi Di Lu

Ya Lu Yu Shi Jin Shi Li An Na Da Gao Shan Nu Si Ma Yi Shi

As soon as the war started, the Police took the offensive. Fan Gui Cai and Hou Lu showed their power one after another, and Mai Ha Di received them all. However, Joseph's then attacked the goal twice. Although they failed to break through, the Police defenders were already quite surprised.

Ten minutes after the start of the game, Huang Wen Gui got the ball and advanced rapidly along the side, deep into the hinterland, and then passed it to Fan Gui Cai, who shot it into the goal, scoring the first point. Afterwards, the Police lost several winning opportunities due to the abnormal performance of left winger Moore.

Soon, Joseph's forwards became active. Jin Shi dribbled the ball and chased after the attack, but was released by Mai Ha Di, resulting in a corner kick. Si Ma Kwei Shi opened the kick with an excellent landing point, and Da Gao Shan Nu greeted the ball with his head, as fast as a shooting star, and thus tied the score at 1-1.

After Joseph's won back a goal, his momentum was overwhelming for a while. Da Gao Shan Nu and Li An Na were like butterflies穿花, repeatedly threatening the Police. Lei Mi Di consolidated the rear, as solid as a golden soup. On the other hand, the Police's center line was weak, and the left wing士was even more overshadowed. Hou Lu, Fan Gui Cai, and Huang Wen Gui had no chance to use their skills. Soon, the Police's two defenders entangled Li An Na, causing Ya Lu Yu Shi to shoot diagonally without defense, and the ball went into the net, and Joseph's took the lead with a 2-1 victory. After another short battle, the first half ended.

Changing sides and fighting, Huang Wen Gui of the Police showed his brilliance, and with Hou Yu's strong assaults, the area in front of Joseph's goal was in trouble again. Still, Lei Mi Di defended his territory well and was not calculated. After a while, 律迎頭頂球, Lei Mi Di rushed to grab it, Hou Lu was blocked and fell to the ground, and Joseph's was fined a penalty kick, which was kicked by Moore and entered the goal in one fell swoop. At this point, both sides tied the score again at 2-2.

Seven minutes later, Joseph's gained the advantage of a corner kick. Si Ma Kwei Shi passed the ball to the center point, and Jin Shi shot it in nearby, and Joseph's won again with a 3-2 lead. After the Police lost, they tried harder. Huang Wen Gui single-handedly rushed past the opponent's rear defense line, but unfortunately Fan Gui Cai and Hou Lu were entangled, and no one responded. At this time, Ha Xian injured his foot, went out and then re-entered, and the formation was slightly changed. One attack and one defense were thus affected. Soon, Huang Wen Gui forced Su Sha back again and cut the ball in. Hou Lu took advantage of the situation and kicked it in, and tied the score again at 3-3. After that, the Joseph's forwards all held the idea of breaking the boat. Li An Na, Da Gao Shan Nu, and Ya Lu Yu Shi attacked blatantly, causing danger in the Police's hinterland. Fortunately, Chen Guangyu slashed and fought bravely against the incoming generals, turning danger into safety. Until the end of the game, the winner was still not decided, and the referee extended the game time by twenty minutes.

After the restart, Ha Xian and Si Ma Kwei Shi had twice forced the goal, but both were saved by Mai Ha Di.迫至最後兩分鐘, Hou Lu dribbled the ball quickly, and Lei Mi Di accidentally lost his footing. Hou Lu passed the ball to the center line again, and Moore shot from close range. Ma Si Kwei Shi's vision was blocked and he could not accurately see the direction of the ball, and he扑一個空, too late to save it, and Joseph's unfortunate fate was thus doomed. As a result, the Police sang a triumphant song with a score of 4-3.

### Movies During Wartime

Entertainment...Triangle Love

Three Loves Has Nancy

This is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. The film features witty and humorous dialogue, a lot of laughter, vivid performances by the actors, and a very interesting love story with four corners, making the film a very perfect and entertaining comedy.

The content tells the story of a country girl who goes to a big city to find her fiancé, causing a lot of jokes. Later, how did she and a writer and a publisher of this writer's work, in a special situation, have a crazy and闹鬧love story?

This film captures a segment of modern urban life and develops it very brightly. The director, Richard Thorpe, has very rich experience in handling comedies. Not only does he create an extremely humorous style for the whole film, but also every shot is full of a strong humorous interest, and every inch of film makes the audience have no chance to stop laughing. Nancy, who plays the country girl in the film, shows a very lovely personality. She vividly portrays the pure, naive heart of a rural girl and her trusting attitude towards urban friends. She is the most outstanding character in the film. The performances of Gary Cooper as the writer and Frank Morgan as the publisher are also wonderful and excellent. This film can be said to be their first collaboration and a successful work.

Queen...Good Doctor Love

A Man To Remember

For audiences who like movies with beautiful stories, this film is the most ideal work. The film depicts the life of a country doctor, a history of failures, successes, sorrows, and honors. It uses a retrospective way to develop various scenes, and tells how the doctor served the society and the poor masses with a spirit of sacrifice for twenty years as if it were one day. At the same time, the film also unambiguously exposes the selfish and shameful state of the villains in society.

Edward Arnold plays a doctor with no degree but with great talent and ability in the film. With a selfless spirit of serving the people, he takes his young son back to his hometown. However, those who dare to trust him are only some poor farmers. The reward he gets is only some agricultural products. In one medical consultation, the harvest he gets is the baby girl he just delivered. He continues to struggle without discouragement, and educates his son to get a very high degree. But what disappoints him is that this son only pursues false reputation and money. Fortunately, he has the adopted daughter as his only help and comfort. In the end, he uses his foresight to save the children of the whole village from a dangerous infectious disease, and only then does he receive the warm respect and love of the whole village.

Shirley Temple, who plays the doctor's adopted daughter, also gives an excellent performance.

At the same time, the latest "March of Time" newsreel will be shown. The film has a very detailed narration and incisive analysis of the internal and external causes and effects of Hitler's seizure of Czechoslovakia.

Ping An...Saving the Tide

The Storm

This film writes about the unrestrained life of some seafarers. The director handles several tense scenes and climaxes in the film quite movingly. Charles Farrell plays a ship radio operator who causes trouble everywhere. How does he fight bravely for his beloved brother, and in the end, in the storm, help his sister-in-law save his brother's life. This film vividly depicts how the life of the crew on board, how they play the occasion, and how they perform their duties conscientiously. The performances of the actors show a kind of irritable and barbaric character, and their fighting, making trouble, getting drunk, flirting, and gambling are all vivid and energetic.

Eastern...The Adventures of Tom Sawyer

Tfhe Adventures o Tom Sawyer

This popular masterpiece by the great American writer Mark Twain has been produced once before. Perhaps some people can still remember the excellent acting skills of the child star Missy Green. This version, dyed in color, makes the scenery of the countryside extraordinarily vivid. The performances of the two child stars, Tommy Kelly and Ann Gillis, are also very moving. Tommy Kelly fully demonstrates that he is a promising actor--as long as he has a suitable script.

The movie is very long, but because of the director's superb skills, the tone is always light and smooth, and people do not feel that there is any slackness in it. This film can be regarded as a top-notch work for turning a literary work into a movie.

May Robson, who plays the grandmother, is also worth mentioning, although she has few scenes.

Da Hua...Double Wedding

Donble Wedding

William Powell and Myrna Loy have been paired for a long time, and they have always given us a very good impression. Of course, many people like their movies, and this film is also very successful, although the plot is not particularly outstanding.

New World...Continuing Seven Fresh Roses

Cantonese Film

The previous episode of Seven Fresh Roses said to the wedding of Ma Luo Fen and Lin Mei Mei, here from Lin's son to Ma Lin two people, bad feelings, at the same time Ran Shu Feng Feng and Xu Manli combined, because of the lack of feelings, resulting in face bumps, each go the end, Ran Shu Ma Luo Fen met Xu Manli, two people occurred love, the old couple found out, Shu Ming Ma Xu originally for fiancé daughter wife, so both sides realized, Ma Yuan escape, the result for the son moved, still home, and Lin love as before,

Central...Dream Tour Wonderland

Cantonese Film

Adapted from "Mirror緣", but further than "金花緣", the whole drama is based on Xin Ma Shuizeng as the starting point, describing Xin Ma, who is originally a tea shop waiter, one night in a dream he saw the Star of Longevity, so the Star of Longevity took him to various places to play, such as Nantianmen, Beitianmen, 大人國, Lilliput, etc., so that he had a strange miracle that he had never seen before, watching this film, really just think that you are dreaming,

The whole play from beginning to end, scattered and abnormal, the plot has no central point, I believe that progressive audiences, will not welcome such a film, the songs sung are still a few old songs,

Taiping...Four King Brothers

Mandarin Film

From silent film to sound film, from monochrome to color, materially this remake of the film is much more advanced, the male lead is Wang Yin, the female lead is a new comer Zhang Cui Fen, the scene is great, is its progress,

### The Illusionist

— Xuan Bing

I remember seeing many people in theaters or at some meeting places, dressed in bizarre costumes, wearing humorous faces, holding a piece of cloth and a deck of playing cards, performing their illusions to the public, turning cigarettes out of a cloth, changing one card from the deck to another; with all kinds of endless variations, they seem like omnipotent gods, wanting this, they have this, wanting that, they have that.

But some illusionists probably know that the audience knows that what they are performing is fake, so before performing their "magic powers," they say a few opening remarks, saying "If you can see it, your eyes are fast. If you can't see it, my hands are fast." This kind of self-acknowledged illusion is fake, is deceptive, naturally, the audience who hears these words, even the most foolish people, know that what he is playing with is not real but illusory, but some illusionists insist on showing off their "magic powers," not only do they not say that what they are going to perform is fake, but even the name that contains the meaning of the technique they are going to perform—illusion—this "illusion" character is deliberately mysteriously explained in a set of deceptive explanations.

This naturally cannot deceive people with self-confidence and strong consciousness, but it will greatly deceive people with unstable consciousness and weak faith.

When I encountered this situation, his explanation naturally could not deceive me, but, I looked at the people around me, and there were many people who were "deceived," and the "deceived" people were not necessarily women and children, even those who were neatly dressed and looked like celebrities and scholars nodded and acquiesced to his explanation, and after his performance, they greatly praised it, saying, "How can such a performance be fake. Where did this thing come from, can this cloth hide so many things?" This kind of self-deception, believing that these performances must be real.

Sitting close to these people who were deceived and still did not know it, I received so much laughing material, besides exchanging a knowing smile with my friend, and on the way home after watching this play, when I was bored, I would also use it as talking material and make a lot of discussions!

But, when I sat quietly and bored, and accidentally thought of this matter, besides feeling that a group of fools were being deceived pitifully, I would go a step further; I felt that everything I came into contact with in life was mostly "close to this," as small as a corner of society that I came into contact with in my personal life, as large as the complex changes in international politics, none were not like this, but their means of performance were more sophisticated and their faces were more solemn.

Like these years, it is the time when illusionists are in full swing to show off their magical powers, some are today in this tall building, magically creating an agreement document, and tomorrow they are magically creating a deal to abolish the agreement, if they get a bargain, they will greet people with a smile, if their demands are not met, they will slap the table and scold people, these pretenses are nothing more than means of fighting for profit, that is, illusion is performing.

Not to mention the distant ones, and not to mention other things for the time being, let's take our eastern neighbor's "signature play" performed a few months ago, the prime minister personally came on stage, holding a sun flag, waving it up and down, and then smiling and magically creating a declaration written with the words "peace and happiness," which led a group of celebrities from our country to applaud and marvel, believing it to be true, and responding to it, causing a storm in the city. However, as the environment changed and the days passed, the performer at that time stepped down, and another one was replaced who was the same advocate of peace as his predecessor; he said that the previous Mr. Peace Declaration was just playing on the stage, and the things on the stage will no longer exist after stepping down, after saying these opening remarks, he is going to start starring in her "signature" play.

This only gave the people who were deceived and still said it was true, and whose will was not firm and whose faith was weak, the greatest blow.

### Year-End

— Zhen Feng

Climb, climb. Desperately climbing along with the days, climb, climb, climb to the year-end, ah, is the year-end a difficult hurdle?

The year-end is ten thousand iron whips, exhausting all the "magic weapons" is not easy to get through! Difficult and painful things are always tightly entangled with the desperate. The wife shouts at her husband for money, the ignorant child twists his father to make new clothes. How do they know the difficulties of being a man? The unfeeling landlord, because it is the year-end, does not understand people's difficulties, and even increases their rent, and fiercely demands the old debts!

Climb, climb, after suffering enough, you still have to climb, climb, climb, climb, climb to the foot of the mountain, climb to the year-end, no, climb to the difficult hurdle, ah, climb to the difficult hurdle!

### War and Peace

— You Di

Peace, peace, now some people are wearing the cloak of peace, covering up their true faces of betrayal—however, they will never be able to tarnish the sacred flower of peace.

The pro-Japanese traitors who advocate peace open their mouths and say: "Is there any war that doesn't want peace?" It is true that peace is the end of war. War is bloody politics, and politics is bloodless war. War ends and peace reappears. It can be said that peace is the negation of war; and the "quantitative change" to "qualitative change" of war is the whole process from war to peace. But peace is not something that pro-Japanese traitors who advocate peace can seek casually!

When war reaches a certain stage, peace will inevitably come. At this time, one side of the belligerent group has completely achieved its political goals by force, and the other side has failed, the reason is: war is a sharp conflict of political (economic) contradictions between two groups, this contradiction is expressed in a special political form (force) to resolve it, and the resolution of this contradiction is the arrival of peace.

The political purpose of our anti-Japanese war is to drive out the national enemy, fight for national liberation, and establish a democratic republic." The political purpose of the Japanese invaders is to monopolize and enslave China, and to completely colonize China. This political (economic) contradiction led to the war. The prospect of this war is: we will use the power of the entire nation to drive the enemy to the Yalu River, and after achieving this political goal, peace will come! But if necessary, we plan to assist the revolutionary movement in Korea, and the result of the war will inevitably lead to a revolution among the Japanese people, then China's anti-Japanese war is to strive for true peace.

Understanding this explanation of peace, all the pro-Japanese traitors' arguments for peace cannot exist! The pro-Japanese traitors' arguments for peace is to seek peace without choice, he demands peace now, may I ask if we can achieve our political goals! No! Ten thousand times no, they not only think that restoring the state before the July 7th Incident can bring peace, but also think that this is a futile high-profile, but their arguments are planned for the Japanese, because the enemy's political goals can be smoothly achieved through the hands of these pro-Japanese traitors!

Therefore, if someone asks, "When will the war end, when will peace come," we should immediately answer him, we will stop the war only after achieving the political goal of national liberation and establishing a "democratic republic", specifically speaking, is to drive the enemy to the Yalu River, the pro-Japanese traitors' arguments for peace say, "Going to Tokyo to fight is peace" This is nonsense that cannot even deceive children!

### Night in the Cattle Shed

— Peng Chenghui

The night is quiet, everything is quiet.

In this remote village, as soon as the sky turns dark, every household closes its doors. Between the fields and the wilderness, everything is quietly resting in the night. It is winter now, the days are short, the sky turns dark especially easily, because there is no moon or starlight, and the weather is cold, it seems particularly desolate outside.

Outside the village houses, there are many bonfires burning cow dung, garbage, and rice stalks, emitting an unpleasant smell, rising thick black smoke, and the firelight flickers in the dark from time to time, sometimes accompanied by one or two sharp, slight explosions.

From the neighboring village at the foot of the opposite mountain. There are occasional deep barks of dogs. In the windows of the thatched houses, small lights leak out, flickering on and off. Although it is still early, everywhere is a scene of silence and desolation. Since the fall of Huizhou, bandits have been rampant, and the people here close their doors even earlier. As soon as the smoke rises from the kitchen, there are very few pedestrians on the road.

On the edge of this small village, there is a small house made of mud bricks, the roof is all covered with thatch, and in front of the door stands an old longan tree, with a few stone benches scattered underneath. This small house is a cattle shed for water buffalo to rest in, and at this time there are three cowherds, embracing a black hard broken quilt, lying on an old bed together. Two tall water buffalo are lying in the dark corner, munching on dry grass.

They are very excited at this time, having beautiful dreams, fantasizing about the world on Feie Ridge. Tomorrow, yes, tomorrow. They can participate in their activities. Da Hei, who returned from the front line, once told them how interesting the guerrillas are. In the overlapping mountains, they ambush at night, detour and attack, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and can often rob many military supplies from the Japanese: telescopes, leather coats, and copper helmets, leather boots and guns. Holding live ammunition in the dark night, shouting orders, is so majestic. Blowing military bugles in the morning and evening and singing patriotic songs in their spare time is so happy. They have also heard the teacher in the school tell stories about many young soldiers under Zhao Lao Tai Tai. The shadow of the "little hero" flashes in their minds from time to time. They are the three most mischievous children in the countryside, and they usually like to play with dirt and fight Mauser guns. Now that they have the opportunity to play with machine guns and box cannons, you can imagine how fascinated they are!

"At this time tomorrow, aren't we sleeping on Feie Ridge?" The smallest one is always looking forward to the scene tomorrow night.

"That's great! Do you think it's as carefree as when you go up the mountain to herd cattle? When you're a soldier, you have to fight all the time!" After all, the bigger one thinks more carefully.

"Even if you're having such dreams, whether they're willing to take us in is still a problem!" The biggest one thinks the most thoroughly.

"If they don't take us in, there's no reason for that!" The smaller one is confident.

"That's right! Didn't the teacher in the school tell us that in the past, the guerrillas accepted both big and small!" The bigger one also feels very confident.

"Haha, box cannons, machine guns, we'll have them to play with tomorrow night." The smaller one is almost ecstatic, reaching out and pinching the bigger one's thigh.

"Play, play, play, I'm afraid that when you hear the Japanese artillery, you'll be so scared that you'll shit your pants!" The bigger one taunts him.

"People's cells are not small, in the future you will know my ability when you see me killing Japanese devils." He is still very proud of himself.

"Hey, let's go to bed early, we have to hurry tomorrow morning!" The bigger one seriously makes this suggestion.

"Good, let's sleep!" The smaller one agrees very much. With a forceful pull on the quilt, all three heads shrink inside the quilt.

Although they are determined to sleep, they are still chatting with each other in the quilt. The god of sleep seems to be avoiding them everywhere, and beautiful dreams are always jumping on their meninges. The night outside is even quieter, and even the intermittent barking of dogs is gone. Everything in the world seems to be in a sweet sleep in the dark night. Finally, they finally slipped into the sweet land of sleep.

The next morning, the sun shone brightly on this small village. As the three cowherds, carrying their bags, marched towards the mountain path leading to Feie Ridge, a commotion of children disappearing was taking place in this small village.

### "Chengdu Poet Symposium"

— Ren Jun

One of the trends in the Chengdu literary world

That was around July last year.

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, several poets have come to Chengdu one after another, plus a few who originally lived in the local area and had a longer writing history, there are at least twenty people.

However, although there are quite a few people; but, until then, they did not interact with each other much, let alone organize any groups.

However, can this situation be allowed to continue? The answer is of course no. Therefore, as a result of the initiation and efforts of several friends, the only poetry group here - the New Poetry Society - was finally officially announced in July.

Then, we held several meetings in succession, discussed many poetry issues, and also set a lot of work plans.

Regarding the various problems of poetry at the present stage, although among the colleagues, in the past, even the styles and opinions of some people were completely different; but, at present, under the general goal of making poetry serve the War of Resistance, it can be said that everyone's opinions no longer have any conflicts and contradictions.

But, speaking of work, it is really embarrassing to say, not only did we not do the work we had planned to do, but, soon, even the group itself fell into a state of unusual slack and dispersion.

Looking back now, there are probably two reasons for this:

First, initially, we planned to publish a poetry journal, but, due to various reasons, it was never realized, which greatly reduced the interest of many colleagues and their concern for the group.

Second, some of the colleagues scattered. For example, Xia Zhi Lin, He Qifang, etc. going to northern Shaanxi, all affected the subjective strength of the group's activities in a tangible and intangible way.

However, can this situation be allowed to continue forever? The answer is still no.

Therefore, not long ago, this group finally reorganized and revived. - Implemented reorganization, and for various reasons, changed the name of the group to "Poet Symposium."

Currently, still a symposium, has appeared in the literary and art circles here in a brand-new posture and style, and has begun a blitzkrieg of work.

First of all, we started to widely solicit members, and widely develop the organization to the masses of all classes. In the future, famous poets will only be a small part of our group's composition, and the most important component will be young people who have only just started writing poetry, or are in the process of starting, or even just have an unusually strong interest in poetry. Because we believe that: this approach, in "this time and this place", is completely necessary; and, only in this way, can we truly make the new poetry movement widely unfold, and lay a mass foundation.

Regarding the work, the following items are currently in progress:

First, hold poetry evenings or recitals... It has been decided to hold one in the shortest period of time.

Second, publish publications... The symposium has started to compile a single-volume poetry publication for the Basha Bookstore here (similar to the "Pioneer" published in Shanghai before the war). This publication will be published after the lunar New Year. The first book, in addition to the works of local poets, also includes the works of authors from Kunming, Chongqing and other places, in addition to this, we are also preparing to attach a supplement (approximately weekly in nature) to the local newspaper.

Third, we are also preparing to regularly send people to various schools, groups, and gatherings to give lectures related to poetry.

Currently, those who are working most diligently for the group include Deng Junwu, Cao Baohua, Fang Jing, Ye Filuo,... and others.

In short, although this poetry group is still very small at present, and is still just starting to work; but, it will assume the tasks it should assume for the poetry movement in the rear and for the construction of anti-Japanese poetry!

(Chengdu, February 1939)
