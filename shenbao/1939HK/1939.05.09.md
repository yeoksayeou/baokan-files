### German-Italian Military Alliance and Anglo-Soviet Negotiations

A Reuter's dispatch from Milan yesterday revealed that the German and Italian governments officially announced the establishment of a German-Italian military alliance as a result of their foreign ministers' meeting. Although the details have not been announced, the main point is that Germany and Italy have established a military and political agreement, closely coordinating to make an effective contribution (?) to European peace. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also stated in his newspaper "Telegraph": "Italy and Germany recognize that each has its own sphere of interest... Neither compels the allied country to provide assistance... However, there is one thing that the two countries are closely related to and jointly protect, and that is the war of consciousness, because both countries understand that the failure of one country is the misfortune of the other." From this, one can see a glimpse of the collaboration between Japan and Italy.

The actions of aggressors require mutual assistance because they are abandoned by all peace-loving countries in the world. Since Hitler launched the Eastern Crusade and Italy occupied Albania, and anti-aggression countries planned to actively curb aggressors, German and Italian aggressors have felt the need to quickly form close ties to deal with the encirclement of the anti-aggression front. Therefore, they first released the idea of democratic countries such as Britain and France encircling Germany and Italy, as a prelude to the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance. In short, the conclusion of the German-Italian military and political agreement is an inevitable outcome, which was expected by clear-sighted politicians around the world. What is most ridiculous is that the highest diplomatic circles in London believe that Italy established the German-Italian political and military alliance because France ignored Italy's invitation to resolve the Franco-Italian dispute. Little do they know that the purpose of this alliance is not only directed at France, but also at dealing with Britain. Didn't Ciano declare that "Germany and Italy each have their own sphere of interest, Italy in the entire Mediterranean region, and Germany in the Baltic Sea and Central European region"? All of those areas have particularly close relations with Britain. The Berlin commentary further emphasized that Germany's recent actions are aimed at "breaking through the British encirclement." German diplomacy is now focused on diplomatic struggles with Britain; all other matters are temporarily regarded as secondary measures.

Today, when Germany and Italy are concentrating their attacks on Britain, Britain should counterattack with strengthened collective forces. At present, in addition to strengthening the ties between Britain, France, and the small countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the most important step is Anglo-Soviet cooperation. As recognized by the London press, "Anglo-Soviet negotiations have reached a critical stage." Britain and the Soviet Union each have different ranges of proposals, and the new proposal submitted by Britain to the Soviet Union yesterday, asking the Soviet government to make a unilateral declaration, is tantamount to refusing to conclude an Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance or send senior officials to hold a meeting. This is a great misfortune for the Soviet Union, but an even greater misfortune for Britain. Because Germany's plan to attack the Soviet Union and induce Poland to cooperate has now largely lost its effectiveness due to Poland's refusal and preparations for resistance (as revealed by France), and the conspiracy to attack Britain is in full swing. Germany is sincerely afraid that Britain will approach the Soviet Union and strengthen its power, so recently it has been particularly sowing discord in the cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt stated: "Since the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union has felt the need to abandon closer relations with democratic countries."

What the German and Italian aggressors fear is the strong restraint of the anti-aggression group under the joint leadership of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Germany especially fears that the Soviet Union will actively assist the small countries of Eastern Europe because of the practical cooperation of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. If Britain wants to protect itself today, it must first protect the small countries that serve as its barrier. If Britain wants to protect the small countries, it must rely on the assistance of the Soviet Union. If Britain wants to stop the aggressors from attacking itself, it can only adopt obvious and active measures to strengthen collective forces, rather than seeking the understanding of Germany and Italy. Germany claims that Britain's leadership of the anti-aggression front is encircling Germany, which is just an excuse for aggressive actions; if Britain alienates the Soviet Union because of this, it will fall into the trap of the aggressors, and Britain itself will be the first to suffer.

The unity of the aggressors is becoming increasingly consolidated, but the leaders of the anti-aggression front are still in the dark. This trend is extremely dangerous!

### Regarding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government

— Lin Zuhan

At the first session of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council, Mr. Lin Boqu (Zuhan) delivered a work report on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. This is for each councilor to use as a basis for inspecting the government and deciding on future policies. This report is divided into three parts: The first part is "Defending and consolidating the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is the common task of the people of the whole country and the people of the entire border region": The second part is "The work done by the border region government in protecting the border region and protecting the entire Chinese anti-Japanese war in the past two years": The third part is "The tasks of the border region government in the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War." What is published here is the first part of Mr. Lin's report, which is divided into four chapters.

Defending and Consolidating Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia is the Common Task of the People of the Entire Border Region and All of China

First, the current situation of the pit war and the environment in which the border region is located include the existence of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region that I want to talk about.

The Chinese nation is waging a large-scale war with Japanese ××ism for its own survival. It has been twenty months now. In these twenty months, we have lost many compatriots, many political, economic, and cultural centers, and we have lost a lot of lives and property. In other words, we have suffered temporary local setbacks. This struggle has caused us great difficulties, and these difficulties will increase with the deepening of the Anti-Japanese War. However, the two years of the Anti-Japanese War have brought unprecedented progress to China in all aspects. The experiences and lessons of the Anti-Japanese War in the past two years have proved that the Anti-Japanese War is originally a long, cruel, difficult, and arduous process. As long as we are not afraid of sacrifice, not afraid of pain, and persist in a long-term war, the final victory will definitely belong to us, and the only way to support a long-term war and final victory lies in the greater unity and progress of the entire nation. Now, insisting on continuing the Anti-Japanese War has become an established national policy. The anti-Japanese sentiment of the military and civilians across the country is rising, and pro-Japanese compromise elements have begun to be washed out of the battlefield. International aid to China from Britain, the United States, and France is gradually becoming more active. This is a sign of China's greater unity and progress. On the other hand, after the Japanese invaded Wuhan and Guangzhou, they exposed their weaknesses of insufficient troops and divided forces, and gradually lost their advantages in coordinating operations of the sea, land, and air forces. In the vast areas occupied by the Japanese, we can see the activities of our guerrillas everywhere, making the Japanese exhausted and forced to change their plans; but we must still fully estimate that the Japanese still have some remaining power, and that they are fully prepared to continue attacking the southwest and northwest, while at the same time transferring troops to attack our guerrilla bases. We must especially fully estimate that, in addition to preparing for new military offensives, the Japanese are stepping up efforts to provoke discord and collude with pro-Japanese compromise elements in an attempt to disintegrate the anti-Japanese camp from within.

The first major turning point of this conspiracy was an attempt to establish a counter-Chiang and anti-Communist puppet central government. This is a serious phenomenon in the current political situation. Under this situation, the environment in which the border region is located is very clear. The Japanese attack on the northwest and the border region is undoubtedly an important part of the Japanese invasion plan. Therefore, we must oppose the illusion that the Japanese will not and dare not attack the northwest and the border region. Taking the border region as an example, the Japanese army once occupied Fugucheng in March of last year, and the Japanese artillery shelled Song Louchuan in September. Since November 24, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Yan'an. Don't these facts all show that the border region has become a direct target of the Japanese offensive? But at the same time, we must never be overwhelmed by the preparation of the Japanese to attack the northwest and the border region. The past few Japanese offensives have been attacked by us, and as a result, the Japanese have had to temporarily return. Even if the Japanese come to attack in the future, we are confident that we can stick to our base areas. We have already put forward the task of cooperating with friendly forces to fight for the defense of the northwest and the border region. What needs to be pointed out here is that, in order to realize the plan to attack the border region, the Japanese have been constantly using traitors, Trotskyites, and diehards to carry out various conspiratorial sabotage activities around and inside the border region, and systematically spread opinions about destroying the border region and destroying the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party throughout the country, such as saying that the border region government should be abolished, the Eighth Route Army is not fighting, and the Communist Party should be disbanded, etc., or separating the border region from the National Government and the people of the whole country, in order to achieve the purpose of attacking the border region and the northwest and cutting off the Sino-Soviet transportation line. The propositions he published included many absurd opinions. Isn't this obvious evidence? Therefore, our task is to mobilize the strength of the entire border region and the strength of friendly forces to fight against the Japanese and Japanese offensives in the border region and the northwest, and to support the war on the front lines. Under this task, we must raise the vigilance of the people of the entire border region and prevent the conspiratorial activities of the Han good Trotskyite diehards. We must warn those who consciously or unconsciously are influenced by the Japanese, Japanese, and traitorous influences and shout slogans, oppose and destroy the border region, and oppose and destroy the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party; what you are doing is welcomed by Japanese ××ism. No matter how you send them in the past, you are actually weakening the strength of the entire nation's resistance to Japan, which is tantamount to helping Japan × to destroy China! Your mistakes must be corrected, otherwise the abuse of the ages will be added to your heads.

Second, the Importance of the Border Region in the Anti-Japanese War

Why does Japanese ××ism painstakingly want to attack the border region? This is not surprising. It is undoubtedly because the border region stands in a very important position in the Anti-Japanese War. In what facts does the importance of the border region in the Anti-Japanese War lie? Its main manifestations are:

First, the border region is a politically important area in the whole of China. The people there have used their own strength to establish a base for the national liberation war in the past ten years, realized nationalism, obtained democracy and freedom, realized the people's rights, obtained people's livelihood reform, and realized the people's livelihood. In recent years, they have adhered to the anti-Japanese national united front and made a lot of efforts to unite the country. In the eighteen months of the Anti-Japanese War, they have contributed a great deal to assisting the front lines; under extremely difficult conditions, they have adhered to the correct political direction, carried forward the hard-working style, and strictly implemented clean politics. May I ask how many governments in the country are as clean as the border region government? The border region government is a local government under the jurisdiction of the central government, and the border region is a part of China's territory. More than that, it is an advanced part. We are not exaggerating to say that the border region is really a model anti-Japanese base area. In the border region, except for traitors, the people are given complete democratic rights. The people not only have complete freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and arms, but also implement universal, direct, equal, and anonymous democratic elections. In other words, the people of the border region have obtained democracy and freedom. They not only do not want to be the cattle and horses of Japanese ××ism, but also prepare to fight steadfastly with the Japanese ××. Not only have they established a democratic anti-Japanese base area, but also can contribute their experience to the people of the whole country, so that the people of the country can take less detours in the anti-Japanese struggle and the cause of national construction, and make the great cause of the national anti-Japanese war and national construction succeed as early as possible.

Second, the border region has a population of more than 2 million. Although most of the vast land is yellow soil grassland, the land is fertile. The arable land alone in the statistics of eighteen counties such as Yan'an is 400,000 miles. The current cultivated area is 9 million mu, and there is still a vast garden for customs clearance. The border region is extremely rich in grain and cotton production. Petroleum food is also a major production, animal husbandry is extremely developed, and there are also many coal and iron cocoons. Judging from these self-sufficient conditions, the border region is also a good place to adhere to the Anti-Japanese War. Moreover, the border region is also the salt land where our national ancestors originated. This is the mausoleum of the Xuanyuan real belt. Here, we have shed the blood of our ancestors to resist foreign insults. The people here have a particularly high sense of national self-esteem and self-confidence. This is because the people of the border region inherited the traditions of their ancestors.

Third, in military terms, because the border region occupies parts of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, connects Gansu and Ningxia to the west, connects Suiyuan to the north, and borders Shanxi to the east, it becomes the northern gate lock to protect the northwest on the one hand, and on the other hand, it becomes an important rear area for adhering to the anti-Japanese war in the northwest. In military terms, the border region is also the strategic fulcrum of North China and the Northwest. From this, we can know the importance of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. ×× will never give up the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, and the region must adhere to its own position and cooperate with the national strength to fight this evil ××.

Third, the Production and Basis of the Border Region

Precisely because of the importance of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, it is not only constantly subjected to the rumors, slander, attacks, and sabotage of traitors, but also becomes a thorn in the side of some diehards. They spread various rumors about the border region everywhere, and even said that the border region is "a new feudal separatist regime" and "the border region has no legal basis." Therefore, they demanded the abolition of the border region and carried out various sabotage conspiracies inside and outside the border region. Although these diehards are still inside the anti-Japanese camp today, the work they are doing today is actually beneficial to the Japanese ××.

Comrades, I will now talk about the existence of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has its full historical, factual, and legal basis. Now, this border region was originally the most backward and complex region ten years ago. The people here were subjected to cruel national and feudal exploitation economically, inhumane oppression and slavery politically, and were backward in culture to an almost unimaginable degree. After the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the people here could not bear this burden and automatically organized and armed themselves under the leadership of Chinese Communist Party comrades, and started the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle in this area. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, two Soviet governments, the Shaanxi-Gansu Border Region (including Guanzhong) and the Shaanbei (including Shenfu), were established one after another. Politically, they implemented the policies of national liberation ××ism and established a thorough democratic system. Economically, they implemented the distribution of land, abolished exorbitant taxes and levies, and improved the treatment of workers. Culturally, they also began to carry out compulsory education and social education, and at the same time universally organized and armed the people. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the main force of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north on the Long March to resist Japan, and after arriving in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, it unified the two governments and the newly developed areas and established the Northwest Office of the Soviet Central Government. Of course, this government should be directly led by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and directly supported and supervised by the local people. It is a completely independent, free, revolutionary, and democratic government. How can it be different from the bases of feudal warlords, because there is no warlord there?

(Note: A paragraph is missing in the original manuscript here, and it will be published in the next issue.)

Chairman Chiang and the representatives of the CPC Central Committee have repeatedly acknowledged the status of the border region government in their talks, and have repeatedly promised to issue orders formally recognizing the border region government. Premier Kong Xiangxi of the Executive Yuan also formally determined that the border region is an area under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan under the instructions of Chairman Chiang. Therefore, although we have not received a formal order from the National Government to formally establish the border region government, and some counties promised by Chairman Chiang have not been formally归belong to the border region, the legal status of the border region government has long been determined. Of course, we do not deny that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government has very different places from other areas under the jurisdiction of the National Government. The past history has made the Border Region Government have its own characteristics. Where are these characteristics? This is when we measure our border region with the breadth of the Three People's Principles, then I should boldly say: Our characteristic is that we earnestly realize the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program. This characteristic should not only not be abolished in the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction today, but should exist and develop greatly. This border region government that implements the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program is, of course, the most legal government. There is no doubt about it. Apart from the standards based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program, what other legal standards are there? Of course not. This is the production and basis of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, the initiator and steadfast implementer of the anti-Japanese national united front, the thorough implementer of the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program, the honest supporter of Chairman Chiang, the constituent part of the National Government, and the protector of national defense, protecting the Northwest, and adhering to the long-term war. This is the basis for the production of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

Fourth, Persisting in the Existence of the Border Region, Defending the Border Region, Striving for Victory in the Anti-Japanese War, and an Important Link in Building a New China of the Three People's Principles.

Comrades, in summary of the previous report, our conclusion is that the existence and consolidation of the border region are consistent with the interests of the people of the whole country. Any loss or weakening of the border region is actually of concern and care to patriotic compatriots across the country and peace-loving people all over the world. Young people from all over the country come to Yan'an to study, and detailed introductions about the border region are lengthy. These facts are enough to prove that owning the existence and consolidation of the border region represents the interests, will, and demands of the people of the whole country. This is a strong guarantee for striving for victory in the Anti-Japanese War and building a new China of the Three People's Principles. In the past two years, all our work, all our efforts, and all our struggles have been carried out in this direction. Therefore, we have sufficient reason to say that persisting in the existence of the border region and defending the border region is an important link in striving for victory in the Anti-Japanese War and building a new China of the Three People's Principles. This is the first part of my report.

### Total National Mobilization and Spiritual National Mobilization (Continued)

— Kai Feng

(III) Concerning national self-confidence and self-respect -- this is a necessary condition for the determination to resist and the belief in victory. If one belittles one's own nation and always feels that others' things are good and one's own things are not, if one does not have enough self-confidence and self-respect in one's own nation and one's own strength, then it is impossible to maintain the determination to resist and the confidence in victory. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must promote the glorious history of our nation, especially the national heroes who bravely sacrificed themselves for the nation and the country in the War of Resistance. National traitors and puppets have lost their Chinese humanity, abandoned the national integrity of our Chinese ancestors, and lost the excellent morals of our Chinese nation. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must enhance national integrity and promote national virtues. Similarly, in spiritual mobilization, we must promote revolutionary patriotism and the spirit of loving the nation. This includes two aspects: the first aspect is that we must inspire the love for one's own country in the people. The Japanese are trying to destroy our country. We cannot survive if we do not love our own country. The second aspect is that the government should pay more attention to and care about the suffering of the people, so that the people feel that their country is lovable. These two aspects must advance simultaneously. We must promote national thought. The promotion of this national thought is to inspire hatred for Japan. We must highly promote national hatred for Japan. Traitors and compromisers who rely on the breath of Japan are bringing the "Greater East Asiaism," "Sino-Japanese-Manchu Cooperation," and "Sino-Japanese-Manchu Community" manufactured by Japan to China, trying to extinguish the Chinese people's national hatred for Japan. It is these traitors who are advocating the idea of transcending the nation. Similarly, Japan is manufacturing pseudo-puppets, and some shameless traitors are playing on stage. Some compromisers are trying to cede certain territories of China and damage certain sovereign rights of China in order to seek compromise with Japan. It is these people who are damaging the absolute independence of the Chinese nation and damaging the absolute integrity of Chinese territorial sovereignty.

(IV) Concerning the improvement of politics -- the improvement of politics is a basic condition for guaranteeing victory in the war. Since the War of Resistance, there has been much progress in our country's politics, but from the perspective of guaranteeing victory in the war, it must be said that the progress of our country's politics is far from enough. The progress of the War of Resistance in politics is not enough to guarantee the final victory of the War of Resistance, especially at the current stage. We must make rapid progress in politics so that we can prepare our new strength more quickly. Chairman Chiang pointed out that in the Second Phase of the War of Resistance, "politics is more important than military affairs," which precisely illustrates the important significance of accelerating political progress at present. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must not only explain the necessity of political improvement, but also carry out real political improvement. Similarly, in spiritual mobilization, we must review the implementation of the central government's and the highest military's war-resistance laws and military orders. For example, in the past, Han Fuqu and Li Fuying, etc., could not execute the military orders of the highest military authorities and abandoned the country's territory without authorization. For example, on certain battle lines, individual military commanders were not resolute in executing the orders of the highest military authorities. For example, in the guerrilla areas after the occupation, individual responsible authorities automatically escaped when the enemy attacked. These all undermined the unity of military orders. Also, the local governments and lower-level political institutions did not earnestly implement the central government's conscription law in conscription, thus causing the phenomenon of extortion and fraud in conscription in some places. The central government's regulations on preferential treatment for the families of soldiers on expedition were not implemented in many places, thus affecting the smooth progress of conscription. Similar phenomena of not executing the central government's war-resistance orders precisely undermined the unity of political orders.

(V) Concerning the development of mass movements -- the purpose of spiritual mobilization is to achieve the exertion of organized strength, just as the program says, "not only in mobilization, but especially in organization." Through spiritual mobilization, more masses can be organized. Therefore, spiritual mobilization should not only be limited to general explanations and propaganda, but also be able to organize the masses in various ways in this explanation and propaganda. To be able to organize the masses, we must first earnestly implement the oath of the National Covenant and the methods of the National Assembly, and convene people of various natures and different professions to hold meetings separately in accordance with the outline of the National Monthly Assembly, and hold them on a regular basis. Through the form of the National Monthly Assembly, we should use existing organizations and create new organizations to organize all the people who have taken the oath of the National Covenant, so that the work of spiritual mobilization can be carried out regularly. After the National Covenant oath, we should establish regular political education for the people, "establish war-resistance consciousness, discuss the world situation, and study the history of the country and the rise and fall of the people and foreign troubles."

(VI) Concerning the establishment of wartime life -- "life is the foundation of the spirit. Without a rational life, there is no sound spirit." Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must make great efforts to mobilize the establishment of wartime life. The standard of wartime life is to break the life of drunken stupor, break the life of temporary ease, break the life of selfishness, and cultivate an enterprising and vigorous life, cultivate a life of great impartiality and courage, cultivate a life of brave sacrifice, and cultivate a life of killing oneself to achieve benevolence and sacrificing oneself to take righteousness. Concretely speaking, wartime life is based on the heroic sacrifice and hard struggle of the soldiers. When the War of Resistance has been going on for more than twenty months, the lives of the front line and the rear are still too far apart. The front line is heroically sacrificed, hard-fought, lively, and tense, while the rear still has a lot of drunken stupor, feasting and extravagance. Therefore, spiritual mobilization must make the life of the rear like the front line. Similarly, the disparity between the rich and the poor in the War of Resistance is also a reason that affects the interest of the working masses in participating in the War of Resistance. Therefore, after spiritual mobilization, we must lower the luxurious life of the rich and raise the life of the laboring masses who do not have enough food and clothing. This will better promote the enthusiasm of the laboring masses in participating in the War of Resistance and improving production.

A selfish life is to forget the interests of the nation and the country, and to put personal interests above the interests of the nation and the country. These people lack the concept of the nation and the country. They always want to use the environment created by the War of Resistance and the various difficulties of the War of Resistance to create personal interests, to achieve attempts outside the nation and the country, and to achieve the intention of making a fortune from the country. For example, there are phenomena such as manipulating the black market, monopolizing speculation, engaging in private malfeasance, and extorting and eating dirt. Spiritual mobilization must correct and sanction these phenomena.

Similarly, in spiritual mobilization, we must strengthen the concept of the interests of the nation and the country, so that everyone understands that the interests of the Chinese nation and the interests of the Chinese people should be higher than those of the revolutionaries. They should take the interests of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people as their interests.

Overcoming the Dangerous Signs of Relaxation in the War of Resistance

At present, the war seems to be in a state of temporary silence on the surface. This is firstly because Japan, after occupying Wuhan and Guangzhou, had to have a period of consolidation due to excessive consumption of troops. Secondly, after Japan's strategy of "quick victory" was broken, they thought of using the seemingly silent state of frontal warfare to carry out political division. On the one hand, they tempted some wavering compromisers and national traitors like Wang Jingwei to surrender openly. On the other hand, they used the seemingly silent state of frontal warfare to create peace illusions in some people in China, so as to relax our country's war resistance mobilization and the growth of new forces. At the same time, they wanted to use the seemingly silent state of frontal warfare to cause an increase in internal friction in China. Some short-sighted people were confused by Japan's conspiracy -- instead of concentrating all will and strength to strengthen war resistance mobilization and lengthen new forces, they used it to create internal friction. Secondly, Japan thought of using this period to concentrate its forces to "sweep away" the guerrilla areas. At this time, the tension and intensity of the war in the guerrilla areas, especially in the Northeast, were unprecedented. It is not easy for places far away from the guerrilla areas to feel the intensity of the war in the guerrilla areas. Due to all these reasons, after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, it is a fact that in some people in some places there was relaxation in war resistance mobilization. When the enemy is starting to attack, this relaxation phenomenon is a very serious and dangerous phenomenon for China's war resistance. Through this spiritual mobilization, we should overcome all these phenomena. Spiritual mobilization is a form of war resistance mobilization. If the work of explanation and propaganda is done well, and if it can be matched with the work of organizing the masses, it will definitely be able to exert its due effect. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly carry out the work of spiritual mobilization. The purpose of spiritual mobilization is also to promote organized strength, strengthen war resistance mobilization, and strengthen war resistance strength.

### Great Annihilation Battle in Zaoyang, North Hubei  An Entire Japanese Regiment Falls into Trap and is Annihilated Entirely Plan to Invade Northern Hunan is Shattered by Us

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 8th] Since our army launched attacks on various lines in Zoufu, central Jiangxi, and northern Hunan, it has been more than ten days, and it has experienced nearly 50 battles of various sizes. Strategically and tactically, it has achieved considerable results. First, the Japanese claim to move troops to invade northern Hunan has been preempted and shattered by us. Second, in each battle, our army can exchange small sacrifices for great victories. The total amount of spoils and captures in these ten days exceeds our own consumption and casualties by about two times. Third, each time we attack, we can seize the initiative and strike the Japanese everywhere, making the Japanese flustered and running for their lives, without time to fight back. Fourth, each place that is attacked by us is a vital point of the Japanese, often causing them to suffer great losses and threats. What is especially characteristic is that our army's coordination and application of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare has gradually become more mature in this attack, and it has the momentum of evolving from a guerrilla force posture to a field army posture. Therefore, although our army is currently not in a hurry to seek the occupation of strategic points, it sometimes does not hesitate to defend the occupied areas with all its might at a certain time.

[Central News Agency, Zaoyang Front, 7th] In Yinjia Village east of the city, our army's front made a large opening on the 7th, luring the Japanese to go deep. A Japanese regiment fell into our trap, and we surrounded and attacked them, annihilating more than a thousand Japanese and seizing many war trophies.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 8th] On the road to loss of the plum blossoms, the Japanese have been attacking us fiercely for days. After our courageous resistance, the Japanese have not succeeded. In the Huangjia Village, Taer Village, Sunjia Village area, we killed more than 5,000 Japanese in the past three days. Currently, we are still in bloody battles. Our Japanese are still fighting fiercely in the Zhongxiang area. There is only minor contact on the Yichang-Yidu front.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 10th] The Japanese are currently rushing to build fortifications in the area east of the Xilong River, with the appearance of holding firm. A certain unit of our troops occupying Tuochuan Port continues to move forward, and on the 6th, it had advanced to the area of Yanmen Pass and Wamiaoji, and launched a surprise attack on a Japanese camp.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 8th] Chinese sources: Five Chinese planes yesterday flew to Yingcheng and Xiaogan, north of Hankou, to bomb Japanese troops. Chinese pilots regarded this bombing as a "bombing to eradicate the Japanese." As a result, a large number of Japanese troops were annihilated.

[Central News Agency, Xiangyang, 7th] Japanese planes, in groups of three to five, bombed Xiangfan and the inner and outer suburbs of Laohekou in several batches on the morning and afternoon of the 7th. Our losses are under investigation.

[Central News Agency, Xiangyang, 7th] More than twenty Japanese planes invaded the city's airspace at about 8:00 p.m. on the 7th. At that time, it was already dark. The Japanese planes dropped dozens of bombs in the darkness and left in the wilderness.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 7th] On the 6th, more than a thousand Japanese launched a counterattack on Nanlin Bridge. After our army intercepted them, the exhausted Japanese soldiers were finally repelled by our elite troops. The Japanese troops in Chongyang and Tongcheng are still in our heavy encirclement.

[Central News Agency, Xianning, 8th] A certain unit of our troops has cleared out the Japanese troops in Dongxintang Market, Chongyang. Baini Bridge was also surrounded by us again. On the morning of the 5th, Japanese Major General Sugiyama led more than a thousand soldiers to attack Shimiaog in Zhongjiao North, attempting to break through. Our army bravely met the enemy and fought fiercely. By noon on the 6th, hundreds of Japanese had been killed, and fierce fighting is still underway.

Annihilating the Japanese on the Outskirts of Nanchang

[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 7th] Starting at noon on the 6th, the thousands of Japanese in Nanchang, with several cannons attached, launched counterattacks in two routes: one attacked Hanwang Temple from Tang Village, and the other advanced towards Guangyang Bridge from Qingyunpu via Continental Bridge. There were fierce battles on each route.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 7th] At dawn on the 6th, our army once attacked Hongmen Bridge in Nanchang. The Japanese reinforced, and our army retreated to Guangyang Bridge. The Japanese are now counterattacking our army in three routes from Tangxi, Qingyunpu, and Continental Bridge. Our army is still encircling the Japanese army in three routes on the outer lines, giving them a fierce annihilation.

[Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 7th] All of our troops besieging Nanchang continue to make progress. The Eastern Route Army once again broke into the old airfield and began to fight fiercely with the Japanese in the Jinpan Road area. Our Southern Route Army has advanced to a certain place south of Nanchang along the highway. At the same time, our plainclothes teams are even more active in the suburbs and urban areas of Nanchang. The Japanese are extremely panicked.

[Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 7th] A certain division of our army broke into Jinpan Road in the city of Nanchang at dawn.

The evacuees are no longer fleeing from Chongqing and walking along the various relief stations. All public and private vehicles have been requisitioned to transport refugees and their belongings to the first relief station for rest and food, and then they are sent on their way from there. Workers are still excavating in the destroyed areas, and the remains of people who have been bombed or burned to death are constantly being discovered, but it is impossible to identify them.

### May Ninth National Humiliation Shanghai People Observe Vegetarian Diet in Commemoration

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Shanghai News: Yesterday was China's May Ninth National Humiliation Day. Various Chinese groups in Shanghai especially requested citizens to eat vegetarian food for one day.

In addition, the three hundred soldiers of the puppet army under Li Zhongcai in Jixian County also revolted in full on the 26th of last month. The Japanese and puppet advisors were all executed. The trend of revolt is extremely strong in the area, and our army is powerful, making the Japanese army very panicked.

The treatment was ineffective, and he died on the morning of the 8th. He was buried in the afternoon.

### Southeast Coastal × Ships Rampant, Merchant Ships Frequently Encounter Trouble, British Government Values Navigation Rights, Sending Warships to Southern China Said

[Central News Agency Fuzhou, 7th] Since × ships have intensified the blockade of our coastal ports, over the past ten days, merchant ships from Britain, the United States, France, and Germany, on the seas off Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, have been repeatedly detained, looted, and searched by × ships. The number is no less than thirty or forty ships. British merchant shipping companies have successively requested their respective governments to lodge serious protests with ×. It is heard that the British government has now decided to dispatch a large number of warships to southern China to protect navigation rights and order each merchant ship to install gun emplacements to implement armed self-defense.

### A Meeting with General Tang Enbo

— Gao Fen

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] We have met General Zhang Fakui, who once commanded armies, General Bai Chongxi, who was dignified and outstanding, and General Wu Qihui, who was amiable and approachable. But the one with a simple and unadorned quality, wearing an ant cloth Zhongshan suit, with a peasant-like facial expression, and who is modest and shrewd, is General Tang Enbo. During battles, he would certainly patrol the front lines alone on horseback, directing junior officers to fight and inspecting the terrain. He was strict in governing the army and emphasized soldier education. His troops were elite. He established meritorious service in many battles, such as the Battle of Nankou, the Battle of Xuzhou, and the defense of Greater Wuhan, where he fought on the Ruiwu Line... Now, he has shifted from the battlefield, where he strategized and commanded, to concentrating his energy on training thousands of excellent ×× troops. He greets every visiting guest with a smile. Just as he could shake hands and chat with farmers on the battlefield and could talk about scriptures with the monks in the temples of the ×× mountains, encouraging them to participate in the resistance against Japan, and organize stray children, ensuring they receive a good education, calling each child by name in a friendly manner... These are the indelible impressions he left on the common people on various battlefields. In ××, he influenced more than thirty Japanese prisoners of war, and a group of common people developed feelings of respect and love for him. These displays of spirit are worthy of emulation by many officers.

He originally had foresight in politics. When the fighting on the Eastern Front had just ended, he held cadre training classes in his direct subordinate units. "Cadres are the keys to the people." Today, he shoulders a greater mission as the education chief of the ×× cadre training class. The excellent young people of ×× are partly serving battalion commanders with combat experience and partly political workers. There are also over a hundred female comrades, all dispatched from various troops and war zones across the country. Some come from as far away as Xinjiang, Gansu, and Suiyuan. "The training focuses on political aspects, and after the training, they will be distributed to the rear of × people, striking at the appeasement policies implemented by × people and striving for a greater number of people with our own regime."

"General Tang, what are your thoughts on the overall strategy after the fall of Nanchang?" Although the general did not participate in commanding the Ganbei campaign this time, he still has a profound understanding of the overall situation. He smiled, lowered his voice, and said slowly, "I don't have much to say... but after the fall of Nanchang, Changsha can be protected without worry. The battle situation in northern Hunan is stable. × people's capture of Nanchang only increases their own burden and consumes manpower... Nanchang is being attacked by our country. Our counter-attacking troops are very effective. × troops hoped to seize a stronghold, but who knew it would become a place surrounded by us..." His words were concise and powerful, but he was always smiling. Then, based on the current battle situation, he confidently predicted that the main force of the × people would concentrate on the north bank of the Yangtze River to sweep away our guerrillas.

The defense of Xuzhou left an indelible impression on everyone. Because of this, General Tang again recalled the cooperation between the military and civilians in Xuzhou, the true situation of the people helping in the battle. He praised it vigorously, raising his voice particularly high, saying, "The people of Xuzhou are the best and very brave. They can truly assist the soldiers in combat, and some care for the soldiers like their own family, delivering tea, water, and food to the front lines. This is a rare thing in any war zone... Therefore, the fighting strength of the brothers has been greatly enhanced. ×" The main reason why Xuzhou was able to be defended for a relatively long time was that the people cooperated with the disciplined army, achieving a level of military-civilian mutual assistance. Now, it has been a full ten months since the fall of Xuzhou. In these ten months, our war has entered the second phase. "Propaganda is more important than combat" and "strengthening military-civilian cooperation." But what we see is, how is the mass mobilization work in each war zone? Is it better than or at least as good as Xuzhou's performance? Based on the facts, finding an old commoner near the Nanyuan front lines still requires the army to search for them with all kinds of methods. On the Guangdong front lines, although the commoners do not necessarily run away upon hearing the sound of cannons, there are still those who remain on the front lines and act as traitors. This makes us reflect painfully on how we should be vigilant.

General Tang's conversation gradually became livelier. When talking about Mr. Ludi, who had taught for two weeks in the training class, he said, "He and Mr. Feng Naichao came to see me yesterday, but unfortunately, I wasn't home." He smiled, looking very apologetic. "I wanted to see them, but I don't know the way." Mr. Yao, who was with us, told him that we were very familiar friends with Mr. Ludi and that if we went to see him now, he could guide the way. So he stood up excitedly and asked his entourage to take care of his luggage because he would be leaving in two hours. We ran out of the Lequn Society's gate. It was raining goose feathers in the sky, and none of us had brought raincoats. Mr. Yao held up an umbrella: "Let's share an umbrella." He quickly and modestly said, "It's okay, it's okay." In a moment, he was soaked all over, but he didn't seem to notice anything, talking about the weather in Guilin as he walked. Unfortunately, Mr. Ludi had just gone out, and we missed him, and he reluctantly returned.

This time, General Tang was in a great hurry, and being able to talk so freely was very exciting. (Draft from the National Salvation Society)

### A Follow-up Report on the Battle of Ji Wang Mountain—An Interview with a Soldier from Special Regiment 1

— Sanjiang

Q: I heard that after you arrived at Ji Wang Mountain last year, you engaged the × people several times. But each time,

A: There were about three times. Our team (referring to Special Regiment 1) fought the bravest.

Q: What were those three times?

A: The first time was the Battle of Yangjialing (October 14, 1938). The 6th Company suffered the greatest losses. The 6th Company Commander, Zhan Ming, personally led thirty-odd daring warriors. Around 2 a.m. at night, they attacked the × people in Xijing Village. They didn't fire a single shot. When they reached the × people, they used hand grenades to kill thirty or forty of them. I heard that the × people hadn't even put on their pants and fought each other. At dawn, the × people counterattacked and occupied Yangjialing. The × people lost forty or fifty men in total this time. We had nine soldiers wounded or killed. The second time (November 8), over a thousand × people attacked Ji Wang Mountain in three routes. One route went through Shao Village East Village, another through Shao Village. Both routes attacked Shanmen Village. The other route went to Sanlu Li Village, using artillery to bombard Bajiamen and Shanmen Village. The 7th Company alone fought them for most of the day at Shanmen Village. But the 7th Company used fortifications for ambush. After the × people got close, they used light machine guns and rifles to fiercely attack. As a result, because the × people's strength was too great, the 7th Company retreated to the trench. The × people then retreated to Sanlu Li Village. The × people suffered twenty or thirty casualties this time. One of our soldiers was injured by machine gun fire, and two were injured by artillery fire. The third time (December 5), the × people besieged Ji Wang Mountain from eight routes. The 3rd Battalion fought the most fiercely with the × people. From 3 a.m., when the × people began their attack, the 3rd Battalion fought the × people continuously until dusk.

Q: Please tell me in detail what happened during this battle.

A: The × people began their attack from Mo Village around 2 a.m. Because the 3rd Battalion's position was near Hanxue Village (about five miles from Guojiacha and Shanmen Village), and the terrain was relatively low, the × people came straight from behind in close formation. When Battalion Commander Yan received the report, he ordered the 7th and 9th Companies to prepare for battle. 7th Company Commander Li Shoupeng and 9th Company Commander Xie Lidao saw that the × people were only about three hundred meters from the position and immediately ordered to open fire, wiping out the × people. At the same time, 7th Company's 1st Platoon Leader He Li and 9th Company's 1st Platoon Leader Ma Jing each selected ten brave men and launched an attack, using hand grenades to bomb the × people. Many × people were wounded or killed at the time, and they captured a × person's Miyajima flag. The × people then launched a fierce counterattack and had to retreat to their original position. As a result, 7th Company Commander Li Shoupeng and 9th Company Platoon Leader Zhang Changsheng were wounded, and over twenty soldiers were killed or wounded.

Q: How was Company Commander Li wounded?

A: Because the × people occupied Xue Village Ditch, they used artillery to bombard behind Guojiacha. Over a hundred × people's cavalry charged towards our position. Company Commander Li was injured near his left eye and had to retreat the troops slightly to the new position.

Q: The × people's artillery fire was so fierce, why didn't the 3rd Battalion retreat?

A: Because the × people surrounded them from several directions, they couldn't get out. The battalion commander and deputy battalion commander (Zhang Shaozong) personally led the 8th and 9th Companies several times without success. As a result, Deputy Battalion Commander Chen died (behind the northeast high ground of Shao Village Zhong Village).

Q: What other spoils of war did you get?

A: 7th Company Platoon Leader Chen Zuolin also obtained × people's light machine guns, rifles, helmets, and bullets. Because the battalion commander ordered him to attack the right flank of the × people, he went through that depression. The × people didn't know about it, giving him a surprise attack.

Q: Didn't the × people attack Shanmen Village at all? Which company was defending there?

A: Two platoons of the 8th Company were at Shanmen Village. Because the security army of Village fought the × people at Shao Village, the × people didn't dare come. They only used artillery bombardment. However, the × people's forces were very strong in the Shao Village and Shangguo Village area. The × people at the foot of the mountain were on the defensive. The rest came from behind.

Q: Where was the 1st Battalion?

A: The 1st Battalion ambushed the × people in the Wencun Liulin Village area.

Q: Where was the 2nd Battalion?

A: The 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion was the first to contact the × people at Han Village. The 4th Company ambushed the × people in the Shi Village Ditch position. The 6th Company ambushed the × people in the Yangjialing position.

Q: In total, how many casualties did the × people suffer in this battle, and how many did we suffer?

A: The × people lost one artillery colonel (at Bajiamen) and one Commander Ushijima (in front of the 3rd Battalion's position). The rest of the officers and soldiers totaled three or four hundred dead and wounded. Our regiment lost one officer (Deputy Battalion Commander Zhang Shaozong), over twenty soldiers were killed, and two officers and over ten soldiers were wounded. The 3rd Battalion suffered the most.

Q: I heard that Brigade Commander Xu also died in battle this time. How did Brigade Commander Xu die?

A: I heard that after the × people occupied Gouxi Village, the brigade commander personally led the guards to Bajiamen to supervise the battle and was killed by × people's artillery fire. At the same time, the Guard Company Commander also died in battle.

Our losses in this battle were also great, but the brothers became more and more enthusiastic as they fought. Everyone was determined to drive the Japanese × people out of China.

The exercise call sounded. I told him to go to the exercise, and he stopped talking.

### Results of Milan Talks: German-Italian Political and Military Alliance, Foreign Ministers of Both Countries Return Home Separately, Rumor of Italian King's Reciprocal Visit to Germany

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] The German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met in Milan and have agreed to conclude an Italian-German military alliance. After their talks, they issued a communique stating: "Ciano and Ribbentrop considered the current general situation and international situation during their talks on May 6th and 7th. The absolute identity of the two governments' observations has been expressed again. Therefore, it has been decided to jointly conclude a political and military alliance as the final way to maintain the relationship between the two Axis powers. Germany and Italy also want to make an effective contribution to guaranteeing peace in Europe through this."

[Central News Agency, Rome, 7th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that the political and military alliance agreed upon by the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in Milan yesterday will be formally signed in Berlin in a short period of time.

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] Political circles here did not regard the announcement of the formal alliance between Germany and Italy as an unusual move. According to the commentary published by Gayda in "Italian Voice," the understanding between Italy and Germany has not changed due to this alliance. In fact, the reason why the two countries announced the formal alliance is simply to publicly tighten Italy's commitment. Ciano's mouthpiece, "Telegraph," stated that Germany and Italy recognize that each has its own sphere of interests. In the Italian side, it is the entire Mediterranean, and in the German side, it is the Baltic Sea and Central Europe. The two countries will carry out their own work with absolute self-reliance, and they should not force absolute direct assistance to the other party, except to facilitate their progress. However, in one situation, the two countries should be absolutely united. What is this situation? It is the ideological war. In this case, both countries have reaffirmed their determination, because they understand that if one country fails, the other cannot survive alone. Ciano will return to Rome today, and Ribbentrop will also depart for Germany.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 7th] Chancellor Hitler visited Italy last May. It is now widely rumored here that Italian King Emmanuel III has decided to visit Germany for a reciprocal visit on the 28th of this month.

[Associated Press, Rome, 7th] According to well-informed sources, after Germany and Italy conclude a military alliance, it makes it possible for Japan to quickly join in forming a triangular military alliance. If the Soviet Union, in view of this move by Germany and Italy, renews negotiations with Britain and France to form a tripartite alliance, then Germany and Italy will conclude an anti-communist military agreement with Japan. Japanese officials here admitted that the Japanese government is approaching Germany and Italy to negotiate the conclusion of an anti-communist military agreement. However, so far, there has been no success. Observers generally believe that the reason why Germany and Italy have not yet concluded a military agreement with Japan is to observe whether the Soviet Union will adopt an isolated attitude towards European events. It is heard that the conclusion of the alliance between Germany and Italy is intended to guarantee each other that if the implementation of a policy by either party causes a war, the other party should provide assistance. Otherwise, Germany and Italy would never conclude this alliance.

### After Germany and Italy Announce Alliance, Current Situation Not Affected, Britain and Soviet Union Believe It Is a Response to Peace Group, US Speculates Japan Will Be Isolated

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] After Germany and Italy decided to conclude a political and military alliance, financial figures here commented that Japan has always opposed the signing of a military alliance by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Now that Germany and Italy have established this agreement, it may not be impossible to induce Japan to change its original intention. The main goal of Germany and Italy in doing this is to respond to the efforts of Britain and France to organize an anti-aggression group. But in practical terms, the current situation will not change because of this. German and Italian staff officers have repeatedly held talks recently, and German Aviation Minister Goering has even visited Italian Libya to inspect defenses. Their close military cooperation has not been a matter of one day, which can be seen from this. However, the outside world had hoped that Italy could maintain neutrality in wartime, but now it has been despaired of.

[Reuters, London, 7th] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the conclusion of a political and military alliance by Germany and Italy to demonstrate the relationship between the Axis powers is not surprising here. However, officials are reserving criticism for the time being because the detailed contents of the alliance have not yet been obtained. But what we must remember is that for a considerable period of time, the relationship between Germany and Italy has become a favorite topic for German and Italian politicians. The tone of the German-Italian communique seems to be specifically aimed at stopping rumors that Italy is dissatisfied with German policies. But from another perspective, if the general Italian people are dissatisfied with the existing German-Italian connection, then the conclusion of the alliance is enough to show their dissatisfaction. Observers in London believe that the alliance is to determine Germany's military position in German-Italian relations. Diplomatic circles are discussing two points: (1) the impact of Italy's possible neutrality in certain circumstances; (2) Germany's relations with the Mediterranean and North Africa.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] Government-affiliated sources commented that the political and military alliance between Germany and Italy is slightly different. In the past, the countries have already maintained an alliance relationship militarily. This event is only to confirm it legally and will not affect the international situation. The common intention is probably that because the attitude of Western European countries is firm, they want to respond with intimidation.

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Diplomats here speculate that the German-Italian military alliance may isolate Japan and force it to seek closer relations with Western democracies. Trade experts, who are well aware that Japan's trade is heavily dependent on Britain and the United States, believe that Japan is the most economically vulnerable. According to statistics, in 1937, 72 percent of Japan's wartime needs were imported from Britain and the United States, only 4 percent from Germany, and even less from Italy, which can be ignored. Senator King said that the purpose of Germany and Italy's military alliance, even if not to dominate the world, must be to conquer Europe.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 8th] Today, newspapers here attach great importance to the German-Italian military agreement and say that German political figures will successively go to Italy for reciprocal visits. London and Paris are not surprised by the conclusion of this agreement between Germany and Italy. The French "Radio Communication Agency" said that this agreement cannot change the European situation. The "Paris Morning News" also holds the same view. However, after the signing of this agreement, the newspapers have changed their tone on the issue of Danzig, anticipating that Italy will support Germany's demands. "Little Paris News" advocates opposing the solution of the Danzig issue by voting, saying that most of the citizens are Germans, and the political power is also in the hands of the Germans. Britain and France must still be prepared to prevent unforeseen circumstances. The current evolution of the European situation depends on how the Soviet Union responds to the British proposal.

### British Labor Party Suggests Reorganizing Army, Simon Delivers Speech, Britain Prepared for the Worst

[Reuters, London, 7th] The British Labor Party's defense policy suggests reorganizing the British army and democratizing it. The policy has been decided and will be submitted to the Labor Party Congress in Weisan. It advocates increasing wages, improving working conditions, and establishing a supply department and a defense department, giving them broad powers to prevent manufacturing delays and improper profiteering. It stipulates that those seeking positions must first serve in the army for one year, saying that this will be very effective both militarily and socially, and advocates that army personnel be free to join various labor unions and professional organizations.

[Reuters, London, 10th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered a speech in Great Yarmouth yesterday, discussing the government's conscription decision. He said that the international situation is changing rapidly and that we must be prepared early and must not prepare only after the outbreak of the 1914 war. We must immediately show the country's strength.

### Japanese Minister of Agriculture Sakurai Cries Out Bitterly, the Result of the Invasion of China Is Human Power Depletion and Raw Material Shortages Are Particularly Serious

[Reuters Tokyo Correspondence] When recently asked if he felt a lack of manpower supply in Japanese farming villages, Minister of Agriculture Sakurai said that many farming villages felt a sense of insufficient manpower. In addition to the need to draw strong young men for the war against China, thus causing a large-scale depletion of manpower everywhere, farmers from all over the country have also flocked to munitions factories and other factories for work. This phenomenon is most pronounced in villages near large cities. Sakurai also said that the Japanese government authorities had drafted a plan to organize "manpower teams," each team of about fifty people, to be sent to various villages in rotation to help with work during busy farming seasons, and are preparing to increase women's participation in field work and to conscript senior middle school students and junior middle school students to perform service. Sakurai also said that, based on government control, the problem of raw material shortages is even more serious than the manpower problem. Because the government controls iron, farming tools are in short supply. The lack of wire has greatly affected the fruit box manufacturing industry. The plan to allocate fertilizers is also hindered by the lack of kerosene. Engines have to be shut down due to insufficient fuel. At the same time, pesticides for crops are also unavailable.

### Germany Assures Italy Not to Use Force Against Poland, Condition for Concluding Alliance, German-Polish Relations Await German Self-Determination

[Reuters, Warsaw, 7th] Officials here are unwilling to criticize the alliance between Germany and Italy before fully understanding its truth. However, the feeling here is that the German-Italian alliance is sufficient to weaken Poland's international position in any possible negotiations on the Danzig issue. According to non-official observations, Italy was actually forced to conclude an alliance with Germany, which was not its original intention. Italy is unwilling to cause a European war because of the Danzig issue. At the same time, Mussolini must have obtained Hitler's assurance that he will take easing steps in the future in order to allow mutual conclusion of an alliance with Germany. The Polish government's mouthpiece newspaper hopes that Germany can choose a peaceful path and conduct negotiations based on the program indicated by Burke's speech.

[Central News Agency, Milan, 7th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that Germany has provided assurance to Italy, declaring that it will never use violence to implement various demands on Poland. In other words, it will not place a fait accompli before Italy. This is the condition for Italy's agreement to sign a political and military alliance. Although Italy has been cooperating militarily with Germany for a long time, it did not agree to the formal conclusion of a treaty of alliance. After Germany repeatedly proposed negotiations, it always treated them with a cold attitude. Now, it finally agreed to sign this alliance because it sincerely hoped that the issue of the Free City of Danzig could be resolved peacefully, which led to the fact that Germany had to abandon its soul-destroying plan for the Free City of Danzig in order to get Italy to accept this alliance.

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] The "Frankfurter Zeitung" commented today, "Poland and the Western European countries have had an opportunity to reflect. We only hope that they can use it." The newspaper also stated that Hitler's proposal to Poland has received Italy's full support. Italy has never opposed Germany's firm proposal, because otherwise, Italy's sea in Poland will be difficult to navigate freely.

### Former British Consul in Hankou, Sir Goffe, Passes Away

[Reuters, London, 8th] Sir Goffe, who once served as the Consul-General in Hankou, has recently passed away at the age of sixty-nine.

### German Navy and Air Force Conduct Exercises in Denmark

[Reuters, Copenhagen, 8th] Germany is currently conducting naval exercises in the Øresund and Skagerrak off Bornholm, with 32 warships of various types and aircraft participating. This is the first time that exercises have been held there since the European War.

### British Reply to the Soviet Union: To Be Delivered by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Foreign Minister; Soviet Union and Turkey Agree to Strengthen Friendly Relations; Potemkin Passes Through Bulgaria En Route to Romania

[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The British Ambassador here, Seeds, has received the British government's reply to the Soviet Union's proposal and will visit the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, for discussions. Furthermore, Soviet officials and newspapers are keeping silent about Litvinov's resignation. According to a responsible spokesperson for the Soviet government, due to the severity of the international situation in recent weeks, the press has not criticized diplomatic events, and the government is unwilling to express definite commitments.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 7th] The French Chargé d'Affaires, Béhier, visited the British Ambassador today for talks. The British and French embassies are in close contact.

[Reuters, Moscow, 7th] The Soviet official news agency reported that the talks between the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, and the Turkish Foreign Minister in Ankara were extremely good. "Both sides are in complete agreement on strengthening friendly relations between the two countries for the benefit of world peace," it said.

[Reuters, Sofia, Bulgaria, 8th] The Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, met yesterday with King Boris and the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Georgi Kyoseivanov, before leaving for the Romanian capital.

### Soviet Union Assures Britain That Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Reports of Rapprochement Between Germany and the Soviet Union Are Inaccurate

[Reuters, London, 8th] This agency has learned that the British government has received assurances from the Soviet Union that, although Litvinov has resigned, Soviet foreign policy remains unchanged.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th] There is much speculation about whether the Soviet Union's future foreign policy will change. According to the Politburo, which decides Soviet foreign policy, there will be no sudden changes. Rumors of a rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union are inaccurate, considering the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the situation in the Far East, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, and the enthusiastic support for President Roosevelt's appeal for peace.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] Political circles here believe that after the resignation of the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, there is a possibility of a rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union. The most reliable sources believe that this is purely a rumor, but they do not deny the possibility that relations between Germany and Italy will not improve. The rumors of a rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union are based on: (1) Litvinov's resignation, as Litvinov was Jewish; (2) "Pravda" commented on Molotov but did not attack him; (3) German newspapers have not attacked the Soviet Union recently; (4) The Hamburger Fremdenblatt editorial yesterday stated that after Litvinov's resignation, the ideological obstacles between Germany and the Soviet Union could be removed; (5) According to reports from Tokyo, Germany threatened Japan that if it did not change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, it would reach an understanding with the Soviet Union.

### Vast Expanse of Sea and Sky: The Royal Yacht and Escorting Ships Sail Through Rain and Fog

[Reuters, London, 8th] A dispatch from the Reuters correspondent on board the British Royal Yacht "Empress of Australia" en route to Canada reports: "We are now sailing in the rain, with a slight swell and a slight rocking of the ship. The King and Queen are quite able to withstand the waves. Although it is raining, all the scheduled events are proceeding as usual. Even in the Atlantic Ocean, our journey is well-organized. We passed five escort ships, which patrolled close to the yacht and sounded their whistles to show respect. Last night, the King and Queen dined with the royal family and then listened to the orchestra on board, which included "The Blue Danube" waltz and a theme song from the film "Snow White." This morning, we entered heavy fog and reduced speed. The whistles of the yacht and the escort ships echoed each other. The heavy fog cleared at 8:00 a.m. We are now sailing in a vast expanse of sea and sky in light rain."

Short Commentary

### Ministry of Education Bans Political Special Schools

Yesterday, the Ta Kung Pao Evening News published a dispatch from Chongqing stating that the Ministry of Education has ordered all provincial education departments, schools at all levels, and other relevant parties to ban political special schools. We believe that this news deserves attention: firstly, because the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction movement has entered a new and arduous stage, we must overcome new difficulties and strive for final victory. We must ensure that the national education system serves the cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and any violations of this supreme principle should be banned. Secondly, the Japanese invasion of China is gradually entering a stage of difficulty and failure. In order to save their crisis, they are intensifying their political conspiracies. Traitors and national betrayers, such as ×××, are using various methods to spread their "anti-Communist peace" and other capitulationist theories and activities in cultural circles, especially in education. This activity already exists among overseas Chinese, in occupied areas, and even in some areas of the rear. Therefore, it is necessary to ban this kind of educational organization.

However, we believe that, firstly, a ban based solely on an official order will not have much effect. We must also carry out extensive publicity and explanation work, mobilize the power of the masses, and conduct a tenacious struggle. Secondly, at the same time, we must actively encourage all educational institutions that do not violate the supreme principles of the revolutionary Three People's Principles and serve the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and actively consolidate and expand state-run and public educational institutions. Since the War of Resistance, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University and the Shaanbei Public School in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have, in accordance with the supreme principles of the revolutionary Three People's Principles, and in order to meet the urgent needs of serving the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, successively cultivated thousands of young cadres for the country and the nation, supplementing the front lines, penetrating behind enemy lines, and serving the rear areas again and again, even five or six times. Over the past two years, they have made the greatest contribution to the cause of Chinese national liberation. We hope that the government authorities will provide unified guidance and leadership, and provide practical support and assistance to these schools and similar educational institutions, regardless of party affiliation or regional origin. If we do not support this kind of War of Resistance and National Reconstruction education while banning traitors and pro-Japanese factions, we will certainly not achieve the desired results. If we broadly ban all "political special schools" on the grounds that they are "unapproved," and even allow traitors and national betrayers to carry out conspiracies in "approved" schools, then we have nothing to say but protest! For the sake of the future of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we cannot but demand that the government pay close attention to this!

### A Comprehensive Discussion of the Current International Situation (Continued)

— Liao Chong Sheng

Not only that, but Soviet Russia's contribution to world peace is even greater than passive tolerance. Last year, when the Czech crisis became increasingly acute, the Soviet Union, in order to fulfill its treaty obligations, declared on September 21st through Litvinov: "The Soviet military authorities, in view of the current situation, are prepared to immediately consult with the military leaders of France and Czechoslovakia to consider the steps that should be taken immediately." On the eve of the signing of the Munich Agreement, Litvinov solemnly warned the powers: "The spirit of the League of Nations should not avoid a crisis in which war and peace are still uncertain, but lead to an inevitable great war in the future!" In reiterating his country's solemn position, he further stated: "The Soviet Union does not condone this kind of politics (referring to sacrificing weak countries in order to seek temporary security through concessions). It feels honored and will have no intention of violating this policy in the future. It firmly believes that in the current situation, there is no way to guarantee genuine peace other than this path (collective security). What the Soviet Union expects from the powers is nothing more than to return to this path." From this, the firmness of the Soviet attitude can be said to be as clear as looking at one's palm.

4. The Shift in Polish and Romanian Diplomacy

Poland and Romania are located between Soviet Russia and Western Europe. After the war, in order to defend against the Soviet Union, they formed an alliance with each other. Today, with the rapprochement between Western European democratic countries and the Soviet Union, Poland and Romania are undoubtedly a major key, both geographically and politically. Therefore, their diplomatic trends cannot be ignored.

Polish diplomacy, under the leadership of Foreign Minister Beck, has always been known for its "balancing act." In recent years, because France's power in Southeastern Europe has declined, it has not hesitated to collude with Germany to satisfy its long-held desire to annex the coal-rich and railway and highway transportation hub of Czech Teschen, and to complete its dream of Poland and Hungary bordering each other. The signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact five years ago marked the beginning of mutual friendship. However, good times are hard to last. After the Munich Conference, although the desire to seize Teschen was fulfilled, the dream of bordering each other was not realized, and Poland itself had become a restricted area for Germany's eastward expansion. Better late than never. Beck's diplomatic policy underwent a significant change. The renewal of the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on November 26th last year was the beginning of its shift. At that time, Polish public opinion unanimously praised it, and even the far-right newspapers that advocated anti-communism recognized this move as "timely and important." As for the semi-official mouthpiece of the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kuryer Krakqwski), in commenting on the Ukrainian issue, it further stated that "Germany has used Ruthenia as its base for directing anti-Soviet and anti-Polish activities. However, even today, Germany and the Ukrainians must thoroughly understand that if the Ukrainian issue is used as an excuse for anti-Soviet and anti-Polish activities, the result will only be to increase the understanding between the Soviet Union and Poland."

Because Germany still needs to utilize Poland, it suddenly adopted a restrained attitude towards Poland and sent its Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Warsaw on January 25th of this year to return the visit. After two days of detailed talks, although the Polish authorities claimed that the negotiations were extremely "satisfactory" and that "all doubts had been dispelled," in fact, Foreign Minister Beck's attitude was unexpectedly tough, and all of Germany's requests, such as further concessions on the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway across the Pomeranian province of northern Poland, were rejected. Moreover, the important mission undertaken by the German Foreign Minister was to inquire about what attitude Poland would take if Germany and Italy were to pressure Western Europe. In fact, Germany desires Poland to maintain neutrality for two reasons: (1) to prevent Poland from fulfilling the Franco-Polish alliance and attacking Germany's rear; (2) if Stalin fulfills the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, Poland's neutrality can prevent Russia from using Poland as a passage to aid France. However, Beck refused to provide any guarantees on this matter, and resolutely declared that Poland must reserve its right to act according to its own convenience, so that when the time comes, it can make a final decision based on its own interests.

Since Poland's attitude is as described above, Romania, which is in the same boat, can hardly allow itself to be outdone. In order to coordinate the positions of the two countries, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu visited Warsaw in early March of this year. As a result of three days of negotiations, Gafencu expressed understanding of the issue of Poland and Hungary bordering each other, and recognized that Germany's use of conquered Czechoslovakia and Nazi-ized Ruthenia as a base for encroaching on Romania was a concern that was even greater than Hungary's ambition to revise the treaty. In order to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, both sides agreed: (1) to adopt a "more active" policy towards the Balkans and the Danube region, (2) to excavate canals and expand highways to connect the Baltic Sea with the Black Sea. (According to this plan, it is proposed to connect the Vistula, Dniester, Pruth, and Danube rivers, which would have significant economic, political, and strategic significance. 3) Today, Poland and Romania no longer have reason to suspect that Soviet Russia intends to invade. On the contrary, from now on, they should adopt a more friendly attitude towards Russia politically and economically.

5. Will Hitler Not Hesitate to Start a World War?

The alliance of democratic countries was originally intended to maintain international order and eliminate war in its infancy, and was not deliberately intended to embarrass autocratic countries. Today's war and peace really only depend on the thoughts of dictators, especially Hitler. From a realistic standpoint, the choice between war and peace should be determined by the strength and weakness of his country. In recent years, Germany has actively expanded its military by mobilizing the country's manpower, financial resources, and material resources in the manner of a wartime controlled economy. Its army and air force equipment may be slightly better than those of Britain and France in some respects. Moreover, before the Munich Conference, Czechoslovakia, with its military strength, could restrain 40 divisions of the German army. Now, this large army can be used for other purposes. In terms of manpower, even if the Czech people of Bohemia and Moravia are not reliable, among the 3.5 million people in the Sudetenland, there are still 300,000 trained men available for his use. There is no doubt that its military strength has increased.

The fullness of military strength and the excellence of equipment are certainly one of the main conditions for war, but under the principle of national strength warfare, food, raw materials, and financial resources are the ultimate key to victory. This is almost universally known.

In terms of food, today's Germany is not much different from the time of the European War, and imports account for about one-fifth of the total national consumption. Since annexing Czechoslovakia, its food panic has greatly decreased because it is close to agricultural countries such as Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. However, in the aforementioned areas, Germany also controlled much of them during the European War, but due to the impact of the war, production was reduced, and it was ultimately unable to provide Germany with sufficient demand. Based on this perspective, Germany's food problem still cannot be regarded as fundamentally solved, no wonder its desire for Ukraine is becoming increasingly urgent.

In order to strengthen Hong Kong's naval strength to cope with the perilous situation in the Far East, the British authorities have specially increased the deployment of fleets to the East for joint defense. According to naval sources in Hong Kong, two newly built cruisers and destroyers have recently arrived in Hong Kong and are expected to arrive on the 21st of this month. In addition, two modern shallow-water gunboats will also come to the East. The two gunboats are named "Dragonfly" and "Grasshopper," with a displacement of 585 tons each. The ships can accommodate 74 sailors and are equipped with four-inch guns. The "Dragonfly" passed through Singapore on the 5th of this month and sailed to Hong Kong on the 6th, while the "Grasshopper" will arrive in Hong Kong on the 16th. The above-mentioned ships will join the British Far East Fleet in the future. Also, the aircraft carrier "Eagle," which left Hong Kong a month ago to participate in the war games in Singapore, was docked in Singapore for repairs and left Singapore to return to Hong Kong during the day. Hong Kong's fleet strength will be greatly strengthened. In addition, Rear Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, has been appointed to China. The British Emperor, in recognition of his hard work and meritorious service, has issued an order to promote him to Admiral and remain Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet. His Admiral flag was hoisted on the flagship "Kent" yesterday morning. Noble succeeded Admiral Little as Commander of the Far East Fleet a few years ago. He was born in 1880 and joined the Navy in 1894, at the age of only 14. From 1935 to 1937, he served as the Fourth Sea Lord and the Director of Naval Supplies. In 1929, he was honorably appointed by the British Emperor to accompany the Navy.

### The All-Circles Relief Association Launches a Full-Scale Fundraising Effort; The China Salvation Drama Troupe Schedules Regular Performances; The China Amateur Students' Association Welcomed the "China Salvation" Troupe Last Night and Presented a Banner

— Qi Zhuo

Since the China Salvation Drama Troupe began preparing to go abroad for publicity and arrived in Hong Kong, a surge of "welcome" and "celebration" has erupted. As for their plays? Because of their careful preparations, they have not yet been able to meet with us. "Perform quickly!" "Perform quickly!" Many people are sincerely anticipating this.

Over the past month, the "China Salvation" friends have been simultaneously preparing for their departure procedures and rehearsing new plays, maintaining the same spirit of tension and hard work as they did when serving on the battlefield. Their departure time is scheduled for the beginning of next month; and performances? There are already signs of progress. This is something readers will be happy to hear!

Currently, the Hong Kong Relief of Refugee Joint Committee, admiring the troupe's outstanding achievements and spiritual dramatic art in their past work in the country, has specially resolved to request the troupe to perform a large-scale charity performance for the committee before their departure, in order to expand salvation publicity and raise funds for wounded soldiers and refugees. Members have already been dispatched to obtain the troupe's consent. At the same time, the China Journalists' Association is in charge of this performance, and the Four Women's Associations, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chung Sing Charitable Society, the China Arts Association, and other organizations have been elected to form a charity performance special committee, responsible for handling the matter. Yesterday afternoon, the first meeting was held at the Journalists' Association, attended by committee members Li Jianfeng, Liu Qingjian, Jin Guomian, Lu Fu, Li Bokang, Zhuang Feixu, Yao Shangqin, Li Shaoming, and more than ten others. Mr. Jin Shan, head of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, and Mr. Lin Shu were invited to attend. After detailed discussions, the main points decided were: 1. Performance time: The 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month, for three consecutive evenings. 2. Performance repertoire: "Defend the Motherland" on the first night, "Long Live the Nation" on the second night, and "The Spring of Taierzhuang" on the third night. 3. Ticket prices: Divided into five types: 10 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 2 dollars, and 3 dollars. (4) The scripts will be submitted to the Chinese Affairs Department for review. The Salvation Drama Troupe is requested to send the scripts to the committee within three days. (5) The Relief Association will first allocate 300 Hong Kong dollars to this special committee for performance expenses. (6) Mr. Lu Guomian of the Chung Sing Charitable Society is requested to handle the exemption from entertainment tax. (7) Charity performance publicity matters: News publicity will be handled by Mr. Zhuang Feixu, and special publications, text, art, and printing publicity matters will be handled by Mr. Lu Fu.

Currently, in addition to actively rehearsing various great plays, the China Salvation Drama Troupe has also begun to produce magnificent scenery and lighting. It is believed that the significance, artistic refinement, grandeur of scenery, and wonder of lighting of this performance will break any theater troupe's performance records. What is especially worth noting is that for this performance, except for the theater rental, all scenery, equipment, and performance expenses will be borne by the troupe. It is said that the scenery alone has reached more than 2,000 dollars, which is an unprecedented and meaningful event in the Hong Kong theater world.

There is also something noteworthy to report about the troupe's activities and influence:

Last night at 10:30 PM, the China Amateur Student Association's welcome party for the China Salvation Drama Troupe was not only enthusiastic, but also quite extraordinary in its style.

After Principal Wu Hanzhen delivered a speech expressing his respect, Mr. Fang Yu Yan, the Director of Studies, said that the purpose of the China Salvation Drama Troupe is "salvation of the nation" and "national salvation," and what we learn in school is also "salvation of the nation" and "national salvation." Therefore, we must join hands, stand together, and have friendly and joyful celebrations.

Mr. Fang also solemnly said:

There are several points that the China Salvation Drama Troupe is worth learning from, to encourage all students:

(1) High enthusiasm; (2) Hard work, quick work, and practical work; (3) Common ideals, common goals, and common actions; (4) Dedication to one's career; (5) Growing in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction; (6) Taking workers, farmers, and soldiers as teachers; (7) Nation above all, nation above all.

This is a lesson in practical life education for the school. This style, this spirit, needless to say, is worthy of our admiration.

Next, Principal Wu presented a banner on behalf of all the faculty and students. Amidst enthusiastic applause, Mr. Jin accepted the banner on behalf of the troupe. The banner was made of satin with white characters, magnificent and majestic, with the inscription "Awaken High Enthusiasm, Unite to Rescue the Motherland."

The speeches of the leaders, Jin Shan and Wang Ying, were sincere in their attitude and moving in their content, making people feel very excited after listening.

Because there were many programs and not enough time, Director Lin Shu and several friends of the troupe made separate appointments to give speeches. A symposium followed, with the topic: "How to bring realistic works to the stage." This topic was aroused by the students of the school in their studies, using collectivist self-education as a method of life education. This style is very worthy of promotion, especially in Hong Kong. After the enthusiastic symposium, there was also entertainment to add to the fun. They moved each other, learned from each other, and all wanted to grow in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction!

### More Than 3,000 Unemployed Teachers from War Zones Remain in Hong Kong; Many Schools in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau Generously Agree to Lend Their Premises to Relieve Unemployed Refugee Children

In order to provide relief to unemployed teachers and staff and out-of-school refugee children who have withdrawn from the war zones, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education recently set up registration offices in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau to facilitate the registration of war zone personnel and students from all sides. It has been underway for many days now. According to the Confucius Society, there are currently more than 100 teachers from the war zones, and many are continuing to register. According to general teachers who have come to Hong Kong, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, more than 3,000 unemployed teachers have come to Hong Kong. As for the matter of borrowing school buildings from Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas Chinese schools to set up schools to teach out-of-school refugee children, it is also actively underway. Yesterday, executive members of the Out-of-School Refugee Children Relief Association discussed six methods for borrowing overseas Chinese school buildings at the new office located at No. 1 Caine Road. They immediately assigned staff to be responsible for different districts, carrying the methods to contact various schools. It is said that each school believes that relieving out-of-school refugees is the responsibility of people in the education sector, and is a good opportunity to serve the motherland, and many have automatically agreed. It is estimated that more than 30 schools, including the Overseas Chinese Middle School, De Ming Middle School, and the Affiliated Middle School of Min Da, have agreed to lend their premises. The rest are still in the process of negotiation.

### Hong Kong Manufacturers Will Invest in Macau, Pending the Decision of Detailed Measures by Macau

After the return of the Macau Investigation Group of the Chinese Manufacturers' Union, the issue of investment by manufacturers in Hong Kong in Macau has become quite a stir. Macau's conditions for industrial development, except for transportation, are quite well-prepared. Recently, there has been progress in this matter, and the extent to which it will reach has attracted much attention from the community. According to Han Suixuan, the Director-General of the Union, the Union is currently waiting for Macau to send detailed maps of the land, factory regulations, and preferential conditions, which will then be studied. Because investment is only in its initial stages, it should be thoroughly reviewed. Regarding the organization of a delegation of Macau gentry and merchants to Hong Kong for a courtesy visit, newspapers have repeatedly reported on it, but the Chinese Manufacturers' Union has not yet received any news from Macau.

### Hong Kong Education Authorities Improve the Education System, Raise the Quality of Teachers; Training Classes Will Begin in September; Monthly Educational Administration Expenses Have Gradually Increased

Hong Kong's education, due to its special circumstances, has many shortcomings and is particularly detached from the domestic education system. In recent years, Chinese and foreign educators have criticized this. The Hong Kong education authorities are also aware of this and are eager to improve it. They have considered issues such as the quality of teachers, funding, and the education system, and have formulated improvement measures. Some of these plans have already been implemented, and the rest can also be implemented in the short term. The details are recorded below.

Neglecting Vocational Education

The unsoundness of Hong Kong's education system has been pointed out by Chinese and foreign educators for many years. The most prominent shortcomings are roughly the following: (1) In English schools, there is too much emphasis on general education, and vocational education is neglected. In addition to studying at the University of Hong Kong and studying abroad, the way out for middle school graduates is government agencies and foreign firms. Few enter other professions. The reason for this is the lack of vocational training. (2) In Chinese schools, the curriculum and student level are not aligned with those of domestic schools, especially in physics and chemistry. After graduation, students who want to go to the University of Hong Kong find it difficult to be admitted due to their English proficiency. It is not easy to go to schools in China, and employment is even more uncertain. (3) The poor quality of teachers is one of the main reasons for the unsoundness of education in Hong Kong, and improving the quality of teachers must start with teacher training. In recent years, the authorities have also realized that there is a need to improve the shortcomings of education in Hong Kong, and have specially commissioned education experts to preside over the matter. The current Director of Education, Mr. Sorrell, is a well-known education expert.

Improving Teacher Training

The change in the start of the school year has already been implemented a few years ago, so that it aligns with the schools in China. Currently, schools in Hong Kong have changed from starting in the spring to starting in the fall. Secondly, the biggest measure of the education authorities is to improve the quality of teachers. The teacher training school run by the Education Department is scheduled to open in September. The location has been selected as the old National Academy, which is currently being renovated. Classes will be taught in Chinese and English, with a training period of one year. After graduation, they will be assigned to teach in various public and private schools.

Increasing Education Funding

As for the original Chinese Women's Normal School of the Education Department, most of its graduates have already served in the education sector. In order to reward each school for employing graduates of the school, the education authorities have specially stipulated the grading of school subsidies, which is determined by the number of graduates of the school employed. Those who employ four or more people are first-class subsidized schools, those who employ three people are second-class subsidized schools, those who employ two people are third-class subsidized schools, and those who employ one person are fourth-class subsidized schools. Because the Education Department has been carrying out various educational improvement works in recent years, the funding has greatly increased. The monthly expenditure has exceeded 100,000 dollars, and last month it reached 438,306 dollars.

### The Printing Industry Chamber of Commerce Will Be Established Today; A General Meeting Will Be Held at the Confucius Hall

The Hong Kong Printing Industry Chamber of Commerce, which has been in preparation for a long time under the guidance of the Labor Department, has been scheduled to hold its inauguration ceremony at the Confucius Hall on Caroline Hill at 3:00 PM today. It is said that the association has more than 100 printing shops in Hong Kong and Kowloon, which accounts for the majority of printing shops in Hong Kong. The association is scheduled to hold an election meeting at the Confucius Hall at 11:00 AM today to elect the first executive committee members. The inauguration ceremony will be held at the same address at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, presided over by Mr. Yip Lan-chuen, a Hong Kong gentleman.

### Four Thieves Robbed a House in Lion Rock Road, Kowloon City, in Broad Daylight; Claimed to be Renting a Room to Commit the Crime; One Suspect Was Arrested; The Victim Lost Gold and Silver Jewelry Worth More Than One Thousand Dollars

Yesterday morning, a household in Lion Rock Road, Kowloon City, was robbed by four thieves who claimed to be renting a room, barging in during broad daylight. As a result, they stole more than one thousand dollars. Afterwards, one suspect was arrested. The case occurred on the fourth floor of No. 37 Lion Rock Road, Kowloon City. The victim was a refugee woman named Wu Mei (22 years old), who had just moved into the house on the 6th of this month. At 11:20 AM yesterday morning, she was sitting idle at home after lunch when suddenly four thieves, two of whom were wearing suits, barged in with knives, claiming to be renting a room. After entering the house, they immediately threatened Wu with knives, forcing her to hand over the key to the safe. Seeing that the thieves were fierce as tigers, Wu did not dare to refuse, so she handed over the key to the thieves. The thieves tied up everyone and searched the house, eventually stealing 490 Hong Kong dollars, 400 provincial currency dollars, eight gold rings, two gold necklaces, and three gold earrings, totaling 410 dollars worth of gold items. After the thieves succeeded, they fled. Not long after the thieves left, a resident of No. 35 heard a loud alarm and chased after the thieves. When the four thieves ran to Hau Wong Road, a Chinese constable happened to be passing by and arrested one suspect. Suspecting that he was related to the case, he took him back to the police station to file a case.

### The Enemy Near Shun De is Restless, Attempting to Threaten Zhongshan; Defend Jiangmen to the Death; Zhang Fa-kui Dispatches Personnel to Inspect Zhongshan's Defenses, Strengthening Our Team is on High Alert; If They Invade, We Will Strike Them Hard

[Zhongshan Quick News] Enemy warships frequently come and go in the waters of Zhongshan. County Magistrate Zhang is making every effort to complete war preparations and mobilize the masses to resist the enemy, with considerable success. Zhang Fa-kui, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, has a comprehensive plan for the defense of Zhongshan. Provincial Government Member Wu Fei was also ordered to supervise the anti-Japanese guerrillas in Zhongshan. Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang also dispatched Senior Staff Officer Zhuo An to inspect Zhongshan's wartime measures, strengthening the area. Staff Officer Zhuo arrived in Shi Qi on the 7th via Macau and immediately summoned Zhang Hui, Yuan Dai, and others to discuss military strategies in detail. He also went to various places to inspect the war situation. He returned north after a week to report. It is now found that the number of enemy troops on the border between Zhongshun and Zhongxin has been increasing in recent days, seemingly intending to harass Zhongshan. The details are recorded below:

Enemy Harassment on the Shun De Border

After capturing Hui Cheng and Jiangmen, the enemy intends to consolidate the outer lines of Jiangmen and Hui Cheng. They have increased by eight enemy shallow-water warships and more than ten rubber boats, which are docked in the Beitou Street area of Jiangmen, attempting to launch surprise attacks on our team at any time. In recent days, the number of enemy soldiers in the area of ​​He Tang and Cang Yuan outside of the new Zhongbian border has increased by more than 200. On the 5th and 6th of this month, the enemy artillery in Wai Hai bombarded our Haizhou Ancient Town positions more than ten times, without any response from our team. At the same time, the enemy forces in Ronggui on the border of Shun De have also increased slightly, with several enemy boats patrolling in Dahuangpu, not daring to invade. Our team is on alert, and we will strike them hard if they invade.

No Major Increases or Decreases in Zhongshan Enemy Warships

There have been no major increases or decreases in enemy warships along the coast of Zhongshan this week. There are three enemy warships off the coast of Gao Lan. Near Sanzao Island, there are two enemy cruisers and one destroyer off the coast between Daganmen and Huangzhou, with no abnormalities. Enemy warships are often seen in the waters of Jiuzhou, and their movements are mysterious. The enemy on Jiuzhou Mountain has not yet withdrawn. Two enemy armed fishing boats docked off the coast of Xiazaizi sailed towards Lingdingyang on the evening of the 7th, but returned on the morning of the 8th and are still patrolling near Fox Hill. There are no enemy troops in Tangjiawan Bay. On the 6th and 7th, more than ten enemy motorized boats were found in the waters of Dahuangpu, transporting grain and military supplies to Ronggui. They were attacked by our team along the way. The enemy motorboats also opened fire with machine guns at our distance and fled in a panic.

Jiujiang Enemy Warships Threaten Gaohe

In addition, enemy troops have been lying dormant on the north and south banks of the lower reaches of the West River in recent days. Our military teams took the opportunity to attack Sanshui, Hekou, Ganggen, Makou, Guanyao, and Fengyong, where the enemy was caught off guard. According to intelligence obtained here on the 7th in Heshan, two enemy shallow-water warships, seven transport vessels, twelve steamships, and more than thirty rubber boats are still docked in the waters of Jiujiangxi Hai. On the morning of the 7th, enemy warships traveled back and forth along the Taiping River and Qingshakou, patrolling and chasing, and occasionally firing cannons and guns at the opposite bank, which seemed to be a drill, attempting to intimidate our Gao (Ming) He (Shan) defenders. According to military information, after the enemy warships conducted drills on the Jiujiang River, a batch of them passed through Zhoujun on the evening of the 7th and sailed towards the Dahuangpu River off Ying Gezui. It is said that this batch of enemy warships was exercising down the West River from Hekou.

### Indiscriminate Harassment, Enemy Aircraft Still Bomb Shantou, Many Houses Destroyed, Few Civilian Casualties, Authorities Intensify Evacuation of Residents Remaining in the City

(Shantou Special Dispatch) Enemy aircraft attacked Shantou again on the 6th, with many stray bullets. Fortunately, the city residents had already fled, so the casualties were less than in the previous two days. As of the morning of the 7th, it was reported that two enemy aircraft carriers and two patrol and destroyer vessels were still hovering between the Linghai Mountains, so before dawn, mountains everywhere were crowded with people. The military and anti-aircraft units were on high alert. Foreign consulates also notified the employees of foreign firms to temporarily suspend business. The actual situation of the enemy aircraft bombing Shantou on the 6th of this month is recorded below. At 8:15 AM, eight enemy aircraft took off from enemy warships and aircraft carriers overseas. After entering the scarf area, they immediately dropped bombs on Qi Lu and Hua Wu. Three bombs landed on the old East District Pacification Commissioner's Office in Conglong, destroying the entire building. Several nearby houses were damaged. Several bombs landed on the cemetery next to Municipal No. 1 Middle School, slightly shaking the school building. Fortunately, the school had already moved inland, and there were no casualties. A bomb also landed in front of the Huang Family Ancestral Hall at Huajiadutou, destroying more than ten houses and injuring one person. At 9:00 AM, they fled overseas. At 9:30 AM, the batch of enemy aircraft attacked again, and after passing through Mazu Island towards the city, followed the Chaoshan Railway to Chaoan, dropping bombs madly in Chaoan City. Nineteen bombs landed on the electric light bureau, the railway station, and the agricultural and forestry farm nursery, destroying more than ten houses and killing several civilians. After wreaking havoc, they attacked Jieyang, dropping eight bombs on the Quxi Sugar Factory. The losses are still being investigated. At 10:30 AM, they returned to the city from Jieyang, dropping three bombs on Yongxiang Street and four bombs on Tongjin Street, all landing in the sea without any casualties. Then, they strafed the city with machine guns before leaving past Mazu Island and going out to sea. At 3:40 PM, they attacked for the third time, dropping 20 bombs on the area around Wuqiao and Hanti Road. The Wuqiao Tonghua Canned Food Factory was completely destroyed. The Chaoan line was also affected, and several civilian houses were destroyed. More than ten shops and collapsed grounds on the bridge along the Han River tributary were also affected. The Mainland Factory was also in ruins. Yongantang and Xinghua Newspaper on Hanti Road were damaged by the tremors. At about 5:00 PM, when the bombs were exhausted, they swept towards Chaoyang Jitou with guns. The Lihua Fuchun electric ship was also attacked and lasted for about half an hour. It is estimated that although many bombs were dropped that day, because the citizens had already fled, there were only three deaths and seven injuries. After the enemy's tragic bombing, people moved to the inland, and the population has been reduced by more than half. There are about 60,000 to 70,000 citizens left in the city. Many people take refuge at the foot of the mountains every day. The authorities are stepping up the evacuation, and young women are also ordered to move inland. Prostitutes must leave the city within five days, otherwise they will be assigned to the war work team. In recent days, boats and cars have been closing the gate and sailing at night, and passengers are crowded. On the 5th, a Guangzhou ship coming from Jie collided with a wooden cargo ship in Hong Kong, causing a tragic accident, killing and injuring more than 20 people.

If the five organizations cannot fully concentrate due to environmental concerns, they must also send personnel to set up offices in Shaoguan so that the Provincial Party Department can guide their work. It is hoped that major organizations such as the Provincial Federation of Journalists and the Provincial Federation of Commerce will move to Shao first.

### Guangdong Relief Association Allocates Relief Funds to Various Counties, Reaching More Than 300,000 Dollars

(Qujiang Quick News) Since the enemy invasion, most counties have been ravaged.

### Social Service Work in Guangdong

Yu Senwen, the secretary-general of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, in the first section of Chapter 3 of his work report on the Guangdong Provincial Social Service Office, "Reflections on Managing the Guangdong Provincial Capital Service Office," stated, "Since the success of the Northern Expedition by our Party, the unification of China, and the assumption of power, under the leadership of the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the foundation of the nation has become increasingly solid, and national policies have been renewed daily. Various undertakings have shown tremendous progress and vitality. However, local Party headquarters have often failed to exert their utmost efforts in promoting social endeavors, and local Party members have not fully participated in serving the masses. This not only fails to fulfill the responsibility of leading, awakening, and helping the people, but also risks separating the Party from the masses. Recognizing this, the central government has firmly ordered Party headquarters at all levels to promote social service undertakings and establish social service offices. Since the establishment of the Social Service Office in this province, we have deeply felt that it is indeed sufficient to attract the broad masses and gain their sympathy. If it can be popularized throughout the country and widely promoted, then the Party's principles and platform will surely penetrate the masses, gaining their understanding, belief, and support. Moreover, as we are in the second phase of the War of Resistance, our Party, as the ruling party leading the national resistance and nation-building, must devote all our efforts to this social service undertaking that garners the most sympathy from the people." This demonstrates the significance and importance of the central government's order to promote social service undertakings.

The Social Service Office of Guangdong Province was established in Qujiang on February 15th of this year. In the two months or so since then, the projects that have been carried out include: (1) Establishing a personal consultation office, with content divided into (A) handling guidance for further education and employment, (B) handling tourist guidance, (C) handling public document drafting, (D) handling legal and medical inquiries; (2) Establishing a job placement agency, with content including (A) registering unemployed individuals, (B) accepting commissions to find talent, (C) introducing unemployed individuals to employment; (3) Holding public education classes, with content including (A) children's remedial classes, (B) women's remedial classes, (C) women's lecture classes, (D) children's choir, (E) women's choir; (4) Establishing a tourist communication registration office; (5) Establishing public lectures; (6) Establishing a passenger guidance office at the Shaoguan Station of the Yuehan Railway; (7) Establishing a public newspaper reading area; (8) Holding a spring smallpox vaccination campaign; (9) Organizing a confectionery labor corps.

The projects that are in preparation include: (1) preparing to set up a bookstore; (2) preparing to set up a public hostel; (3) preparing to set up a public clinic; (4) preparing to set up a refugee vocational training center; (5) a consumer cooperative; (6) an emergency rescue team. These are all urgent tasks that need to be completed quickly, especially in Qujiang. The newly established headquarters, lacking fundamental resources, needs material support, such as solving the difficulties of food and lodging, the lack of spiritual food, the shortage of daily necessities, and the rudimentary medical treatment. All of these require immediate remedies.

Movies and Drama

### Premiere Performance by the Central Photography Studio: National Defense Drama "Battle" Written by Zhang Min, Directed and Starring Zhao Dan, with Bai Yang and Gu Eryi

[Chongqing Communication] Since the unprecedented War of Resistance against Japan in Chinese history, Shanghai, which has always been a hub for film and drama, has seen many people immediately leave this place and head to the interior. In the past twenty-two months, these drama workers have gone deep into the war zones and villages, using drama as a bridge to connect the generally sluggish rural areas and the common people with the War of Resistance.

I remember that Jin Shan once wrote a wartime drama communication, in which he mentioned that there was a local gentry who owned many guns and armed farmers. He did not express his opinion on this war of resistance. So, when they performed a drama (a drama that aroused the passion for national salvation), they invited this gentleman to watch it. After watching the drama, the gentleman stood up very moved and firmly stated that he would definitely do his best to fight the invaders. This small example shows how great the mission of national salvation drama is.

This group of film and drama workers, except for Wang Xianzhai, Jia Jiachen, Sun Min, Tang Jie, Xu Xinyuan, and others who have returned to Shanghai, the rest, such as Lan Ping, Li Lin, and Zuo Ming, are all in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, engaged in drama work. Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, and Ouyang Yuqian are staying in Hong Kong to continue making films.

General Shanghai directors, such as Ying Yunwei, Shi Dongshan, and Hong Shen, are neighbors in Chongqing. Many famous Shanghai actors have joined the Central Photography Studio. This Central Photography Studio, centered on Shanghai directors and actors, has produced many war of resistance newsreels and films on the theme of war of resistance in one year.

Recently, all the staff of the Central Photography Studio have prepared another large-scale public performance. The lineup of performers is rare in inland performances, and most of them are acquaintances from Shanghai.

The drama performed this time is a five-act national defense drama called "Battle." The playwright is Zhang Min, who used to direct "Romeo and Juliet" and "The Thunderstorm" for the amateur experimental theater. The director in charge is Zhao Dan, a well-known young actor in Shanghai. The "stage manager" is Gu Eryi, who became famous as the county magistrate in "Carnival Night," and Zhu Jinming, who is best at "amateur" lighting.

As for the actors, there are even more familiar actors, such as Bai Yang, Lu Chao, Wei Heling, Gu Eryi, Xian Qianli, etc., and all the actors of the Central Photography Studio. The theater for the public performance is the Cathay Grand Theater. Although we have not seen this performance, we can definitely imagine the enthusiasm and success of the public performance.

### Representative Works of Hollywood Movie Stars (Continued)

Marlene Dietrich: Josef von Sternberg's "Desire" and Mammoulian's "The Song of Songs" are both worth cherishing repeatedly. In terms of emotion, "The Song of Songs" is superior to "Desire" by far.

Loretta Young: Loretta Young has several color costume films, but none of them are as good as her comedies. Among Loretta's comedies, "The Farmer's Daughter" is the most outstanding.

Claudette Colbert: Undoubtedly, "Cleopatra" is Claudette's crowning achievement.

Katharine Hepburn: "Little Women" and "Quality Street" are most suitable for Katharine Hepburn's personality. In terms of comparative achievement, the latter seems to be more moving than the former.

Myrna Loy: Myrna Loy's "The Thin Man" and "Manhattan Melodrama" both have wonderful performances.

Sylvia Sidney: Movie fans all know that "Madame Butterfly" is Sylvia Sidney's immortal work, but "Fury" is also not weak.

Alice Faye: In terms of segments, Alice Faye has an extremely outstanding performance in "Alexander's Ragtime Band." Among the starring works, "Lillian Russell" should be recommended.

Sonja Henie: Sonja's skating art is most praised in "One in a Million."

Merle Oberon: In America, she starred in "The Cowboy and the Lady" and "These Three," and in England, she starred in "The Scarlet Pimpernel."

Ginger Rogers: For dance films, "Shall We Dance" is the first choice, and for acting films, "Kitty Foyle" is recommended.

### Husband, Wife, Friend (6)

Miss Carver then said, "Then why don't you come to my apartment on Doster Street to see me?"

Leona hesitated for a moment and said, "Okay, I'll come right away."

After a few words of idle talk, Miss Carver told him the truth, although Torrance's singing voice was good, it wasn't anything great. The applause from the audience at the afternoon concert was just friends deliberately cheering her on.

Carver later said, "There is some difference in class between the two of you. She condescended to you. Actually, she is a social woman. Now she is going to take music as her career. This makes you very frightened. You don't want her to be like that, do you?"

Leonar wanted to shake his head bitterly.

"But she just won't let go," she said, looking at her watch and standing up. "I'm going to prepare for my own concert--I'm going to sing at the American Volunteer Army Conference tonight." As she shook Leonar's hand, she approached him and raised her head to look at his face. This powerful suggestion was very obvious.

'Can I kiss her?' Leonar thought to himself. "She is so lovely," at this moment, the bell rang suddenly.

A little promoter came in with a letter. When Miss Carver read it, she looked displeased. "Alas, they specifically want me to sing a military song tonight. I can't remember the words in the song. Now I have no way of knowing--a friend has left the city. This song is sung by their navy--about a destroyer."

Leona said, "Ah, that's the song!"

"Do you know it?" Miss Carver asked with excitement.

"Of course, I was a sailor in the Great War."

Miss Carver walked to the piano and played a note. Leona sang along, "Let me sing it to you." So he started to sing. But he stopped after not even singing a line. "Wait, I can't sing it like this, I can only sing it hiding in the bathroom. Where is the bathroom?" Carver pointed it out to him, watching him curiously. But he walked in. She followed to the door. He took a deep breath and started singing loudly.

Before he could finish a line, a cup on the washbasin shelf fell and shattered. He stopped singing and apologized anxiously, "Alas, I'm really sorry! I always have this kind of thing happen." As he said this, he picked up the fragments from the ground.

Miss Carver asked, "You said this has happened before?"

"It's happened twice."

She seemed to be dreaming as she walked to the piano and played a note, saying, "Sing, sing loudly."

"Okay, but if the mirror falls down too, don't blame me." So he started singing again. (To be continued)

### Grass Court Tennis Singles Final Xu Weipei Wins the Championship Defeats Younger Brother Weipei Three to Two Little Xu Performs Very Well But Ultimately Loses Due to Inferior Skill

…The All-Hong Kong Open Grass Court Tennis Singles Final was held yesterday afternoon at 4:45 at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. It was a competition between the Xu brothers, so whoever won or lost didn't seem to matter much. In short, the brothers monopolized the top two spots.

…During the battle, Little Xu worked very hard, refusing to be careless, and boldly attacked his brother's weaknesses, with the ambition to win the championship. The general audience was surprised and only then realized that the outcome of the Xu brothers' match was not predetermined.

…Among the guests were Governor of Hong Kong Sir Geoffrey Northcote, Deputy Judge John Lothian McDougal, Chinese representative Lo Man-Kam, and Chow Shou-son, which invisibly increased the competitors' enthusiasm.

…In the course of this competition, Xu Weipei encountered strong opponents one after another and faced many difficulties. Only because of his superior skills did he defeat the Lin brothers and reach the final. His personal technique is indeed very strong.

Xu Runpei encountered mostly unknown players in another group of competitions, so his highest level was not performed. It was not until yesterday that he tried his best to show it, with forehand, backhand, and net skills all in place. At the same time, he used dangerous angles to deal with his brother, winning the first set. The second and third sets were caught up by his elder brother, losing one to two instead.

In the fourth set, Da Xu wasted a lot of opportunities, hitting the ball over the net, and committing many double faults, resulting in two to two, three to three, and four to four, three draws. Afterwards, Little Xu's net performance was poor, and one smash and one kill often hit the vital points, winning another set with six to four, resulting in a tie of two to two.

In the final decisive fifth set, Da Xu worked harder and completed it in one go, taking the lead with an absolute advantage of five to one. However, Little Xu fought bravely and chased to four to five. At this time, the situation became tense again. Da Xu had to be careful and fought several times with fierce smashes at the net, achieving his goals and finally winning with six to four. The overall result was three to two, and he won the championship for two consecutive years.

Looking at the two's tennis skills, Da Xu is better and has better experience. He only performed seven-tenths of his full strength in this match, so good angles with the sideline and baseline were rarely seen. Net play was also only tried once or twice.

[Haitong News Agency, Sha Ba Dian, 8th] Yesterday, the Polish players defeated the Dutch players. After Poland won two consecutive singles, they won by four to one, entering the second week of the competition and meeting Germany. The results are as follows:

[Haitong News Agency, Chai Ge Dang Bo Dian, 8th] Yesterday, South players Medk and Pansik won straight sets over the Irish players Nanchen and Yizhen, so South won with a score of three-zero, and entered the second week of the competition.

[Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 8th] After a fierce battle yesterday, Hungary narrowly defeated Romania by three to two. After the Saturday and Sunday battles, Hungary led by two to one. In yesterday's singles, Hungarian player Gaboldi lost to Romanian player Galaru by six to three, six to eight, four to six, and two to six, but Yasbo (Hungary) fought hard in five sets, defeating Smith (Romania) with one to six, six to two, six to three, six to eight, and six to two, and Hungary was able to enter the second week to battle Yugoslavia.

The biggest drawback of the two Xus is serving "double faults". Da Xu had a total of nine times and Little Xu had a total of eight times. If they encounter equally matched opponents, they will lose points because of it, which is very important. At the same time, the serves of the two Xus are also very loose. It is not easy to restrain strong players, and it cannot assist net play. Please pay attention to this. The results are listed below:

Xu Dengpei

Three to six

Six to two

Seven to five

Four to three

Six to four

### Public Basketball Game: Star Island Defeats South China, Championship Seemingly in the Bag; Minor Error Occurs During Game, South China Will Appeal; Eastern Strength Crushes Chung Sing, Then Voluntarily Withdraws

(Our Special Correspondent) Last night, two very important Senior Group basketball games were held in the YMCA gymnasium. One was Peninsula versus South China, and the other was Chung Sing versus Eastern. These four strong teams coincidentally competed on the same evening, which was particularly noteworthy. Even with higher ticket prices, the venue was packed.

The Group B game started at 6:30 PM, with Wah Hung facing Chung Sing. Because their strengths were closely matched, the game was quite exciting. However, Wah Hung had more offensive opportunities and ultimately won 34-30.

The next game was the most crucial one concerning the championship. Most of the spectators showed sympathy towards South China, hoping for their victory. However, South China was defeated by Star Island with a narrow score of 29-31, by just one point. With this victory, Star Island sees the championship as practically guaranteed.

During the competition, both sides emphasized teamwork and cleverly utilized their skills to score points, resulting in a very balanced game. The score often fluctuated, with the difference between the two sides rarely exceeding one to three points, which illustrates the tension of the game.

Each side, upon gaining possession of the ball, seized the opportunity to advance and score. The only important condition of this strategy was gaining possession. Having the ball meant having a way out, so direct physical contact was rarely seen. Collisions were only necessary when fighting for the ball under the basket, to see who would win that crucial move.

Throughout the entire game, South China had slightly more opportunities to shoot than Star Island, but their angled shots from the left and right often missed the mark. They also had more free throw opportunities, but many of these were also missed. If their free throws had been more accurate, victory might not have been snatched away by Star Island. In my opinion, South China's defeat was not due to inferior technique, but primarily due to the squandering of free throw opportunities. Furthermore, the abnormal performance of Shek Chun-chi (石振智) was also a reason for their failure.

South China's players also lost many jump balls to Star Island. Another point was the lack of effective rebounding. Whenever their offensive shots hit the backboard, there were rarely any of their own players advancing to the basket to seize the opportunity. Consequently, when the ball bounced off, it was often snatched by Star Island's defenders. Conversely, Star Island did not have this problem, so their battles under the basket were often fruitful.

Star Island's performance was not as brilliant as when they played against Eastern. This was due to South China's excellent strategies, which effectively controlled their opponents. However, although South China managed to control the game, they still missed critical opportunities and suffered defeat, which is truly regrettable.

During the game, there was an incident where Star Island scored a basket, but before the shot was taken, the scorer's table suddenly blew the whistle. However, the referee did not follow by blowing the whistle to stop the game, and Star Island managed to score during this time. As it happened, Star Island won by only one point, with a score of 31-29. Consequently, South China raised questions after the game, arguing that the referee's failure to blow the whistle to stop the game at the time was improper, and they have announced their intention to appeal. So, what will happen next? Let's wait for the next installment.

In the final game, Eastern faced Chung Sing. Insiders believed that there would be a fierce battle, but Chung Sing's players performed poorly, resulting in a one-sided game. Chan Yu-chi (陳汝止) tried hard to fight back, but he was marked tightly by Eastern's Chan So-ki (陳索祺) and could not perform to his full potential. Kwok Chik-hung (郭植鴻) also failed to live up to expectations.

Eastern had Wong Ting-fan (黃鼎芬) and Sun Bo-hing (孫寶慶) off the court, but Fung Nim-wah (馮念華), Tsui Hang (徐亨), and Law Kat-on (羅吉安) and others performed exceptionally well, often charging into the opponents’ basket, which Chung Sing could not resist. Their teamwork was also well-coordinated. Consequently, Eastern was leading 36-16 by halftime.

In the second half, Chung Sing showed more spirit, with a momentum of overwhelming force. They launched a series of aggressive attacks and regained many points, rising rapidly. Eastern also retaliated with several scores during counter-attacks, leading to a fierce and tragic battle. During a scramble for the ball, Wan Fan (桓芬) and Shui Hing (瑞慶) collided with each other. As a result, Wan Fan's head was injured and bleeding, while Shui Hing lost consciousness for a while before recovering. Later, with five minutes remaining before the end of the game, Eastern was still leading 53-42, but Eastern suddenly declared their withdrawal to the referee, allowing Chung Sing to win. The scores of the Star Island versus South China game are listed below: (Tai Sui)

### Hong Kong Soccer Team Returns in Defeat, Expected to Arrive This Morning

— (Our Special Correspondent)

The Hong Kong interport soccer team departed for the Philippines on the 28th of last month with great fanfare. We all believed that this strong force would surely bring good news, and that they would have a successful trip, which seemed like a foregone conclusion. Furthermore, considering that the Philippine team was defeated three times in three matches when they came to Hong Kong in early spring, and that their technical level was lower than that of Hong Kong, which was evident to everyone, we believed that the Hong Kong team's trip to the Philippines would not be a problem for victory.

Who would have thought that the Hong Kong team's expedition would be unfavorable, suffering unexpected defeats one after another? In the first match, the official game against the Philippine interport team, and in the second match, the exhibition game against La Salle University, they both lost 1-3. The reasons for the defeats have been described in previous reports, related to timing, location, and personnel, which is the disadvantage of being the visiting team. Fortunately, they defeated the YCO team 4-1 in the third match, preventing a complete whitewash and regaining some honor.

The Hong Kong team left the Philippines yesterday and is returning north on the Tai Ping steamer. It is estimated that they will arrive at around 10:30 AM today. The Football Association will send a small team to welcome them.

Hong Kong soccer has long been dominant in the Far East, but in recent years, teams in Southeast Asia have made significant progress, almost surpassing Hong Kong. Therefore, Hong Kong's soccer community should not be overconfident. If they want to maintain their superior position, they must make even greater efforts in the future. (Tai Sui)

### School Volleyball: Yesterday Senior Pui Ying Defeats King's College; Today Each Grade Has Three Matches

The school volleyball competition, organized by the Volleyball Association, featured a match between Senior Pui Ying and King's College at 4:30 PM yesterday. Both sides showed great intensity, with King's College initially displaying strong momentum and putting immense pressure on Pui Ying. However, Pui Ying rallied and launched a counter-offensive. King's College's stamina waned, and their formation showed repeated weaknesses. Coupled with frequent misunderstandings in their middle and back rows, Pui Ying capitalized on their aggressive attacks and won 3-2, with scores of 14-21, 21-13, 18-21, 21-16, 21-13.

In the Junior Grade match between Tak Ming and Wah Yan, Wah Yan displayed strong fighting spirit and defeated Tak Ming 2-0, with scores of 21-10 in the first set, 21-11 in the second set, and 21-8 in the third set.

In the Minor Grade match between Farmar and Paul, both sides played fiercely. Farmar was stronger than Paul and won 3-1, with scores of 23-21 in the first set, 19-21 in the second set, 21-19 in the third set, and 21-19 in the fourth set.

### Thoughts on May

-- Qiu Xian

Pomegranate flowers are in bloom, it's May.

May, bloody May, a May of many hardships, deeply engraving a [symbol obscured] mark on us, sowing the seeds of struggle in our hearts!

May 3rd, May 4th, May 7th, May 9th, May 30th.

[Text obscured]! [Text obscured]!

[Text obscured], [Text obscured] humiliation

Year after year, we lived like animals, letting pain and hatred gnaw at our souls, until this day, when it erupted like a volcano.

For survival, for freedom, and even more for the justice of humanity, we stood up firmly, raised our fists of resistance, and answered blows with blows! Who said I was a docile lamb, who said the 'sleeping lion' would not rise up and roar!

The raging wind stirred up the roar of the wilderness, and the whole world shook. China was struggling.

Now it is May again, and fierce battles are unfolding across China. Countless fields and homes have been destroyed by artillery fire, and countless compatriots have died, displaced by the shelling. However, no one complained, no one was discouraged! Everyone, with wounded spirits, stood on the front lines of the war of resistance for the sake of the motherland.

Yes, for the sake of the motherland, we no longer hesitate or waver; although the flowers of freedom are beautiful,

May is no longer a month of humiliation, [text obscured], a May of battle, a glorious May!

As the month of battle arrives, let us sing aloud!

"[Text obscured], [text obscured], [text obscured]!"

### Mountain Flowers

-- Ding Di

In the deep valley, many unnamed wildflowers bloom, red, the passionate color; radiating the light of life.

The valley, deep, secluded, desolate, rarely visited by people.

It is locked in a long period of time, peaceful, undisturbed. The sound of the tournament gongs, the leisure of the frog's croaking, the evening heat under the bean trellis, the call of hoeing, the cattle and sheep in the poor alleys, the New Year's drums; as such, the flowering months and years pass, the wildflowers in the valley, watching us, silently, record them for us.

Flowers bloom and wither again, flowing through the years of spring and autumn in the valley. The mountain flowers are joyful.

Breaking through the quiet atmosphere, unaware of the years of the wilderness dream. A great upheaval occurs between man and beast. To resist the invasion of the beasts, man fights with the beasts. For this struggle, many warriors shed their bright red blood, damaging their limbs, or sacrificing their entire lives. The blood of the warriors flowed down, and the mountain flowers were dyed red.

The white bones and green phosphorescence are buried in the ground, the sounds of horse-riding at dusk. The wind and clouds of the desert, the ancient fortresses, when the fragrant grasses grow, you can't find any basis for missing them. But we can pick up one or two red mountain flowers in the valley, on the battlefield, at will. The equality of life, the light throwing of heads, allows you to understand the immortality of the stars, the longevity of the sun and moon. The soul comes to the maple forest green, the soul returns to the mountains black, the spark of life, does not disappear, nor does it blur. Unfolding the laughter of freedom, warming this merciless valley, so that we never forget that blood has flowed on this earth: passionate red, heroic red, brilliant red, giving us courage, comfort, encouragement, and impetus.

The stench fills the valley. Life is suffocating.

Only the mountain flowers, still standing upright in the ugly valley, in the dense thickets of thorns.

The wind is very foul, indicating the rampant nature of the beasts. The warriors shed their blood, cleverly mixing it into a kind of irrigation, cultivating the flowers of freedom, and dyeing them red.

In the struggle between man and beast, many warriors love to plant their flowers, scattering new seeds, year after year, the mountains bloom in clusters, not only in the valley, but also down to the low plains and lowlands. The dawn and the morning breeze, blowing open the stench and decay of heaven and earth. Each flower unfolds the wings of freedom.

There is no more stench. Revealing the freshness of the mountain flowers, a clear light and auspicious air in the universe.

Thousands upon thousands of years of vicissitudes have been exchanged for the spring breeze of flowers, a spring rain came to the small building overnight, and tomorrow I will hear the sound of apricot flowers being sold, and maybe the sea will dry up, and the rocks will rot, but the mountain flowers will still remain: not withered, not yellow, and not decayed. It is not a fluke accident. You say, this mountain flower, no, you should say the soul of the warrior, the enlightener of freedom, this is not like those ordinary flowers!

The remaining dogs and sheep are finished. Giving us the enjoyment of happiness, wherever there are mountain flowers, freedom has germinated.

Freedom has germinated, which is truly a blessing for us, but we must not forget the hard-working and haggard gardeners!

We should thank them for the cultivation of blood!

### Criminal Morbidity of the Japanese Economy

-- Yuan

Collapse is the result of disease. When the disease is in the internal organs, it is invisible to the eyes of ordinary people. However, as the disease deepens, the morbidity gradually manifests. We expected that Japan's main purpose, the war against China, would be a 'quick victory'. If it lasts for a long time, there will be the disaster of economic collapse. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, it has been nearly two years. What is the state of the Japanese economy? According to Japanese newspaper reports, the Minister of Finance said that of the 8.1 billion public bonds recently raised, only 5 billion can be offset by taxes, and the rest must be used by the Japanese people's savings. That savings is the national blood. Taking the national blood and turning it into glory bombs is the last resort, and economic collapse is not far away.

Furthermore, it has been a year since Japan implemented economic control regulations. Their people's understanding is not deep, so the number of violations is increasing. According to the investigation by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of its Ministry of Justice, from June of last year to February of this year, there were 13,581 violators nationwide. Among those prosecuted, there were 579 in Tokyo and 510 in Osaka. In addition, there are 3,150 people. Recently, the number of repeat offenders has been gradually increasing. The authorities of the Ministry of Justice believe that this is due to the previous lenient attitude and that the method should be changed, and that strict training should be adopted for violators. A few days ago, Matsumoto, the director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau, issued instructions to the national prosecutor's offices, saying that when dealing with such cases in the future, they should consider the circumstances of the case and impose physical punishment and fines, but with fines as the main punishment. Any law, if too many people violate it, its effectiveness will be equal to zero. When will the Japanese economy collapse? Judging from the above situation, I am afraid it is not far away!

Moreover, the Japanese in China take advantage of their power to make national disaster fortunes, which is not uncommon. Some use the military's passports to transport goods, or collude with unscrupulous merchants to engage in unclear and ambiguous businesses. These degenerate phenomena were not seen or heard in Japan before. Now this kind of fact is not only heard but also seen. The degeneration of the Japanese national character and the collapse of the country's social public economy can be seen from the morbidity of this national character.

### Spirit and Matter

— Chì Qiáng

From a long time ago, the West talked about matter, while China in the East talked about spirit.

After the Reform Movement of 1898 failed, the Westernization movement rose, and the court and common people alike clamored for "foreign affairs, foreign affairs." The clamor filled the ears. Although the Reformist and Conservative factions each had their own reasons, the abandonment of spirit in favor of matter was, to some extent, an odd trend.

History always possesses the conditions of cause and effect. An event cannot be extracted one-sidedly to provide a simple answer; it's as difficult as trying to cut water with a knife.

For decades, the winds and rains of Europe and America have influenced the Chinese, who now wear long robes with Western trousers...

Forget it! You come!

A fearsome face of a Fascist dictator, a cannon, a row of machine guns - what is revealed is still not poisonous enough! Killing without batting an eye, of course, with airplanes and bombs above, and armored vehicles and tanks below. Matter, matter! Killing requires tightening one's own trouser belt. A slice of bread is approved by the central government, and orders are issued that you can't take an extra bite. White bread (塌) shouldn't even be thought of, distribution is revised several times, but the result is still just a waste of paper.

China has its own history, which is good in itself. However, the disastrous Qing dynasty suppressed morale horizontally and vertically, devising all sorts of methods to crush it. This left the whole country lifeless, believing that the emperor's eternal cause was finally settled. However, the imperial guards were useless, and the magic of the Boxers remained above the Ninth Heaven, unwilling to descend for a time. Thus, they opened the door to welcome reform and invited Mr. Matter to help. After matter caused a disturbance, the spirit became even more troubled, right up to the present. The spirit is unmoored, fishing up some superficial material, so that "the human body becomes a dead thing," and "scholars lose their lives in many ways, and the great path is lost like a stray sheep in a branching road."

Now, old debts are completely written off, and military service newly awakens the spirit! The great sword can be held upside down and handed over to others, but Mauser guns are also unreliable, because they can be used to fight the enemy but also to protect them. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen, when discussing the use of weapons, believed that it all depended on the human spirit, and once said, "Comparing the two, the power of spirit is nine, and the power of matter is one." The use of matter requires "authority"!

Facts tell people that those currently in certain positions are mostly in their fifties or sixties, judging by their age. Why are there so many people in their fifties and sixties? Were they born with such treacherous intentions? This is due to the lingering poison of the Qing dynasty's suppression of morale. In their youth, they were "dead things." They fundamentally lacked spirit. Therefore, Gu Xuan's advocacy of "anyone over forty should be shot" has a reason, it's not just nonsense.

Based on this judgment, we can raise a glass and dance for joy, saying, "The elimination of certain figures is a matter of time. They have declared their own death sentence in spirit, not worth even a press."

Due to the gravity of the times, we must send away the useless and welcome in new spirits. The so-called new spirit is the spirit that is indispensable at this time and in this place and that humans require for survival. Spirit is morale, is vigor, is vitality, is an invisible force. Therefore:

Our spirit must keep pace with the wartime effort, achieving genuine progress: the shortcomings of the past in spirit must be cleansed in the War of Resistance: those with duties must fulfill them: those with abilities must exert them: life must be serious and tense: the front and the rear must truly achieve shared hatred for the enemy and shared destiny, words and actions must be consistent, and gather under the goals of "nation above all, race above all, military first, victory first"; unwavering, not cheating above or below, not being false, not taking advantage of the situation, and adapting general social life to wartime conditions.

If these can all be achieved, then one portion of matter can be used as ten portions of matter.

### Mountain City

— Qiàn Fēi

A gray sky shrouds the gray city. Small snowflakes flutter down, lightly. The mountain peaks are covered in a layer of white mist. Today is market day, but the weather is so cold, I'm afraid it won't be lively, will it?

However, when we walk out onto the street and outside the city gate, the market is bustling with activity. A cacophony of sounds mingles with people's breaths. The wind blows, making people shiver. Their voices tremble along with the air they exhale.

Unloading the heavy burdens from the backs of pack horses, they carry the fruits of their labor into the city to sell: red rice, peas, sorghum. People taking advantage of the market weave through the crowds of sellers.

"The prices are high. The price of grain has risen." Everyone says this.

"Isn't it? Rice that used to cost eight old dollars per斗 is now selling for fourteen dollars." The egg seller chimes in.

Eggs have also risen in price: from two cents to forty cents.

Caulifower, hook vine, potatoes, are placed alongside; but they have all risen in price.

"Why?"

"Too many people!" The grain seller says. Because of the war, many people from the South have fled to this corner of the Southwest. Especially with the arrival of National Central University, the small county town has seen its population increase by a tenth out of nowhere, and everyone feels there are too many people. The poor wear strained expressions. They look at us with disgusted eyes. But there are also those who secretly rejoice, as goods are priced as high as possible, and their pockets fill up quickly.

The sun is still hiding in the clouds. A lead-gray sky covers the gray crowd -- huddling around a burning pile of dry grass and cow dung for warmth, eating red rice from bags. They rarely have cotton clothes to wear. But even if they did, their so-called cotton coats have already borne the weight of three generations of history. Broken, with patches of red and blue hanging down like beads, most of the cotton has already fallen out, with only a faint trace of cotton fluff hidden in the tattered cloth full of holes. The entire cotton coat is held together by just a belt. Everyone sighs and shivers, saying:

"Freezing!" (To be continued)

### Manchurian Snow

— Shū Qún

"Since I have already promised you that even if he doesn't redeem you, we will definitely let you go home within a month. You can rest assured!"

"I'm not going home, I'm not going home!"

"It's even better if you don't go home, wouldn't I have one more comrade?"

"Are you not lying?"

"I told you, I don't lie."

And so, her once helpless soul had a new place to rely on. And so, she planned to stay in that temporary room for a long time; she gave each item in the room a suitable place -- for example, she put the vase near the bed, so she could conveniently see it before going to sleep. And so, she felt that each of her comrades was kinder than when she had arrived. She saw them as fellow residents, as her own older and younger brothers, she saw their pain as her own misfortune, she saw their intentions as her own hopes, she despised their lack of aesthetic sense, and began to automatically tidy up their messy rooms, and finally, she gathered the dirty clothes and socks they had thrown everywhere, wrapping them into a ball. To avoid the bad smell, she pinched her nose for a long time. This was work she had never done at home.

"Rest, look, you've dirtied your hands!"

Yǔ Wén tried to stop her. But she stubbornly retorted with a kind of childishness:

"You have to control everything, do I need you to control me?"

She continued until she was satisfied, and then stopped, panting, constantly patting her chest. Then, they all gathered around her, praising her. Some said:

"You really are our good sister!" Others said:

"You really are our good comrade!" (Sixty)
