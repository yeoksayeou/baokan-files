### Current Situation of the War of Resistance

The current overall situation of the War of Resistance presents an extremely optimistic outlook, with counter-offensives on all fronts and frequent reports of victories. We compatriots who have escaped the flames of war and are residing overseas should feel greatly excited in addition to our expectations!

The most important factor that we cannot ignore regarding the recent frequent victories on all fronts is the bloody and arduous struggle of our soldiers and civilians on all fronts and in the occupied areas. This is why, when we hear the news and are excited, we should solemnly pay our highest national respect to these brave warriors. However, at the same time, we should also understand that the reason why the thousands of soldiers on the front lines and behind enemy lines have been able to fight hard and win is threefold: first, it is due to the exposure of the conspiracies of Wang Jingwei and others; second, it is due to the supreme leader and the central government's adherence to the national policy of unity and resistance; and third, it is due to the unanimous support of the government and leader by the people of the whole country, and their vehement opposition to "anti-communist peace" and other traitorous words and deeds. Because of these three factors, the thousands of soldiers on the front lines and behind enemy lines are able to strengthen their confidence in final victory, and are able to move forward bravely and swear to kill the enemy; because of these three factors, international public opinion and friendly governments and peoples are able to increase their confidence in sympathizing with and respecting China, and are able to accelerate their steps to aid China and restrain Japan.

However, the current victories of the counter-offensives on all fronts are not yet the decisive victory for the entire War of Resistance. The setbacks suffered by the enemy on various fronts do not represent the total collapse of the enemy's army. According to generally reliable estimates, when this political conspiracy is newly frustrated, the enemy will certainly have new military adventures to supplement the political conspiracy and implement new offensive strategies. The enemy has been actively preparing for this new military adventure since the capture of Nanchang: although our resolute launch of counter-offensives on all fronts has caused the enemy's preparations to suffer a major blow, when the enemy's combat effectiveness has not yet suffered a fatal blow, and international sanctions and internal revolution have not yet developed to the point where they cannot fight, the enemy will not only not withdraw its troops, but will also intensify its speculative steps! The recent news of the emergency situation in Fuzhou and Shantou, although actually an attempt by the enemy to relieve the siege of Guangzhou, does not mean that the enemy does not want to seize new strongholds in order to plan to support its operations on the Yuehan Railway and in southern Guangdong, and to achieve its dream of strengthening its occupied areas in the southeast. From the perspective of China's War of Resistance, we have now reached a turning point in the entire situation after more than twenty months of arduous fighting! We have reached the point of turning from inferiority and defeat to superiority and victory!

Although the current counter-offensives on all fronts are not yet the comprehensive general counter-offensive to drive out the Japanese enemy; even though the current situation on all fronts still has the possibility of suffering even greater dangers; but only from the current development of our army's victories and the intensification of the enemy's difficulties, we can increase our greater confidence in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance! Our current task, although not yet to launch a comprehensive general counter-offensive, drive the Japanese enemy out of China, and gradually recover lost territory, is to concentrate all our strength to maintain the dominant position that has been or is about to be achieved on all fronts, and to develop this dominant situation with all our strength, to combat the enemy's new and greater military adventures, to prepare for a comprehensive general counter-offensive, and to meet the final victory. In order to achieve this overall task, we must support and develop the counter-offensives on the front lines and behind enemy lines in military terms: in recent days, we have repeatedly recovered Gaoan and Tongshan, and rushed into Wuning in the central battlefield, preventing the enemy's army from advancing towards Changsha; in the southern battlefield, we have repeatedly recovered Zengcheng, Conghua, Xinhui, and other counties, preventing the enemy's army from spying on Guangdong and Guangxi; in the northern and eastern battlefields, we have respectively attacked Kaifeng, Xinyang, Xuzhou, Baoding, Beiping, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and various places in the Lianghuai River Basin, containing the enemy's army in North China and East China from reinforcing Yuehan and South China; therefore, we must currently help the government enhance the combat effectiveness of the front lines and develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines from both material and spiritual aspects, maintain and expand the offensive on various battlefields, and prevent the enemy's new offensive. At the same time, we must also work hard politically and diplomatically; politically, we must support the central government and the supreme leader, consolidate national unity, severely punish those who surrender to the enemy and betray the country, thoroughly eliminate anti-communist and peaceful words and actions that violate the War of Resistance and national construction, and promote the National Spiritual Mobilization as the current central task: diplomatically, we must adapt to the international anti-aggression front movement, intensify international propaganda and national diplomatic movement, in order to demand that the United States stop transporting military supplies to Japan and other practical work, expand the aid-China and restrain-Japan movement, and strive for more and greater foreign aid. We must fulfill this task in order to maintain and develop the current victory, and to realize the comprehensive general counter-offensive ahead of schedule, drive the enemy out of China, and complete the great cause of the War of Resistance and national construction.

### The Current State of Social Education in Shanghai

— A．N.

Social education is extremely broad in scope. Shanghai, as China's largest city with a population of over three million, has a particularly developed social enterprise sector to meet the needs of the environment. In addition to government funding, there are also many private initiatives. However, after the start of the War of Resistance, most of the government-run institutions were in the occupied war zones, and the few that were not in the occupied war zones were also cut off from funding sources. They have been announced to be suspended. To date, those that are still in operation are privately-owned, and their educational targets are limited to citizens of the concessions. Compared with the pre-war situation, it is truly a drastic change. Here is an overview of the government-run enterprises that fell into the hands of the Japanese army and those that were suspended before the war.

1.  People's Education Center: The Shanghai Municipal People's Education Center was originally located on South Wenmiao Road. It was a large-scale and well-developed institution with various affiliated projects that were handled with great success. It was the most complete and well-established implementation agency for social education in the city. It fell into the occupied war zone after the War of Resistance.

2.  Libraries: There were originally three municipal libraries, one being the Shanghai Municipal Library in the city center, one being the municipal library affiliated to the People's Education Center, and one being the circulating library in Yimiao. Among the three, the municipal library was the largest in scale and the newest in construction. After the war, it was either destroyed by fire or used by the Japanese army.

3.  Museum: Located in the city center, the architecture was magnificent and the content was quite substantial. After the outbreak of the war, except for a few treasures that were moved to a safe area, the rest were lost. The grand palace-style building was forcibly occupied by the puppet municipal government.

4.  Stadiums: The largest in scale was the Shanghai Municipal Stadium. The magnificence of its architecture was unmatched in the Far East. In addition, there was the Municipal First Stadium, located on Daji Road in South Shanghai, which was smaller in scale. As for the Shangyi Stadium, it was scattered in various towns and villages and was jointly managed by local schools. After the war, all of them fell. Some of the buildings in the Municipal Stadium were destroyed by artillery fire, and it has recently been occupied by the Japanese army as a barracks.

5.  Zoo: Located on Wenchao Road in South Shanghai, opposite the People's Education Center. The various animals that were raised, except for a portion that was moved to Gujiatai Park for public exhibition, were all killed.

6.  Botanical Garden: Located on Longhua Road in South Shanghai. Before the war, it had been transferred to the Municipal Garden Bureau. It was located in a quiet and secluded environment. There were thousands of varieties of rare flowers and exotic plants. After the war, it all fell into the hands of the Japanese army.

7.  People's Reading Rooms: Scattered in various municipal towns, there were no less than several hundred places. Before the war, the Social Bureau designated various schools to run them, either posting the original newspapers or adapting them into wall newspapers. After the war, they were all eliminated with the closure of the schools.

8.  Literacy Schools: Shanghai began large-scale literacy education in July 1935, and held six sessions in succession until June 1937, each session lasting four months. The implementation plan included two major parts, one was literacy education and the other was civic education. The specific goals were the cultivation of national morality, the learning of simple characters, the transmission of common language, the improvement of people's lives, the cultivation of democratic awareness, and the training of productive capacity. After two years of operation, great achievements were made. A total of 317,526 people in the city had received literacy education. Taking the last session before the war, the sixth session, as an example, there were still 91 literacy schools in the city, with a total of 368 classes, and 22,262 students enrolled. According to coordinated statistics, the number of illiterate people in the city by the end of the pre-war period was only 309,334, which was more than half less than before the literacy education was carried out. If time could be allowed, it would not be difficult to eliminate them all. However, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, this great undertaking has been suspended, which can be said to be the greatest loss in Shanghai's social education.

The above-mentioned social education enterprises were all run by government agencies before the war, and have all been suspended after the war, with none existing. In addition, there are some enterprises that were government-run in the past, but a part of them were able to relocate and recover. The existing social education enterprises are mostly privately-owned or newly emerging after the war, and are also described below.

1.  People's Schools

Although the People's Schools were government-run in the past and were all scattered in the countryside, since the fall of Shanghai, some of the original teachers, recognizing the importance of people's education, have relocated to the concessions to reopen schools, but the number is much smaller than before, with only about fourteen or fifteen levels. The funding is also very limited, so book and miscellaneous fees are also charged to supplement the funding. The implementation methods have also been uniformly stipulated. The main points are recorded below:

A. Purpose: In accordance with the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation plan, to provide elderly out-of-school people with simple knowledge and skills.

B. School buildings and equipment: The principle is to borrow ordinary school buildings.

C. Students: Both men and women are accepted, and may be set up separately if necessary, but only those between the ages of sixteen and forty are accepted.

D. Period: Each period is six months, and education is provided for one hour per day.

E. Level: Divided into primary and advanced levels. The primary level is equivalent to the first grade of primary school, and the advanced level is equivalent to the third grade of primary school. A combined class system may be adopted.

F. Subjects and hours: Chinese language: primary level accounts for 66% of the total time, advanced level accounts for 50%. Arithmetic: primary level accounts for 12% of the total time, advanced level accounts for 10%. Civic training: primary level accounts for 14% of the total time, advanced level accounts for 8%. Music and physical education: primary and advanced levels each account for 8% of the total time. General knowledge and simple occupation: primary level is combined with other subjects, advanced level each accounts for 12%.

G. Teaching materials: In addition to self-edited materials, literacy textbooks published by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and the Commercial Press can be used. Short-term primary school textbooks, Lao Shao Tong, and people's readings, etc., are selected by the teachers within this range with reference to the students' level.

2.  Tutorial Schools

In the past year, tutorial schools in Shanghai, established by private individuals, have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, reaching more than 200 schools with about 60,000 students. The nature of each school can be roughly divided into two types: general education and vocational education. The general education provided focuses on supplementing language, mathematics, and general knowledge. The so-called vocational education covers almost all sectors of the vocational world. The reasons for the particularly developed after the war are nothing more than three: first, the high desire for knowledge among the staff of the business community; second, the change of direction of students in ordinary schools who are unable to read due to the impact of the war; and another reason is the widespread decline in the economic strength of the people, who are unable to bear the cost of ordinary education for their children, and send them to tutorial schools, hoping to acquire a skill in a short period of time to make a living. With these three factors, tutorial schools have been able to flourish for a time, but in terms of quality, they may still not be able to fully satisfy people.

3.  Street Children Education

Street children education is the newest product of adapting to the needs of the environment after the war. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai and its fall as an isolated island, refugees have gathered in the special zone, and vagrant children are walking the streets everywhere. People with a passion for education believe that there is a need for relief, so they raised funds to organize the Shanghai Street Children Education Association to be responsible for the operation. To date, 30 street children schools have been established, with a total of 50 levels, educating more than 4,000 children. All educational activities are different from schools, and the teaching materials are also formulated by the teachers themselves according to the "principles" stipulated by the Street Children Education Association. The teaching hours are also based on the convenience of the street children. The school buildings are completely borrowed from public places, such as temples and ancestral halls, but school buildings or civilian houses are also borrowed when necessary. The implementation points of this new enterprise are recorded as follows:

A. Educational purpose: To help vagrant out-of-school children between the ages of six and fifteen to receive appropriate education, so that they can be healthy in body and mind, and acquire basic knowledge and skills to adapt to real life.

B. Educational methods: 1. Teaching aspects: gatherings, group work, visits, individual guidance, etc.

2.  Nurturing aspects: Providing medical treatment, correction, and assistance to injured children in their daily lives, and improving their production methods, or introducing vocational training.

C. Implementation steps: 1. Register street children. 2. Guide teachers. 3. Contact educational venues. 4. Physical examination. 5. Stipulate educational hours. 6. Send staff to guide.

D. Teaching schedule: 1. Teacher preparation. 2. Street children gather. 3. Cleanliness inspection. 4. Daily meeting - street children's songs or reports on current affairs knowledge and spiritual talks. 5. Special teaching activities for the whole class or in groups, such as Chinese language, arithmetic, social design, and performance. 6. Singing and games and sports. 7. Group meeting - presided over by the group leader to discuss group affairs and progress.

4.  Refugee Education

Refugee education, as the name suggests, is also a new enterprise after the war. When the war broke out in Shanghai, refugees from the surrounding suburbs gathered in the special zone. Relief centers were established one after another, and were separately organized by the International Relief Committee, the Charity Group United Relief Association, the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, the Refugee Relief Branch, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, and various hometown associations and public organizations. At most, there were more than 220 relief centers. The educational methods were independent of each other and lacked standards. The educational affairs were concurrently handled by the managers of each center, and the methods were also different. Later, the organizers of each center, recognizing the importance of refugee education, successively set up training groups or education groups to preside over the educational affairs of each center under their jurisdiction, but still only focused on the children's part. Until the International Committee of the Red Cross took over the responsibility of providing food for each center, an education committee was set up to uniformly preside over the refugee education in the city, and the facilities and facilities were put on the right track. At most, the number of refugees receiving education reached 149,700. As for the content of the implementation, refugee children aged six to sixteen received children's education, divided into Chinese language, arithmetic, general knowledge, singing, physical education and other subjects. Chinese language, arithmetic and general knowledge were basic subjects and must be educated. Singing and physical education depended on the equipment, talents and environment of each center. The education time was at most 22 hours per week. Refugees over the age of sixteen received adult education, divided into literacy, spiritual training, lectures, storytelling, movies, fitness exercises, etc., with literacy education as the main focus and lectures and storytelling as supplements. The education time was at least 21 hours per week and at most 26 hours per week. Refugees who had the ability to live or were more intelligent were given vocational education, divided into vocational training and production education. Vocational training was given to them with vocational knowledge and skills, and production education was given to them with the technology of various handicraft production. There are now 22 types of handicraft production workshops, such as embroidery, sewing, carpentry, weaving, etc., and products have been launched for sale. If it can be maintained and promoted spiritually, it will not be difficult to transform the consuming refugees into producers.

5.  Lane Education

The so-called lane education is actually equivalent to the past itinerant education, but its itinerant range is based on the lane as a unit. Its implementation method is very mobile. Any lane with no schools nearby but a large population is its educational venue. The school buildings are mostly borrowed from public places or the remaining houses of enthusiastic educators. The equipment is very simple. Except for those necessary for education, the rest are provided by the students voluntarily, and even the tables and chairs are brought voluntarily. The content of education focuses on basic training, especially on the knowledge and skills of daily life and the inculcation of national concepts and national consciousness. Since the recipients are children, it seems that they can be classified into the scope of school education, but since the implementation method is very different from school education, it is actually a kind of social education, because the target of social education is not limited to children. At present, there are about 430 people in the city who are receiving this lane education, divided into seven levels and scattered in seven places. When the number of out-of-school children in each place decreases, they will be moved to other lanes for education. It is also a product of adapting to the actual needs after the war.

6.  Newspaper Boy Education

Shanghai is a gathering place for the newspaper industry. There are thousands of children who rely on selling newspapers for a living. These children call out the important news published in various newspapers every day, running around everywhere. It is really necessary to give them strict training, because they can influence the public's minds. Enthusiastic educators in the city initiated the implementation of newspaper boy education. There are now about 10 levels of newspaper boy schools, enrolling more than 400 students. In addition to giving the newspaper boys the knowledge and skills of daily life and language education, special attention is paid to the reporting of current affairs knowledge, so that each newspaper boy can listen to the important news about current affairs every day. The teaching hours are based on the principle that they do not interfere with the children's time to sell newspapers. The school buildings are all combined with ordinary schools or other public places, and funds are being raised to expand the scale.

People's sports in Shanghai were once said to be developed. Before the war, the Social Bureau specially set up a people's sports section to guide people's sports throughout the city. It also held amateur sports meetings and walking competitions. The municipal stadiums trained people's sports without any surplus. The China National Sports Association also hosted international sports competitions. After the War of Resistance, all of the above institutions have been suspended, but the atmosphere of sports competitions is still booming. Except for track and field competitions, which are rarely held due to the lack of large venues, the practice and competition of football, basketball, tennis, swimming, etc. are still carried out as usual.

In addition to the above, there are many other social education enterprises that are too numerous to describe. For example, after the municipal library was destroyed, private individuals set up the Dingxiang Circulating Library, the China Circulating Library, and the Ding's Library, etc. In short, there are fewer public social education enterprises in Shanghai after the war and more private ones, especially tutorial schools are the most developed. Moreover, there are several enterprises that are jointly set up in one place. Due to the regulations of the concessions, they cannot be publicly attached outside, so a precise survey is not easy. The new social education enterprises are all needed by the war environment, and have profound significance in the process of resisting the war and building the country.

### The Circle and the Sharp Blade (2)

Raw Material Plunder and Foreign Exchange Plunder

The Japanese mainland is now in constant need of large quantities of imports, especially raw materials that Japan itself does not produce. This requires foreign exchange to buy these items in the world's abundant markets. Japan's imports will increase with its military buildup and expansion of industrial equipment, and are expected to increase further. Japan hopes to rely on new sources of raw material control and foreign exchange earnings to become less dependent on foreign exchange in the import market. This is another motive for the war against China, and another reason for trying to expand the "Yen Bloc" to the conquered territories. Thus, the success or failure of this point is a major factor in the conditions for the future success or failure of Japan's efforts to expand its export industry using the "Yen Bloc." In terms of the supply of imported goods, the Japanese Empire has not been as generous as it has been to the export market. Before the outbreak of this war, the three major territories accounted for the following percentages of the total exports from the Japanese mainland: Taiwan 9.8%, Korea 14.2%, and "Manchukuo" 6.3%, totaling 30.3%. The three territories supplied all the food needed by Japan (food actually accounted for the majority of the goods sold by the three territories to the "mother country"). However, the proportion of the total amount of important raw materials and other goods needed by Japanese industry from the three territories was much smaller than the figures mentioned above. Before the war, China's exports to Japan accounted for 42% of the total amount purchased by the Japanese mainland from foreign countries. Now that China's most important commercial cities have been incorporated into the "Yen Bloc," Japan is now trying its best to take advantage of the opportunity to import more goods from China, but the results have disappointed the Japanese. Although the Japanese can seize any valuable items they see in the occupied areas, and expel foreigners who buy Chinese products; although the Japanese no longer need to use foreign exchange when shopping in China; and although the Japanese suppress prices and buy by force, or often confiscate things in practice using the methods commonly used domestically.

In the first eight months of 1938, the monthly average of Japan's imports from North China increased by three and a half times compared to 1936. During this period, there was still major military turmoil in Central China, and Japan's imports from that region had fallen to only one-fifth of what they were before. But once the situation in the region is similar to that in North China, the same increase can be expected. In the end, the resources of Central China will also be exploited in the same way. Although there are some possible hopes for the Japanese development plan, the victors know that even if they can achieve the greatest success they imagine, they still cannot make Japan less dependent on other foreign countries to supply its needs because of China. This is another reason for Japan to take advantage of the extremely perfect opportunity to incorporate China into the "Yen Bloc"; not only to completely extract every kind of raw material in China that is useful to Japan, but also to make China provide more foreign exchange to pay for Japan's continuous purchase of goods from foreign markets. Therefore, the main problem that Japan's "Greater Yen Bloc" must deal with is foreign exchange. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Empire was extremely dissatisfied with its foreign exchange situation. Now, let's go back to 1936, when Korea and Taiwan, like the Japanese mainland, were suffering from a shortage of foreign exchange. Although the total amount of goods they purchased from foreign countries, that is, non-Japanese countries, was small, it was still much more than the total amount sold to these countries. In 1936, the total amount of overdrafts they gave was paid by Japan in foreign exchange, totaling 57.3 million Japanese yen.

According to official foreign trade reports, Japan's own trade deficit in the same year totaled 70.8 million Japanese yen. However, the largest part of the trade deficit (in 1936, Japan had to pay a huge amount for this, and exhausted all of its free gold reserves, and at the beginning of the war in 1937, it was forced to start selling huge amounts of gold) was related to "Manchukuo" and Dalian, its transit port in the Kwantung Leased Territory. These two Japanese territories, which were the initiators of the "Yen Bloc," had a trade deficit of 258.7 million Japanese yen. The difference in their import and export trade was indeed entirely due to their mutual transactions with the Japanese mainland, because the amount they purchased from the "mother country" far exceeded the total amount they rewarded to the "mother country." However, because the Japanese mainland and the Kwantung Leased Territory of "Manchukuo" both recorded such trade inaccurately in Japan's so-called foreign trade reports, and because both sides deliberately reduced Japan's trade deficit to the smallest possible attack by analogy, this difference should be listed as the largest of the three items to make up for the total amount of trade deficit between the Japanese Empire and various countries. If the incorporation of "Manchukuo" into the "Yen Bloc" did not enable Japan to provide for its own use the excess foreign exchange obtained from selling high-value soybeans in the trade between "Manchukuo" and non-Japanese foreign countries, then the above-mentioned difference would probably increase by more than 100 million Japanese yen. This point cannot be ignored.

The Absolute Emptiness of the Foundation's Foreign Exchange

Japan's foreign exchange problem is now more serious than before. In the first year of the war against China, Japan had spent 50% of its gold reserves. These golds had to be sold overseas to offset the empire's foreign trade deficit. Moreover, during this year of war, Japan also massively increased its purchases of military raw materials to maintain its stockpiles. The stockpiles of only these three items, cotton, wool, and American timber, had already used up 60%, 70%, and 80% respectively. Moreover, the foreign raw materials that are usually needed have been reduced to the extent that their imports cannot continue to be maintained. If this continues, then the export industry of Japanese manufactured goods such as cotton, which contains foreign raw materials, will be in danger of complete cessation. Therefore, the foreign exchange problem has made Japanese leaders even more uneasy, and they are even more skeptical about whether the gradual expansion of export trade within the "Yen Bloc" region is beneficial. The exported goods mostly contain raw materials that Japan needs to use foreign exchange to purchase in the world market. Although the export trade to the "Yen Bloc" region has expanded, the imports from these regions have not seen the same expansion, and Japan has not received the same opportunity to occupy the market's territories. The increase in the trade deficit caused by Japan's trade with its newest territories is now shown by the following figures. Japan's iron exports to the non-colonial part of the "Yen Bloc" averaged 41.5 million Japanese yen per month in 1936, but in the first eight months of 1938, it had increased to 89.6 million Japanese yen (although these exports have increased by more than double, Japan's exports to foreign countries in the same period were only half of the previous period). However, the average monthly import from the non-colonial territories subsidized by the "Yen Bloc" was only 19.9 million Japanese yen in 1936, and only 49 million Japanese yen in 1938. Japan has also not continued to receive much foreign exchange from these newly acquired places. The net amount of foreign exchange received by "Manchukuo" from the trade surplus from trade outside the "Yen Bloc" can be regarded as a gift to Japan. In 1936, it was 13.3 million Japanese yen per month, but in the first six months of 1938, "Manchukuo's" trade with foreign countries actually saw a deficit of 2 million Japanese yen per month, which had to be offset by Japan's allocation. Japan may be able to accumulate a considerable amount of foreign exchange in North China and Central China. Japanese personnel are now relying on the active assistance of the army in these two places to try to scrape together Chinese legal tender to exchange for "Federal Reserve" banknotes or Japanese yen banknotes, or to pay for Japanese exports. However, the Chinese government is now implementing a policy to maintain the legal tender so that it can be exchanged for foreign exchange. Therefore, the benefits obtained by Japan are indeed not very large. The legal tender still occupies a dominant position in most of the occupied areas, and the general public does not want it to fall into the hands of the Japanese. This is indeed the main obstacle encountered by the "Yen Bloc" in these areas.

As long as people think a little about Japan's trade surplus position in its transactions with the new territories in the "Yen Bloc," it is easy to understand why Japan should not discriminate against exports to various places in the "Yen Bloc." At least it should not send various manufactured goods containing foreign raw materials and capable of obtaining foreign exchange in the world market to the various places that have joined the "Yen Bloc." These new territories are now being regarded too much as an important part of the Japanese domestic market. On the mainland and in Japan in general, various trade regulations are planned in the sense of consumption to prevent goods from being sold to second-class customers who cannot pay in other currencies but can only pay in Japanese yen or rely on Japanese yen banknotes. This not only makes Japanese exporters very troubled, but also greatly frustrates the military who are eagerly promoting Sino-Japanese "cooperation." Therefore, the only thing Japan can sell now is to fully control China's exports to third countries and confiscate the foreign exchange obtained from this trade for the use of the "Yen Bloc." Only in this way can Japan's trade obtain various benefits from the newly emerging monetary alliance. These benefits will be the spoils of victory.

Japanese Attempts to Destroy the Whole

Japan's path of advancement in China is blocked, at least for the time being, because it cannot control the foreign exchange income obtained from China's exports to third countries. There is another more important reason: the new currency used by Japan in North China is just a piece of paper that can only be exchanged for another piece of paper and cannot be cashed. Protecting the failure of Japan's attempts has caused Japan to hesitate to use the same currency in China according to the original plan and to withdraw the "Japanese Yen Military Notes." This "Military Notes" cannot even be used as legal tender in a liberated New China. It can never gain the trust of any Chinese that the Japanese army's guns cannot reach. At a time when the Chinese legal tender can still be exchanged for foreign exchange, any new currency, at least with the backing of a portion of China's current foreign exchange income, can have an equal opportunity to fight with the Chinese legal tender and gradually abandon it. Therefore, if the Japanese want to achieve economic victory in the war against China, if they can, there is still one more hurdle to break through: because they cannot have the Chinese currency that allows exports to flow out, they cannot control China's export trade to third countries; because the inherent value of the Chinese legal tender far exceeds the substitutes they use, they cannot control or destroy the Chinese "old currency"; because before the Chinese legal tender is completely destroyed, if they want to create a better substitute, the only obvious way is to make this substitute freely exchangeable for gold yuan or gold pounds. In the current situation, it can only be exchanged by transporting Chinese goods to foreign countries, so they cannot create a better substitute than the Chinese legal tender. The Japanese are now using bayonets to carry out this work, trying to reduce the flow of Chinese products to the world market, but not only has it failed to achieve results, but it has also encouraged them to export. Therefore, the construction of the "Yen Bloc" in China is still far from being completed. No matter what kind of close economic and financial relationship Japan and its firmly controlled territories have on the one hand, and the occupied areas in China on the other, this relationship is still completely based on the barbaric power of the Japanese army: a closer monetary alliance, a more intelligent and more coercive force, has not yet truly been realized. Even if a "peace treaty" is concluded between the two countries, even if this peace treaty allows Japan's desire to rule China to come true, it is difficult to expect these situations to undergo rapid changes.

At the same time, Japan is now using force to at least lay the foundation for those economic policies, hoping that the monetary mechanism of the "Yen Bloc" will eventually proceed smoothly, effectively, and almost automatically, so that the encroachment on the interests of China or third countries will not be overly exposed: and it is preparing to make Chinese members use the name of a New China to implement modern methods of controlling foreign exchange to replace the current means of Japanese army and navy officers' habitual brutal interference in trade and industry. A refined and discriminatory bureaucratic system—such as licenses, quotas, restrictive regulations, donations and taxes, and manipulation of tax rules, credit and loan regulations, etc. Japan has developed all of this in its country and its territories into its recent feudalism, which has been extremely successful, along with the two major patented enterprises that have been given to Japan, namely the development companies of North China and Central China. Now, it has quietly planned to achieve Japan's ambition. This is nothing more than turning China into a major part of the Yen Bloc, like Taiwan, Korea, and Manchukuo; developing various Chinese products that are useful to Japan; turning other products or future competition with Japanese industries into non-existent; turning China's pre-war vast and increasingly self-sufficient power into complete dependence on Japan; and reducing China's economic exchanges with the world outside the Yen Bloc to a degree suitable for Japan's own needs. However, Japan wants to achieve this economic victory over China and the long-established interests of the Taixi. The future is uncertain, and it remains to be seen when the goal will be achieved, because the interests of the Taixi and the modern progress of China are closely integrated, and it has become a legitimate and independent unit in the whole country. Even if Japan can achieve this economic victory because of the resistance of the Taixi or its inability to maintain China's own long-term resistance, it seems that there is no guarantee that Japan's economic problems will be solved within the "Greater Yen Bloc."

### Puppet Organizations in North China

— Mu Xin

[Min Ge News Agency, Dusi Correspondence] When the military offensive of the [Japanese] bandits encountered the most stubborn resistance, the [Japanese] bandits began their despicable and shameless political conspiracies everywhere. They used all kinds of deceptive and numbing propaganda in an attempt to divide our unity and the enthusiastic support of the people for our government. In order to more conveniently exploit and control our people, the [Japanese] bandits used money to buy off the corrupt and traitorous elements in various parts of our country to establish puppet organizations—traitorous governments. Based on the results of recent investigations and interviews by reporters, and referring to the research on captured [Japanese] puppet documents, the ugliness of the [Japanese] puppet and traitorous organizations in Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces are specially reported to readers in various regions.

Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, fell on November 8th of the year before last (1937). After our troops withdrew from the city, a group of shameless traitors began activities to establish a puppet organization. On December 28th, the traitors Han Qian and Guo Xiang[sheng], etc., organized the false "Shanxi Provincial Provisional Government Preparatory Committee," and officially began preparing the puppet organization on that day.

It was not until June 20th of last year—1938, that the puppet "Beijing Provisional Government" issued an order officially establishing the puppet "Shanxi Provincial Public Office," and simultaneously announced the organization chart of the puppet provincial office and its list of personnel. The traitorous newspaper, "Shanxi Xinmin" newspaper, even published a special issue to "congratulate" the establishment of this puppet organization.

The puppet organization has a supreme advisor at the top, serving as the "supreme commander" of the puppet organization. Below is a governor, a secretary-general, and three councilors. It is divided into four departments: civil affairs, finance, construction, and education. There is also an advisory councilor and three counselors. The elements of these degenerates are some hooligans, former Qing Dynasty "selected tribute students", opium and alcohol addicts, and other traitors. The traitor Gao Buqing used to be the manager of the Shanxi Provincial Bank. He was arrested and imprisoned for bribery and fraud. He was only released after the July 7th Incident, and is a shameless parasite.

The puppet Shanxi Provincial Public Office is the supreme leading agency of the Shanxi puppet administrative organization. In addition, wherever [Japanese] bandit forces can reach, puppet county public offices are established. According to Li Qichang, the puppet education section chief of Hongdong, who was arrested by our side, the general structure of the [Japanese] puppet organization in each county is divided into three sections, under the leadership of the puppet county public office, the maintenance society, and the special agent organization.

In addition, there are several things led by the [Japanese] bandit special agent organization: a "political work team" serving as "county office advisors," an "economic work team" engaging in fraud and manipulation, a garrison team guarding the city, a "reassurance team" specializing in false and deceptive political propaganda, a "lotus leaf team" specializing in repairing local structures, and an "ox path team" responsible for repairing roads.

It can be said that the [Japanese] bandits have established many agencies in various places; however, these agencies are surrounded by our guerrillas, making it difficult for them to exert their effectiveness outside the city walls. Even the [Japanese] puppet regime in Taiyuan cannot extend its policies beyond ten li outside the city. In the entire Shanxi, our anti-Japanese regime still exists in all 105 counties.

Therefore, these traitorous governments are fundamentally puppet organizations of the [Japanese] bandits, so the [Japanese] bandits will abolish or reorganize them at any time when they see them as displeasing or inconvenient to use. The puppet organizations in Suiyuan and Chahar were reorganized by the [Japanese] bandits recently for this reason.

After the reorganization, the [Japanese] puppet organization linked Suiyuan and Chahar to form the "Mongolian League Autonomous Government", realizing the [Japanese] bandits' dream of a "Mongol state" that had been in their minds for a long time.

The "Mongolian League Autonomous Government" has a chairman and vice-chairman. The chairman is the well-known traitor De Wang, and the vice-chairman is the traitor Li Shouxin. Below them are four departments—security department, general affairs department, livestock production department, and military affairs department. The security minister is called "Jia'er Gela". The puppet affairs are Tao Ketao. The production department is unclear. The military affairs department is a department that has just been organized and has not yet announced its personnel. Among these four departments, the continued affairs department is the largest, and it has five departments: civil affairs, finance, education, and other departments.

The various local governments of Sui and Chahar are under the direct jurisdiction of the "Mongolian League Autonomous Government". They divided the two provinces (all of Chahar, and most of Suiyuan) into five league public offices and two special municipalities.

The functions of the puppet league public office are similar to our administrative regions, and are divided into three departments: civil affairs, security, and production. The five leagues are: Chahar League, Xilin Gol League, Ujimqin League, Yikezhao League, and Bayantala League. The puppet league leader of Chahar is [unclear]. Ujimqin League is Prince Lin (Prince of Zhonggong Banner). Yikezhao League is Balegedong. Bayantala League is Bao Yingerlegere. The Xilin Gol League is unclear. The past local bureaus of Suiyuan are mostly included in Bayantala League.

The two special municipalities are: "Hohhot Special Municipality" and Baotou Special Municipality. The mayor of the former is He Bingwen (former president of the Chamber of Commerce), and the mayor of the latter is called Liu Jiguang. Hohhot Special Municipality is the original Guihua City, and Guisui County is also merged into it. The puppet "Mongolian League Autonomous Government" of Chahar and Suiyuan and other organizations below it, like puppet organizations in other places, are mere puppets. The actual power lies in the hands of the Japanese warlords.

However, no matter how the [Japanese] bandits "reorganize" and "strengthen" the puppet organizations, they will not have any effect. From the far north of Suiyuan and Chahar to the southernmost part of Shanxi, our guerrillas are everywhere [unclear], bravely [unclear] the anti-Japanese national revolutionary [unclear] regime. The ordinary wave of resistance from the people in various places has [unclear] the [Japanese] bandits and puppet organizations one by one on small "prison" like points and lines, giving the [Japanese] bandits constant siege and strikes.

Among these puppet organizations, in addition to those great traitors who are willing to be running dogs for the [Japanese] bandits, the others, especially the lower-level staff, feel the greatest pain and the greatest hatred for the [Japanese] [unclear] and the shamelessness of the great traitors. Even these great traitors also feel uneasy and sad because they are subject to interference from the [Japanese] '[unclear]' (special agent organization) everywhere. Most of the puppet troops have become aware of the [Japanese] [unclear]'s [unclear] and oppression, and they are constantly defecting in batches, some committing suicide, and continuous escapes have become a common phenomenon.

Following the upsurge of the people's war of resistance, and with the awakening of the [Japanese] puppet soldiers and lower-level staff, under the heroic situation of "inside and outside cooperation", all puppet organizations will eventually become the tombs of the [Japanese] bandits and traitors, burying their own corpses.

### People of Rehe Province Rise Up in Resistance; Righteous Army Frightens Traitors; Visitor from Rehe Discusses Local Situation

— Sen Ran

[Special Dispatch from Beiping] Since the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces have been lost. The anti-Japanese war in Rehe was a flash in the pan. For the past seven years, the Japanese have been operating in the four northeastern provinces, and although they have achieved some success, the patriotic feelings of our people in Rehe, and the guerrilla activities of the Volunteer Army, are clear proof that the Northeast is not lost. Recently, a visitor came from Rehe to describe the general situation there. I will briefly record it to inform those in the rear who are concerned about the situation in the Northeast.

The loss of Rehe was due to the tyranny of Tang Yulin's era, and the weak national consciousness of some of the people. The direct cause was the lack of defense and the soldiers being unprepared. When Tang committed outrageous exactions and oppressed the people for a long time in Rehe, the Japanese troops immediately disintegrated upon arrival. At that time, the Japanese relied heavily on the guidance of a small number of treacherous people. Rehe is naturally dangerous, and those who are not familiar with the terrain cannot be bandits. Some ignorant people even regarded the Japanese as saviors, initially unaware that they were leading wolves into the house and replacing one tyranny with another. After the iron hooves of the Japanese invasion had gained a stable foothold, these people gradually began to taste the feeling of national subjugation, and their suffering increased day by day, until they rose up to resist, but it was already too late. Rehe is inhabited by Han and Mongol people, and originally governed sixteen counties and four administrative bureaus. Now the administrative bureaus have all been upgraded to counties, totaling twenty counties. There are six million Han people and five hundred thousand Mongol people, most of whom are poor and live in difficult conditions. The so-called officials, gentry, wealthy households, and small families account for only one or two percent of the population.

Since there are so many poor people in Rehe, many people have risen up due to the Japanese high-pressure resistance, which is due to the environment and life. The Northeast Volunteer Army has risen from scratch since September 18th, and the main force is the troops of General Li Du. The soldiers in Rehe belonged to a part of the 12th Army of General Li. Among them, there were personnel from the Eighth Route Army who were active in the border area of Jin, Ji, and Cha. Last year, they entered the Liao region via eastern Hebei, and shared the guerrilla responsibilities with the 12th Army. They went deep into the people, and the cover was quite confidential. Although only 5,000 people were actually engaged in activities and battles, there were no fewer than 30,000 people lying dormant waiting for opportunities. However, since the Japanese bandits occupied Rehe, they have been using the great dangers, and the defenses at the mouths of the river are particularly strict. The highway network is crisscrossed and built of asphalt and gravel. Each village office is equipped with a telephone, and the transportation and communication are very sensitive and convenient, so the activities of our guerrillas are quite difficult. When the Eighth Route Army entered Rehe from eastern Hebei via Panjiakou last autumn, they fought with the [Japanese] bandits in the area of Fengning on the border of [unclear] and Cha, and there was no smooth progress because of this. At the moment, our troops in Rehe are lurking in the depths of the mountains and forests, taking the opportunity to move out, suddenly destroying the [Japanese] bandits' transportation, and intercepting their logistics transport vehicles for our use. Or they disguise themselves and enter the towns and cities to burn the [Japanese] bandits' rear food warehouses, avoiding frontal battles with the [Japanese] bandits. When the [Japanese] bandits come, we leave; when the [Japanese] bandits retreat, we gather, making the [Japanese] bandits exhausted and unable to catch us.

Most of the guerrillas in Rehe are natives of Rehe, good at riding and shooting, and have a strong and brave personality to kill [Japanese] bandits. They are familiar with the geography and appear and disappear unpredictably. If they can be trained again and taught the methods of modern warfare, they will surely become the elite troops on the front line of the war against [Japanese] bandits. The anti-Japanese sentiment of the people is also rising day by day. In the past, when the [Japanese] bandits first occupied Rehe, they searched every household for guns, and no private possession was allowed. Therefore, most of the civilian guns were taken away by the [Japanese] bandits. Now the people's anti-Japanese war is fought with bayonets and hand-to-hand combat with the [Japanese] bandits, or even with knives and sticks to intercept the [Japanese] bandits' cars. Their heroic and decisive spirit is like this.

The Japanese have been planning to invade the Northeast for decades, so after September 18th, they actively promoted their planned economic and political policies, and achieved considerable success. This is an undeniable fact. Since July 7th, the [Japanese] bandits have been acting in North China in the same way, but the effect is very poor. The reason is that when the [Japanese] bandits first captured the Northeast, they fooled the people who did not know the misery of national subjugation, and had not tasted the taste of slaves. When they saw the violence of the [Japanese] bandits, and the plunder of the [Japanese] [unclear], they hated it very much. Even the traitors have seen the gradual weakening of the puppet officials in the Northeast, and the arrogance and deception of the Japanese officials, and deeply regretted it. Therefore, what the [Japanese] bandits did in the Northeast and could be effective, can no longer be used in North China. The increase and strengthening of national consciousness and national concepts are the focus of the defeat of my political training and the superiority of the Japanese. After the [Japanese] bandits' military [unclear], there is no good politics to follow, only killing and implicating people. The greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. Rehe--even the Northeast--the local people's excitement is not because of the [Japanese] bandits' tyranny and inhumanity.

Although our political work in Rehe is not as thorough as in Hebei and Shanxi, it is quite successful. Each county has several liaison officers assigned to be responsible for intelligence and propaganda, instilling anti-Japanese ideas and strengthening civilian organizations. However, in terms of military affairs, due to the [Japanese] bandits' advantageous transportation and communication, there is still no significant effect. As for the [Japanese] bandits' political work, they are extremely strict in preventing our people, and no matter the size of the agency, the Japanese hold the real power and regard the puppets as puppets. For example, in the county government, the Japanese are called counselors, now changed to deputy county magistrates, and they have the power to kill at will. The directors of the police bureaus in each county are all Japanese, and are no different from the deputy county magistrates. Below the police bureau are five or seven police stations, each of which has two Japanese instructors, dividing the area into several districts, each with a public office, which is the so-called "autonomous agency" of the [Japanese] bandits.

The latest household registration of the entire Rehe has been completed, and the household registration books are kept separately in the police station and the district office. The increase or decrease of people [unclear] reported in time. Registration is only carried out after verification. Those who leave the village and return after staying overnight must also report to the district office to request the police station to issue an identity certificate. Those who go out for a long time must find joint guarantors to clarify the reasons for the record, and the police station will issue a passport, stating all restrictions before they are allowed to travel, and they must first state the deadline before traveling. If they do not return after the deadline, the guarantors and their families will be arrested, and even sentenced to death for "collusion." The cruelty of the restrictions and the harshness of the punishment make the people dare not speak out in anger, and the resentment is deeper than this.

Although there is no newspaper propaganda in Rehe, the people are happy when they hear that the guerrillas are active somewhere, and they spread the news to each other, and use "the Central Army has come" as comfort. Even the puppet troops and puppet police under the high pressure of the [Japanese] bandits also have this mentality, hoping that the war can extend to Rehe, so that there is an opportunity to turn around and surrender. Therefore, the [Japanese] bandits in Rehe do not dare to send puppet troops to the "cleanup work" against our guerrillas, for fear that the puppet troops will defect and turn their guns on them. At the moment, the Rehe puppet army is about 10,000 people under the command of Xing Ni Shi [unclear], numbered the First Fifth Route Central Control District Command Headquarters, and is completely stationed in Chengde. Other county garrisons are called "Japanese Security Team," but their strength is scattered and weak, and they are not worth attacking. Our guerrillas are therefore very successful. Although the [Japanese] bandits try their best, it is difficult to achieve any effect. Once the Qing [unclear] rise up, the guerrillas' activities will be more active and can be asserted.

The [Japanese] bandits are suspicious, and it is heard every day that innocent civilians in Rehe are being arrested and massacred. Recently, due to the activity of the guerrillas in Rehe, a large-scale inspection was carried out, and many well-known people in each county were arrested by the [Japanese] bandits for no reason. The situation in the entire Rehe is disturbed and in a state of extreme terror. The traitors are also feeling that everyone is in danger. The loyal and righteous people are waiting for the opportunity to move, and the people are automatically joining the guerrillas more and more every day. Therefore, today's Rehe has almost set off an angry wave of resistance against [Japanese] bandits. (April 5th)

### Soviet Union Proposes Concluding Collective Security Agreement; Soviet-Turkish Negotiations in Final Stage; British Ambassador to Germany Ordered to Return to Post

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th Dispatch] The Soviet Union has previously expressed its willingness to conclude a military mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France. It is now heard that the Soviet Union has also proposed that countries that fear aggression by National Socialist Fascist dictatorial countries should hold an international conference. According to French diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union suggested that all countries concerned with maintaining the status quo of Eastern and Western Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, the Danube River basin, and the Scandinavian Peninsula should participate in the conference and conclude a collective security agreement, stipulating that once Germany and Italy continue to launch aggressive actions, all contracting countries should resist them with force.

[Hai Tong News Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, who is still staying in Moscow to report to his government on Britain's response to the Soviet anti-aggression proposal, will leave the Soviet Union tonight and is expected to arrive here on Tuesday or Wednesday. British political circles believe that Maisky and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds have successively engaged with the Soviet government, and the process has been very smooth. Therefore, the details of the British-Soviet negotiations can be published soon. British political circles also said that Britain is only prepared to guarantee the security of the Soviet Union's western border and does not include its eastern border. Recalling the French-Russian agreement before 1914, there were also similar restrictions. It should also be noted that the agreement to be concluded this time is not an agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but rather individual ties between Britain and France and the Soviet Union. After the above-mentioned treaty is concluded, a new alliance will also be established.

[Hai Agency, Moscow, 24th Dispatch] It was announced here today that Foreign Minister Potemkin will go to the Turkish capital within days. According to political sources, Soviet-Turkish negotiations have reached the final stage and an agreement will be established soon.

[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson left Britain this afternoon to return to Berlin. According to outside speculation, Henderson will not return to Berlin until next month. This move was unexpected. However, according to sources, there is no special political importance to Henderson's urgent return to Germany. It is heard that the French Ambassador to Germany will also return to Berlin in a few days.

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson was summoned back to China on the 10th of last month (i.e., after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia), and it has been over a month. A certain person in political circles recently commented that the British government has once again taken a appeasement move, and it is rumored that Germany has pulled back from the brink and is willing to adopt a negotiating approach rather than intimidation. However, Britain's intensified expansion of armaments and organization of collective security will not be weakened by this. Others said that the recall of Ambassador Henderson was to condemn Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Now that the government has decided to form a peace group in Europe in the hope of achieving a permanent solution, temporary measures, such as recalling ambassadors, are no longer necessary.

[London, 24th Dispatch] Foreign news, the diplomatic circles here are very concerned about the sudden return of British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson to Berlin. It is reported that Henderson was instructed by Chamberlain and Halifax to discuss matters in Berlin with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Henderson was summoned in the middle of last month to protest against Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. His return to Berlin this time, just before Hitler's speech on the 28th, has attracted particular attention from all parties. It is reported that Chamberlain and Halifax met with Henderson on Friday night and decided to send him back to Berlin on Saturday night.

### Britain Intensifies Shipbuilding; Cabinet Discusses Conscription Issue; Using Strength as a Backing for Negotiation

[Reuters, London, 24th] According to a report by the diplomatic correspondent of the 'Daily Telegraph', the Navy plans to lay the keels of twenty 900-ton escort vessels in June. These escort vessels are similar in size to the destroyers of the pre-European War era. They are the fastest, best-equipped, and most efficient among escort vessels, and are capable of withstanding attacks from submarines and aircraft. In order to expedite the shipbuilding process, the Navy plans to start construction on eight of the sixteen destroyers planned for this year. The construction of large warships is also being actively promoted. Including those under construction, those about to be built, and those already completed, the total tonnage of large warships exceeds 950,000 tons. Sixteen old-style cruisers and thirty-six destroyers have been modified by the Navy into escort vessels capable of defending against aircraft and submarines. The naval authorities are also adding eight new-style guns per month, mainly anti-aircraft guns. The production capacity of cannons has increased sixfold since 1936. Furthermore, in order to protect merchant ships, more than 2,000 heavy guns are stored in major ports to prepare for unforeseen events. The strength of the British Navy has broken the record since the Napoleonic Wars, it is said.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Cabinet will discuss the conscription issue tomorrow. A memorandum on the matter will be submitted to Cabinet members for review, but it is feared that a decision will be difficult to reach immediately. The Cabinet will also hear Simon's budget proposals. There is widespread concern that income tax will be increased, and sugar, tobacco, and tea will be presented as potential sources of increased revenue.

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon is scheduled to present the 1939-1940 budget to the House of Commons tomorrow. The defense expenditure is listed as £580 million, the highest amount ever for peacetime defense. The total annual budget is expected to be around £1.266 billion. Air Force expenditure is expected to be £208 million. War debt to the United States is not included in the budget.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The British Ambassador to France, Phipps, met with French Prime Minister Daladier this morning, and then with French Foreign Minister Bonnet in the afternoon. The 'Times' learned that the nature of the talks was the issue of Britain implementing compulsory conscription. This is a precautionary measure to ensure that Britain can immediately strengthen its military to cope with aggression when the situation requires. The report also stated that Chamberlain has now recognized that methods must be changed. Given past experience, all negotiations are ineffective without strength as a backing. The democratic countries' struggle for peace, like preparations for war, must rely on strength to achieve their policies.

### Le Havre, France Placed Under Martial Law in Dockyard Area to Prevent Sabotage by Terrorists

[Reuters, Le Havre, 23rd] The local authorities have received warnings that terrorists will carry out sabotage at several important locations in the port, especially oil docks and refineries. Therefore, the authorities have now prohibited people from approaching the dockyard area and have dispatched police to strictly protect important locations.

### British and Romanian Foreign Ministers Begin Talks; Romanian Foreign Minister Also Meets with Chamberlain; Business Negotiations to Be Held in Romania

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, after meeting with Romanian Ambassador to Paris Titulescu last night, departed for England and arrived at Victoria Station at 5:20 pm today. The Romanian Minister to Britain, Tilea, had gone to Folkestone in advance to greet him and accompany him to the station. British Foreign Secretary Halifax personally went to the station to welcome him. Also present were the ambassadors of Poland and Turkey, the Greek Minister to Britain, and many officials from the Romanian Embassy.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu went to the Foreign Office this morning to meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax and begin talks. The Romanian Foreign Minister will also go to the House of Commons this afternoon to meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain. Gafencu is accompanied by two secretaries, but no commercial experts. Commercial negotiations between Britain and Romania will begin on the 25th of this month in the Romanian capital. The British delegation led by Zeros is expected to arrive in the Romanian capital today. It is not known whether the Romanian Foreign Minister will meet with Trade Minister Stanley, but no formal consultations have been scheduled.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will visit British Foreign Secretary Halifax tomorrow morning and Prime Minister Chamberlain in the afternoon. At that time, Gafencu will present the progress of Romania's negotiations with Turkey, Poland, and the Balkan countries, along with Germany's attitude. Germany believes that Romania's joining an anti-aggression group is extremely undesirable and that Romania's closeness to Soviet Russia is more dangerous than aligning with Germany or Hungary. Germany is also prepared to provide guarantees for Romania's borders, as Britain has offered to Romania, but on the condition that Romania does not provide the same assistance to Britain.

### U.S. Imposes Increased Import Duties on German Goods

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The increased tariff on imports of German goods by the United States officially came into effect at noon on the 23rd. However, because the customs office is closed on Sunday mornings, the new tariff regulations were actually implemented starting at 1 p.m.

[Associated Press, New York, 23rd] Tanner Pabe, First Secretary of the German Embassy, gave a speech today, solemnly refuting that German trade development is detrimental to the trade of the United States and democratic countries, and that it is not connected with extending political influence to Latin American countries.

### Germany's Eyes Focus on Southeastern Europe; Attempting to Undermine the "Peace Front"; Italian-Yugoslav Negotiations Still Inconclusive

[Associated Press, Berlin, 23rd] It is reported that Hitler will mention the replies of various small countries to Germany's inquiries when he speaks to the German Parliament on the 28th. Reliable sources have not yet been able to confirm that Axis countries will hold negotiations in the coming days, including a military conference of generals from Germany, Italy, and Spain. It is also heard that Germany is now preparing a vigorous diplomatic campaign, especially focusing on Southeastern Europe, on the one hand, strengthening the position of totalitarian countries, and on the other hand, undermining the efforts of Britain and France to form a "peace front."

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] The Foreign Minister of Hungary is scheduled to visit here on the 26th of this month. The official here generally expresses great hope for this move, preparing to carry out the second step of the "Axis activities," planning to contact the Balkan countries and organize an "anti-encirclement group." Political circles believe that the participation of Hungary and Bulgaria should not be a problem, so they are stepping up efforts to win over Yugoslavia. Germany may explicitly inform the Yugoslav Foreign Minister that Germany is prepared to strongly support Italy's activities in the Adriatic Sea. At the same time, it has mentioned the issue of the German minority within Yugoslavia and the Karlovy Vary region, indicating that the issue is similar to that of Czechoslovakia and must be resolved. Sources in this country indicate that the Yugoslav Foreign Minister will still try to maintain neutrality and adopt an impartial attitude.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia apparently have not yet concluded a new agreement. Great attention is being paid to this here. It is generally believed that Yugoslavia is still hesitant to accept the proposals of the Axis countries. It is heard that the proposals are to withdraw Hungary's demands on Yugoslavia and guarantee Yugoslavia against German and Italian aggression, but with the following three conditions: (1) Yugoslavia joins the Anti-Comintern Pact; (2) Reorganize the Yugoslav army under the supervision of Germany and Italy; (3) Yugoslavia and Italy sign a commercial treaty.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, London believes that today's report on the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in Venice indicates a further step in the existing friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. Foreign observers believe that Yugoslavia's attitude is that the Axis countries' pressure on Yugoslavia is stronger than the guarantees provided by distant countries. Italy's emphasis on the Adriatic Sea and on maintaining Yugoslavia's integrity is sufficient to guarantee against possible oppression from the north. However, the widespread antipathy of the Yugoslav people towards the Axis countries cannot be ignored.

[Central News Agency, Venice, 23rd] The Yugoslav Foreign Minister departed for his country this afternoon and plans to visit Germany in the near future.

[Associated Press, Venice, 23rd] The two-day negotiations between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister have been completed. An official gazette was published today, stating that the South has formally united with the dictatorial countries. The gazette stated, "The Yugoslav government has agreed to strengthen cooperation with Germany and Italy in political and economic aspects, while maintaining friendly relations with Hungary. It is said that Ciano this time represents Germany and Italy, to establish a Balkan group, including Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Bulgaria.

[Associated Press, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] It is generally believed that the negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia in Venice will have the following results: (1) A line of countries in Eastern Europe and the Danube River basin; (2) Yugoslavia's future policy will be completely controlled by Italy. It is said that Yugoslavia will not participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact but has agreed to sign a friendly treaty with Hungary.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 24th] The agency views the results of the talks between the Italian and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers in Venice as a victory for the Axis countries, creating a further success in tearing apart the encirclement policy.

### Ambassador Guo's Speech: We Are Determined to Fight Resolutely; Thompson Sympathizes with Our Soldiers and Asks for Donations of a Large Number of Military Uniforms

[Reuters, London, 24th] Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi said in a speech at the meeting of the Manchester China Relief Committee today, "I believe that in a year's time, whether or not an international war occurs, we will see signs of a peaceful resolution in the Far East, because the European democratic countries have begun to resist aggression. Chamberlain has declared that the countries in the anti-aggression front include China. President Roosevelt has ordered the US fleet to sail to the Pacific, and the Japanese people have also begun to loathe war. However, the Japanese warlords have not yet abandoned their attempt to conquer China, and the Chinese people must redouble their efforts and continue to resist." The secretary of the China Relief Committee, Thompson, said that every advance or retreat of the Chinese army will cause great suffering. He has appealed to all sectors to donate 50,000 sets of military uniforms by the end of this month and has now completed it. Manchester has donated 17,000 sets. He has now again appealed for donations of 50,000 sets of military uniforms.

### British Warships Patrol Eastern Mediterranean; Gibraltar Officials Announce Ban on Export of Certain Grains

[Associated Press, Malta, 24th] Local officials announced that three battleships, two cruisers, two aircraft carriers, and twenty-six destroyers have been ordered to leave here on Wednesday. Officials refer to this action as a "routine summer patrol" in the eastern Mediterranean.

[Reuters, Malta, 23rd] Officials announced that several squadrons of the Mediterranean Fleet will leave here on Wednesday for a patrol in the eastern Mediterranean, including the First Battle Squadron (except for the battleship 'Ramillies'), the First Cruiser Squadron (except for the 'Sussex'), the aircraft carrier 'Glorious,' and three small destroyers.

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 24th] It has been announced here that the export of certain grains is prohibited, except for those with export licenses, to ensure that there are various essential grains available for supply at all times.

### Britain and the United States Coexist and Prosper Together; Halifax Broadcasts to the United States, Wishing Success to the New York World's Fair

[Reuters, London, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Halifax broadcast a speech to the United States today, wishing the New York World's Fair success. He said, "Ladies and gentlemen, in terms of material things, the people of Britain and the United States can coexist and prosper together. British prosperity is also American prosperity, and the United States is Britain's greatest customer, so American prosperity is also British prosperity. This exhibition will surely promote the truth." Halifax also invited Americans to visit Britain in his speech, saying that as soon as they step on British soil, they will feel the unity of the British people's determination to preserve the traditional free system and everything necessary for life, and that Britain is now engaged in strengthening itself.

### Tehran, Iran Decorated with Lights and Colors to Celebrate the Crown Prince's Wedding

[Reuters, Tehran, 23rd] The Crown Prince of Iran's marriage to the Egyptian Princess has led to four days of national celebrations starting yesterday. The national flags of Iran and Egypt are hung everywhere in the city, and arches are built at various intersections. At night, the city is brightly lit with electric lights, which is very lively. Tomorrow, the King of Iran will grant the newly married couple two newly built buildings, both of which are made of marble and are extremely exquisite.

Short Commentary

### Ms. Smedley's Call

Truth and justice are not to be taken lightly.

China's war of resistance against Japan is a war to protect truth and justice. Therefore, in this war, it has attracted hundreds and thousands of international people who cherish truth and justice, including communists, Christians, military and technical experts, journalists, and men and women of all races, fields, and classes.

They ran to China instead of Japan, and even those in Japan who cherished truth and justice ran to China, such as Mr. Rokuchi Kōichi and others, who are willing to work for China's liberation.

Ms. Smedley is just one of the hundreds and thousands of people who are willing to sacrifice and serve for China's war of truth and justice. However, Ms. Smedley's past efforts have been enough to make righteous people all over the world hear about it and be inspired. Ms. Smedley recently also sent a letter from the southeastern battlefield, concerning the situation of the New Fourth Army's soldiers who were bravely fighting but were wounded and had no one to rescue them, to the wife of the Director of Hygiene in Hong Kong, Yongjue, appealing to Western doctors living in comfort to temporarily put down their comfort and go to rescue thousands of wounded soldiers fighting for truth and justice. Ms. Smedley shouted loudly:

Chinese Western doctors and foreign Western doctors, these people (Chinese soldiers), for the sake of human culture's life, do not seek fame, do not seek profit, and go to the front line to fight and die without any welcome or farewell. Are you really not helping? Can you not be disturbed by nightmares at night? Don't you feel ashamed when you look in the mirror? If these people are defeated, can you have no fear for the future of you and your descendants?

We Chinese compatriots who are spared the gunfire and live under the influence of foreigners! Our Chinese doctors and nurses! Can we not be moved by Ms. Smedley's appeal? We dare to use Ms. Smedley's words with ardent enthusiasm to appeal to everyone:

"Please temporarily put down your lack of love and go to the front line in China, where you can deal with various problems, various difficulties, and various painful things, fight for justice, and take care of the brave men who die for your sons and your country. Don't leave a shameful mark in national history!"

All men and women who love truth and justice all over the world, even within the × country of Japan, do not hesitate to travel thousands of miles to the battlefield in China to serve the Chinese war. Can it be that we Chinese compatriots ourselves are willing to live under the influence of foreigners in a timid and shameless manner? At the same time, we want to ask, foreign newspapers have published in large print the articles of Ms. Smedley and other righteous people calling for aid for Chinese soldiers. Could it be that our own Chinese newspapers indifferently and shamelessly throw these calls for justice and humanity into the wastebasket?

Don't you feel ashamed?

Truth and justice are calling out to you!

### No War in Europe

— Dong Ping

To understand Chamberlain's lack of resolve, look at his two declarations: "If any action occurs at this time that threatens Poland's independence, and the Polish government believes it must resist with all its strength, the British government will immediately provide Poland with assistance." "For all actions that clearly threaten the independence of Greece or Romania, and the governments of Greece or Romania believe that they must resist with all their strength, the Imperial Government will consider it a treaty of mutual assistance with Greece or Romania."

Isn't that very clear? What Britain and France guarantee is only the "independence" of Poland, Greece, and Romania, and only if the "government" of that country "believes it must resist with all its strength."

Later, French Foreign Minister Bonnet stated that "territorial integrity" was also included in the guarantee in addition to "independence." But he still said: "If Germany attacks Danzig, Poland will resist with all its strength. We will immediately aid Poland." But how does one determine "resisting with all its strength"?

We admit that the British and French declarations did shatter Germany and Italy's "extortion and aggression" attempts, but they also opened a door of convenience for Germany and Italy: "diplomatic aggression."

Due to the restrictions of the British and French declarations, Germany and Italy did not "attack" by force, but changed to diplomatic aggression. Therefore, Italy and Hungary, Italy and Greece, Germany and Hungary, Germany and Yugoslavia have all had talks. Even the Associated Press reported that Germany and Poland had reached an understanding and were prepared to return Danzig to Germany.

If the Axis powers use "diplomatic aggression" and gain significant gains, I don't know how Chamberlain will issue another declaration to save this mistake.

Therefore, we agree with Major Attlee's words that this declaration is too weak. Why is it so weak? In the end, it is because Chamberlain's group fears war.

IV

It has been made very clear above that whether democratic countries or Axis countries, psychologically and traditionally, fundamentally fear war and have not yet reached the point of resolving to resort to force. Now, we are willing to provide two reasons in diplomacy, military preparedness, and the general situation why the walls cannot be torn down and a duel cannot be started.

First, let's talk about the Axis countries. The most obvious, we list five points

First, we understand very well that after the Treaty of Versailles, Britain, France, and the United States were countries that maintained the status quo, while Germany and Italy were countries that attempted to break the status quo. But there are too many ways to break the status quo. Germany and Italy avoided the important and chose the light, abandoning war and using intimidation. After repeated trials and validations, to this day, because democratic countries have the resolution to unite and use force to stop aggression, Germany and Italy can still use intimidation or new "diplomatic aggression" to achieve their ambitions. They must not risk war.

Second, even if we take a step back, if the democratic countries are determined to resist, then Germany and Italy's tricks of intimidation and diplomatic aggression will naturally not work. But will they fight hard? No, definitely not. We believe that if Germany and Italy had been fighting for land in 1935, they would never do it now. They have already increased a lot of land. The current territory of Germany and Italy is much larger than in 1914. The power of Germany has opened up a new epoch in history. We can say that Germany and Italy have now reached a point where they can almost be conservative. At least, we believe that Germany and Italy have no intention of quickly giving away the large amount of land and interests they have painstakingly gained in the war.

Third, the military strength of the Axis powers is not as good as that of the democratic countries, which is an important reason why Germany and Italy do not dare to fight rashly. Although Germany and Italy have tried their best to prepare in recent years, they are still difficult to make great progress due to financial resources, manpower, and resources. According to the statistics in January 1939, the military strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan was four-fifths of that of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. And the poor resources in particular cannot support a long-term war. But if a war breaks out, the war must be long-term and costly.

Fourth, the failure to fully develop the anti-communist front has made Germany and Italy often worry about their rear. The first is Japan. Although it has signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, because of the war in China, after falling into a quagmire, Hiranuma recently said in a cautious tone: "Japan does not belong to democratic countries, nor does it belong to totalitarian countries." It has officially withdrawn from Germany and the Soviet Union's stage. Germany and Italy have also politely declined Japan's request for a military alliance. This makes Germany and Italy have to hesitate a little before launching a war.

Fifth, Germany and the newly occupied colonies, Czechoslovakia and Albania, and even Abyssinia and Australia, although occupied by Hitler and Mussolini in one fell swoop, are full of internal hidden crises and naturally require a long period of reorganization. Before this work is completed, Germany and Italy will not act rashly.

Now, here are the reasons why the democratic countries are reluctant to fight. We list the three most obvious points:

(1) The democratic countries' wartime preparations have not been completed. Britain and France have been too lax since the war. Because of the national praise of peace, their military preparedness has been very lax. The two countries' first-line troops combined are not as good as Germany's. The worst is the air force, which is too far behind the Axis countries. Combined, they are less than half of Germany and Italy's. Chamberlain and Daladier, looking at the beautiful prosperity of London and Paris, how can they be willing to suffer losses in the present? They can only delay time, waiting desperately to catch up.

(2) The attitude of the United States is a major guide for the actions of the main countries. Although Roosevelt issued a proposal, it was just empty talk and a way to gain fame and reputation. He has no determination to provide real assistance to the democratic countries. Therefore, for Britain and France to stand up and fight, the United States must show a full attitude.

(3) The cooperation of the Soviet Union is even more important. We know that Britain's deeply rooted traditional policy is not to associate with the Soviet Union. ××××××, it would rather see the pure freedom on the British Isles than see the Bolsheviks raise their eyebrows. Now, the situation is pressing, and Britain and the Soviet Union are conducting negotiations and have concluded them satisfactorily. However, what the future holds and how true cooperation will be realized, we can only wait and see! Without the cooperation of the Soviet Union, the democratic countries will not be able to stand up.

V

Now, many people are vigorously promoting that a great war is about to break out, saying: "The Second World War is inevitable, and when it will break out is only a matter of time." We do not deny this sentence. So-called "one time" is it a matter of days, months, or years?

Our opinion is: There will be no war in Europe this year, 1939. (End)

### Frequent Tragedies in Jin Tian Refugee Camp; Refugees List Facts of Abuse; Police Chief Inspector Discusses Reality of Camp Staff Beating Pregnant Women; Camp Rules Strictly Prohibit Corporal Punishment, Violators Will Be Strictly Investigated

Regarding the frequent tragedies occurring in the Jin Tian Refugee Camp, all the refugees have separately sent letters to the Chinese and Western Emergency Committee and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce,訴 expressing their experiences and requesting a thorough investigation of the perpetrators and their punishment. Chinese representatives Sir Robert Ho Tung and barrister Lo Man Kam, as well as Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. Cary, have expressed extreme concern upon hearing this news and are conducting a thorough investigation. These matters have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. The reporter, therefore, made a special visit to the Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Sze To Wing-kwok, to inquire about the truth of the case. He agreed to give a statement detailing the course of events. Furthermore, all the refugees in the Jin Tian Refugee Camp, in order to inform the public about what has happened and to seek assistance, have issued an appeal to all sectors of society. The text is over a thousand words long, and every word is filled with sorrow. It is recorded below for the readers to observe separately.

Sze To Wing-kwok Issues Statement

According to Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Sze To Wing-kwok, told the reporter that managers had indeed illegally beaten refugees, but the claim that someone was beaten to death was unfounded. According to his investigation, the truth is that because the Jin Tian Refugee Camp is entirely made of sunflower sheds, camp regulations strictly prohibit smoking and private cooking, fearing a careless fire that could endanger the lives of four thousand refugees in the camp. The tragic fire in Ma Tau Twenty years ago could easily be repeated. A few days ago, a camp manager discovered a refugee woman cooking medicine in a windy place, and immediately stopped her and informed her of the camp's prohibitions. As a result, a dispute arose between the two parties. The manager, in a moment of anger, disregarded the law and beat the woman's back with a cane. He was subsequently dismissed from his position by the authorities. The woman later left the camp and reported the incident to the Yau Ma Tei Police Station.

Beaten Pregnant Woman Shows Bruises

She then returned to the camp and went to the medical clinic to ask a nurse to examine her injuries. It was found that there were indeed bruises on her back, but they were very minor and would not have serious consequences. A few days later, the woman left the camp and returned to her hometown. The truth about the second unfortunate event is that麻包 sacks in the emergency refugee camp were discovered to have been stolen. The refugee who stole them was caught and sent to a senior officer for review. Later, a camp manager beat the refugee and then released him. The manager was also dismissed for this. A few days later, the refugee also left the camp and returned to his hometown. There are currently eight hundred refugees living in Jin Tian. The authorities have advised them to return to their hometowns and provided them with three days' worth of food for the journey. However, they are reluctant to leave. If there were indeed cases of abuse in the camp, they would have left as quickly as possible. Why would they linger? The chief administrator of the Jin Tian camp is a senior Chinese health official who is trusted by the authorities. The Emergency Relief Committee has also sent two officers to the camp to manage all welfare matters. Camp regulations strictly prohibit corporal punishment. If anyone receives complaints about the camp, they can report them to the camp administrator or the Director of Medical and Health Services, who will conduct a thorough investigation.

Barely Recovered, Yet Abused Again

An appeal to all sectors of society from all the refugees in the Jin Tian Refugee Camp: We are all very sorry that this time ××is rampant, leading beasts to invade the south, and successive fall of various places, and is extremely destructive. It is unspeakable what pain it is for the refugees who have no home to return to, are displaced and have nowhere to rely on. Fortunately, the Hong Kong government and our central government have shown mercy, and Chinese overseas and philanthropists in Hong Kong care about their homeland, are concerned about their hometown, which has suffered a great disaster, and have donated generously and enthusiastically to provide relief, and have set up places to take us in, so that our thousands of victims can rest and avoid freezing, starving, and being exposed to the elements. The refugees are all grateful for the benefits they have received and sing praises of virtue. Therefore, we are lodging in Jin Tian refugees, meaning that we rely on food and accommodation and settle down temporarily. But after the shock of the soul, we are met with endless pain, grace is received from the top, but abuse is inflicted from below, which is unusually cruel. The managers in the camp are worse than prison guards. Although there is no lack of food and accommodation, the torture is worse than that of prisoners, causing the refugees to act abnormally, and both laughing and crying are sins. Recently, it has become more and more fierce, such as mean abuse, cruel tyranny, all kinds of actions, it is impossible to list them all. We have selected a few things below, please note for future investigation

Pregnant Women About to Give Birth Beaten Mercilessly

Donated clothing, etc., has seen thousands upon thousands, except for the severe winter, when a portion of the Huo ones were selectively distributed, the remainder is still a lot, but those who came later have not been given a shred, but its storage is full of warehouses, and its intention is not announced, and nothing has been said about sending people out to other places, but whether it is sold at auction is unknown, the meanness of its actions is one of them, a month ago, a female refugee, Ms. Tan, who was many months pregnant, was about to give birth, because she was far outside the camp to boil medicine, thinking it was a case of helping with the delivery in advance, because our countrywomen adhere to old habits, which is not unreasonable, but the person in charge, seeing the woman's actions, chased after her and destroyed the medicine and cooking utensils, and the woman followed her crying, so she was angry, and her ferocity broke out suddenly, and she beat the pregnant woman, causing injuries all over her body, and later she only gave her a dollar, and the woman did not agree to accept it, so she went out of the camp, and they let her go, and after returning to her hometown, the woman died in the womb due to her injuries, and the woman died with her, and it was a tragedy that was never seen before, if you are so cruel, the cruelty of the wolf, this is the second,

Why Is Cooking Medicine Different? Punches and Kicks Are Thrown

The daily two meals in the refugee camp can fill the stomach, but it is inevitable that some cannot finish the meal, but women occasionally buy a little salted fish to supplement it, or if they are not feeling well, they can use soup and medicine to adjust it, but most of the people in the countryside advocate national medicine, and there is no Chinese medicine equipment in the camp, and it is difficult for the refugees to spend money, and they go outside the camp to buy and use it, and they cook it themselves in the open space, which is the most proper action, but the person in charge does not give convenience, and when they see it, they beat and kick them, and they break the medicine utensils, and if they ask for mercy, they use sticks to block them, and the most pitiful thing is that the old, young, women and children all suffer, and the cruelty of their abuse is the third

Accused of Stealing Lunch, Group Beating

Now, it has become more and more common to recommend it, to check that there are many people with good and bad things in the camp, which is a common example of natural selection, and on March 29, at 9 p.m., the refugee Yang Cai, who had not been familiar with the crime, was accused of taking a small hidden bag, and the person in charge of the office did not ask for proof, and the group of people beat him violently, and for a while, punches and kicks were thrown, and he was beaten to the point of serious injury and vomited blood, and they still did not stop, and continued to beat him, and then drove him out, and it was heard that he died near Jin Tian Village, and died due to his injuries, and this kind of action, the use of torture, and the murder of people is cruel, and its wolfishness is more cruel than × people, this is the fourth,

Toes High and Imposing Will

To check that the staff in the camp, most of them are careless, frivolous and violent, disregard morality, are poor and mean, and do not know what the country and nation are, so they are arrogant, and regard the refugee camp as their ancestral hall property, and for the sake of relief, they all have to look up to them and be happy with them, and their toes are high and imposing, which is even more official, and in their minds they think that refugees are local hooligans and rotten, and they arbitrarily impose their lewd power, In fact, they are only servants in front of our refugees, and their personality and status are not related to our good refugees at all, and as for their actions, this is the fifth, the above few points, the facts are all there, the refugees dare to ask for conscience, and they are confident that there is no deception or fabrication, but the group is angry and cannot be silent, and they are forced to express their feelings, and the rights and wrongs are clear, and the Chinese officials from all walks of life should be able to discern, and they hope that all the officials will be able to discern and pity our refugees who have suffered a catastrophe, and pity our refugees who are displaced and give them improved treatment, so that they can correct their wrongdoing, and this is what we are asking for, All the refugees in Jin Tian Refugee Camp are respectfully,

### Melville, a Strong British Man Stationed with the Chinese Navy, Appointed Commander of the Fifth Fleet; Rear Admiral Holland in Charge of Yangtze River Naval Affairs; Commanders of British and American Fleets Meet in Hong Kong

In view of the dangerous situation in the Far East, the British naval authorities have not only dispatched more warships to the East to assist in defense and strengthen their naval strength, but have also recently appointed Rear Admiral Melville as Commander of the Fifth Fleet of the Chinese Navy, in order to share the burden of Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Noble. Rear Admiral Holland, the original rear admiral commander, is responsible for British naval affairs on the Yangtze River. It is understood that Rear Admiral Melville was originally the head of the British Royal Naval Signals School and only became a flag officer this spring. In the North Russian campaign of 1919, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his special merits. In addition, Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, went to Nanyang for inspection and returned to Hong Kong on the morning of the 6th of last month aboard his flagship HMS Kent. HMS Encounter, which went to Singapore to participate in the war, also returned to Hong Kong with him. It is reported that Admiral Noble returned to Hong Kong this time to meet with Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the American Fleet in the Far East. It is said that the two men discussed general issues in the Far East when they met in Hong Kong.

### Murder Case in Lok Ma Chau; Huang Jinyun Sentenced to Death Yesterday; Barrister Luo Dongxun's Vigorous Defense Ineffective; Jurors Unanimously Say Defendant Guilty

Late at night on January 4 of this year, a tragic incident occurred in a thatched cottage in the Akau area of Lok Ma Chau in the New Territories. Huang Zhong (41 years old), a refugee who fled from Bao'an County to Hong Kong, and his wife Wu Shenliang (37 years old) were brutally murdered. His son, Huang Jiu (11 years old), was also injured. Afterwards, the two murderers fled without a trace. It was not until March 19 that the police authorities arrested the suspected murderer Huang Jinyun at the Guangming Theatre in Yau Ma Tei and charged him with the crime of murdering Huang Zhong. The case continued yesterday morning in the High Court, presided over by Judge McGilligan, who summoned seven jurors: Dama Na (chief), Chen Zhixing, Li Jinchun, He Jinsheng, Feng Zeliu, Zhong Dexiang, and Guo Fen. Deputy Crown Counsel Wyatt prosecuted. After the court opened, the defendant Huang Jinyun took the stand to testify. Then Deputy Crown Counsel Wyatt stood up to make a statement to the jurors. The defendant's defense lawyer, Luo Dongxun, stood up to address the jurors, saying that he hoped the jurors would not find any suspicious points in the case before judging the defendant guilty. He cited facts to defend the defendant. At around 3 p.m., the jurors retired to deliberate for a long time. They then returned and unanimously found the defendant guilty. The judge then sentenced the defendant to death.

### Hong Kong Authorities Promote Prosperity in the Peninsula; Allocate Funds to Build New Roads; Extend Argyle Street Directly to Kowloon City Saigon Road; Major Landowners Invest in Building New Buildings in the Area

The Kowloon Peninsula will become prosperous in the future. Various constructions have been improved step by step. In terms of transportation, the most important thoroughfare is Nathan Road. However, due to the recent surge in population, traffic in Kowloon is extremely congested and road development is indeed necessary. The government authorities have also paid attention to this. Recently, it has been decided to build a new road plan, with a construction cost of 50,000 yuan. Construction has now begun. The new road starts from Argyle Street and extends to Kowloon City Saigon Road. The road leads to Kowloon

Prosperous Areas

Its importance is only second to Nathan Road. After the road is completed, Kowloon City, Kai Tak, Upper Prince Edward Road, and Customs Pass will be connected to Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei by this road. The road surface is wide enough to accommodate four cars. After the road is completed, the traffic between Nathan Road and the eastern part of Kowloon Peninsula will be faster than it is now. At the same time, the car traffic on Chatham Road and Prince Edward Road will not be as congested as it is now. The new route starts from London Road, follows Waterloo Road to Argyle Street, and goes directly to Kowloon City. It is understood that after the completion of the newly built road, the current bus route to Prince Edward and Kowloon City will

Bus Routes

At least two routes will be changed to Argyle Street. One is from the Yau Ma Tei pier to Kowloon City, and the other is from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon City. To continue building Argyle Street to Kowloon City, the small mountain next to Saigon Road must be completely removed. The mud and stones from the mountain have now begun to be excavated and used to fill the beach opposite the Kowloon City Police Station. The development of the Argyle Street area has resulted in the addition of countless new buildings in the eastern part of Waterloo Road. It is said that the tycoon Yu Dongxuan has built 36 new houses there, and the Humphreys Estate Company has also built 18. Across the road is the address of the Kowloon Hospital expansion site. The new buildings of the Li Long Hospital will be built this year, and a mental hospital will be built next to it.

### A Glimpse of Shek Kip Mei Village

— Yu Wan

Who says that a civilized city does not contain a backward village?

In contrast - since this is a majestic and brilliant golden island, why should there be a simple and humble village?

- This village is Shek Kip Mei Village, which the locals call Hakka Village. Next to the Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po, on the back side of a row of streamlined Western houses and villas; on the wide Pak Pu Road, a small path full of rubble diverges; in the brightly lit night, a pile of crooked and overturned houses are revealed.

Originally, there are several "villages" of different sizes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. There is Tai Hang Village in Causeway Bay, and Hakka Village in Castle Peak Road. Besides, are Kowloon City and Diamond Hill not tribal villages? However, here - Shek Kip Mei Village, the impression it gives people is not so simple and vague!

Due to the narrow space and dense population, the houses are small and the eaves are low. In front, there is a muddy ditch full of sweat, and due to the accumulation of feces and the vertical and horizontal pig pens... people are reminded of the concept of "hell on earth" as soon as they step into the village.

Days and nights of wind and rain have swept clean the long streets of the bustling city - however, the entire Shek Kip Mei Village has been swept away by wind and rain, covered with sand and broken countless short trees and low eaves - the fences, their only short bamboos, the pig pens, their only dry stakes, I am afraid that they have been destroyed without leaving anything behind - the suffering of the villagers is what they are like in the eyes of the pleasure-seekers!

The village is piled up and crowded, with about 300 or more families squeezed in. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the farmers here only planted flowers, watered vegetables, and raised pigs and chickens. They worked at sunrise and sunset, renting one or two acres of "rural land" from the "Royal Family", building wooden houses and sheds, and diligently planting flowers and vegetables, and raising pigs and chickens to meet the daily needs of food and miscellaneous grains. There were only one or two small shops selling "groceries and pastries" in the village. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, there were many refugees from the mainland, so the refugees who could not be accommodated in the Western houses began to explore like Columbus. After three to five months, the ladies wearing modern cheongsams were discovered here; Western furniture, which was originally to be placed in Western rooms, was moved in quite a bit. Half a year later, due to the fall of Guangzhou, a large number of refugees from the war zone fled here like bees, and the farmers who had been washed by the city also had to take the opportunity to ask for money. Therefore, the walls at the entrance of the village were already covered with signs saying "Rural Houses for Rent"... Now, let alone the girls in cheongsams, our noble gentlemen actually come in and out of the small mud houses. Architects, they rely on land for food, and they produce a cause and effect of "price" and "value" under the abacus, so they resolutely take the money to buy flat land here to build wooden buildings. Rent or sell, they have created several streets in the backward countryside in a month and a half - what "Yongsheng Lane" and "Kangning Lane". Whether the land is expensive because of people or people are expensive because of land, Shek Kip Mei Village now has a sewing factory with ten or so sewing machines and a wooden shop making rosewood furniture...

However, alas! The refugees are ultimately at their wits' end. In the clear autumn or even the cold and dry winter, they may be able to survive in the forest of "pigs" and "chickens". However, in today's misty spring rain, especially in the last ten days or so, during the storms, the humid atmosphere of the village head, mixed with the steaming stench of pigs and chickens; the sewage ditch of the village. The washing of the people in the sewage ditch... By the time the sultry summer night comes, the scene of mosquitoes gathering into thunder, the suffering of the lives of the people living here can be said to be completely exposed in hell on earth.

Tourists to Kowloon's Cow Island, if you happen to walk near the streets of the village and it happens to be a sunny day, you may imagine a idyllic village like Utopia. However, this is not the case: the village in the big city has no vitality. Besides the rice porridge and side dishes that are carried in loads from restaurants and tea houses every morning, what else do the villagers of Shek Kip Mei communicate with the city?

### Tour Guide Industry Booming; Tour Guide Agencies Suddenly Increase to Over a Hundred; Number of Tour Guide Girls Exceeds a Thousand

The tour guide business in Hong Kong has been booming recently. There are no less than a hundred tour guide agencies in Central, Sheung Wan, and other places. The number of tour guide girls in this profession is also over a thousand. The business is quite good. However, due to business relations, it has been condemned by society. People in the tour guide business have presented this problem to the authorities, requesting permission to register and establish a tour guide association to develop the business. It is understood that the petition has been submitted to the Hong Kong authorities for more than ten days, but it has not yet been approved. According to semi-official news yesterday, the Hong Kong authorities are still studying the issue of whether to abolish or retain these tour guide agencies. Therefore, the approval is still pending. However, most opinions advocate the need for existence, but it is necessary to establish regulations to restrict out-of-line behavior. Those who violate this rule will be punished.

### Bloodshed in Tea House; Deputy Crown Counsel Wyatt States That Defendant's Family Was Brutally ××; Received News from Home That They Were Tragically Killed; Uncle and Younger Brother Murdered, Aunt Raped

The case was heard yesterday afternoon at the High Court by Judge McGilligan, who summoned seven jurors: Wessica (chairman), Johnson, Won, Walker, Sousa, Goula, and Chen Jintao. Deputy Crown Counsel Wyatt prosecuted. The defendant was represented by solicitor Palama, who deferred to barrister Sielton. After the court opened, the prosecuting lawyer

Stated the Case

Briefly stating that the defendant was a partner in the tea house, receiving a monthly salary of four new yuan, and also owning 75 yuan of shares in the store, so he was also one of the shareholders. At around 7 p.m. on the day of the incident, his younger brother, Li Rong, brought a letter to the defendant. The letter was from his aunt, asking the defendant to send two or thirty yuan back to his hometown for household expenses and for his travel expenses to Hong Kong. When his fellow villager handed the letter to his younger brother, he had told him that the defendant's uncle and younger brother in the village had already been

Japanese ××

His aunt was also raped by the Japanese. Li Rong also took the opportunity to tell the defendant when he handed the letter to his brother. The defendant was extremely angry after hearing this bad news. At 11 p.m. that evening, a Japanese person came to the store for supper. At that time, the defendant was working downstairs. The case then occurred. The defendant entangled with the Japanese person to the oil chicken table. The defendant grabbed the oil chicken knife and forcefully slashed at the deceased. Customer Yang Shaoqi saw this and immediately stepped forward to stop him. The defendant said, "This person has slaughtered and raped my family, so I am retaliating. Don't panic. I will go to surrender immediately," and so on. Then he alone

Went to Report to the Police

On the way, he met a police officer and was taken back to the police station to file a case. The government doctor, Carney, then took the stand to testify. Finally, the photographer testified about going to the scene of the incident to take photos. The court ordered that the case be adjourned until 10 a.m. this morning for further hearing.

### Foreign Residents; Have Not Yet Enthusiastically Registered; Only Two-Tenths of the Total Number Have Registered; Authorities Issue Warnings to Register Quickly

It has been a month since Hong Kong held the registration of foreign residents. The original deadline was May 31, but only 1,490 foreign residents have registered so far. According to the authorities' expectations, the number of registered persons should reach 10,000. Compared with the number of registered persons, this number is only 20%, which is very far apart. The registration office is surprised to see the indifference of male foreign residents in Hong Kong to registering quickly. According to an employee of the office, most of the registration forms that have been filled out and returned are filled out incorrectly. The questions in the form must be answered positively. The office has now issued a warning that registration is an obligation of foreign residents and must be fulfilled. Those who do not register after May 31 will be severely punished. If the number of registered persons can fill out the forms and return them to the registration office as soon as possible, it will be easier for the office to organize them. Please ask major stores and foreign firms to ask their staff to fill out the forms as soon as possible.

### Little Water Obtained by Reservoirs During Heavy Rain; Full-Day Water Supply Still Pending; Weekly Rainfall Reaches 250 Million Tons, But Reservoir Water Collection Is Only One Eighty-First

The continuous heavy rains last week, during this period of water shortage, provided much-needed relief, greatly benefiting residents' water supply. The water authorities will also extend the water supply hours by two hours daily. The general public believes that full-day supply will soon be further implemented, which is also likely to be realized. However, according to a report from the water authorities yesterday, despite the heavy rains last week, the reservoirs in Hong Kong only collected one-eightieth of the total rainfall. Since last autumn, Hong Kong has experienced a prolonged drought, and the soil is parched. Therefore, despite the heavy rain, most of it was absorbed, and only a very small amount flowed into the reservoirs. Thus, although it rained heavily for several days, the amount collected by the reservoirs depends on the dryness of the soil. Last week, the total rainfall was over six inches, weighing 250 million tons, but the amount collected by the reservoirs was only 63.9 million gallons, or 3 million tons. The remaining 247 million tons were either absorbed by the parched soil or flowed into the sea. As of last Friday, the water stored in Hong Kong was only 223.4 million gallons (approximately 10 million tons), a figure that only accounts for one-twenty-fifth of the rainfall from the 15th to the 21st of this month.

### Overview of Nanhua College; Decision to Establish School in Chaozhou and Meizhou to Develop Higher Education; President Zhong Luqi to Visit Nanyang Today for Investigation

School Tour

Facts tell us: Cultural education, as the foundation of a nation, is the main target to be destroyed by the × people. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, domestic universities have either been bombed or forced to relocate, causing professors and students to wander, and the life of higher education is in danger. Allowing it to be destroyed without construction, and watching it die without seeking rebirth, is a hidden worry for the nation. In order to relieve out-of-school youths, promote overseas Chinese education and culture, and create talents for the war of resistance and national reconstruction, Nanhua College came into being. Tracing back to the history of the school.

On the day after the anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction last year, three famous educators, Lei Binnan, Zhong Luqi, and Lei Tongqun, invited people from all walks of life to gather at the Confucius Hall to discuss the matter. At that time, 28 people including Ren Hongjun, Chen Hengzhe, Zhuang Zeyi, Huang Juemin, Chen Binhe, Chuan Shanglin, Zeng Youhao, and Wang Youjian attended. The result of the discussion was that it was necessary to establish an institution of higher education at this time and place. Famous people in the cultural and educational circles were invited to participate in the initiation and help support it. Therefore, research evolved into reality.

Starting a business is difficult, but with the board of directors generously donating huge sums of money, and President Dr. Zhong Luqi, Professor Lei Tongqun and others working hard, since the school started in the fall of last year, the school's progress has been steadily improving. The school is located in the beautiful natural environment of Lion Rock Road in Kowloon, which is also a good environment for nurturing talents. The current directors of the college are Wang Chonghui, Xie Guansheng, Wang Yunwu, Zeng Youhao, Qiu Gongye, Qiu Yuanrong, Qiu Jiping, Qiu Shen, Zeng Yangfu, Lei Peihong, and Gong Zihong. They are all very concerned about school affairs.

The current main faculty members are: Chairman and Professor Zeng Youhao, President Zhong Luqi, Professors Lei Tongqun, Cheng Jingyuan, Qiu Huajun, Huang Juemin, Li Bao, Cai Zhaoling, Lin Shiyan, Guo Butao, Li Weicheng, Fang Xiren, etc. Secretary and Library Director Wang Yongdai, they understand education and run education, and their spirit of hard work is admirable.

The college currently has three departments: Literature, Law, and Commerce, with a total of eleven departments with four years of graduation, and also offers special courses in Commerce, Political Science, Journalism, Teacher Training, and English, with two years of graduation. Starting from this semester, an affiliated middle school has also been opened, and the scale is gradually expanding.

The college has also decided to establish the main campus in Chaozhou and Meizhou in order to develop higher education in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas. The Hong Kong campus will serve as a branch campus, so that they can advance together. The Ministry of Education has expressed deep sympathy for the college's various facilities and has given encouragement. The filing procedures are said to have been completed.

President Dr. Zhong Luqi is scheduled to set off today to inspect overseas Chinese education in Batavia and the Nanyang Islands to facilitate the development of school affairs. The trip is expected to take place in February.

### Fierce Fighting on the Northern Front; Our Great Army Approaches from the South, Crossing Jiangcun; We Adopt a Strategy of Steady Progress, Advancing South Step by Step; × Bandits Routed in Conghua, Leaving Over Two Hundred Corpses

[Northern Jiang Quick Report] The counter-offensive on the northern front continues. Our army is adopting a steady and solid strategy, advancing south step by step. ×, plotting to defend Guangzhou to the death, is constantly reinforcing their troops and plotting against our rebel bandits, so the fighting has been fierce in recent days. The military situation is recorded as follows:

Our Position Consolidated in Front of Aotou and Lion

Since defeating the main force of the × army in Zengcong, the Liang Division of the 12th Army Corps captured important strongholds such as Shikeng Street in Conghua on the 18th, and then advanced along the highway, attacking Shentang and deploying strong positions in the areas of Shiqian Market, Ganhe Market, and Aotou Village northwest of Conghua to prevent the × army from breaking out or harassing. For several days, × has been under our army's control and has not taken any action. Recently, × has transferred more than 2,000 people from Guangzhou's Taihe City, distributing them to the areas of Taipingchang and Shentang. On the 19th, more than 300 × from Shentang crossed the river to harass Mumian Cliff, Mayazhuang, and Jiulianfen, and were intercepted and defeated by our Peng Division's strike team. On the 21st and 22nd, they sent out scouts to probe and search north, threatening to attack Conghua again.

× Bandits Suffer Another Crushing Defeat in Conghua

On the morning of the 22nd, more than a thousand × infantry, supported by several cannons, advanced along the Guangzhou-Conghua highway to attack Conghua. Our Liang Division sent out troops and engaged in fierce fighting with × in the area near Jiekou and Mumian south of Conghua. × used artillery fire to cover their advance and launched fierce attacks. We resisted and counterattacked, advancing and retreating repeatedly. × was unable to make progress. At noon, reinforcements from our army arrived and joined the battle, boosting morale and bravely killing ×. × could not withstand it and fled in the original direction. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue, and the × formation was in chaos, abandoning supplies along the way and retreating south in a panic. In this battle, over two hundred × were killed and over a hundred were wounded. Our army is currently searching forward.

Our Army Presses South in Xinjie

After our army recaptured Xinjie, it repelled the invading × army on the morning of the 21st. × corpses were scattered everywhere, and they retreated to Jiangcun. Our army took advantage of the victory to press Jiangcun and Gaotang. On the 22nd, it arrived at a certain place north of Jiangcun, surrounding and monitoring ×. A part of the elite troops took a detour along the Guanghua Line to attack Renhe Market. On the evening of the 22nd, a certain unit of our army cooperated with the guerrilla team of the Second District to launch a night attack on Jiangcun ×. They once rushed into Jiangcun, killing dozens of ×, but due to terrain limitations, they automatically withdrew to their original positions. Currently, a part of our vanguard troops has detoured past Jiangcun and is flanking Gaoceng and Dalang. The strike team in the northwestern suburbs of the city is also active, trying to contain the × army's communication. Once all the troops reach their destinations, they will launch a large-scale attack on ×.

### Fierce Fighting Still Rages in the Dongjiang; Our Forces Engaged in Bitter Fighting in Luofu Mountain; × Surrounded, Iwata Killed in Action; × Aircraft Wildly Bomb, Breaking a Wing

[Dongjiang Quick Report] In the Dongjiang battle, the contention between × and our forces is still fierce. Our army, backed by the Luofu Mountains, is utilizing mountain warfare and engaging in a stalemate with ×. There have been gains in recent days. The battle situation is recorded as follows:

Fierce Fighting Still Rages at the Foot of Luofu Mountain

On the 21st, × attempted to attack our army's position in Futian Luofu Mountain with more than 2,000 people. They were ambushed in Gongkeng and suffered losses. That night, they reinforced again. On the morning of the 22nd, approximately 2,000 people, a mix of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, supported by six or seven tanks and five aircraft, again attacked our army in Jigungkeng Futian. The attack was quite fierce. Our army calmly responded, and our artillery on Luofu Mountain also displayed its power, concentrating its fire on the target, and fiercely attacking ×. × was threatened by our artillery fire and could not advance an inch. According to military news from the front, × and our forces were still fighting fiercely in the Suzuo, Jigungkeng, and Futian areas at the foot of Luofu Mountain until dusk. × even set fire to rural villages in various places to prevent our army from advancing. On the same day, artillery fire was heard all day near Qishi and Masilongjiao on the south bank of the Dongjiang. The intensity of the battle can be imagined.

× Battalion Commander Iwata Killed in Action

Also, the day before, two regiments of our advance troops, in coordination with the Luo Fengxiang unit of the Third Guerrilla Column, pursued the Zeng ×, surrounded them, and annihilated more than 100 × infantry and cavalry. At that time, the × Battalion Commander Iwata Rokuro was surrounded in the center and could not escape. He was shot and killed. We also seized a batch of × army bullets and guns. On the night of the 22nd, our headquarters, in coordination with the guerrilla team of the Third District, launched a night attack on the × camp in Zhenghe Market northwest of Zengcheng. When they arrived outside the kiln, they lit a fire as a signal. With a command, they attacked from all sides, rushed into the market center, and engaged in fierce fighting with ×. Our army and the guerrillas fought × with broadswords and hand grenades. After about 40 to 50 minutes of fighting, they retreated in different directions along the original route. The night attack was also a great victory, annihilating nearly a hundred × and seizing much.

× Aircraft Wildly Bomb Futian and Suzuo

In this counterattack on Zengcheng, the × army, in addition to relying on its mechanized troops, also relied on its aircraft to bombard our rear and positions in large quantities. After wildly bombing Boluo County on the 18th, at 9 a.m. on the 19th, three × aircraft flew from Longmen and circled over Luofu, dropping 30 large bombs in succession. On the 20th and 21st, three to nine × aircraft also took turns bombing the Luofu Mountain Suzuo area, dropping 40 to 50 bombs. The area at the foot of Luofu Mountain and Jigungkeng were the most heavily bombed, but many bombs fell on the wasteland, and we suffered no losses. It is reported that when the × aircraft attacked Luofu Mountain, our artillery counterattacked with accurate fire. One aircraft had a wing broken off by our fire and descended rapidly, almost crashing to the ground. Then, after tumbling a few times, it limped toward Guangzhou.

### Our Two-Pronged Counterattack on Xinhui; Rumors that Jiangmen Has Been Recaptured; We Use Mobile Warfare to Exhaust the × Army; Guerrillas Cross the River at Night and Set Fires in Response

[Zhongshan Quick Report] After our army systematically withdrew from Jiangmen Huicheng, it has been taking steady steps and using mobile warfare tactics to exhaust the × army. After several weeks of entanglement with ×, × has become exhausted. On the 23rd, our army defeated the × in Huicheng, and rushed into Jiangmen that night. Yesterday, the 24th, news of victory came from Sanbu, saying that our army had recaptured Jiangmen on the 24th, and the remaining × were being swept away. The battle situation is as follows:

Two-Pronged Counterattack

On the 19th, the Jiangfu Road army advanced towards Jiangmen from Tangxia Duruang Jinggen. At the same time, a part of the army was sent out to bypass the new highway and pounced on Shuanglong Tianshang. The × army there only had about 300 people, and its strength was very weak. After being pressured by our army, it retreated to Jiushe after a little resistance. As for Huicheng, after × reinforced from Daliang on the 19th, on the 21st, they sent out more than a thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with 13 tanks and armored vehicles as the vanguard, and launched a fierce counterattack on our army's position from Gangzhou Road. More than ten × aircraft circled and bombed. Our army held the position in the Jinniu Mountain area and engaged in a stalemate with ×, fighting fiercely for two days and nights. On the morning of the 23rd, a large number of our fresh troops arrived and launched a brave attack, defeating ×.

Rumors of Recapturing Jiangmen

Our army took advantage of the victory and continued to advance towards Jiangmen. In the evening, the Jiangfu and Gangzhou armies arrived at the Jianghui Station and Fanluo Zini in the suburbs of Jiangmen. Until late at night, the guerrillas of the Fifth District secretly crossed the river from Hetou, rushed into Jiangmen, and set fires as a signal. Our armies on the outskirts of the city then gradually entered the urban area. The × army was suddenly caught in the fire, and the order was in chaos. Our army bravely charged and killed until dawn. On the 24th, news came from Sanbu that our army had recaptured Jiangmen, and the remaining × were being forced outside Haiwai Street, and a sweep was underway.

### Xinhui Refugees Talk; The Plight of Young Men, Women, and Children in Jianghui Under × Military Rule Is Miserable; Puppets of the Maintenance Society Take to the Stage

After Jiangmen in Xinhui fell, our military and civilians are now holding positions against the × in the Shadi Zishui Duyuandai area, launching counter-offensives against Jiangmen and Huicheng day after day, causing the × to run ragged. However, in this battle of Jiangmen, the civilians and local defense forces bravely participated and dealt a heavy blow to ×. × harbors a deep resentment towards our civilians and is extremely ×× towards the villagers of Xinhui. Yesterday, a villager from Makeng Township in the Eighth District of Xinhui escaped to Hong Kong and gave reporters a detailed account of the situation in Xinhui and Jiangmen under × military rule, which is recorded as follows:

Refugees Arriving in Hong Kong Talk About ×× at Noon

The villager said that since Jiangmen Huicheng fell, the local defense forces have resisted, and we have nothing more to say. However, the responsible authorities were too calm and negligent, resulting in significant losses for merchants and civilians. In particular, the grain stored in the righteous granary and the rice in various rice shops were not moved in time, resulting in the greatest loss. As a result, there is a great rice shortage in various villages in Xinhui today. Rice is sold for a mere catty per dollar, which is a very serious situation. After the × army occupied Huicheng, they are now stationed in the Dasha Mountain, Xiangshan, and Mashan areas, and have built an artillery position on Da Yun Mountain, with six or seven cannons, indiscriminately shelling the surrounding villages. Because the palm leaf fan piles near the city obstruct their line of sight, they have burned all the fan piles in Huicheng, causing the palm leaf fan industry to lose millions, resulting in huge losses. The × soldiers act ×.

In Huicheng and Jiangmen, young men and women have been cleared out, and there are few pedestrians. The only ones who remain are rascals and traitors in the Maintenance Society.

Ugly Characters and Traitors; Ghosts Come Out in Broad Daylight

A puppet Maintenance Society has been established in Huicheng and Jiangmen, with its headquarters in the Southwest Academy. The puppet chairman is Liang Rong (also known as Zipizhi Rong), who used to collect waste paper in Huicheng. The committee members are Lu Qi (i.e., Lu Dapeng), Liao Lie (i.e., Liao Zhiping, a practicing Chinese medicine doctor), Xie Luyu (a figure from the Ziyue Hall), Liang Yingchu, etc. However, recently, the puppet Maintenance Society members have resigned because they are competing with the × Advancement Army for military pay. The puppet Advancement Army captain is He Pingzhi, and the team headquarters is located in Cen Richu's mansion. All kinds of people are gathered there, and the situation is chaotic, just like a gathering of ghosts. The robbery incidents happen dozens of times a day, and most of them are committed by the puppet army and the puppet Advancement Army soldiers. The public order and security situation is increasingly out of control.

× Army Retaliates and Bombs Suxiong

The villages of Suxiong (Rongkeng, Maxiong, Tianlu, and Changxiong), about ten miles away from Huicheng, have many strong men and weapons. The strong men in each village are supervised by the village chiefs Chen Yu, Jiu Qu, etc. Every night they attack Huicheng. The × army, because of its small number of troops, has been attacked by our strong men and cannot sleep or eat. They are filled with hatred and anger. Recently, they set up artillery in Henan, Huicheng, and shelled the villages, destroying dozens of houses and killing dozens of innocent villagers. They then ordered the evacuation of women and children (because many refugees had fled to the villages when Huicheng fell). The refugees, women, and children all fled by boat to Sanjiang and transferred to Hong Kong and Macao. Unfortunately, one longboat, when leaving the Machong estuary, was hit by a shell, and the whole boat was destroyed. More than a dozen old and weak people on the boat were killed, a truly tragic scene. When the × army invaded Xinhui this time, the local defense forces were brave in resisting, but because political mobilization was inadequate, evil people and traitors were active, which ultimately affected the military progress. It is truly heartbreaking.

### Recent Situation in Southern Counties; Prohibition of Rice Exports to Avoid Supplying ×; International People Provide Widespread Disaster Relief

[Southern Route Quick News] Although the counties of Xuwen, Haikang, Taipu in the Southern Route have not been spared from the lurking and harassment of × aircraft and warships, our strength is strong and our defense is solid. Therefore, although the coastal areas seem tense, they are actually relaxed. The recent military and political situations in the Southern Route are summarized as follows:

International Sympathy; Widespread Relief for Refugees

Hepu County has been bombed by × aircraft many times, reaching more than ten times so far, resulting in heavy losses and leaving people homeless and in urgent need of relief. International people, Pastor Bao (German), established the Beihai Refugee Relief and Reception Center on the 30th of last month to carry out widespread reception work. Two more reception centers were established in Hepu County, one in the Jiande Association and one in the St. Barnabas Church, with sheds built to accommodate more than a thousand refugees. He also wrote to the Hong Kong Relief Society to donate food. After the county was bombed, commerce was suspended and it has become a dead city.

Thorough Prohibition of Food Exports

After × occupied the Hainan Islands, the Southern Counties ordered a ban on food exports. It is now found that the people of Xuwen County are still applying to the county government for the issuance of grain transit registration certificates to transport grain to neighboring counties by sea. The authorities believe that the × warships are now surrounding overseas areas, fearing that they will be intercepted midway and used to supply ×. To prevent this, a public notice was issued yesterday prohibiting the export of grain by sea and suspending the issuance of grain transport registration certificates by sea from now on. At the same time, the Haikang County government also strictly ordered a thorough prohibition of rice exports. Those who violate the order will be considered to be supplying ×.

### Guerrillas Active in Guangzhou City

[Shameen Communication] After Guangzhou City was subjected to the general counterattacks from our various routes, it has suffered a great blow, and the situation in the city is becoming more and more chaotic. Our guerrillas, lurking in the city, are even more active, and from time to time they gather to attack × camps. In the past few days, our guerrillas have been appearing on various streets, openly carrying guns and wearing armbands. When they encounter × soldiers, they immediately open fire. Therefore, gunshots can be heard in the city day and night. The number of × soldiers killed by the guerrillas every day reaches more than a dozen. Now, most of the × soldiers are hiding and dare not come out. There are very few × soldiers on guard on the streets. Guangzhou City has been virtually controlled by our guerrillas. In recent days, our counter-attacking armies from various routes have approached Guangzhou. In order to prevent the people in the occupied areas from suffering unnecessary sacrifices, the guerrillas have been performing in various restaurants, tea houses, and busy streets to persuade the people to leave Guangzhou as soon as possible to avoid suffering poisoning.

### In Shaoguan (2)

— Microwave

I am very pleased that, upon arriving in Shaoguan this time, I met many responsible authorities and obtained a lot of valuable materials and instructions from the conversations.

First, I met with our provincial political leader, Provincial Governor Li Hanhun.

In a simple environment with a square wooden table and a few bamboo chairs, I talked to this political leader for quite some time.

As a leader, he puts on his uniform every day and goes to the office during office hours to preside over provincial affairs. The difficulty and busyness of the work cannot be undertaken without a very energetic person. Several friends who used to work with him in the army told me that commanding an army is much simpler than presiding over provincial affairs. The military system is a unified one from top to bottom, so it is not necessary to deliberate as much as a provincial governor when issuing orders. Governor Li is eager to govern, so he is busy every day with how to refresh personnel, adjust institutions, how to establish a sound political system, to meet the needs of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and how to build a new Guangdong, to live up to the earnest expectations of compatriots and fellow villagers at home and abroad. All of this makes him feel much more tired than before in the army, but his spirit of courage is constantly advancing.

To achieve this goal, there is the formulation of the Guangdong Provincial Wartime Governance Program. This program "is based on the Three Principles of the People, implementing the Central Government's Program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, referring to the resolutions of the National Political Council, and considering the actual situation in the province. For the current stage of political facilities, concentrate political elbows and people's strength, reform politics, develop the economy, and promote culture, in order to achieve the goals of victory in the war of resistance and success in national reconstruction."

Regarding the content of this program, a general outline has been drafted and is awaiting detailed revisions by the Provincial Affairs Conference before it can be implemented step by step. The outline is as follows:

(A) Reforming Politics

1. Promoting Righteousness

2. Adjusting Institutions

3. Enriching Talents

4. Training Regimental Police

5. Pacifying Localities

6. Popularizing Relief

7. Mobilizing the Masses

(B) Developing the Economy

1. Reorganizing Finances

2. Activating Finance

3. Promoting Trade

4. Developing Industry

5. Rectifying Transportation

(C) Promoting Culture

1. Reorganizing Education

2. Promoting Academics

There are also two new organizations here, the "Political Affairs Research Association" and the "Design Committee," which aim to attract talents, pool ideas for research, and promote provincial political affairs. The Political Affairs Research Association is jointly organized by senior officials of the provincial government and meets once a month to review past work and accelerate administrative efficiency. For the convenience of research, the association is divided into seven groups: Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, Construction, Security, Land Administration. The Design Committee is divided into four groups: Politics, Economy, Culture, and Defense. The number of members ranges from seventeen to twenty-nine, selected or appointed by the provincial government.

Another important thing is that the provincial government will soon implement joint office work. It was originally scheduled to start on the 15th of this month, but was slightly delayed due to insufficient preparation. The main purpose of joint office work is to concentrate authority and increase efficiency, with a military significance.

One point that I would like to particularly mention is that the wartime personnel have made much progress in spirit. Everyone is spending their office hours at the office, shedding the previous loose and disorganized "anarchic" state.

Movies and Drama

Movie Novel

### Happy Angel (10)

"In their mad and violent times, no one can predict the details. We'd better leave here quickly. Tomorrow night they might bomb this place."

"That sounds like it would be exciting."

"Watch a bombing?"

"Yes," she nodded casually, "Bombs thrown into the snow will be as beautiful as spraying diamonds."

"Maybe what's sprayed out will be our flesh and blood. Dear, we'd better get away."

"I can imagine what Paris is like now, just like in 1914. Those lovely soldiers are singing—Forward—Forward. Oh, Archer, I'm so happy to be with you."

"Why?" he asked absently.

"All this vast, miraculous death, and the destruction everywhere, is what you have helped to create!"

"Why don't they die?" Weipo asked roughly, "Who is more sinful, the one who sells weapons or the one who buys them? Irene, I assure you, these killing weapons are too good for those little people." His voice trembled with insult and anger, and he walked out of the room.

That night, Irene returned to the reception room. The travelers were all silent, with uneasy hearts. Everyone knew that tomorrow, this place would be bombed into a desolate wasteland. Harry was also calculating in his heart that he and Irene would have a second parting.

"Why are you always looking at me like that?" she suddenly asked, "You've been looking at me like that ever since I came here."

"Yes, because you remind me of someone who looks like you. Have you really never been to Omber? Mrs. Weipo?"

She laughed and shook her head, "I don't think I know your Omber, but, excuse me, I'm not Mrs. Weipo."

"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought…"

"I know what you thought," she interrupted, "Mr. Weipo and I only have a professional connection."

"I know," Harry murmured, "A very beautiful professional connection."

"I think you're probably the kind of person who respects Mr. Weipo very much because he sells explosives, guns, and warships."

"Ah, no, I'm not like that, but I would never criticize those who oppose him."

"His business is booming. He sows a little seed of fire here and there, so people always have to buy his goods."

"Naturally, that's perfectly legal."

"Why are you staring at me again?"

Sports News

### Public Baseball Tournament is Coming Soon, China Team's Talent Remains, Other Teams' Strength Has Also Increased

[Our Paper News] Baseball is a most exquisite and brain-using sport. However, precisely because its organization is complex and its rules are numerous, many people do not understand it and are not very interested. If one understands it, one feels that baseball is more worthwhile than any other ball game.

The Hong Kong Open Baseball Tournament is scheduled to begin on the 6th of next month at the Caroline Hill Navy Ground. There are six participating teams. Although there has been no increase compared to previous years, because each team is full of talent and its strength has increased, it can be predicted that the competition will be exceptionally intense in the future and there will be an unprecedented grand occasion.

The participating teams include the China Team, the South China Athletic Association Team, the Hong Kong Baseball Club Team, the Westerners' Team, the American Ship Mindanao Team, and the Shanghai Brewery Company Team.

The China Team is the defending champion. All the good players will continue to play this year. However, it is not yet known whether catcher Luo William, who is currently at Danxia Mountain, will return. If he returns, he will still hold this position; otherwise, Lin Ye will replace him. The currently planned lineup is roughly as follows:

Pitcher: Huang Rongjun; Catcher: Luo William or Lin Ye; First Base: Chen Lunshi; Second Base: Hu Zhengqu; Third Base: Lin Ye; Shortstop: Chen Fang; Left Field: Zhong Cansen; Center Field: Cai Bingfen; Right Field: Lu Jiaxing; Reserve: Huang Guoqing.

Looking at the above list, all are famous generals. The attack and defense will definitely be sharp and strong. In the future, when competing with various teams, they will surely reveal their championship colors again.

As far as I know, other teams have new players joining. Of particular note is the renewed lineup of the Hong Kong Club Team. Because the team has many new players, such as Harris, Brown, Delaney, Vanikia, Bissell, Bielu, etc., all of them are experienced players. In addition, "Fastball" Hissa, who used to be a pitcher at the San Francisco Seals, will also play for the team. If his arm is well, then any team that meets the Hong Kong Club this year will likely suffer a painful blow.

The Mindanao Team's strength was already good last year, but this year it is even stronger, because the ship has many young baseball players who have newly joined from the United States, so their strength has greatly increased and is no longer comparable to the past. Among these people, the most noteworthy are pitcher Luis and outfielder Reagle. They are extremely strong in defense, but their batting is relatively poor.

The Westerners' Team, which won the runner-up last year, still has the same lineup this year, but the experience of each member has greatly increased. Their fast-paced style of play is frightening. The pitcher position will still be held by Adair, with Birella as the backup pitcher in case of need.

The Shanghai Brewery Company Team is this year's new army. It is composed of players who previously played for other teams in Hong Kong, so it is impossible to predict the results. However, from a personal perspective, the strength does not seem weak. The team members, such as veteran Da Li'anna, Xiao Li'anna, Nashalian, Jie Cao, etc., are all fast players. If they are willing to work hard, the future is also promising. (Donglang)

### Basketball Game Last Night. Group A: South China Defeats Guangda. Police Suffers Defeat. Taikoo Lost to South China

In the Open Men's Basketball Tournament, South China played against Guangda in Group A last night. Although South China was once defeated by Sing Tao, their strength is still strong. Guangda hoped to defeat South China and came to the game with an elite team. After the start of the game, Guangda's momentum was remarkable, and they frequently put pressure on South China. In the first half, they took a lead of 27 to 13. After that, South China mobilized the entire army. Huang Zuo shouted and encouraged them, and the three armies fought bravely. Good news came frequently. Guangda was in a state of panic and lost 26 to 43.

In the second game, Sing Tao played against the police. Sing Tao is a strong team in this year's competition, and the police are also very brave. After the two sides fought, Sing Tao cooperated well. Li Peiyan and Lu Zhenxuan played to the point and made many achievements. Li Renjie and Dai Fucheng shot well. Liang Guoduo and Pan Yaojun both had good performances. The police, Na Lianxing and Chen Jinkui, were also good at fighting, breaking through and entering, but Sing Tao passed and attacked, taking care of each other. The police resisted with all their might and finally lost 40 to 54.

In the final game of Group B, Taikoo played against South China. Taikoo's coordination was disorganized. South China's offensive was balanced. Luo Huazhang, Zhuo Hongzhan, Zhuo Guorong, He Hongji, and Mo Dunxiang all made contributions. Taikoo's Guo Ying and Liang Gengchang tried their best to support, and there were some gains, but South China's strength was strong, and Taikoo ultimately had no effect, losing 25 to 57.

### Yesterday's Open Tennis Tournament: He Jia Lost to Xiao Xu. Today Xu Weibai and Da Linzhen Semifinals

The Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament resumed yesterday. Veteran He Jialiu played against Xu Runpei. In the first set, He's power was brought into play, and in one breath, he beat Xiao Xu to cope with difficulty with a score of 4-0. In order to open the difficult situation, Xiao Xu stood up, pressed and attacked together, and the situation improved. He won with a score of 7-5. In the second set, He Jialiu jumped too much in the first set and walked too intensely. His vigor declined. The young and vigorous Xiao Xu seized the opportunity to kill, serve sharply, and get on the net properly. He won a complete victory with a score of 6-0 and was promoted to the week to play the semifinals with Li Huitang. Xiao Xu's performance in the first half of the first set yesterday was extremely abnormal. He made serving errors, and his shots fell into the net. He was violently killed by He Jialiu's high pressure. As a result, Xiao Xu's ball skills were one notch higher. He used both softness and hardness to break He's hard work policy. Therefore, the old and strong He Jialiu inevitably lost.

### The Sport that Chinese People Should Have in the All-Out War of Resistance

— Zou Falu

After the launch of the all-out war of resistance, it is very clearly placed before us that there are only two roads. One is to bow down and obey, to give and take, to only follow, and to never recover, and to die in darkness. The other is to rise up and seek survival, overthrow the invaders, lift the constraints, and achieve freedom and equality and bright and brilliant life. A person, a person without a heart to do good, I believe will never be willing to abandon the road of life and take the road of death.

To cut off the road of death and open the road of life, we must concentrate everything and struggle under the same goal of fighting for survival. Whether we can achieve the goal depends on the degree of struggle. At present, the struggle is multifaceted, mobilizing the masses, arousing the feeling of anger towards the enemy, developing resources, consolidating the economic foundation, negotiating, winning the world's assistance, teaching young talents, continuing the lifeline of the country, planning and deploying, making decisions in the tent, charging into battle, killing the enemy on the battlefield, and everything done for the war of resistance are all struggles. However, although there are many ways to struggle, in summary, there are only two ways: mental and physical labor. In other words, it is mental and physical strength. As the Western saying goes, "A sound mind is in a sound body," and abundant physical strength can only be produced from a sound body. Therefore, to have a transcendent spirit and majestic physical strength to enrich all the forces of struggle and achieve the mission of victory in the war of resistance, training a sound physique is a prerequisite.

Exercise is a tool to severely refine the sound and strict body, which is recognized by all in ancient and modern times, and there is no need to say much. However, under the current situation of launching an all-out war of resistance, what kind of exercise should be used to train the physique of the whole people to cope with the current great disaster is worth our review. In my personal opinion, the most suitable sports at present must meet the three principles of "economy" and "easy to learn" and "easy to do". The reason is: (To be continued)

### First Division Football League Runner-Up, Decisive Battle This Saturday, Xuhe Cup Final to be Held on the 13th of Next Month

[Our Newspaper Special] The current football competition has reached the end of the tea and flowers. Many people will temporarily hide in the mountains like leopards, waiting for the cool autumn in September to meet the fans again.

However, the ball fate is broken and continued. The more concerned, there are still two ball accounts that have not been clearly settled. One is the First Division League runner-up decisive battle, and the other is the Xuhe Cup championship battle.

The East team will return from the South to apply. They arrived during the day. In order to complete the procedure as soon as possible, the General Association has set the date for the runner-up final at 4:30 pm on the 29th of this month. The location is Caroline Hill.

The East team has returned from a long trip, and has gained a lot of experience. They have also added two "external" players, Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting, to their strength. The momentum is very strong. It is not difficult to defeat the Navy in one battle and win a runner-up seat. Don't say that bezoar and canine cases are not precious enough.

The Xuhe Cup championship battle is a matter for South China and the Navy, but whether our China team can handle and package the six major championships depends entirely on this final move. Thinking about it, the concern is doubled. I only hope that the generals of South China will take good care of themselves and complete this glorious creation.

This competition will be held after the Philippine International Team returns, but the battle date has been set for May 13th. The location is the Standard Supplementary Ground. This final autumn wave is enough to be missed. (Taisui)

Swimming Guide

### Backstroke

— Pan Yeshao

Most swimmers are not familiar with backstroke. A detailed examination shows that the reason is not that it is difficult to learn, but that it is not as lively and cheerful as other swimming styles. When saving drowning people, backstroke can be useful. Freestyle is the fastest way to get to the drowning person's location. To drag him to the water's edge, backstroke is the most convenient. Both of them lie supine in the water, and rescue work is easier to carry out. Not to involve too much, the most troublesome thing at the beginning of learning backstroke is that the limbs feel particularly stiff.

There are also many types of backstroke movements. The most agile is to alternately kick downwards with the lower limbs, with both hands crossing over the head and entering the water forward. This swimming posture is similar to freestyle, only the direction of the body is opposite. Because the direction of the movement is different, the posture of the limbs coming out of the water and entering the water is also different. When kicking with the lower limbs, the toes must be slightly inward. This foot posture can increase the area of ​​impact with the water and enhance the power of the floating body. Therefore, the head can also be raised a little higher, so that the position where the hands can exert force to paddle is suitable. The upper limb movement of freestyle is to push downward and backward, which is a crawling movement, while the upper limb movement of backstroke is very similar to rowing. The position of activating the water is similar, but it is slightly different from the upper limb movement of breaststroke. In addition to the opposite direction, the hands and feet come out of the water and go in again. However, they both move to both sides, which easily makes the body sway from side to side. If the force applied by one of the limbs is large or small, and because the backstroke posture cannot see the front, the direction of the continued backstroke must be skewed. It is not difficult to correct the error, just pay attention to the uniform use of arm strength.

Another type is to raise both hands away from the water at the same time, cross the head, and insert them into the water forward, and then pull them towards the sides of the waist to get out of the water. The kicking action of the feet is like breaststroke, so those who have learned breaststroke find it very easy to learn this action. Only when the hands pass over the head, the waves of water raised by the arms will prick at the ears, mouth, nose, and eyes, making them uneasy, especially hindering breathing, and continuing to exercise will be exhausting. However, over time, the so-called difficulties will become a thing of the past.

The method of turning around in backstroke also needs to be studied. According to the swimming rules, when backstroking to the side of the pool, like freestyle, you are allowed to touch the end of the pool with one hand. Once you touch the side of the pool, immediately take advantage of the forward momentum of the body to turn around. At this time, hold the side of the pool, and the pool wall is touched by both feet. Facing the side of the pool, throw it backwards. This posture facilitates breathing and can also take the opportunity to rest the muscles of the limbs. Another turning method is to use the strength of the soles of the feet to push the pool wall through the body in the water, and then come out of the water again.

The back movement can also stretch and float easily without much effort, but it is not as easy to last as breaststroke. For the improvement of swimming skills, the backstroke movement is quite complicated and is worth practicing carefully.

Commentary

### Problem of Balancing Commodity Prices

— Bao Leti

(4) High Commodity Prices and Wartime Economy

Generally speaking, commodity prices and the purchasing power of the people are mutually causal. When commodity prices rise, national income increases, and consequently, the people's purchasing power also increases. If commodity prices rise above the level of the people's purchasing power, national consumption will naturally shrink, causing commodity prices to inevitably fall until they are equal to the people's purchasing power. However, this is conditional on developed production and stable order, and even then, it cannot be fully realized in practice, because wages never rise in the same proportion as commodity prices. Therefore, high commodity prices only weaken the people's purchasing power and rarely have the possibility of increasing it. Consider the table below: The average wage of factory workers in the 27th year only increased by 1.8% compared to the 26th year, but the cost of living for workers at this time had already increased by 29.4%. This is a clear fact.

Comparative Table of Living Expenses and Wage Index for Shanghai Workers

Year 26 Year 27

Worker Living Expenses Index (1) 124.11 160.60

Factory Worker Wage Index (2) 100.00 101.80

Currency Purchasing Power (3) 80.57 62.27

(Note 1) Figures compiled by the China Branch of the International Labour Office. (2) Wage index, calculated based on the "Monthly Average Wage Table of Shanghai Factory Workers" in the January issue of the "Economic Statistics Monthly" published by the Institute of Economic Statistics.

Moreover, our country's production is already extremely backward, and now it is in a time of war that is destroying all production equipment. Therefore, high commodity prices, on the one hand, reflect the decline in the external value of the currency, and on the other hand, strengthen the power of foreign goods to exploit our country's wealth. In other words, it is enough to promote the collapse of our country's finances, finance, currency system, and the entire national economy.

On the surface, the income of comprador capital (merchants who specialize in selling foreign goods) and quasi-comprador capital (such as producers who use foreign goods as raw materials and sellers of finished products, etc.) may also increase to some extent, thereby creating a superficial prosperity in bank deposits. However, it cannot compensate for the loss of monetary value of other wealth capital, let alone the loss of the entire national wealth. That is obvious.

From the perspective of facts, the high rise in domestic commodity prices has already made the entire population feel a severe threat to their lives. If this threat is not eliminated, or even expands further, there is a danger of shaking the entire social order. What is even more dangerous is that it will directly shake the economic foundation of the war. Recently, the United Kingdom provided a loan to China to jointly balance foreign exchange. If we disregard the political significance and only analyze its economic significance, then everyone knows that it is "to maintain its market for goods exported to China." In other words, because commodity prices in China have already exceeded the level of purchasing power, making the market for their goods in China face a major obstacle in addition to the violent obstruction of the Japanese. Balancing China's exchange rate is to prevent the continued rise in the import prices of Chinese goods.

Moreover, our reason for attaching importance to this issue is less for the present and more for the future. We must first plan for "preventing problems before they occur," because the main reason for the current soaring commodity prices is due to the impact of the war. Therefore, in the future when there is still no hope of ending the war, that is, in the future when all the reasons that stimulate soaring commodity prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be an unlimited risk of further increases.

(5) The National Government's Countermeasures to Balance Commodity Prices

The National Government has long been determined to control commodity prices during the war. However, this control is still in the trial stage in European and American countries with extremely well-organized economic systems. Germany's "appropriate price system" is praised by the world, but in China, where the economic organization is like a plate of loose sand, there is really no room for imitation. However, the fact is that it is no longer permissible to let it go on like this. If we can remove the speculative factors in commodity prices, we can balance the situation and solve the problem easily. Therefore, recently, the provincial and municipal governments were finally ordered to organize commodity price balancing committees separately, and to cooperate with provincial and local banks to implement price balancing for people's daily necessities, and to stipulate three types of fair price standards: (1) For goods whose production and transportation costs are slightly or very slightly affected by the war, the average price of the three or one and a half years before the war shall be the standard; (2) For goods whose production and transportation costs are affected by the war, their costs after the war plus a considerable profit shall be the standard; (3) For goods whose costs are not easy to calculate, the total amount of capital required for their operation plus a considerable profit shall be the standard. It is also stipulated that the goods for balancing commodity prices are limited to daily necessities.

The commodity price balancing committee is jointly organized by the local government, existing banks, or local banks, and chambers of commerce. For industrialists, merchants, or individuals who hoard large quantities of daily necessities, the committee may request the local主管官署 to force them to sell them at the assessed price. It is also stipulated that those who violate the following clauses with the intention of speculating and manipulating shall be reported to the court in accordance with the Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations: (1) The amount of mutual buying and selling between companies in the same industry shall not exceed the actual amount of individual goods; (2) Companies in the same industry that do not deal in daily necessities shall not mutually buy or sell futures on the market; (3) No exchange or market shall be established for the purchase and sale of daily necessities.

However, Shanghai, which still occupies an important position in the entire economy and is the place where speculation is most rampant and commodity prices rise the fastest, has unfortunately been surrounded in the occupied area. Political power can no longer exert much effect. If it is not for the people to come forward and govern themselves, it will be simply impossible to implement. Therefore, whether the citizens of Shanghai can be freed from the improper reduction and cruel oppression of commodity prices depends only on whether the leaders of various industries can contribute and support and work hard on this point.

### Stablehand Wang Afu

— Jin Zairong

Outside the courtyard where we lived was a stable, and one of the many stablehands was called Wang Afu.

He was short with a sallow complexion, in his thirties. But his eyebrows were always furrowed, as if he had some unfathomable worry. His movements were very restrained. When he spoke, he was always overly humble, revealing his peasant nature everywhere, unlike a "foreman."

He often wore that set of gray cotton military uniform, and the leggings were also put on improperly. Sometimes his handkerchief was worn askew. He had nothing except a small dog. That small dog was a Japanese breed, captured by a brother when we attacked Zhangdian. He wanted it. He was very strange about that small dog. Sometimes he was very protective of it, not allowing others to touch it. But sometimes, he would beat it mercilessly until it barked and howled, while its owner showed his two rows of yellow teeth in a sinister smile.

The small dog often ran into our courtyard, and he would come in to get the dog. But a group of teasing servants would take the opportunity. One would hold the small dog, and the others would surround him, asking him to sing: "Sing! Sing, Old Wang!" The chaotic noise, mixed with the small dog's barking and howling. He was obviously embarrassed. However, people saw his embarrassment and did not sympathize with him. Instead, they pressed him even harder, shouting, "Sing! Sing!" laughing louder and without restraint. So we came out to watch this most exciting act. He would delay for a while, but when he saw that this delay had no effect, he had no choice but to sing. But when he stood in the courtyard preparing to sing, people made even more demanding requests. "Shake your butt! If you don't shake, it won't work." At the same time, someone in the crowd would take out his own handkerchief and hand it to him. He had no reason not to accept this request. He had to take the handkerchief and sing in the courtyard, twisting and turning while straining his throat.

Then, "This slave lives in Baoding Prefecture..." The sad tune continued until the color of his face gradually changed, and his eyes were filled with tears. In the end, his voice became hoarse and his tears flowed down. Only then did people satisfy him and release the small dog, letting him go out. But after a while, it was the Japanese-breed small dog's bad luck. The barking and howling reached my ears, and then we heard Wang Afu beating the small dog again.

I saw such things three or four times. I sympathized with him very much and disagreed with the servants' teasing, but I didn't know why he was often sad, often sang that sad song, and often beat that Japanese-breed small dog.

It was a windy day, and that act had just been performed in the courtyard again. I couldn't bear it any longer. I called a servant into the room and told him not to do this again in the future. He agreed and then said, "Afu is also pitiful..." Obviously, he knew the inside story. I asked him about it, and he told me the following story:

"Mr. Jin, don't underestimate Wang Afu. He was originally a big landlord. Before the Japanese devils invaded Baoding, he still had a manor, several hectares of land, and a lot of property. He had a wife and a younger sister. When our army defended Baoding, I met him. He lived in a village south of the city. But he made the wrong decision. We asked him to donate money, but he didn't. We asked him to do something, but he didn't do it.

"When our army withdrew from Baoding, people scattered. The commander and I were the last to leave, but we saw that his family was steaming snow-white steamed buns and slaughtering a big pig. I wondered what trick he was up to. Who knew that he was preparing to welcome the Japanese x x!

"When the x x arrived, they didn't give him any special treatment. It is said that the pig was eaten, but the steamed buns were trampled to pieces. His wife was spotted by a Japanese devil, who immediately wanted to take her away. However, how could he let the Japanese devil take his wife away? So they fought. The Imperial Army could easily subdue an unarmed Chinese man. But the Imperial Army seemed more interested in 'saigu' (Japanese for sexual intercourse) than in killing people, so they took a civilized action towards Afu, tying him to a wooden ladder and then dragging his wife onto the kang. One, two, three... Perhaps he closed his eyes at the time (it is said that Wang Afu did close his eyes), but he could clearly hear his wife's struggles. He could also clearly hear the muffled shouts, and the devils who climbed onto the kang were six or seven...

"Late at night, the house was silent. Wang Afu finally fell to the ground with the ladder. When he woke up again, he found that another Imperial Army soldier was untying him. This Imperial Army soldier was not particularly kind. He probably knew that he was a big landlord, so he wanted him to point out where the gold was hidden. However, no gold was found, but his younger sister was found instead. Two cold bayonets were pressed against him, forcing him to watch his younger sister being climbed on by one, two, three Imperial Army soldiers.

"He wanted to resist several times, but the cold bayonets were pressed against his chest, and he didn't dare to move. However, he never dreamed that under the pressure of the cold bayonets, the last one to 'saigu' with his younger sister who had fainted on the ground was himself!

"He almost went crazy. After suffering countless gun butts from the Imperial Army, he was still not dead, so he came west with the refugees.

"Before the fall of Taiyuan, our troops arrived in Taiyuan. They found him in the refugee camp. He didn't give me a chance to laugh at him. He hugged me and cried, telling me about the above experiences..."

"So, he stayed here as a stablehand," I interjected. The servant agreed with me and then left. I completely understood why he always frowned, sang such sad songs, and often beat that Japanese-breed small dog.

After those inhuman beasts stepped into our country, such stories were played out everywhere they went, and thousands upon thousands of people suffered hardships. Wang Afu's experience is just one of many ordinary stories! But this is the humiliation of the nation, and we must not forget these ordinary stories.

In order to prevent those ordinary stories from continuing to be played out in various places, our soldiers are raising the banner of upholding justice. I hope that in the near future, the same banner will be raised in the East across the sea. This is my blessing to those who are fighting for justice and peace in the island nation. Their shoulders also bear the responsibility of preventing those ordinary stories from being staged!

### An Inspiration

— Qiming

It's raining, very annoying! But I know the rain will stop, as long as the wind changes direction, the sun will come out.

I'm sick, very painful! But I know I'll get better, as long as I seek hygiene, I can soon regain my health and be happy to be human.

The country is being bullied, very difficult! But I know the bullying will pass, as long as we resist together, strive to build the country, we can soon have a bright and brilliant Republic of China.

Everything in the world, all things in the universe, has a certain order, a certain track. Loss of order is war, deviation from track is disaster. One cannot say that there will absolutely be no chaos and disaster, but after all, this is temporary. Order and track will eventually exist forever, never to be destroyed. Compared to the temporary, what does the eternal count for!

We see, we see from afar, behind the dense clouds that bring rain, isn't there still the sun shining? In the hidden place of the groaning and twisting body, isn't there still a whole and vigorous physique supporting it? Also, in the depths of the disintegrating country, isn't there still a majestic and vast national soul invigorating it? Our hope is not in vain, and the time for its realization is not far away!

Let us work hard, neither despairing nor impatient, all the misfortunes will be like a nightmare, soon to disappear without a trace, when the light of dawn arrives!

### On Leader Worship

— Bailou

It seems that someone once said that every young person should have a central figure of worship in their minds. We often say that someone is a thoughtful person. In fact, all people have thought activities, so to particularly point out that someone is a thoughtful person actually means that that person's thoughts are organized, not the scattered thoughts that ordinary people share.

For a person's thoughts to develop to the point of being organized and systematic, they must go through various developments, experiences, and a gradual enrichment of knowledge. But there must be an indispensable element: figure worship. However, it is not idol-style figure worship, but rational and scientific figure worship.

If a person's thoughts tend towards organization, no matter how curved the development process of their thoughts may be, they must have a certain degree of type. What determines this type is someone who leads their thoughts to unfold in a certain direction. Although this someone does not exist in our thoughts at the beginning, when thoughts develop to a certain degree, such a person will appear in our minds, progressing with the advancement of thoughts. Our confidence in this certain person gradually deepens, eventually leading to a psychological worship of them. Only when the evolution of thoughts reaches such a stage can our confidence have a certain destination. Only figure worship derived from the thought process is worthy of being called scientific figure worship.

Some people strongly oppose the idea of hero worship. These people's views focus on the saying that the times create heroes, while ignoring the role of individuals in history. The reason why a person becomes a hero, becoming an object of worship for certain groups, is of course determined by the person's various circumstances, but the main reason is that the person's character can synthesize the essence of their era and embody it in their lifestyle and way of thinking, thus becoming a great person. The reason why heroes become the center of admiration for the masses lies in this. The reason why leaders are different from the general masses is that they can fully grasp and utilize the environment. Although they also rely on the promotion of the masses, the determining point of this driving force is still concentrated in them. Leaders and the masses are an organic whole, inseparable from each other.

Perhaps some people think that the general masses' worship of heroes is idol worship. They have not gone through a process of ideological understanding. But we believe that the general masses directly recognize their leaders through intuition in real life. They recognize from real life who truly seeks their welfare and who truly guides their lives. Therefore, although their form of hero worship is close to idol worship, it is actually based on real life. Sometimes a hypocritical leader can also receive blind support from the masses for a time—as in the case of fascist countries—but soon in real life they can recognize the leader's true colors and overthrow them.

Recently, after reading Dong Xianguang's Theory of Chiang Kai-shek and a biography of Lenin, I couldn't help but think of the madly emotional masses around the Xi'an Incident, and at the same time imagine the Soviet people who never stop admiring Lenin's remains in front of his tomb throughout the seasons. The fact that the Soviet Union has today's strength and that China has been able to achieve today's great unity, cooperating with one heart to fight against the war, we cannot underestimate the significance of hero worship and leader worship.

In order to enrich our thoughts and shape our personality, we should all have a central figure of worship in our minds. This not only enriches our faith in justice but also gives us a lot of comfort in the spiritual field at all times.

### Villagers (Continued)

— Green

The men in yellow wanted to rest, so Guo Laoer led them into the largest hotel, Huang Longyuan. The owner, Huang Guansan, and his family hurriedly escaped through the back door, leaving only two old shop assistants to attend to them, carrying out two jars of wine to invite these foreign "honored guests" to drink.

In an instant, all the young men and women in the town had fled, leaving only the old and the young. Because they had received too many lessons, they already knew how to conduct themselves.

It was already dusk, so of course they could go back, and more importantly, they had to go back. So the staggering footsteps, carrying the drunken men in yellow, walked out of Huang Longyuan.

Guo Laoer gave advice to the leader again, saying: Returning like this would inevitably be laughed at by the "bandits," and they should also be given some punishment. The leader listened to him and did two things:

First, set a fire, starting with Huang Longyuan. While burning, Guo Laoer spoke to his fellow villagers, old and young:

—You are harboring "bandits," so you are being punished. If you do this again, we will kill every last one of you!

Second, Guo Laoer wrote a notice that was neither clear nor coherent, and posted it on the bridge pillar in the middle of the street, saying in essence:

...We have already gone to the countryside, where have you hid! Come out if you have the guts!...

They returned safely to the city in the dim twilight, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Guo Laoer was greatly rewarded by the commander, who said that he handled things thoughtfully and efficiently, and immediately promoted him to "police chief."

Guo Laoer's elation can be imagined.

The next morning, Guo Laoer followed his usual habit, going to the Yongchun teahouse on the west side of the old "county government" to drink tea and have breakfast. Because he was so excited, his face was beaming. As soon as he sat down, he told the waiter and the people at the neighboring tables many things, praising the "benevolent governance" of his master, and announcing his grand policies after taking office as "police chief." While he was giving his grand speech, someone walked outside and, seeing him, bent down and said to him in a heated tone:

—Chief Guo, someone outside wants to ask you to do something. Please come out and meet them.

Guo Laoer looked at the person, and it seemed to be a neighbor he recognized, but he couldn't remember the name.

—Can't you ask him to come in?

As he said this, there was a somewhat uneasy look on his face.

The person moved forward another step, whispering in his ear.

—The person has a confidential matter, and if Chief Guo helps, there will be some gratitude, so it is not convenient to say it here.

When Guo Laoer heard that someone wanted to thank him, his expression immediately eased. He stood up and followed the person out.

Sure enough, there was already someone waiting at the door of the teahouse. As soon as he saw Guo Laoer come out, he stepped forward and raised his hand, saying:

—Sending Chief Guo home to the dogs—

At the same time, there was a popping sound from the raised hand, and Guo Laoer fell backward, a stream of blood flowing from between his eyebrows, covering his face and the ground.

The people in the teahouse ran outside, ran in all directions. The person who had asked Guo Laoer out and the person who had raised his hand also ran among them. Before long, no one knew where these two people had run to.

The "police" arrived and picked up another note in front of Guo Laoer's chest, which read:

...We have come to the city to eliminate these traitors who act as accomplices to the tiger...

Then, the city gates were closed, and a house-to-house search was conducted, causing chaos and unrest. As a result, it only stirred up trouble within the city walls. Moreover, it was a matter of 'birds flying into the sky, where can hunters find them!' (End)

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

He smiled, tacitly agreeing. He thought

'Why do you ask again'?

'Did I hurt you'?

He still smiled. Tacitly agreeing, as if also saying;

'If it wasn't suicide, does anyone hurt themselves? If you didn't hurt me, did I hurt myself?'

'Is it serious'?

He silently pulled out the collar of his shirt, which had been dyed red with blood, and showed it to her. She glanced at it, then looked at his face and said:

'Why are you so cold to me? I feel like I'm talking to a deaf person. Won't you forgive me yet?' (Forty-seven)
