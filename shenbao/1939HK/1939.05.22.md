### On the So-Called "Sino-Soviet Secret Pact"

Recently, in European international affairs, alliances and agreements have become prevalent, with each party scheming and plotting for their own benefit. This trend shows no signs of abating. Its influence has even led some to believe that the Far East is following suit. For example, yesterday's and the day before's newspapers carried a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo stating that two Japanese newspapers published reports of a secret pact between China and the Soviet Union. One newspaper claimed that the Soviet Union would provide China with an unlimited number of aircraft pilots and mechanics. It would also extend a loan of 400 million yuan to China to purchase military supplies, and would jointly establish a Sino-Soviet arms import company with 50 million yuan. The other newspaper claimed that the Soviet Union demanded a price for its aid to China in resisting Japan. The matter was allegedly discussed by Sun Ke in Moscow, and the following points were reportedly approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: First, China must consult with Moscow before accepting mediation from any third country. Second, China should absolutely suppress pro-peace factions within the National Government and other jurisdictions. Third, China must equalize the equipment and treatment of the Central Army, the Communist Army, and the armies of various provinces. Fourth, the three provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang should be designated as special administrative regions, with Mao Zedong as chairman, garrisoned solely by the Communist Army. The Soviet Union would be allowed to develop the resources of these three provinces and station a military officer as a military representative. Fifth, China should hire Soviet experts as military training officers to train soldiers and pilots. Sixth, land and air routes would be opened between Xi'an and Moscow, via Lanzhou, Hami, and Dihua. In exchange, the Soviet Union would provide China with unlimited material and technical assistance.

Given the rapid pace of events, we have not yet heard any response from the Chinese and Soviet authorities. However, based on the reports, a preliminary analysis reveals that none of the claims align with truth or reason. From what we know and believe, since China launched its full-scale war of resistance, it has received sympathy and assistance from all countries except the aggressor, not just the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's extensive material and technical assistance to China has been ongoing for some time, not just recently. This assistance is based on morality and mutual trust, and is therefore unconditional and does not involve any secret pacts. The Soviet Union is abundant in military supplies but lacks gold and silver. China's expectations of the Soviet Union lie in the former, not the latter. Therefore, we have not heard of any discussions regarding the so-called loan. Moreover, why would the government need to establish a company when dealing directly with another government? An air route between Chongqing and Moscow was opened and publicly tested long ago. Why would it be necessary to demand it as a condition of a secret pact? All these points, in both fact and spirit, are superior to what the Japanese newspapers reported. They are more worthy of respect and beyond the ability of the Japanese newspapers to comprehend. As for the so-called hiring of experts, China has historically invited numerous foreign advisors. However, this is an action taken autonomously by the authorities and is not subject to the constraints of any international treaty. China is fighting to resist aggression and to win freedom. How could it willingly sacrifice the freedom to hire experts for the sake of a so-called secret pact? Furthermore, the claim that three provinces would be designated as special regions, with specific individuals in charge, specific armies garrisoning them, and specific countries enjoying exclusive rights, is the desire of aggressors and does not suit the Soviet Union. As for the alleged equalization of equipment and treatment for all armies, our military authorities have previously dismissed this as a divisive tactic. Equal treatment has been practiced for some time, but unequal equipment is a reality due to limitations. Moreover, since the start of the war of resistance, troops have been divided by sectors, and there is no distinction between the Central Army and the Communist Army. Equipment is gradually improved and supplemented according to what is feasible, and this does not vary by sector. All these points can be refuted not only by facts, allowing us to assert their falsehood, but also by reasoning, leading us to conclude that the Chinese and Soviet sides would never make them conditions of a secret pact. As for the claims that China cannot accept mediation from other countries without prior consultation with Moscow, and that it must absolutely suppress pro-peace factions, these statements seem to harbor resentment towards the Soviet Union and aim to falsely accuse the Chinese government of becoming communist, using it as material for fabricating an alleged secret pact.

In international relations, contradictions lead to interests, interests lead to friends and enemies, friends and enemies lead to either hostility and war, or the formation of alliances, the signing of agreements, or the conclusion of secret pacts. Each party acts according to its needs and takes what it deems appropriate. This is a common practice and a familiar approach, and there is nothing surprising about it. Moreover, while these methods and approaches inevitably have consequences, broadly speaking, it is more accurate to say that circumstances create treaties rather than treaties creating circumstances. For example, the Entente Cordiale between Britain and France was a product of their alignment, not the other way around. The same applies to the alliance between Germany and Italy. A Sino-Soviet alliance is not entirely impossible. After Britain and France guaranteed Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union felt somewhat less threatened in the West, which increased its incentive to be more proactive in the East. This means that the conditions for China and the Soviet Union to jointly become the main force for stabilizing the Far East are becoming increasingly ready. Therefore, if China and the Soviet Union (or a wider range of countries) adopt reasonable measures and demonstrate important developments in the near future, it should not be surprising. However, it must be based on reciprocity and the principles of equality and freedom, and certainly not on a secret pact as reported by the Japanese newspapers. This can be asserted with certainty.

### On the National Political Council

— Xiyuan

The National Political Council was conceived during the War of Resistance and established on the anniversary of its outbreak. Its preparation and planning took place after the fall of Nanjing, when a small number of compromising and surrendering elements were spreading poison, while the military and civilians across the country and national leaders were adhering to the War of Resistance and persevering. At that time, all patriotic people actively demanded the establishment of a body representing public opinion and the implementation of democratic politics, so that the government could concentrate national strength, mobilize human and material resources, and persist in the War of Resistance to the end in order to win the final victory. As national leader Chiang Kai-shek said: "Previously, the general public had many criticisms of the War of Resistance, mostly believing that in the past we only carried out military mobilization, but did not mobilize the political power of the whole country to mobilize the people to participate in the War of Resistance" (speech at the opening ceremony of the first session of the National Political Council). In April of last year, the Kuomintang convened a temporary national representative assembly "because the national representative assembly cannot be convened immediately due to the current value of the invading army, and at the same time, in this extraordinary period, it is urgent to unite the strength of the whole country, pool ideas, and benefit the determination and implementation of national undertakings, it was resolved to organize a body representing public opinion, and the National Political Council will be convened after the National Political Council Organization Law is formulated". At the same time, the temporary assembly declaration also pointed out that "the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance depends not only on military strength, but also on the strength of the people, and the development of the strength of the people and the increase of civil rights are causally related, so organizing the people and training the people are necessary tasks for developing the strength of the people and also necessary conditions for increasing civil rights", and "autonomy emphasizes self-defense" and "freedom and unity take both into account" are the principles that must be guarded to develop the strength of the people and increase civil rights. This decision of the Kuomintang was indeed able to conform to public opinion and was indeed a preliminary and concrete method to remedy the shortcoming that political mobilization lagged behind military mobilization in the past.

Following the decision of the Temporary National Congress, the National Government promulgated fifteen articles of the National Political Council Organization Regulations on April 12 of last year. According to the provisions of the regulations, the nature of the National Political Council is, on the one hand, an organ for pooling ideas and soliciting public opinion, that is, an organ for government consultation (as stipulated in Article 1 of the regulations "The National Government establishes the National Political Council specifically for the purpose of pooling ideas and uniting the strength of the whole country during the War of Resistance"), and on the other hand, it also has the powers of resolution, suggestion, and consultation that are common to parliaments in ordinary constitutional countries, so it is also a considerable body representing public opinion (as in Article 5 "During the War of Resistance, the government shall submit important internal and external administrative policies to the National Political Council for resolution before implementation", Article 6 "The National Political Council may submit proposals to the government" and Article 7 "The National Political Council has the right to listen to the government's policy reports and to inquire to the government"). In this way, in terms of nature, although it is not yet a true body representing public opinion, it already has the function of a considerable body representing public opinion. Secondly, in terms of the method of production, although the national political councilors are produced by election and appointment rather than directly elected by the people, the 200 councilors selected and appointed by the government include a wide range of provinces and cities, parties, nationalities, all walks of life, and overseas Chinese, and therefore they can also reflect public opinion to a considerable extent.

"The most important significance and purpose of the establishment of the National Political Council is to concentrate the strength of the entire nation to fight to the death against the forces of aggression in order to achieve victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction" (Chiang Kai-shek). Therefore, the organization of the National Political Council has important significance in the history of China's political development. The first session was convened in Hankou on July 6 last year, at a time when the withdrawal from Xuzhou and the crisis in Wuhan were taking place, so the people of the whole country held a unified attitude of support for the establishment of the National Political Council, which was a considerable body representing public opinion during the war, and put forward many opinions on the first meeting for the councilors to put forward the first meeting in order to provide the government with adoption and implementation. At that time, the most central issues were: how to persist in the War of Resistance and strive for the final victory, how to specifically carry out the defense of Wuhan and strive for the victory of the third phase of the War of Resistance, and how to consolidate and expand the national united front and promote the development of democratic politics. The resolutions of the first meeting generally reached resolutions that conformed to public opinion, which was reflected in the post-recess language and many important resolutions, such as determining the national policy of "fighting the War of Resistance to the end and striving for the final victory of the country and nation", such as announcing the policy of "a united front of the anti-Japanese nation with cooperation between all parties and factions"; such as passing the "Supporting the Outline of War of Resistance and National Construction", "Improving Administrative Institutions at All Levels", "Establishing Provincial and County Political Councils", "Implementing Democratic Politics", "Improving People's Livelihood during the War of Resistance" and other proposals.

The first session of the General Assembly closed on July 15 last year, and then adjourned. The second session of the General Assembly was reconvened in Chongqing on October 28 last year. The convocation of this meeting came after the national army withdrew from Guangzhou and Wuhan. Undoubtedly, China's War of Resistance had entered a more arduous stage. On the one hand, the × people and traitors were taking advantage of this opportunity to spread rumors, saying that China would definitely split and embark on the road of compromise and surrender at this time. At the same time, the pro-Japanese peace faction and defeatists were spreading a pessimistic and hopeless atmosphere, and in fact, they were helping the × people to gain momentum. The second session of the National Political Council was held at such a serious juncture, and naturally aroused close attention from the people of the whole country and international friends. This meeting, aimed at the serious situation at the time, resolutely cracked down on the pro-Japanese peace faction and the defeatists' attempt to compromise and surrender to the ×, and smashed the Japanese Fascist ××'s poison scheme of spreading rumors, slandering, and sowing discord, and enthusiastically embraced the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek and his declaration of adhering to the War of Resistance and never surrendering: On this point, from the General Assembly, Chen Shao Yu and other 73 councilors proposed "Supporting Chairman Chiang and the National Government to Intensify National Unity to Persist in Sustained Resistance Case", Councilors Zhang Yiying and other 41 politicians proposed "For the War of Resistance to the End, the Government Should Be Ordered to Promulgate a Decree to Prevent Anti-Minyan to Determine the Public Opinion Case", Councilor Chen Jia Geng and other 21 people proposed "No Peace Talks Before the Japanese × Has Withdrawn from My Individual Territory Case", Councilor Wang Zao Shi and other 66 people proposed "The Political Council Should Issue a Declaration to Embrace Chairman Chiang's Book to the People to Call on the Whole Country to Unite and Rise Up to Continue the War of Resistance Case". It was unanimously passed that the following resolution: "Embracing Chairman Chiang's declared policy of full-scale resistance and sustained resistance to strive for the initiative, in the future, the people of the whole country should resolutely resist the war under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, never surrender, abide by the rules, and complete the task of resisting the war and building the country", which was expressed most clearly. However, when this resolution was passed, it was not without great controversy. Wang ×× and his few wings, who had lost confidence in the future of the War of Resistance and belittled the national strength, even tried to stir up a discussion of peace and war inside and outside the meeting. At that time, Wang ×× not only openly protected and praised the pro-peace Zeng Lun of individual councilors, trying to dispel the proposal of Councilors Chen Jia Geng and others that "all civil servants who dare to talk about peace before ×× has returned the homeland should be regarded as traitors and traitors to the country"; but also publicly defended the councilors who did not pay to express their support for Chairman Chiang and the declaration of resisting the war to the end, and insisted that Zhang Junli make a report on the proposal containing the content against Chairman Chiang at the Political Council, trying to use this to attack the authority of the leader of the resistance war, in order to shake people's hearts and influence national policy; he even made Tao Xisheng and others desperately oppose the proposal of Councilor Chen Shaoyu and others on "Overcoming Difficulties, Passing the Rooster Pass, Persisting in the War of Resistance, and Striving for Victory", trying to use this to break the solidarity of ××××××; However, due to the efforts and struggles of the people of the whole country and the majority of councilors, the result of finally exposing and winning the conspiracy of Wang ×× to undermine the resistance and destroy unity was that ×× not only failed to use the National Political Council as a tool for surrendering to ×, but also exposed his conspiracy to seek peace with ×, which was a major gain of the second session of the National Political Council.

Secondly, the General Assembly also passed the "Please Abolish the Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Method to Fully Reflect Yu Lun and Freedom of Publication Case" proposed by Councilor Zou Taofen and other 74 people, indicating that the councilors are doing their best to promote democratic politics and protect civil rights and freedoms. Finally, the General Assembly also passed the "Improving the Conscription Implementation Law" proposed by Liang Shuming, Li Yuanding, Wang Yaming, Shi Liang and others, the "Strictly Punishing Traitors and Puppets Case" proposed by Lin Zuhan and other 21 people, the "Strengthening National Diplomacy Case" proposed by Wu Yuzhang and other 32 people, the "Vocational Education Implementation Plan" proposed by Jiang Hengyuan and other 21 people, and more than 20 other cases, which are all suggestions for concrete methods to persist in the War of Resistance and strive for victory, and propose practical solutions to the current difficulties.

The success of this conference is not only reflected in the resolutions passed, not only in the enthusiastic debate and sincere unity when discussing and passing the proposals, and not only in the active, responsible suggestions and questions of the councilors and the sincere answers of the heads of various departments and ministries of the government: but also in the fact that most of the councilors abandoned their prejudices and respected each other's personalities when discussing the issues. Although there were heated debates, there were few meaningless disputes. Debate is necessary, it can make the issues clearer, and it can make different opinions tend to be consistent. The vast majority of councilors can adhere to the principle of "no compromise on basic national policies, and specific issues can be discussed", which is the main reason for the success of the conference.

However, there are also shortcomings in the work of this Political Council, the most important of which is the lack of prior preparation. Before the meeting, not only were no proposals submitted to the Political Council, but also no consideration was given to how to enable the councilors to have the opportunity to understand and study the issues in advance after traveling thousands of miles, so that, as in the previous conference, the councilors only began to receive certain materials after entering the Political Council meeting venue and beginning to work, and it was difficult to study them seriously. In the reports of various ministries and committees, in the schedule of meetings, and in the study of proposals, there was a lack of prior preparation. The second is that there is not enough discussion on specific methods. This meeting has more than 80 proposals, which is much less than the more than 100 proposals in the previous meeting, but it has not been able to concentrate several specific and substantive proposals for detailed discussion, so the effect is limited.

Fortunately, after the end of the second Political Council, some of the councilors were able to go to the front line to inspect the war situation, comfort the troops, and go to the rear to investigate the people's feelings and help the government promote various tasks, which is very commendable.

After more than three months of recess, the third session of the National Political Council was convened again in Chongqing on February 12 of this year. From the second session to the third session, although there was only a little more than three months of time, China, in the War of Resistance, has experienced major tests and progress. The main characteristics of the third session that were different from the previous two sessions are:

First, this conference was held after ××××××, during which time, domestic unity, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the anti-Japanese national united front, and the relationship between the various anti-Japanese parties have made some progress;

Second, after the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, although peace and compromise temporarily surfaced, under the strong leadership of Chairman Chiang and the pressure of the frontline soldiers and the people of the whole country insisting on resisting the war to the end, it has temporarily disappeared, and after ×××××××××, the national policy of insisting on resisting the war to the end has been consolidated;

Third, Wang ××, who surrendered to × and sought peace, has been relieved of his post as speaker, which will enable the discussions at this Political Council to reach more united and consistent opinions on the basic national policies of adhering to the War of Resistance and diplomatic policies;

Fourth, Chairman Chiang personally served as the speaker, which will enable the opinions of the Political Council that are beneficial to the War of Resistance facilities to be more quickly reflected to the government and military authorities, so as to reduce the drawbacks of the resolutions of the Political Council in the past being delayed and unable to be realized quickly.

The third session of the General Assembly, in the enthusiastic atmosphere of the whole country unanimously and resolutely cracking down on the near guard's attempt to induce surrender and ××'s absurd act of begging for peace, made the entire body of the Political Council more resolutely and closely united around the national policy of the War of Resistance, and passed the resolution supporting the government's national policy: "Solemnly resolve that the established policy of the War of Resistance must be supported to the end", and called on the people of the whole country to "strengthen their confidence, align their steps, be of one heart and one mind, and go through to the end, in order to restore the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and administration, and complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country". The resolute tone of this resolution, especially the solemn enthusiasm and unanimity when passing the resolution, strongly demonstrated the iron will of our people of the whole country to resist the war unyieldingly and persist to the end, reflecting the major progress between the two sessions - the progress of "turning danger into safety".

The importance and progress of the third session of the General Assembly lies not only in the fact that it passed a resolution supporting the national policy, but also in the fact that it deliberated on the plan to implement the national policy, that is, the various administrative plans for the second phase of the war proposed by the government. Although this plan is only an outline and lacks specific figures and progress, it is still a major manifestation of the progress in the second phase of the War of Resistance. In order to win the victory of the second phase of the War of Resistance, we need a plan with the coordination and connection of all aspects and the military first and victory first as the basis, and this plan has seen its beginning in the third session of the General Assembly.

The General Assembly, on the basis of the important principle that politics is more important than military affairs, passed many resolutions aimed at striving for continuous progress in politics. Such as "Strengthening the Implementation of the Three Principles of the People, Giving Play to the People's Spirit to Benefit the War of Resistance Case" proposed by Councilor Dong Biwu: "Please the Government to Implement Awakening the Virtuous and the Able to Clarify Official Governance Case" proposed by Councilor Luo Wengan and others; "Intending to ask the Government to be Careful in the Selection of County Magistrates and to Improve Treatment to Determine the Term of Office to Strictly Supervise and Amend County Administration to Benefit the War of Resistance and National Construction Case" proposed by Councilor Li Yuanding and others, are all concrete proposals on improving politics. "Please Establish a Democratic Rule of Law System to Lay the Foundation for National Construction Case" proposed by Councilor Zhou Lan and others. Because this so-called case solemnly pointed out that "the principle that our country's politics should be based on democracy and the rule of law to complete national construction is also well known to the people of the country. At this time when the War of Resistance is becoming increasingly beneficial and national construction is beginning, we should sharpen the spirit of democracy and the rule of law and establish a system of democracy and the rule of law, so as to train and achieve substantial achievements as early as possible and establish a solid foundation for the political intentions".

The General Assembly has made even greater progress in cultivating new forces and building military forces by passing important resolutions such as the Case of Accelerating the Expansion of Air Force Construction proposed by Councilor Huang Jianzhong and others, as well as improving conscription implementation and strengthening work behind enemy lines. In terms of economic construction, cultural construction, and education, it has also made major contributions, especially for the construction of Sichuan and Kang, the General Assembly passed the organization of the Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association and the inspection group, which will have a major impetus to the construction of our rear area of the War of Resistance.

Looking at the experience of the National Political Council's three General Assemblies, it has indeed passed a lot of proposals on the national policies and various policies during the War of Resistance, but after these proposals are passed, how many of the government's actions are adopted, how many are implemented, and the specific situation cannot be known. After the "Case of Substantially Protecting the People's Rights" proposed by Councilor Shen Junru and others at the first General Assembly and the "Case of Protecting Freedom of Speech and Publication" proposed by Councilor Zou Taofen and others at the second General Assembly were passed, the government must refer to the resolutions of the Political Council to make the plan concrete and practical in the future, and on the other hand, it must implement the plan strictly. Only implementation can make the plan have true value and effect.

The reason why the Political Council can become a considerable body representing public opinion during the war and can gain the considerable trust of the people is that the work of the Political Council in the past six months since its establishment, due to the efforts of the councilors and the supervision of national opinion and the people of the whole country, can indeed reflect public opinion to a considerable extent, as Chairman Chiang said at this session of the Political Council: "The purpose of convening the National Political Council is to concentrate the strength of the whole country to eliminate the unprecedented national crisis and gather the will of the whole country to establish the foundation for national construction". Moreover, the people of the whole country are more eager to be able to pass through this transitional method of a wartime body representing public opinion to achieve true democratic politics. The responsibility of the Political Council is not only to be able to constantly reflect the opinions of the people to the government, but also to assist the government to gradually promote democratic politics, so that public opinion can be promoted and politics can become more progressive, as Chairman Chiang said: "What I sincerely hope from all councilors is that everyone should first establish mutual trust and common trust, and that everything should be open and honest, and that we should create a harmonious and friendly atmosphere like brothers and feet, that there is nothing that cannot be said directly, and that there is nothing that cannot be understood together. On the one hand, we must weigh the collection of public opinion. We must truly represent public opinion and fully promote public opinion; we must know everything and say everything, so that there is complete mutual understanding, harmony, and thoroughness between the government and society, without the slightest hindrance."

In order for the National Political Council to complete such a task, not only do all councilors need to work harder, but also the people of the whole country need to work together and supervise. As Chairman Chiang said in his closing remarks: "The historical mission of this Council is to lay the foundation for democratic politics, especially to lay the foundation for permanent and true democratic politics", "The people of a country, if they cannot be concerned about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is to say, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, they cannot create a strong country."

China is beginning to move towards the path of democratic politics, which is the need of the War of Resistance. In this regard, although our achievements are not yet great, we will be able to continue to progress under the joint efforts of the whole country. We certainly cannot say that a transitional body representing public opinion does not have its drawbacks, but in general, the work of the past few sessions of the General Assembly has shown its considerable effect on the reform of politics and the promotion of the War of Resistance. When objective circumstances allow it to have progressive development, its effect can still be expanded and enriched. The direction of future efforts lies in strengthening the development of this body representing public opinion, and gradually transforming the current National Political Council and the councils that are being prepared in various provinces into bodies that truly represent public opinion.

### The Economic Plunder of China by Japan in North China

(Jinxi Dispatch) The fall of North China has been over a year now. What exactly have the Japanese warlords seized? This question is what every patriotic Chinese comrade is eager to know. Indeed, in the current stage of our prolonged war of resistance, the power supporting both sides of our war has gone beyond the scope of military and political aspects and has entered the realm of whether or not there is economic combat capability. The reason why the Japanese warlords have tried to end the war nine times and avoid prolonged combat as much as possible is precisely because they lack economic combat capability. At the same time, if the war inevitably continues, the Japanese will inevitably seek a solution to the panic of economic problems in China. Therefore, a part of China's vast resources has subsidized the enemy. What a huge natural loss this is!

Here, we must determine the basic strategy of the war of resistance. We must expand the scope of the struggle, not only attacking the enemy's offensive politically and militarily, but also destroying the foundation of the enemy's economic aggression. In our economic construction during the war of resistance, on the one hand, we must build a solid national defense economy, and on the other hand, we must support private economic activities as much as possible. In addition, we must effectively destroy the enemy's economic plans! This is the three-part movement of economic construction in our war of resistance. One part is missing, and it cannot support the prolonged war of resistance. Therefore, we cannot ignore the enemy's economic plans. We must deeply understand the essence of the enemy's various conspiracies in order to plan effective countermeasures. This is our motivation for collecting the enemy's economic construction data.

I. The Enemy's "Seizure Agencies"

1. Pseudo Sino-Japanese Economic Agreement Council:

The enemy's "seizure agencies" for carrying out economic conspiracies were organized one after another after the establishment of the puppet government. In March of last year, the Japanese Terauchi Hisaichi and the traitor Wang Kemin signed an agreement to establish the "Sino-Japanese Economic Agreement Council," composed of five members from the enemy and the puppet government, with the traitor Wang Kemin as the chairman, deciding to take "the comprehensive development of industrial resources in North China" as the main task.

2. Pseudo China United Reserve Bank

In the financial aspect, the pseudo China United Reserve Bank is the enemy's main "seizure agency." The puppet government announced the bank regulations in February, appointing the traitor Shi Huang as the president, with a capital of 50 million yuan, serving as the central bank of North China and the only bank issuing banknotes. It was stipulated that the banknotes of the pseudo United Bank were the new legal tender, universally used, and all kinds of legal tender originally in circulation were prohibited from circulation after June 11.

3. Revision of Tariffs after Forcibly Taking Over Customs:

After the establishment of the puppet government, it forcibly took over the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao customs. After the end of the war in Shandong, it reopened the Qingdao customs and stipulated different regulations for the export and import of Japanese goods, national goods, and foreign goods. This method of the Japanese obviously contains the role of economic monopoly, so it is also one of the seizure agencies.

4. Pseudo North China Development Company

The pseudo Xingzhong Company was dissolved at the end of October last year with the establishment of the pseudo North China Development Company. All enterprises previously controlled by the Xingzhong Company were taken over by the North China Development Company. The original employees of the Xingzhong Company were also transferred to the Development Company, and the capital has now been increased to 350 million yuan.

II. What the Japanese Seize

1. Financial Aspect:

A. Issue Paper Money and Absorb Legal Tender as Much as Possible:

We deeply understand that the Japanese economic panic cannot but be compensated by the excessive issuance of paper money. The above-mentioned pseudo China United Reserve Bank is the only banknote issuing agency. At the end of last year, the amount of issuance had reached a huge 100 million yuan. Other pseudo Mengjiang banks also issued more than 30 million yuan. Although there are no accurate statistics for various industrial banks, the number is also not small. (To be continued)

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor:
I read Mr. Yang Jingtong's article "Overseas Chinese Education in the Philippines" published in your newspaper on March 27. It is completely inconsistent with the facts and is extremely insulting to the overseas Chinese and education colleagues on this island. I am very surprised. After investigation, the overseas Chinese education on this island is being improved under the efforts of this association, such as the discussion of the school system and curriculum, and the implementation of the wartime education plan. The facts are all there. Yang Jingtong is one of the directors of this association. If he has any opinions, he should make suggestions to this association. Instead, he disregards the facts and talks nonsense. His purpose is only to exaggerate the Hongguang School he runs and undermine this association's plan for improving overseas Chinese education. In order to rectify discipline, this association convened the sixth plenary meeting of the board of directors and questioned Yang Jingtong on the spot. Mr. Yang still argued sophistically, which aroused public anger. In addition to unanimously resolving to cancel Yang Jingtong's attendance qualifications, he also wrote a rebuttal. Now I am sending the rebuttal (text omitted, editor's note) and asking you to publish it in your newspaper to correct the public's perception, so that people at home and abroad can understand the true situation of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines. Sincerely, to the editors of Shenbao, the Philippine Overseas Chinese Education Association, May 17, 1938.

### General Retreat of the Enemy Army on the Border of Hubei and Henan Provinces; Enemy Forces in Xinye, Tongbai, and Zaoyang are All Eliminated; Our Army Continues to Advance and Pressure Suixian and Yingshan

[Nanyang Dispatch from This Newspaper on the 20th] Since our attack in northern Hubei and southern Henan, enemy casualties have indeed reached 20,000. The enemy has been completely eliminated from the areas of Xinye, Tanghe, Tongbai, and Zaoyang. The remaining enemy forces have retreated and gathered in the Suixian, Yingshan, and Xihe areas, with morale depressed. We are continuing to attack. Near Tianmen and Jingshan, we are also taking the initiative to attack the enemy.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 21st from This Newspaper] According to a telegram from Guizhou, the east bank of the Gan River and the tributaries of the Fu River in Jiangxi Province are completely under our control. We have been constantly attacking the enemy in the towns of Niuhang, Liantang, Xiangtang, and Dudu, and have captured many prisoners. A unit of our army once attacked near Nanchang yesterday. The enemy was caught off guard, and many were killed by our army.

[Central News Agency, Chengcen, 22nd] We have been sweeping away the remaining enemy forces on the Han-Yi and Jing-Zhong roads, with daily victories.

Active Operations of Our Army in Hebei and Shandong; Intermittent Traffic on the Pinghan and Jinpu Lines

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] According to a dispatch from Tianjin, traffic on all lines in North China is in a state of intermittent disruption. Although the enemy on the Jinpu Railway has started full traffic, tickets to Pukou are sold in Tianjin, but no passengers inquire about them. Moreover, this through train cannot arrive at the station on time when traveling south from Tianjin. In recent days, the southbound train has sometimes been unable to reach Jinan, because the northern section of the track is sometimes destroyed. The opening hours of the Pinghan and Pinghuan railways have also been inaccurate recently. It is said that 52 bridges on the Tianjin-eastern section of the Beining Railway in the eastern Hebei area were once destroyed.

[Minge News Agency, Xingji, 11th] Since the 10th and 11th, our army has been attacking the enemy along the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines and destroying enemy traffic. The situation is as follows: (1) Three miles of the railway in Shuangmiaonian County, Pinghan, were destroyed by us, five miles of the telegraph poles were cut down, and 1,300 catties of telegraph wires were dismantled. Then two enemy trains arrived at the destroyed area and were attacked by us, killing more than 30 enemy soldiers. (2) About seven miles of the railway north of Handan were destroyed by us, all the sleepers were burned, and more than 300 catties of telegraph wires were dismantled. (3) A unit of our army destroyed two miles of the railway between Xingtai and Guanzhuang, engaging in a fierce battle with the road protection enemy for half an hour. The enemy suffered considerable casualties. (4) Two miles of the railway in Fengduan, Neiqiu, were destroyed by us, more than 100 catties of telegraph wires were dismantled, and the road protection enemy was defeated, killing more than 1,000 enemy soldiers. (5) More than ten miles of the highway between Gaoyi and Zanhuang were destroyed by us, and we engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy near Gushan for several hours, killing more than ten enemy soldiers. (6) Seventeen miles of the highway near Lincheng were destroyed by us, and two bridges were blown up. (7) Three miles of the railway southeast of Jingxing on the Zheng-Ren line were destroyed by us, and an enemy locomotive was blown up. A unit of the enemy in Jingxing pursued us and was defeated by us, killing more than 20 enemy soldiers. Another unit of our army dismantled more than 200 catties of telegraph wires near the Jingxing coal factory.

[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 21st] More than 500 enemy soldiers in Xingtai attacked westward in three routes on the morning of the 11th. After a fierce battle with a unit of our army for more than two hours, the enemy could not resist and fled back to Xingtai. More than 800 enemy soldiers, including infantry and artillery, from Biyang, Anping, Boye, and Huixian attacked Guandi in four routes on the morning of the 10th. They engaged in a fierce battle with a unit of our army for two days and nights. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. They are still confronting each other.

[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 21st] The enemy in Zhengdian, northern Shandong, used eight vehicles to carry more than 100 enemy soldiers to attack the east and west Cui Nuoting (south of Yang'an Town) the night before. They were intercepted by a unit of our army. After a fierce battle for more than two hours, 40 enemy soldiers were killed and four enemy vehicles were destroyed. As we were solving the battle, more than 500 enemy soldiers, including infantry and cavalry, from Shanhua Bridge came to harass us in ten vehicles. After a fierce battle for half an hour, we withdrew safely due to the disparity in strength.

Our Army in Shanxi Recovers Tumen; 8,000 Enemy Soldiers Killed in the Battle of Guzhen

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 21st] According to a telephone call from the front, a unit of our army launched a surprise attack on Tumen at 12:00 pm on the 19th, stormed into the village, and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy all night. Finally, at 8:00 am on the 20th, they defeated the enemy and recovered Tumen, capturing many prisoners. The enemy in Heilongguan was shaken by the fact that the road to support was cut off by us, and they strictly guarded their strongholds to prevent our attacks. The enemy forces in Tu-Hei attempted to attack westward several times, but failed. Now that Tumen has been recovered by us and traffic is interrupted, it is not difficult to annihilate them. There have been contacts in the Jinxi Jinxiang Town area for days. Our army launched a large-scale counterattack on the night of the 19th. The fighting was particularly fierce in Jinxiang Town, Kangjialing, and Gaoduibao. More than 1,000 enemy soldiers were surrounded by us and could not communicate with each other. Our army fought bravely and the enemy broke through and retreated, most of them fleeing to Jinxi, and a part of 400-500 in the city fled to Xiyincun, northeast of Jinxiang. Now there is no trace of the enemy in Jinxiang.

[Central News Agency, Dali, 21st] Several hundred enemy infantry and cavalry with two cannons in Guzhen (north of Hejin) were suddenly attacked by a unit of our army at 10:00 pm the day before yesterday. They engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy for three hours, destroying one enemy cannon and killing 70-80 enemy soldiers. The captain of the Hejin Jianmu team was seriously injured. The enemy in Jicheng has suffered more than 1,000 casualties in total after continuous attacks by a unit of our army. Their seriously injured officers and soldiers were cremated together with the enemy corpses.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 21st] Shang Wujian, the pseudo-Imperial Army of Linxi, and Fan Dingbang, the Imperial Army of Ronghe, defected one after another.

### Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Enthusiastically Donate; Amount Reaches 10 Million Yuan

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 20th] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have donated 10 million yuan. Overseas Chinese in this city have donated 4.5 million yuan, and overseas Chinese in other major cities in the Dutch East Indies have also donated generously, not lagging behind. The Batavia Xinbao, the largest newspaper run by overseas Chinese here, raised 1 million yuan in donations. The newspaper was fined and suspended for eight days due to misunderstandings with the local government. However, the editors of the newspaper took advantage of the suspension period to visit famous overseas Chinese everywhere to raise donations, and the results were remarkable. The overseas Chinese in Java are very enthusiastic about forming a front-line rescue team, and the amount of Chinese medicines they have shipped back is particularly large. Because the East Indies are originally famous for producing quinine and other medicines, the overseas Chinese here know that malaria is prevalent in the war zone in China, so they are stepping up the movement to donate medicines.

### Encyclopedia of China Collected by the University of Vladivostok

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] TASS News Agency, Vladivostok, 21st. The Department of Literature of the Far Eastern Library of the National University of Vladivostok has the largest collection of Soviet literature, including a 500-volume Chinese medical encyclopedia, which is extremely valuable. It was compiled by hundreds of people over decades, and contains all the manuscripts or printed books that have been passed down for a thousand years about Chinese culture.

### Another Conflict Between the Soviet Union and Japan; News Released from Changchun; Soviet Warships Concentrated in Vladivostok

[Haitong News Agency, Changchun, 21st] Yesterday, Saturday, it was announced here that at 11:10 am on Friday, Soviet border guards fired shots at the Japanese garrison in Taiping Town (translation) south of Mishan on the eastern border of the puppet Manchuria. The puppet Manchurian government protested to the Soviet Union on Saturday, and the protest letter has been forwarded to Moscow by the Soviet Consul General in Harbin.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 21st] The Soviet Union's "Truth" published an editorial on the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on extending the current service period of the Navy. The editorial stated that the number of Soviet warships is increasing year by year, their technical equipment is constantly improving, and their combat power is increasing daily. The Baltic and Black Sea Fleets are developing, and their strength will be even stronger. A complete fleet has been created in the North Sea. As for the Pacific, Soviet warships are gathered in the port of Vladivostok, as stable as Mount Tai. During the civil war, the Red Navy soldiers fought against the enemy and showed amazing battle continuations. Their heroic names are known to all. The Soviet Red Navy strictly adheres to its combat tradition. Our country's heroic sailors are diligently learning double-handed techniques in preparation for the enemy's imminent battle. The Soviet Union is building fleets of deep sea and ocean warships. The extension of the naval service period is the most important means to guarantee the strengthening of the Soviet Union's national defense forces. Sailors are highly respected in our country, and the Soviet state has taken various practical methods to enable its sailors to perform the greatest possible service. Soviet sailors warmly welcome the government's decree on extending the service period, and grand exercises have been held on various warships, where touching speeches naturally expressing the Soviet patriotic sentiment have been made. In the not-too-distant future, the Soviet Navy will become the most powerful navy in the world.

### The Yen Falls Again; Reason is Capital Flight; Enemy Unable to Rescue

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] News from Shanghai: The enemy currency is increasingly falling sharply here. In exchange shops, one enemy currency can only be exchanged for 98.3 cents of legal currency. This matter has caused extreme anxiety on the enemy's side. In addition to suppressing enemy officials and civilians from engaging in thrift, the enemy is also preventing large amounts of enemy currency from flowing into the south bank of the Suzhou River to support it. The Finance Officer of the Enemy Ministry of Finance stationed in Taiwan returned to China on the 20th to discuss rescue measures with the enemy authorities, attempting to rescue the situation. The Finance Affairs Commissioner of the East Asian Bureau of the Enemy Asian Development Agency stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Office of the Bank of Japan are working hard to cooperate and implement various rescue measures, but all measures are still ineffective, and the enemy's financial turmoil is becoming more obvious.

[Central News Agency, Junqing, 21st] News from outside Shanghai: Foreign bankers here said that the depreciation of the yen is due to the fact that domestic purchases of foreign exchange in Japan are extremely restricted, so Japanese merchants have come to Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange in large quantities, resulting in a large amount of yen flowing to Shanghai.

### Japan Will Conclude a Military Alliance with Germany and Italy; Discussed and Decided by the Five-Minister Conference; Attempt to Take Retaliatory Action Against Democratic Countries

[Tokyo, 20th] News from abroad: After a lengthy meeting, important Japanese cabinet members announced to the Japanese press today that "Japan's policy toward the European situation has been finally decided." The nature of the final decision has not yet been announced, but it is speculated by well-informed sources in Tokyo that it is related to the establishment of a direct alliance with the Axis powers. For several weeks, Germany and Italy have been stepping up pressure on Japan to join the alliance, but there have also been strong opponents within the Japanese government. Japanese military officials have never concealed their desire to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. It can be seen that Hiranuma and Arita may be powerful figures among the opponents. However, since the Gulangyu Incident and the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States bluntly refused to change the administrative structure of the Shanghai International Settlement, the military has been given an opportunity to promote its policies in an intangible way. It is said that the atmosphere in the meeting of important Japanese cabinet members was unusually tense, and it took two and a half hours of debate to resolve the final decision, which shows that the opinions were not consistent. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai spoke the most in the cabinet meeting. According to various interviews with Japanese newspapers, Arita suddenly turned from the front line of opposing the alliance to supporting it in recent days, while Navy Minister Yonai firmly opposed this alliance. However, before the official announcement of the content of its settled agreement, all criticisms are speculative, and it is not too early to avoid them. After the meeting, Hiranuma reported the progress of the meeting to the Emperor and informed other cabinet members who did not participate in the meeting. It is said that Arita will give a lecture to the Privy Council next Wednesday to clarify Japan's attitude towards various issues in the international situation at that time.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Yesterday, Saturday, the cabinet held a secret meeting to decide on the policy to be taken on the European situation. Although the Japanese newspapers did not publish its resolution at all, according to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the participants in this secret meeting were Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, and Finance Minister Ishiwata. They unanimously decided to adopt a policy of responding to Europe. It is said that the Japanese government has resolved not to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy, but to adopt a neutral policy, but still to be favorable to the two countries during the outbreak of the war. However, this report is completely fictitious. According to political circles here, the Japanese government is still divided into two factions this year. The military advocates signing a military alliance with Germany and Italy, but the diplomatic circles and the party do not want to conclude a military alliance, resulting in a direct attack on the United States. Moreover, the military's organ newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" wrote a commentary stating that various departments in Japan have requested that the Anti-Comintern Pact be expanded into a military alliance, but the only purpose of this alliance is to directly attack the Soviet Union, but it is useless now that the Sino-Japanese war is in progress, resulting in an attack on the United Kingdom.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 20th] It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Minister notified the cabinet today that the navy and marines have been ordered to withdraw from the Gulangyu Incident in order to seek a peaceful solution. In summary, the procedure discussed at today's meeting of senior cabinet members was to decide whether to accept the invitation of the German-Italian Axis powers on strict principles, so that it would be better than having nothing to gain. The cabinet has approved the resolution of the meeting of senior cabinet members, and this matter will not require a meeting with the Emperor to resolve, because the consent of the Emperor had been obtained in advance. Yesterday's meeting also sought to eliminate different opinions on the progress of the cabinet. The Japanese Prime Minister spent the weekend at a villa near Yokohama. Konoe attended yesterday's cabinet meeting. Cabinet members hoped that this resolution could accelerate the resolution of the war in China, so as to avoid standing in opposition to the democratic countries.

### Chongqing After the Bombing

— Li Jinsheng

The third of May was a day with ten thousand miles of clear sky, devoid of clouds. The mountain city of Chongqing was bathed in bright sunlight. Such clear weather is exceptionally rare in Sichuan, but the people of Sichuan did not welcome it!

At noon, the school bell rang twelve times. Suddenly, a piercing, hoarse sound tore through the air. Woo! Woo! Woo! Stimulated by this ominous sound, people scattered frantically toward both sides of the Yangtze River. For half an hour, the sharp, hoarse sound was like needles, plunging the entire mountain city into a midnight-like silence. Only the distant sound of heavy bombers, Hong, Hong, Hong, Hong, grew nearer and nearer. Then came the deafening explosions. Thirty-six enemy planes created a flesh-and-blood-splattering "May Third"!

At 2:30 PM, the enemy planes departed, but the fire blazed red across the entire mountain city. Daliangzi, Shenxiankou, Xia Xinfeng Street, Shaanxi Street, Chuqimen – the fires burned through everything, turning everything into ashes. Thousands of fire dragons writhed fiercely into the sky, crackling and hissing in unison. Magnificent buildings collapsed askew. Bricks and stones, shattered by the flames, flew in all directions. It was truly a fire of unprecedented scale! Caoping Street, which had been hit by heavy bombs but had not caught fire, was half-scorched earth. Zhicheng Alley and Bingzi Alley were completely gone. To the left of Caoping Street was a deep, gaping pit. Most tragically, at the passenger wharf in Chuqimen, when the air raid alarm sounded, the passengers, workers, and coolies all sought refuge on the cargo boats. The hateful enemy, seeing so many people, dropped a heavy bomb. Wooden planks, steel beams, and the arms, legs, flesh, and blood of over seven hundred people flew into the surging, rolling currents. Bodies tumbled in the waves, and heads bobbed in the river. The waters of the Yangtze were dyed red with blood. Over seven hundred people, those seven hundred-plus people, were churned into a mass of meat paste in the blood-red river, devoured by the waves. Over seven hundred people were instantly destroyed by the heinous Japanese enemy!

A similarly tragic and horrifying scene occurred on the banks of the Yangtze River, inside an air raid shelter. There were over three hundred people inside. The enemy dropped an incendiary bomb at the entrance of the shelter. The wind blew into the cave, filling it with the smell of sulfur. All three hundred people in the shelter were suffocated to death in their dreams. Infants in swaddling clothes swelled to twice their size, and black blood flowed from their ears and noses.

Refugees in the bombed area desperately tried to rescue their children and mothers. Mud figures dragged from the rubble, their hands and feet twitching before going still. The rescuers paused, gritted their teeth, and threw themselves into the inferno to perish together. The cries before death, and the stench of charred human flesh, made one want to die! Beneath the flaming torchlight and swirling clouds of smoke, our houses collapsed one after another, and the Ta Kung Pao newspaper office was also destroyed!

Qingping Association and Chuanyan Yili were also in the disaster area. Although they were not directly hit by bombs, two buildings were destroyed. The enemy treated these two places with forty-six-jin stones. The enemy planes not only carried stone bombs, but also dropped ten large packages of "New Moon Brand" cigarettes wrapped in soft red paper.

The blood-and-flesh-splattering "May Third" was the most shameful day the enemy gave us. On this day, the enemy incurred a blood debt of over three thousand lives to us!

II

The stench of blood from "May Third" had not yet dried, and the enemy delivered an even greater blood debt to us on "May Fourth"! The enemy's intention was to destroy our new capital, Chongqing. Twenty-seven enemy planes flew towards us at eleven o'clock, twisting and turning, only passing our air defense outposts, arriving over Chongqing City at six o'clock in the afternoon. The enemy planes were originally arrayed in the shape of a "person." As they flew over the riverbank, they suddenly changed into a straight line, dropping bombs indiscriminately on the city. Instantly, fires erupted everywhere. Xinfeng Street, Shaanxi Street, Nandou, Xiufeng Street, West Fourth Street, the commercial district, Douyou Street, Ji Street, Taiyanggou, Baixiang Street, Daizi Street, Caoping Street, Shiban Slope... all turned into volcanoes. The magnificent buildings of the Hunter & Company watch store and the China National Goods Company were slowly destroyed in the flames. The entire Guotai Grand Theater was burned to the ground. Over five hundred people in the neighboring air raid shelter did not escape – it was truly an unprecedented catastrophe!

In Tieban Street, the Central News Agency collapsed after being hit by a bomb. On the roadside was a heartbreaking, bloody picture: a woman with a child in a bamboo basket on her back, holding a child tightly by the right hand, and another child by the left hand. Her abdomen had been blown open by a bomb, and an unborn infant was lying in a pool of intestines. All five lay quietly in a pool of blood. I no longer believe this is the human world – even in hell, you couldn't find such a cruel scene!

Lianglukou and Tongyuanmen were high ground, a very steep road leading upwards. When the fire broke out, it was like a magnificent volcano. Thousands of houses were burned to the ground, not one left standing. The scale of the fire was imaginable.

The fire grew bigger and bigger, burning until one o'clock, then two o'clock, continuing through the night, until the next day. People rescuing along the streets flowed like water. Thousands of water dragons attacked the fire dragons, swirling into a mass. The screams of the wounded, the crackling of burning wood and stone, and the stench of human flesh made one unable to hear or see. Chongqing was entirely enveloped in red light. People's faces were drained of color, carrying young children and running blindly into the distance.

Power poles fell, their long bodies lying in the streets. Electrical wires scattered on the ground, weaving an irregular web. In the great fire, the entire German Consulate was burned by the enemy's bombs, while the large waterworks next to it was safe and sound. The towering water tower still stood tall. Was it that the enemy's bombing skills were too poor, or were they deliberately opposing the Allied nations?

The fire continued to burn, and countless houses and properties continued to be destroyed!

III

In Chongqing after the disaster, during the day, people could no longer be seen walking on the streets. Douyou Street and Lianglukou streets were deserted. Everywhere one looked, there were broken walls and ruins, walls burned red, telephone poles and beams turned to charcoal. A foul, pungent smell made one dizzy. The bombed-out areas were frighteningly dark at night, with not a single shadow to be found. The desolation and misery were indescribable!

In the Yangtze River, during the day, apart from soldiers and messengers carrying official business, no one could be seen crossing the river in small boats!

Houses and shops near the disaster area were mostly closed. Not a single good pane of glass could be found in the doors and windows. Travelers from outside the city went out during the day to avoid the air raid alarms, but could not find a place to spend money on food when they returned at night, so they all left hungry!

In total, the enemy planes’ mad bombing of Chongqing destroyed no fewer than five thousand buildings. No fewer than ten thousand of our compatriots were bombed to death or burned to death. The prosperity of the entire city was reduced to ashes, but our military institutions and political and economic organs were undamaged. We can see very clearly the reason for the enemy planes' mad bombing of Chongqing. The enemy was indeed using such cruel and terrifying methods to cover up their floundering feet because of the failures on various battlefields and our daily improvement in military affairs. But we believe that our compatriots who have been victimized will surely endure our blood and tears, grit our teeth, and demand this blood debt from the enemy! (Written in Chongqing after the bombing on May 10)

### The Miao People of Guizhou

— Ye Juesun

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The total number of Miao people in Guizhou Province is approximately 3.7 million, accounting for nearly half of the province's population. Moreover, the areas where the Miao people live are mostly mountainous regions rich in minerals. Therefore, in the development of the Southwest, how to mobilize these ethnic groups is a question worthy of our research.

In general medical books and geography textbooks, the description of the Miao people seems to have become a stereotypical formula. Invariably, it is nothing more than "short clothes, floral skirts, barefoot, walking, hair coiled in strange styles, wearing silver ornaments, conservative customs, and not interacting with Han culture." The section describing the Miao people's clothing is fairly accurate, because usually, we can see Miao women in various parts of Guizhou wearing short clothes and skirts. However, the skirts are not entirely floral; some are blue. And the hairstyles on their heads have many different types. Some wear silver ornaments, while others do not. Therefore, due to the differences in various styles, the Han people give them different names, such as Green Miao, Floral Miao, White Miao, Twisted-Head Miao... a total of no fewer than seventy or eighty types. There are also names based on the areas where they live, such as East Miao, West Miao... The more advanced Miao people are called Yi people and Tujia. Most of the Yi people and Tujia can speak Han Chinese, and are almost completely the same as the Han people. Among them, there is also a group called Songjia Miao, who can be considered the most cultured group among the Miao people. According to them, they are descendants of Duke Xiang of Song from the Warring States period, and they even have their own script. Whether this is reliable is difficult to verify.

It is true that the Miao people are conservative, because the areas where they live are all in remote mountainous areas, such as the villages of Songtao, Tongren, Jiangkou, Longli, and Fan Ding... in these counties, transportation is very difficult, and there are very few opportunities for contact with the outside world. Therefore, all customs and habits are still according to the old ways. As for the statement that they "do not interact with Han culture," in fact, it is somewhat untrue. The Miao people not only have already begun to integrate with Han culture, but also regard it as a supreme honor. At the "gan chang" – market days – in every town in Guizhou, we can encounter many Miao people. However, as long as they can speak Han Chinese, they absolutely refuse to admit that they are Miao people. "You are very Miao" and "You are very rustic" are phrases that can almost be considered a specialty of Guizhou. They mean, "You are too unsophisticated and don't understand anything; you're just like a Miao person." Tracing the origins of this phrase, it is naturally due to the past contempt of the Han people for the Miao people. However, on the other hand, it has had the opposite effect. Since the Miao people know that they are despised, they strive to integrate with Han culture, trying their best to learn Han customs and language, hoping to become like the Han people. Therefore, the previous contempt for the Miao people has become an invisible factor promoting the integration of the Miao people with Han culture. This situation is certainly not right and is mostly a thing of the past. Now, the Guizhou provincial authorities pay great attention to this issue. To avoid making the Miao people feel uneasy, all taboo words such as "Miao," "rustic," and "Yi" are avoided as much as possible to avoid increasing the divide. In Guizhou, the Miao and Han are like two brothers in a family, with the same rights and obligations. Therefore, the view of the Miao people must be new and the old formula abandoned.

Guihai Hengzhi has a few sentences about the Miao people's living habits: "Eating must first be a sacrifice. The Miao people eat with their hands, which shows the legacy of the three ancient times." From this, it can be seen that the Miao people's lives have a distinctive feature, and at the same time, this has also led to many problems:

The Miao people love to eat beef, but they are also very superstitious and feel that eating too much beef is a great sin. Therefore, some Miao people in southern Guizhou even use the method of eating cow dung to atone for their sins. Although this dung is from the stomach to the intestines and has not yet left the abdomen, from a health perspective, it is still not very appropriate.

The way they live also needs to be improved. Usually, people and animals live together. Upstairs is the bed, and downstairs are pigs and horses. In addition, the climate in Guizhou is humid and there is a lot of miasma, so there are many people among the Miao people who suffer from dysentery and malaria. Moreover, after they get sick, they do not ask for a doctor, but only invite a kind of person called "Miao Laonai" to "hit the evil spirits." There are many ways to "hit the evil spirits," but they generally involve hanging a chicken or other small animal from the beam and then cutting off its head. It is said that this can remove evil and cure diseases, but of course, this is a superstitious method.

When it comes to clothing, the Miao people are very simple. Women do not wear pants, only skirts, because wearing skirts makes it easier to spread their legs, which is convenient for climbing mountains, walking, and farming.

Moreover, Miao women only wear two sets of skirts throughout their lives: one for going up the mountain and one for "gan chang." The material is very durable homespun cloth.

The Miao people's marriage is quite free. The dances held in the suburbs every spring and autumn are a good opportunity for men and women to choose a spouse. After marriage, the bride does not live in the husband's house, but still lives in her mother's house, so the first son is often not the creation of the groom.

In summary, both Miao men and women are very healthy, able to work hard, good at reclaiming wasteland, and their diligence and frugality are especially worthy of our learning. During the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods of the Qing Dynasty, halls were established to govern the Miao people. At first, the Miao chiefs regarded officials as if they were gods and were very respectful to the government. As a result, the general officials were very tyrannical and oppressive to the Miao people, and the number of Han people migrating to Guizhou also increased day by day. In three or four decades, the Miao people's residential areas were almost completely occupied. The Miao people were indignant and advocated driving out the guest people and restoring their homeland. Therefore, there was the Miao Rebellion of the sixtieth year of Qianlong. Later, the Qing court mobilized tens of thousands of elite soldiers from Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces to quell the rebellion. When Minister Chuan Ding was in charge of border affairs, he strengthened military preparations on one hand and established Miao schools on the other, implementing the so-called "half military, half political" ruling method, and delineated three thousand miles of land centered on Guizhou in the southeast as the Miao territory to limit the scope of their activities... This traditional, somewhat imperialistic, erroneous policy has now been completely abandoned. (About Relief Society)

### League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting to Discuss China's Application. British Aid China Association Issues Declaration Demanding Sanctions Against Japan

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 21st] The League of Nations Administrative Council Standing Committee is scheduled to open tomorrow. The only important international issue on the agenda is China's application. However, Britain and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly use this opportunity to vigorously conduct diplomatic negotiations. The Danzig issue is not included in the agenda. The Advisory Committee does not intend to discuss it at all, and it is also possible that the public thinks that now is not the time to discuss this explosive issue. British Foreign Secretary Halifax plans to issue a statement on the East Silesian issue at the meeting, which has been determined.

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] The 105th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to open in Geneva on the 22nd. China's application has been included in the agenda. The British Aid China Movement has issued a declaration requesting that the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly and the Administrative Council at all times, that is, the resolution advocating that member states individually aid China, should be implemented immediately. The method is nothing more than the following three points: (1) Refuse to supply Japan with war materials, especially aircraft, which should be prohibited from being exported to that country; (2) Boycott Japanese goods, so as to inflict a major blow on the country's economic foundation in a short period of time; (3) Provide financial and economic assistance to China to build the southwest provinces, develop industrial cooperation movements, and relieve refugees in the war zones. The above actions should be adjusted by a committee established by the Administrative Council to improve its efficiency. Recently, the governments of some member states of the League of Nations have declared that they are willing to uphold the collective security system. The League of Nations Administrative Council can indeed help China, which is to provide further security for the collective security system. Also, the United States is willing to actively participate in aid to China, which can be seen in President Roosevelt's recent remarks.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 21st] Hu Shize, China's representative to the League of Nations, and Fuller, an American expert on opium issues, reported to the League of Nations Opium Committee yesterday on the illegal promotion of the opium trade by the Japanese in the occupied areas. Representative Hu stated that the Japanese openly sheltered opium dens and secret drug factories, and the only condition was that opium dealers must pay taxes. The Japanese consulate was the center for distributing drugs, and transportation was carried out by military trucks and warships. This measure by the Japanese obviously constitutes a major threat to the world, and world public opinion should immediately find ways to stop it.

### Progress in British-Soviet Negotiations. Final Consultations in Geneva. Rumor British Will Accept Soviet Suggestions.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] According to last night's news, Britain intends to ease its opposition to the Soviet Union's proposals. Reliable sources predict that the cabinet on the 24th will approve the conclusion of a military alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union, or the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union following the precedent of the Franco-Soviet Pact.

[Associated Press, London, 20th] Semi-official sources stated last night that Britain is considering abandoning its plan to oppose the basic principles of the Soviet proposal. Reliable sources expect Chamberlain to appeal to the cabinet on Wednesday to approve the conclusion of a military alliance with the Soviet Union, or to sign an agreement to balance the Franco-Soviet agreement. Soviet officials have not yet criticized Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on Friday regarding the report on the Dantzic situation. The newspapers are also silent, reporting only in five or six lines. The British House of Commons debated foreign policy, but the nature of the debated issues was not mentioned at all.

[Associated Press, London, 20th] It is understood that regarding the British-Soviet alliance, Chamberlain is consulting with the authorities of Poland and Romania, seeking their opinions. The Prime Minister's move is to hope to get a full reply so that he can make a final decision on the British-Soviet alliance at the cabinet meeting next Wednesday. In diplomatic circles, it is believed that Romania agrees with the Soviet Union's participation in the peace front, and Poland's previous opposition to the Soviet Union's accession has now changed somewhat.

Divergent Opinions Greatly Diminished

[Reuters, London, 20th] It is said that as a result of continued foreign negotiations in the past 24 hours, Britain and the Soviet Union have seen closer ties. Officials say that Moscow's recent letter has helped to clarify the situation, and it is hoped that subsequent negotiations in Paris and Geneva can achieve considerable progress, so that the cabinet meeting on Wednesday can make a decision. According to informed sources, Britain has indeed tried its best to get closer to the Soviet Union's views, so the differences between the two sides have been greatly reduced. Soviet Ambassador Maisky has left Britain for Geneva.

[Reuters, Moscow, 20th] Soviet circles did not pay much attention to the fact that Vice Minister Potemkin stopped going to Geneva to meet with Halifax and Lai. The reason has never been expressed here. It is clear that Potemkin's influence in presiding over Soviet foreign policy does not exceed that of Maisky. Soviet officials and newspapers have maintained a silent attitude toward Chamberlain's report on the British-Soviet negotiations in the House of Commons. It is believed here that this is a sign that the Soviet Union's top authorities are not prepared to conduct a new case against Britain. At the same time, informed sources believe that the authorities must have instructed Maisky to continue negotiations with Halifax in Geneva, and after Halifax has met with the French authorities in Paris, it can be hoped that a compromise between Britain and the Soviet Union will be reached.

British and French Talks are Harmonious

[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] According to authoritative sources, as a result of British Foreign Secretary Halifax's consultation with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, a mutual alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has a "possibility of rapid completion." If this alliance is established, it will not include the Baltic states.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] After British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax arrived here today, he held a long talk with Prime Minister Delatier and Foreign Minister Bonet at the Ministry of the Army at 5:10 PM. In addition to several experts from both countries assisting him, British Ambassador Sir Phipps also participated in the matter. It was not finished until 7:50 PM. The official did not issue a statement to explain the progress of the talks. When Prime Minister Daladier met with reporters, he only said that today's talks were extremely harmonious. Members of the British and French cabinets and experts then had dinner together at the Ministry of the Army. There were eight people in the meeting, and talks continued during the meeting. Foreign Secretary Halifax then took a train to Geneva at 9:35 PM with Malkin, a legal expert from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Strong, Director of the Central European Department, and Baker, Director of the Intelligence Department, to attend the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky also traveled in the same car. (According to Ambassador Maisky, who arrived here from London this morning).

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Prime Minister Daladier, and French Foreign Minister Bonnet met at the Ministry of the Army tonight, lasting nearly three hours, discussing the entire international situation. It is said that this talk showed absolute harmony between Britain and France. Halifax and Bonnet will continue to consult in Geneva, at which time they can also contact Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky. It is the general impression here that Halifax and 　Radier and Lai’s meeting were very satisfactory, but the substantial establishment of the British-Soviet agreement still needs some time, while Soviet sources here said that they hope that the agreement can be established in the near future.

France and the Soviet Union Take the Same View

[Reuters, London, 21st] The "London Observer" diplomatic correspondent stated today that tomorrow's talks in Geneva will be the last opportunity to discuss military cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The important talks between Halifax and France last night have been confirmed here. It is said that the French government and the Soviet Union take the same view that only full military cooperation can complete the defensive wall of the peace group.

The French Cabinet Holds a Meeting

[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] Before the British Foreign Secretary arrived, the French Cabinet convened a meeting at 10:00 this morning, focusing on discussing the stalemate in the British-Soviet negotiations. The French Foreign Minister reported on the Franco-Turkish agreement and the French government's decision to hand over Alexandria to Turkey, and said that the Spanish government was completely independent and neutral and was willing to cooperate for European peace and had expressed guarantees to France, asking France not to worry about being attacked on three sides when the war broke out. The Soviet Ambassador to Britain arrived here yesterday and transferred to Geneva. He first met with the Soviet Ambassador to France to explore the recent French attitude and situation, so as to provide a reference for the continued British-Soviet negotiations in Geneva in the future.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 20th] The "detailed content of the new British plan on which the British-Soviet negotiations will be based in the future cannot be explored, but it has aroused great attention from all parties. According to news reports, the plan has been taken to Paris by Foreign Secretary Halifax so as to discuss it jointly with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Lai. The plan was drafted in accordance with French suggestions, and its content has very important concessions to the Soviet Union's views. According to the "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent, the French plan slightly disagreed with the Soviet Union's proposal that major countries should consider the issue of safeguarding Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. The "Times" diplomatic correspondent analyzed the differences between the British and Soviet views and said that the Soviet Union advocated signing a tripartite agreement, while Britain advocated that countries jointly issue a declaration. The scope of the guarantees proposed in the agreement proposed by the Soviet Union actually exceeded the scope of the British proposal, while Britain determined that Poland and Romania must be taken care of first, because the two countries must be the first to defend themselves in the event of a threat.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st] Foreign Minister Ciano arrived at Anhalter Bahnhof station on Sunday morning. His mission is to sign a military alliance between Germany and Italy. Those welcoming him at the station included Foreign Minister Ribbentrop representing the German head of state, German Ambassador to Rome Mackensen, Italian Ambassador to Berlin Attolico, General Milch representing General Göring, State Secretary Weizsäcker of the German Foreign Office, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Raeder, and key military and political figures.

[Reuters, Rome, 20th] Mussolini said today in Cuneo, "After the signing of the German-Italian alliance, it will become a group of 150 million people, and no one in the world will be able to match it." Amidst enthusiastic applause, Mussolini continued, "This group, in terms of manpower and military equipment, possesses invincible power. Although its purpose is to hope for peace, if stubborn and reactionary democratic nations attempt to obstruct our progress, we will inevitably abandon peace. Italy is currently maintaining a silent attitude, but when the time comes, the Italian people will definitely express themselves. Italy has a population of 45 million, with ten million people bearing arms, and their will is united." The audience shouted again, and Mussolini said, "Your cheers prove that the unity of the people is not empty words." Mussolini concluded by saying that his speech in Turin was very detailed, so he did not want to say much today. "If the need arises, the Italian people will rise up and express themselves."

[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 20th] After inspecting the frontier defenses in Aosta today, Mussolini delivered a speech. When he spoke to the point that "Our Alpine troops are sufficient to overcome any delusions," the crowd shouted slogans such as "Nice, Savoy!" Mussolini continued that Italy could wait for the opportunity, that Italy had one million soldiers ready to fight at any time, and that military equipment was sufficient. "I do not know what path the democratic nations will take, but we are waiting for the opportunity, preparing to respond to all events. The past sixteen years have fully demonstrated our country's strength and determination, which is powerful and irresistible. Those protected by democratic nations have all failed one after another, and the banks of the Thames have become the only place for exiles to breathe. I hope that the people of the whole country can understand my intentions. The victories we have achieved today, future victories will also be in our grasp."

### Baldwin's Speech Supports Government Policy; Warns Fascist and Nazi Followers That Those Who Resort to Force Will Hardly Succeed

[Reuters, London, 20th] Former British Prime Minister Baldwin delivered a speech in Horsham today, stating that he absolutely agreed with the government's policy. He said, "Britain is prepared to reason with those who are reasonable, and at the same time, it is prepared to resist anyone who attempts to oppress neighboring countries by force. In the world, there are no warmongers except for the so-called followers of Fascism and Nazism. But if the leaders of Fascism and Nazism insist on resorting to force, they will definitely encounter resistance from other countries in the world. This great power is something that no one can resist, even a hero like Napoleon could not avoid it. No one can hope to succeed Napoleon. It is hard to believe that a wise and capable person like Hitler would make such a big mistake in politics." Baldwin concluded by saying that his current belief that all ordinary people in the world, including the people of Germany and Italy, would ultimately or even in the near future achieve victory, was stronger than before.

Brief Commentary

### A Warrior's Intimidation

The military alliance between Germany and Italy, according to various telegrams, will be officially signed today (the 22nd) in Berlin with a "grand ceremony." The eastern ×× Japanese rulers have been fiercely fighting over whether to join this alliance in the past few days, but according to yesterday's news, they have decided to participate. In fact, they only have this path to take.

The military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy cannot surprise the world today, because based on the facts since the establishment of the "Anti-Comintern Pact," this agreement has long been recognized by the world as a de facto military alliance of aggressive countries. The main reason why the three Eastern warriors officially announced the establishment of the alliance today is that, in view of the new progress of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression front, they want to use it to intimidate the capitalist rulers of certain democratic countries! How the three warriors threaten and actually damage the rights and interests of all peaceful countries is common knowledge, so this new intimidation by the warriors is not very surprising.

However, it is an unforgivable mistake to excessively ignore the intimidation of the warriors today, that is, to excessively ignore the military alliance between Germany and Italy, and even between Japan, Germany, and Italy, because it is a powerful backlash against the anti-aggression group movement of democratic and peaceful countries. First, it is possible to threaten Britain and France with more crazy speculative adventures; second, it is even more possible for Japanese × to benefit by inducing and threatening Britain, the United States, and France, especially or threatening these countries. Therefore, if a strong counterattack is not given, that is, if the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are not used to counterattack, not only will there be a danger of a new war breaking out in Europe, but Japanese × will also have the danger of advancing from Gulangyu to Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou ××××, ×××!

### Tensions in Danzig; Germans Destroy Polish Customs in Eastern Prussia

[Reuters, Danzig, 21st] A group of Germans attacked the Polish customs in Katholf near the border of East Prussia today, and the situation there is very tense. The group of Germans first opened fire on the customs, and the tax officer, at the request of the police officer, temporarily　withdrew. The Germans then destroyed it. The Danzig police chief has sent Deputy Chief Pan to investigate. Pan went alone, refusing to bring escorts. When Pan arrived at the scene and got out of the car to inspect the area where the dispute occurred, the group of Germans attacked his driver again. The driver fired three shots into the air and then fired two more shots, wounding one person. According to sources responsible in Warsaw, the driver killed one person.

### A Meeting with the Ex-Kaiser of Germany

— J. V. Kurenberg, translated by Wang Shen'e

Little has been heard about Wilhelm II, the once-famous ruler of Germany. Many guests who visited the ex-Kaiser were not allowed to write about him, but this article is an exception. The author is the son of Prussian King Péro, the former German Prime Minister.

It was the early morning of November 10, 1918. A train not found on the timetable pulled into the small station of Eysden, located in the southernmost outpost of the Netherlands. Sitting in the carriage's reception room was the ex-Kaiser of Germany, who had just abdicated from Spa, within the occupied Belgian territory, where the German Imperial Headquarters was situated. The ex-Kaiser was now taking refuge in the safe zone of neutral Holland.

The collapse of the royal family was the first confirmation that the World War was coming to an end.

The stationmaster telephoned the Foreign Minister in The Hague. The Foreign Minister was very surprised by this almost unbelievable news. So the Foreign Minister telephoned the Dutch nobility in his bedroom, speaking very urgently; and managed to find Amerongen Castle for the Kaiser as a temporary refuge, which was generously donated by the Bentinck family.

At this desolate station, a cold winter rain was falling on the open platform. Kaiser Wilhelm II slowly walked down the army, his face sorrowful, his hands deeply inserted into the pockets of his gray coat, waiting for the Dutch government's permission to pass through to safety.

Twenty years have passed since that November. That defeated and declining figure has lived very quietly in Holland since that year. He has reached the age of eighty, and whatever shortcomings he may have had as a ruler, he now leads an exiled life with quiet dignity, which is worthy of infinite sympathy. In 1920, the Kaiser was forced to abdicate and took up residence in the castle of Huis Doorn.

Doorn is a secluded village in the middle of the Netherlands with 7,000 residents. A casual visitor would not expect such a prominent exile to be living there. Every child knows this "house," but calling this house a castle, even according to the Dutch style, still feels too small. The big ladle that makes up the semicircle can be seen on the road. A plainclothes detective carefully questions visitors at the door, and another gendarme wanders nearby.

Visitors are led to a room where two red leather books are placed side by side, one with a W on it and one with an H. Anyone who goes to see the ex-Kaiser must write their name in the handbook. Among those inscriptions are many expressions of loyalty, words of comfort, and passages from the Bible. The visitor's handbook is placed on the ex-Kaiser's left and right every night, and the ex-Kaiser reads it in great detail.

Across the garden. There is a wide road leading to the Imperial Palace, with neat lawns on both sides, surrounded by age-old yew trees. The house is in the style of a Dutch aristocratic manor, with two floors and red brick walls covered with green vines, set off by spotless white window sills. Across the circular pool, the two wide glass front doors in front of the house were opened, and two servants in black uniforms bowed to welcome visitors inside.

Up　stairs, the first thing that caught the eye was the full-length portrait of the Dutch Governor and his wife, which is Wilhelm II's way of expressing his respect for Orange　Nassau. The ex-Kaiser had a deep relationship with them. He was often very happy to admit this relationship, as can be seen from the gift he sent to Buckingham Palace in London a few years ago, the statue of Emperor Governor William III.

A military map was spread out on the table. China, following Spain and Abyssinia, has become a battle outpost, attracting the Kaiser's deep attention. Small flags were stuck on the map,　clarifying the location of the troops. The Kaiser is the only survivor of the military in the Great War; what attracts visitors the most is that the room is decorated with many fresh flowers.

The dining room is in the back, with a panoramic view of the garden. In the evening, the people at the dining table were happy and solemn. The porcelain in the "Berlin" New Palace is used here. But if you think the Kaiser's dinner is sumptuous, you are wrong, on the contrary, everything is very simple. The simplicity of each dog's menu is probably unparalleled in　many royal families.

The housekeeping at Doorn is quite thoughtful. One night, the Kaiser took a small guest on his lap and asked, "Now, please tell us what we are going to eat tonight?"

The child said, "Duck—son."

The Kaiser said again, "Then, what do we eat for the second time this week..." But the wide room manager said that the food would be used up during the first dinner.

A very small staircase leads to the first floor. The guests were not given a bunch of flowers, and they were led into the half-dark room of the late Queen Augusta Victoria. Visitors put the flowers　on the white felt covering the coffin.

Above is a picture of the Gaslow region——as a memory of the previous glorious era. On her recent constitution's writing　table, there are more than fifty separate frames putting her descendants' photos. In the lonely exiled life, she often sat there, feeling that she was with many dear juniors who stayed elsewhere. She had many beloved grandchildren, and the family life was simple and melted, even in the days of holding power and glory.

The neighboring　Ming is very quiet　, Princess Hermine, the successor of the German emperor,　here drinks afternoon tea, which is an English custom, but Doorn runs the warning very carefully. Princess Hermine is knowledgeable and widely read, and her criticism of classical books shows wisdom and vision. Her thoughts and actions are like a modern woman. Last year, she allowed her eldest daughter to marry a commoner, and she frankly admitted that she liked everything in the new Germany, and she personally knew Hitler.

The Kaiser is accustomed to walking to tea, he walks to his wife's room with lively steps, making people feel that he is not an 80-year-old man, he wears dark black home clothes, he likes to wear white vests and leggings inside, now he only wears a few rings, there is a large pin on the tie, and a small cross on the buttonhole.

The Kaiser has　thin white hair and a very compassionate　good beard, he does look like a prominent figure. The action is calm and　beautiful. A sharp eye shows the old man's　brilliant spirit.

### ×Cotton Yarn Supply Short, ×Raw Materials Lacking; Over a Hundred Peninsula Textile Factories Close Down; ×Yarn Nearly Disappears from the Market in Recent Months, Many Small Factories Suspend Work; Over a Thousand Workers Idle and Helpless

Since the military and since, Hong Kong has been in a neutral position, safe and worry-free. The number of inland capital fleeing to Hong Kong is quite large. Therefore, in the past 20 months or so, all industries in Hong Kong have been thriving and prosperous. In particular, the small-scale weaving industry in the peninsula has been particularly prosperous. According to statistics, the increase in the past year or so should be around five or six hundred. These small-scale weaving factories mostly use multiple mobile phones, installed in buildings, employing dozens of male and female workers, engaged in weaving. The products they produce are mainly shirts, socks, lace, towels, etc. Nineteen of the above-mentioned textile products sold in the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon market are manufactured by these weaving factories. In addition to the Hong Kong market, they are also sold in various parts of Southeast Asia. The number of male and female workers employed in these weaving factories is four to five thousand. They are all paid by the piece, with no fixed monthly salary. Those who work quickly can earn seven or eight cents a day, otherwise it is usually three or four cents. However, the number of people who rely on this directly and indirectly for a living is unknown, which accounts for an important part of Hong Kong's industry. The raw materials used by these small-scale weaving factories in the past, such as cotton yarn and rayon, are almost entirely supplied by Japan. The price of Japanese cotton yarn and rayon is about half the price of products from India and Canada, so the cost of manufacturing products is lighter, and even if they are sold cheaply, there is still a large profit to be made. Recently, however, the source of Japanese cotton yarn and rayon has become less and less, and today it has almost disappeared from the market. The general small factory owners in the peninsula are greatly panicked due to the lack of raw material supply. In the past week, it is not uncommon for people to announce the temporary suspension of the public to avoid losses on the leather fees. The reporter investigated the areas where small weaving factories are located, such as Kowloon City, Sham Shui Po, and Hung Hom yesterday. It is estimated that in the Kowloon City area alone, there are 53 small weaving factories that have announced a temporary shutdown. In addition to more than 70 in Hung Hom and Sham Shui Po, there are more than 20 larger-scale factories with dozens of male and female workers in two shifts day and night. These hundreds of closed weaving factories have more than a thousand men and women in total. In addition to the permanent workers, the rest of the part-time workers are paid by the piece. Once they stop working, their lives will be severely hit and they will be trapped in helplessness. Although they want to find work in other large factories, it is not easy to find a job in today's situation where people are overwhelmed. What will they live on? It is a question. According to people in the weaving industry, ×cotton yarn and rayon have always been sold at low prices to seize the market. Now the source has been cut off. This shows that ×military consumption due to the invasion is too great, and the lack of domestic resources and raw materials has fallen into an extreme situation. The future of ×industry is very pessimistic.

### Tragedy of Landslide at Sai Wan Ho: Three Dead and Two Injured in the Collapse of a Shack - After Continuous Heavy Rain, a Large Amount of Mud and Boulders Suddenly Collapsed Violently, Crushing to Death an Elderly Woman and Two Girls, and a Man's Left Arm Was Broken

Continuous heavy rain in Hong Kong these days, as if pouring down, the soil on the mountains in Hong Kong and Kowloon has been eroded by the rain for several days, and the water flowing down the mountains has washed down more than a dozen places, causing traffic to be blocked and inconvenient. At 4:45 pm yesterday, dozens of wells of mud and boulders collapsed on the mountain above Chuanlong Pit in Sai Wan Ho, hitting the back of a house in the pit. A part of it collapsed as a result. At that time, three women and children were unable to escape and were tragically buried alive. A man also had his left arm broken, and a woman had minor facial injuries. The details of the tragedy that occurred are recorded below.

The buildings are extremely simple. Most of the residents are Hakka people. They mostly raise pigs and grow crops. On the south side of the pit, there are three houses in a row, built next to each other. These three houses are not numbered. The first house on the right is inhabited by four families, Huang, Zeng, Chen, and Yang, with about a dozen people, old and young. The back of the house is a mountain ridge, and the front faces a huge pit that is seven or eight feet deep.

Continuous heavy rain these days has eroded these simple buildings, which are already showing signs of looseness. The water flowing down the mountain behind the house is like a river, and the walls behind the house are constantly impacted and soaked until they are loose. At 4:45 pm yesterday, when the rain was clearing up, the people in the house were deeply rejoicing. Unexpectedly, at this moment, dozens of tons of mud and stones suddenly collapsed from the mountain. The force was extremely violent, like ten thousand horses galloping, unstoppable. The back wall of the house was directly hit. With a loud crash, the back of the house collapsed. The old woman Huang (54 years old), the girl Zeng Song (5 years old) and Chen Xiang (3 years old), who were sitting in the back of the house, were unable to escape and were buried by the landslide. At the same time, a man named Yang Zhuoxin (26 years old) was also unable to escape in time, and his left hand was broken by a fallen fir tree. Huang's daughter also suffered abrasions on her face. Other residents were fortunate to escape quickly and were spared.

Three Dead, Two Injured

After the house was unfortunately collapsed by the landslide, nearby residents heard the news and rushed to the rescue, but only Yang Zhuoxin and Huang's daughter were rescued, while Huang and the two girls were buried in the mud. At the same time, some residents, seeing this tragedy, immediately reported to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station. The on-duty officer of the station dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate after receiving the report, and also transferred the Public Works Department to send workers to the scene to excavate, and summoned ambulances to the scene to send Yang Zhuoxin and Huang's daughter to Mary Hospital for treatment. Public Works Bureau workers excavated for a long time before Huang and the bodies of the two girls were exhumed one after another, and transported to the morgue by hearse for autopsy.

### The China Salvation Drama Troupe's Great Charity Performance Is Approaching - Three Famous Plays "Long Live the Nation" Will Be Performed - The Cost of Scenery and Costumes Reaches More Than Five Thousand Yuan

All the members of the China Salvation Drama Troupe are veterans of the drama circles in Shanghai and other places. In the past 20 months, they have marched through the north and south battlefields. In the actual experience, the progress is particularly rapid. In the field of emerging drama in our country, it is the most famous advanced drama troupe.

It has now been decided that from the 25th of this month, for three consecutive nights, the three famous plays "Long Live the Nation," "Defend the Motherland," and "Spring in Taierzhuang" will be performed at the Lee Theatre. The plot of "Long Live the Nation" is tense and touching everywhere. "Defend the Motherland" is composed of the troupe's four most wonderful short plays, and the representative work "Put Down Your Whip," which has been performed more than 700 times, is also included. "Spring in Taierzhuang" is the troupe's collective creation, which is both solemn and lively, meaningful and full of interest. In addition to the actors and scripts being the best, the scenery, costumes, props, and lighting have all been newly purchased, totaling more than 5,000 Hong Kong dollars. All of them are voluntarily donated by the troupe. Its greatness and realism break the unprecedented record of war dramas in Hong Kong. All kinds of electric lights are used to set off the morning, noon, dusk, and night. The gale and violent storm, and the lightning flashing, are lifelike. The audience is as if they are on the scene. The Journalists Association, entrusted by the Relief Committee to co-organize this performance, is stepping up its work as the performance is approaching. Yesterday, it specially entertained the persons in charge of the Education Association to discuss the method of being responsible for ticket sales, and asked Lu Guomian to plan to carry out indoor ticket sales with various businesses. To raise funds to help the needy, to appreciate the most advanced drama and art, I hope that our enthusiastic overseas Chinese will squeeze in and rush to buy tickets at that time, and don't miss the opportunity.

### Hong Kong Has Drafted a Plan to Install Wireless Telephones - Preparing to Connect with Cities in British Territories - Singapore to Communicate with the United States on June 1

All parts of the Far East have wireless telephones to connect with other places, but Hong Kong is uniquely lacking. According to reports, the Hong Kong authorities have now drafted a plan to install wireless telephones to connect with cities in the British Empire. Although the experimental plan has been drafted, some details are still to be studied. When this plan is implemented in the future, the first places to communicate with this country will be Manila, Singapore, and India. Regarding the Hong Kong installation of wireless telephone meter, the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong Telephone Company are now negotiating to decide to take charge of this matter separately. The contract can be established soon. The cost of wireless telephone calls has not yet been decided. In the future, the current price of wireless telephone calls between Hong Kong and Shanghai will be the standard, and will be increased or decreased according to the distance. The installation of wireless telephones in Hong Kong is part of the British Empire's transportation development plan. There are now wireless telephone connections between Singapore and London, and wireless telephones with the United States are also being prepared.

### Macau Xiangzhou Sea Area - Three Aircraft Strafed Fishing Boats - One Fishing Boat Was Sunk and All the Crew Members Died - The Shipowner, Chen, Was Seriously Injured and Fortunately Survived

Yesterday afternoon, a fisherman arrived in Hong Kong from Macau by wheel. According to what he told reporters, on the morning of the 19th of this month, a certain fishing boat registered in Macau sailed to the Xiangzhou sea area and was fishing. Suddenly, three aircraft flew overhead. Seeing that there were fishing boats, they immediately flew low and strafed with machine guns. At that time, other fishing boats saw the situation and fled one after another. However, the shipowner of the fishing boat, Chen, was unable to sail away in time and was sunk. At that time, there were six or seven crew members on board, all of whom died. Only the shipowner, Chen, was seriously injured and barely survived. When his ship sank, he grabbed a floating object and drifted to the surface of the sea. After the aircraft passed, he dared to call for help. Soon, another fishing boat passed by and rescued Chen, took him back to Macau and reported to the authorities. After receiving the report, the Macau police immediately summoned an ambulance to send Chen to the hospital for treatment. The Macau police are currently conducting research on the occurrence of this unfortunate incident.

### Wild Dogs Found in Dium Ji Wan and Tai Tam Tuk - Be Careful When Visiting These Places

Yesterday, three residents (two men and one woman) of a thatched cottage on the side of Luo Mountain in Shau Kei Wan brought grass-cutting knives and bamboo poles to cut leather near the Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir in the morning. Unexpectedly, ten wild dogs suddenly ran out of the mountainside fiercely. The grass-cutting men and women initially thought they were hunting dogs raised by Westerners and did not pay attention. Then they heard their cries were different from ordinary dogs, so they immediately took precautions and did not dare to act. The wild dog group eventually crossed another mountain peak and left. Afterwards, the three men and women did not dare to cut grass again, and returned to Shau Kei Wan to report the case in a wolfish manner.

### The Far East Water Pipe Company on Castle Peak Road, Tsuen Wan Was Almost Robbed - Li Wenyu Used a Knife to Resist Three Thieves - Robbers Entered with Weapons and Failed - Two Robbers Were Cut and Injured and Fled

At 10:45 pm the night before last, the Far East Water Pipe Manufacturing Company on Castle Peak Road in Tsuen Wan was robbed by armed robbers. Fortunately, the clerk was alert and bravely resisted with a knife, and finally repelled the robbers and avoided losses. The details are as follows:

Holding a Cleaver, Waiting in Formation

The Far East Water Pipe Manufacturing Company is located on Castle Peak Road, a rather remote location. After nightfall, it is even quieter. The company's employees leave after work, leaving only a clerk, Li Wenyu, to guard. Li is 40 years old and lives with his wife, Lin Quan, in a small house near the company. There has been no difference in the past. Last night, at 10:45 pm, Mr. and Mrs. Li were already fast asleep. Lin Quan suddenly noticed an unusual sound from the door fan. Knowing that it was not a good sign, she pushed Li awake and told him everything. Li remained silent, secretly got up, grabbed a cleaver, and waited for the robbers to enter before attacking head-on.

Swinging the Knife, Two Thieves Were Injured

Before long, the door of the house had indeed been pried open. In the darkness, three burly men were seen, one holding a handgun and the other two holding iron rulers and other weapons. They rushed in. Seeing that they had bad intentions, Li swung his knife forward and slashed at the robbers. The thieves were caught off guard and hurriedly fired a gun to demonstrate, trying to stop Li. However, Li was not intimidated at all and swung his knife wildly, resulting in a melee. Lin Quan blew a whistle to call the police. The thieves knew that the matter had been exposed, and two of them had been cut and injured by Li in the melee, so they fled in a panic. Li did not pursue them. After the incident, he went to the police station to report the case.

### Salt Fields in the New Territories - Salt Is Produced in Lantau Island and Castle Peak

It is really strange to say that news about "salt" is rarely found in Hong Kong news. Recently, we have only seen one or two news items reporting that "Hong Kong's table salt is shipped from Siam!"

Probably not only me, but many readers will not believe that Hong Kong's table salt is shipped from Siam, because Hong Kong has its own salt yang and produces salt every day, and there are also many large and small salt shipments to other places for sale.

Hong Kong residents do not eat salt produced locally in Hong Kong, but instead take it from Siam. According to the principle of revitalizing local goods, it seems a bit contradictory. Now let me introduce Hong Kong's local salt!

Some of Hong Kong's salt fields are located in Lantau Island and some are located in Castle Peak in the New Territories. There are more in Lantau Island than in Castle Peak. In recent years, it seems that the economy has been a bit sluggish. Many of the salt fields in Lantau Island are barren and dilapidated, and many salt-water grasses have grown. This is probably the result of Hong Kong people not eating Hong Kong salt.

Last Sunday, I went to Castle Peak to visit a salt farm. The owner of the farm was very polite and explained the salt-making process to me. Now I will introduce what the owner of the salt farm told me to the readers. Salt is made of seawater. The raw materials used must be used during manufacturing. Since no raw materials are needed, of course, no capital is needed. The only raw material is seawater. It also relies on intense sunlight. After several hours of exposure, large salt is naturally formed, also known as raw salt and coarse salt. Approximately eight hours of "sun exposure" will complete the task, but salt cannot be made on rainy days. People who rely on salt making to eat can only "eat grain seeds."

The area of a salt field is about the same size as a paddy field. The bottom of the salt field is paved with flour-like fine sand. The sand surface must be flattened. If it is concave and convex, the seawater put in cannot evenly stay on the field surface, and the salt crystallization will be affected.

When the tide rises, the salt field people first put the seawater into a reservoir. After a considerable period of time, the water in the reservoir has been filtered eight or nine times, so they put the water in the reservoir into the salt field. The salt field is sealed on all sides so that water cannot leak. Three to five parts of water on the field surface is enough. After eight hours of sunlight exposure, these three to five parts of water will all turn into white salt, which looks like a thin layer of flour. When collecting salt, use a gentle method to sweep away the salt, and then flatten the sand. The next day, do the same thing again, and get the harvest of the second day. In short, the people in the field must work diligently, and there must be sunshine every day. Each salt field can earn more than 20 yuan per head, which is more profitable than planting rice and other grains.

According to people in the salt industry, part of the production of Hong Kong's salt fields is sold to Bao'an and Dongjiang, part of it is sold locally to residents of the New Territories, and part of it is sold to fishing boats. Under Castle Peak, there are even three or four salt grinding businesses, which move large raw salt and coarse salt into small mills and instantly turn it into fine table salt. The color is also snow-white and clean. The main customers of salt shops are large fishing boats going to sea. Fishing boats must prepare before going to sea, but a small number of fishermen use the high prices on the mainland to smuggle salt in the name of fish. With such main customers, the business is also very prosperous. Now, due to the blockade by the warship, fishing boats dare not smuggle salt as rampant as before, and the salt grinding business is also not as good as before.

Salt is a daily necessity. The population of Hong Kong is now estimated at 1.5 million, and the estimated daily demand is about 30,000 catties. How can we bear to let this huge amount of money flow into Siam. Hong Kong itself is a salt field, so why don't we promote local goods vigorously? If we can maintain Hong Kong residents eating Hong Kong salt, the salt fields and other direct and indirect industries will be greatly and positively affected!

It is reported that the frontline × army, due to the activity of our guerrillas, has appealed for assistance from Guangzhou and Foshan. Yesterday, the 18th, over two thousand × soldiers and a large quantity of ammunition were transferred to the Hekou-Xinan-Ganggen area of Sanshui. Consequently, transportation along the Guang-San (Guangzhou-Sanshui) line has become busy again, with military vehicles constantly moving. It is estimated that by the 18th, over four hundred boxes of military supplies had been transported to the front lines, mostly stored in the town of Xinan. However, there has been no unusual movement by the × troops. The weather in Xijiang has been unfavorable in recent days, with frequent overcast skies and rain on the front lines. × Aircraft have temporarily ceased operations.

Attack on Makou, Our Army Achieves Minor Victory

Yesterday, the × troops stationed at Makou, Ganggen, and Dalulu on the south bank of Sanshui were suddenly attacked by our army. On the 15th of this month, a unit of Commander Zhang's division stationed in Jinli secretly attacked the × Pacification Office in Dongmakou, killing dozens of × officers and soldiers. On the evening of the 17th, our Jinli team again launched a night attack on Makou. First, several dozen commandos were selected to infiltrate the × positions, scout the terrain, and at midnight, they set a fire as a signal, coordinating with the inside to launch a joint attack. Our team deployed effectively, and the × soldiers were attacked everywhere, hastily fighting back. After about an hour of intense fighting, our army became more and more courageous, and the × positions became disorganized. We killed over twenty people and burned down two pontoon bridges near the shore before dispersing in different directions under the cover of darkness.

Night Attack on Xinan, Annihilating Thousands of × Troops

The battle situation in Qingbao, Jinli, and other places has been quiet. According to intelligence from military agencies, the × troops in Hekou and Xinan are moving frequently. The × troops, who had previously penetrated deep into the western districts of Zunnan, Maxi, Pingdan, and Jinguan, have all been recalled to Hekou for concentration, shortening the defense line. However, they occasionally send patrol boats or fire cannons at Luji on the west bank. In Baoyuetang, Sanshui, the × army once sent troops to invade a week ago, but they were defeated by our tax regiment and guerrillas and fled back to Xinan. There is no trace of × troops in the Yangmei area. On the late night of the 17th of this month, our team attacked Xinan from a certain location, fighting fiercely all night, annihilating hundreds of × troops, capturing two puppet soldiers, and seizing many military supplies. The next morning, they all safely returned to their defenses without losing a single person.

Sanshui × Army to Hold Meeting

Furthermore, the × troops on the Sanshui front, in order to deal with our guerrilla attacks, are not only increasing troop reinforcements for defense but also plotting to eliminate our guerrillas. They have been frequently and secretly discussing suppression plans in the past month. It is reported that the commander of the Xijiang × forces, Brigade Commander Matsumoto, will travel from Foshan to inspect the front lines of Hekou, Sanshui, within the week. He will also convene a meeting at the Hekou Customs House on a certain day, gathering Commander Matsuno of the Sanshui × regiment and many high-ranking officers to discuss military invasion matters. The next day, he will also convene puppet leaders from Hekou, Xinxu, Ganggen, Xinan, Makou, and Yangmei to listen to instructions, using both coercion and enticement in his words. It is said that this × meeting, in addition to dealing with our guerrillas, also contains political conspiracies, attempting to use various means to lure our people into submission and enslavement.

### Xiaolan, Zhongshan Rushes to Handle the Aftermath, Assigns Zhou Shouyu to Preside

[Zhongshan Express] In Xiaolan Ancient Town, the third district of Zhongshan, × warships frequently spy and carry out pointless shelling. The other day, a × warship sailed from Beijie, Jiangmen, to the open sea and fired cannons at the urban area of Xiaolan, collapsing buildings and injuring people, resulting in a terrible disaster. Yuan Dai, commander of the First Detached Force, telegraphed County Magistrate Zhang Huichang to report and request the dispatch of officials to take charge of the aftermath and guard the local area.

### Southern Counties Ban Export of Firewood, Merchants Request Adjustment of Supply, Duty-Free Foreign Rice Allowed for Free Purchase and Transport

(Guangzhou Bay Express) Since the population of Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangzhou has surged, the consumption of daily necessities has increased significantly. Taking firewood and rice as examples, the supply is sometimes insufficient, and both firewood and rice prices have risen sharply. Furthermore, due to exchange rate issues, merchants from the interior are rushing to export firewood to supply Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangzhou, seeking huge profits, resulting in a near exhaustion of firewood sources in the interior. Therefore, the counties in southern Guangdong have decided to ban the export of firewood. However, since the production and export of firewood in the interior are originally beneficial to the people's livelihood and economy, firewood merchants are requesting the government to find ways to adjust the situation, allowing the firewood produced in rural areas to be distributed and supply the needs of urban residents.

(Maoming Express) Zhang Yan, the administrative commissioner of the seventh district, previously stipulated the quantity of duty-free foreign rice to be purchased and transported by each county, as well as the procedures for issuing certificates by the county government, in order to alleviate the rice shortage. He sent a letter to the Customs Commissioner of Leizhou for reference and implementation. Now, because rice prices are rising day by day, he has made changes to allow merchants from Guangzhou Bay and various counties to freely purchase and transport rice, but they must obtain a certificate from Deputy Officer Li Bangrong of the Mazhang Communications Office of the Special Garrison Command and present it to the customs for inspection before import is allowed. Commissioner Zhang sent a letter to the Customs Commissioner of Leizhou Customs, stating: "Regarding the relief of the rice shortage in this district, the provincial government has previously issued an order to allow the duty-free import of 100,000 metric tons of foreign rice. This department has followed this order and stipulated the quantity to be transported by each county, as well as the procedures for issuing certificates by the county government, and has sent a letter to your customs office for reference. Now that rice prices are rising day by day and the counties are collecting funds for purchase, fearing that it will be too late to alleviate the situation, we have made further changes to allow merchants from Guangzhou Bay and various counties to freely purchase and transport rice, but they must obtain a certificate from Deputy Officer Li Bangrong of the Mazhang Communications Office of the Special Garrison Command for statistical purposes. In the future, all imported foreign rice with certificates from the county governments and the deputy officer should be released duty-free."

### Vietnamese Burn and Loot Overseas Chinese Shops in Shi Luo and Xia Tu, Our Consul-General in Hanoi Lodges Strong Protest, Over Twenty Assailants Arrested and Interrogated

(Dongxing News) In Shi Luo and Xia Tu, Vietnam, there are only over a hundred overseas Chinese residents, mostly from Qinlian. On April 25th at 5 PM, a Vietnamese child had a quarrel with a Chinese child, involving the parents of both sides in a verbal conflict. The Vietnamese, incited by their gang leader, gathered a mob and rushed into the overseas Chinese shops, beating and looting. Seeing the aggressive momentum, the overseas Chinese endured the insult and temporarily avoided the conflict, hoping for a resolution. Unexpectedly, the Vietnamese thought they had an opportunity and looted the overseas Chinese property and set fire to the houses. Upon hearing the news, the overseas Chinese in Kanghai immediately reported to the local garrison officer, who drove to the scene of the incident to rescue them. By 7 PM, over twenty Vietnamese assailants had been arrested on the spot and are currently being interrogated. It is not yet known whether the Vietnamese attack on the overseas Chinese was incited by × or has other background. However, the Kanghai Overseas Chinese Association, for the safety of the overseas Chinese in the two ports, specially sent Chairman Cao Liu Gong and Committee Member Jiang Rukai to report to the special consul in Haiphong, requesting negotiations for compensation and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again. After receiving the report, the consulate sent Secretary Wei Guanghan to investigate and comfort the affected overseas Chinese, and telegraphed the Consul-General in Hanoi to protest to the French government.

Yesterday, they sent an express mail telegram appealing to various parties, stating: "We believe that our association was originally organized to connect the feelings of fellow countrymen and strive for the unity of fellow countrymen in order to improve the position of Qiongya in Guangzhou Bay. It has not been long since its establishment when Qiongya suddenly fell, and our feelings for the country are extremely painful. Recently, the people of Qiongya who are unwilling to be trampled underfoot by iron hooves are fleeing to the bay in an endless stream, enduring wind and dew, with a tragic situation that shocks the heavens. The old and the weak are supporting each other, and the sounds of sorrow shake the earth. In the future, the number will be immeasurable. Seeing these wailing victims, who would not be grieved? And seeking ways to help, we think of our heroic soldiers, with their fearless spirit, fighting the × people on the front lines. We should also embrace compassionate wishes to relieve the refugees in the rear, in order to conform to the common spirit of unity. However, the capacity of our association is limited and we cannot carry out large-scale relief efforts. Starting with those who are closest, we have established the Qiongya Refugee Relief Committee to take on the mission of relief from the perspective of the Qiongya overseas Chinese in Guangzhou Bay. We are now actively promoting it and starting fundraising to lay the foundation for relief. We earnestly hope that domestic and foreign agencies and charitable organizations will uphold the righteousness of supporting each other in times of adversity and express the sincere heart of unity. Quickly develop kindness and provide assistance. As for distant places, where fundraising cannot reach, if you can feel compassion and automatically donate funds by telegraph to our association, we will be even more grateful. During the War of Resistance, it is necessary to strengthen the strength of all parties. The significance of the relief of refugees is even greater, because maintaining the safety of a part of the refugees increases a part of the vitality of the country. Saving the part is to save the whole, and the future of the War of Resistance will eventually release its great brilliance. How can we leave the Qiongya refugees with no way to repay the kindness? This matter concerns relief and is the eager hope of the fleeing compatriots who have no homes. We hereby present this telegram and sincerely request your consideration. Guangzhou Bay Qiongya Fellow Countrymen Association.

### The Southern Battlefield of the Dong River

— Shi Yuan

(Special Report) The southern battlefield of the Dong River is an important part of the South China guerrilla area. It possesses the vast and wealthy counties of Dongguan and Baoan, and most of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Japanese have used great force to conduct several brutal mopping-up operations against it, attempting to open up the international route of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, but the results have been disastrous; all conspiracies have completely failed.

However, due to inconvenient transportation and the rumors spread by traitors, outside understanding of this battlefield is often unclear. Therefore, I am here to give everyone a truthful introduction:

(1) A Natural Guerrilla Area: "The Lychees of Dongguan" I think many people have already heard of them. "Gua Lü" and "March Red" are all coveted delicacies. This time, due to work, I had the opportunity to taste the flavor of March Red and see the vast and beautiful orchards again. However, this year's Dongguan lychees are a bit different from previous years. They are not only expensive food, but also provide excellent cover for the guerrillas. Because the area is full of dense orchards, the mechanized units of the Japanese cannot exert their effectiveness. Our troops can use its cover to move freely, sometimes transforming from scattered to consolidated to give the Japanese a heavy blow, and sometimes transforming from consolidated to scattered to spread to the surrounding villages, so that the Japanese aircraft cannot detect and threaten our army's actions. It is truly a natural guerrilla area.

(2) The "Mosquito Army" in the Mouths of the Japanese: Our army mostly uses nighttime for combat in this area. This type of warfare has yielded many gains, especially the general attack on the 15th of last month, which made the Japanese tremble with fear. We used two companies of troops to completely eliminate the Japanese sentries on the Shilong Bridge and occupied the Shilong Railway Station. The Japanese army, in a state of great panic, used artillery to bombard the surrounding suburbs all night, and the consumption of ammunition was the highest since the fall of Shilong.

On the same night, our army in Dongguan City used only one company to destroy the most solid defensive fortifications of the Japanese in Xidou, broke into the city. Although we were unable to overcome the entire city due to poor communication, the Japanese were completely routed, with over a hundred casualties (a total of about three hundred people), and three small steel cannons were destroyed by us. After daybreak, they were ordered to rotate defenses and were transferred back to the rear for replenishment.

Because of this, the Japanese in Dongguan and Shilong are in a state of terror at night, unable to sleep in peace, fearing the surprise attacks and assaults of the "Mosquito Army."

(3) The Great Civilian Armed Forces: The civilian armed forces in Dongguan and Baoan counties are much stronger than those in other areas of the Dong River. Machine guns, pistols, and each village has them. Just taking the two villages of ×××× in the ×th district of Dongguan as an example, there are ten light machine guns and over a hundred pistols and two hundred Guangdong-made rifles, and even mortars. Other locally made cannons are countless.

Film and Drama

### World Celebrities and Movies

Mussolini loved watching movies, and he also had a strange habit of not liking to read movie reviews. He believed that movie reviews were the most worthless type of work. In order to comply with the Prime Minister's wishes, movie reviews could not be found in Italian newspapers and magazines.

Hitler's interest in movies was also not weak, but he only liked to watch German-made films.

The King and Queen of England also loved watching movies. The King had his own movie room in Sandringham Palace. Although the equipment was not very sophisticated, the films shown were the newest and best. On average, they were shown once a week. In addition to the King and Queen, Queen Mary and other members of the royal family were also in the audience.

Duke Windsor, also a fan of movies, recently watched "Pygmalion" with the President of France, Lebrun.

President and Mrs. Roosevelt also had a great interest in movies. Roosevelt's eldest son, James Roosevelt, served as Roosevelt's private secretary and is now a director at a film production company in Hollywood. Recently, when he was directing "Wuthering Heights," he invited his parents to visit, and the Roosevelts greatly admired it.

General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation, was a movie and theater enthusiast. He believed that the most interesting thing in the world was to watch plays, so whenever he felt uncomfortable, he would go to the theater to relieve boredom.

The great scientist Einstein was not only knowledgeable in science, but also had a great understanding of film art. Recently, it was rumored that he had been hired by a Hollywood film production company to serve as a director. Six years ago, when he visited a California film production company, he intended to devote himself to the film industry to show his genius.

The great writer Shaw had always been very disgusted with movies, so he never wanted to have his works adapted for the screen. Recently, he gradually felt that movies had considerable value, so he was willing to have his work "Pygmalion" made into a film, and there are still a large number of his works in preparation for production.

She gave a mysterious smile, slowly walked up the stairs, and said to the hostess:

"Allow me to introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?"

### South China Football Team to Play Foreign Sailors Today at 5:15 PM at Jia Shan

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The South China football team is now ready to depart on a distant expedition. Sufficient preparations are necessary. Therefore, the charity match originally scheduled for the day before yesterday and the practice match scheduled for yesterday were both held at Jia Shan. If the ball could be adorned with the elegance of Miss Guan Shan, it would be a grand spectacle. The fans were delighted at this news, believing that South China's farewell contribution was a ball game not to be missed.

However, it has been raining continuously for days, and good things are hard to come by. The charity match was cancelled for this reason, and the practice match was also postponed. The general fans all resented the heavens for not being beautiful. However, as the team's departure is imminent, team leader Mo Qingyin bears full responsibility. Regarding the selection of those going on the expedition, it is believed that further review is still required before a decision can be made. Therefore, with the consent of the British warship HMS Concord, the practice match was rescheduled for today at 5:15 PM, still at Jia Shan. This match is equivalent to a selection match, and the performance of those who are selectable but not yet decided will determine their fate.

Last night, the South China Athletic Association staff held a farewell banquet at the Guangzhou Restaurant, attended by dozens of people. During the banquet, they raised their glasses to wish for victory in the future. However, team leader Mo was painstakingly working on the formalities for one or two undecided players. That is why the full list of expedition members has not been disclosed in the newspapers for so long.

Tonight, South China will hold another celebration banquet at the Jinling Restaurant. This South China tour has also won many honors. We wish that after the expedition, the team will truly live up to its name and revive the spirit of sportsmanship and chivalry.

The South China lineup for today is tentatively set as follows, with substitutions in the middle. The strength of the sailors is also strong, so there should be many exciting moments in the competition. This is predictable.

### Continuous Rain Delays Baseball Match South China Stars Feng and Bao to Tour South

…(Special Report from this Newspaper) The Open Baseball League, held after the football season, is one of the most enjoyable sports in the summer.

…Two battles were originally scheduled to take place one after the other starting at ten o'clock yesterday: (1) Western Club vs. Hong Kong Club; (2) South China Club vs. Min Diannu, in good order.

…Heaven did not cooperate, and it rained continuously in the morning, causing the players to be unable to go to the battlefield again, just like the good deeds were ruined by the rain god the day before.

…Although only six teams have joined the battle group this year, because a double round-robin system is adopted, it will take about four months of competition to complete everything. It is hoped that it will not rain every time during the battle period, so as not to hinder the activities of the players.

…In the past few sessions, the South China Club had suspended sending teams to participate, the reason being that there was a lack of such people in the village. This year, due to the Sino-Japanese war, many of the best players have gathered in Hong Kong, so South China has re-raised the flag and sent a team to participate in the competition again, and for the first time in seven weeks, they defeated the Yang Club upon their first expedition, leaving a very good impression on people.

…In the South China team, such as outfielder Feng Jingxiang and shortstop Bao Jiaping, are also famous football players. Recently, these two people will be touring the South, which is a great loss to the team.

…The China team was the champion of the previous session, but the players in the team have changed, and the strength seems to be slightly worse than in the previous session. Therefore, they suffered a defeat when they first encountered the Min team. However, the members still know how to work hard and practice diligently in their spare time. Diligence pays off, and their future is still very optimistic. It is not impossible to continue as champions in the future. In general, try to work hard for it (Donglang)

### Several Common Mistakes for Beginners in Swimming

— Zou Falu

(3) Mouth Exhaling, Nose Inhaling

In general, people on land are accustomed to the method of exhaling through the mouth and inhaling through the nose. Beginners in swimming also use this habit when they reach the water because they are accustomed to it. However, the breathing method when swimming is the opposite of that on land. If you do not change it, it is simply impossible to talk about swimming. When swimming, in order to easily float and move forward, the head is not very easy to come out of the water. The time for breathing is only between turning the head and raising the head. In this short period of time, to complete the mission of inhaling, a large mouth is naturally more convenient than a small nostril. Moreover, because the nostrils are small, the water dripping on the face can always directly enter the lungs with the inhaled air, causing coughing. Therefore, inhaling must be done with the mouth. When swimming, because the head does not often come out of the water, exhaling must be done in the water. When opening the mouth to exhale in the water, the water will inevitably take the opportunity to invade. To expel the water, small nostrils are naturally more convenient than a large mouth. Moreover, since there is ample time in the water, exhaling does not have to be as rushed as inhaling, and using small nostrils is enough to cope. Therefore, exhaling must be done with the nose. This kind of training is the most basic training for swimmers, and it is also the first thing that beginners in swimming must pay attention to.

(4) Afraid to Open Eyes

When beginners in swimming encounter water entering their eyes, they feel a kind of astringent and unbearable pain, which is very unnatural. Therefore, they are reluctant to open their eyes in the water, and they are unwilling to open their eyes on the surface of the water. However, it is impossible to distinguish whether the direction of swimming is wrong, whether the destination of swimming has been reached, and whether there are obstacles in the water and on the surface of the water without opening your eyes. If you are afraid to open your eyes even on the surface of the water because water has entered your eyes, it is not only extremely wrong, but also very dangerous. However, the discomfort of water flowing into the eyes on the surface of the water is the same as the discomfort of water entering the eyes in the water. Therefore, to develop the habit of opening your eyes, you should practice both on the surface of the water and in the water. You must not reluctantly open your eyes on the surface of the water and close them immediately when you reach the water. With this kind of practice, the habit of opening your eyes is not easy to develop.

(5) Random Movement of Hands and Feet

When swimming, the movements of the hands and feet can help the body float up and make the body move forward. However, they must be moved legally, otherwise there will be no good results. For example, to float up, the downward movement of the hands and feet must be faster and more powerful than the forward movement of lifting the hands and retracting the feet. To move forward, the backward movement of paddling with the hands and kicking with the feet must be faster and more powerful than the forward movement of extending the hands and raising the feet. When performing the movements of stepping with the hands and feet or paddling with the hands and kicking with the feet, you must try your best to increase the area of contact between the hands and feet and the water to increase resistance. When performing the movements of lifting the hands and retracting the feet or extending the hands and raising the feet, you must try your best to reduce the area of contact between the hands and feet and the water to reduce resistance. This is the iron rule of swimming. However, beginners in swimming desperately move their hands and feet randomly because their bodies sink and cannot move forward, hoping to float up and move forward. Because of the rapid movements, the movements they make are contrary to the correct methods. As a result, they sink a little faster and move forward a little slower. Therefore, when beginners in swimming do not move their hands and feet legally, they may as well not move when they encounter danger, and they can still float up with the buoyancy of the water. Otherwise, it may lead to unfortunate results.

(6) Wiping Face and Water

When beginners in swimming have water all over their faces, they often wipe it frequently with their hands. Although this action is not very dangerous, it is enough to affect swimming skills. Because the wiping action, no matter how fast you do it, will always take some time. The main mission of a swimmer's hands is to make the body move forward. If you abandon the main mission and turn to other things, the efficiency of moving forward will definitely be reduced. This is a very obvious fact. The reason for this action is actually related to exhaling through the mouth and inhaling through the nose, and being afraid to open your eyes. Because the water on the face will drip into the eyes and be inhaled into the nostrils. It is not easy to open your eyes, and water will invade the lungs. Wiping it dry will naturally make it easier to open your eyes and breathe smoothly. Therefore, to eliminate this bad habit, you must correct the mistakes of breathing and opening your eyes. If you do not need to raise your head to breathe, and you can open your eyes both inside and outside the water, this unnecessary action will disappear by itself. (End)

### Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities Changing Domestic Economic Environment (Continued)

Excessive Optimism About Shanghai's Abnormal Prosperity is Unwarranted Economic Development of the Southwest Depends on Transportation Construction — Annual Report of Shanghai Bank —

Sharp Reduction in Oils Among exports, oils suffered the most severe reduction, decreasing by 53 million yuan, a decrease of more than 73 million yuan compared to the previous year. This is because tung oil exports fell from more than 89 million yuan in the previous year to more than 39 million yuan this year, which was affected by the obstruction of inland transportation. As for export quantities, textiles, livestock products, minerals, yarn, oils, and tea accounted for the largest proportions in descending order.

Japan Ranks First In terms of country, Japan ranked first in imports this year, increasing from 150.4 million yuan in the previous year to 209.8 million yuan this year. The United States was second, decreasing from 188.8 million yuan in the previous year to 151.2 million yuan. Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Dutch East Indies also decreased compared to the previous year. In terms of export goods, Hong Kong ranked first, increasing from 162.9 million yuan in the previous year to 243.3 million yuan. Japan was second, increasing from 84.3 million yuan in the seventh year to 116.5 million yuan. The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, etc. also decreased compared to the previous year.

Shanghai Trade In terms of port, Shanghai has historically accounted for more than half of the country's import and export trade. This year, it decreased from 91.3 million yuan in the previous year to 49.1 million yuan, while other ports increased from 87.8 million yuan in the previous year to 115.7 million yuan. Shanghai's trade only accounts for less than one-third of the total trade volume. A port's trade must have a vast and accessible hinterland to support it. Now, the Yangtze River Basin, which is Shanghai's hinterland, has been reduced to an occupied area, all industries have been suspended, and transportation is obstructed, making it difficult to transport goods. A decline is almost inevitable. All of these are the effects of the current war, which deserves our attention.

Domestic Trade Domestic trade has also been severely affected by the spread of the war. In the past, the transportation and sales of domestic goods relied on Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou as important distribution centers. This year, the Yangtze River waterway is still blocked. Goods in the war zone are difficult to transport. Even trade between the interior and Shanghai and coastal ports must bypass southern China and be transported to Changsha and Hankou via the Yuehan Railway. After Hankou and Guangzhou fell, they were either transported to Kunming via Haiphong and the Vietnamese Railway, or to Guangxi via Guangzhou Bay and the highway, or to the southwest provinces of Taiwan via Wenzhou, Ningbo, and the Zhegan Railway. Transportation is becoming more and more obstructed. Therefore, the manufactured goods needed in the interior and coastal products are in short supply, and prices are rising daily. The raw materials and food supplied to Shanghai from the interior, such as cotton and wheat, cannot be transported either. Shanghai factories have to rely on foreign cotton and foreign wheat. If the war is prolonged, the economic structure of the interior may tend towards self-sufficiency due to the stagnation of domestic trade.

Prices This year, commodity prices in various places have fluctuated dramatically due to the lack of coordination between supply and demand. In general, they tend to rise. The main reason for this is that production has stopped or transportation is difficult. Demand has not increased, but supply has been greatly reduced. Therefore, although the amount of currency has not increased significantly, the prices of various goods have continued to rise. In Shanghai, the general price index rose from 134.3 in December of the previous year (with 1929 as 100) to 159.4 in December of this year, an increase of about 18%. Except for food, the prices of other commodities have risen significantly. The price of various staple foods has remained very stable. Except for a few cities with an increase in refugees, there is no drastic rise. The good harvest last year provided a sufficient supply, which helped maintain order in the interior and contributed to the wartime economy.

Commerce The commercial effects of the war vary greatly from region to region. In Shanghai, industries and businesses within the International Settlement are prospering due to the damage incurred to the districts within the Chinese sectors and the lack of access to Hongkou and Yangshupu. The high profits seen are unparalleled to previous years and can be attributed to several factors:

### Increase in Refugee Population

Funds have also flowed in, stimulating various consumer businesses, such as department stores, entertainment venues, restaurants, and transportation, all of which have seen significant increases in revenue and profits. Due to the high population density, housing has become a problem, and rents have risen daily. The long-dormant real estate industry has also become active, but only in small-scale real estate transactions for housing and factory use.

### Establishment of Foreign Exchange Black Market

After the establishment of the foreign exchange black market, the foreign exchange rate decreased, so importers with inventories have doubled their profits, such as hardware, western medicine, and woolen cloth industries. Although suffering great losses during the war, they can always compensate for more than enough. Exporters also benefit from the favorable exchange rate, and their goods can be sold at good prices. For example, the silk industry, which has been sluggish for many years, has shown signs of recovery this year due to the sharp increase in commodity prices.

### Sharp Reduction in Goods Production

This creates a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. For example, the cotton spinning industry relies entirely on Shanghai for the cotton yarn it needs because inland yarn factories have completely stopped production. However, only yarn factories in the safe zone of the International Settlement are operating in Shanghai, so the demand exceeds the supply, and the price of yarn has soared, with a profit of 100 yuan per piece. The year-end surplus is quite substantial. Other industries such as cotton weaving, silk weaving, iron industry, enamel industry, and match industry also have the same phenomenon. Therefore, the establishment of small-scale new factories after the war is extremely enthusiastic.

### Transportation Obstruction in Production Areas

This results in a shortage of goods sources, and those with inventories dominate and hoard, such as the cotton industry. Due to the shortage of goods sources in the dried cocoon industry and raw hide industry, prices continue to rise, and those with large inventories are making huge profits. All of these factors have led to today's abnormal prosperity in Shanghai, which is a special phenomenon in the wartime economy. However, these factors are mostly temporary. Consumers cannot consume permanently, and producers cannot manipulate the supply. Moreover, the wider the occupied area, the narrower the market. Therefore, the economic future of Shanghai cannot be overly optimistic.

### Domestic Industry and Commerce

Regarding domestic industries and businesses that have fallen into war zones, weaving is at a standstill. The losses are enormous and incalculable. In the southwestern provinces, factories that relocated from the occupied areas initially concentrated in Hankou. Subsequently, various factories from Wuhan successively moved into the Southwest. Despite the extreme difficulties in transportation, they were eventually able to reach their destinations, and some have already begun manufacturing. Their spirit is truly admirable. In terms of commerce, in major cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, due to population increases, there is a superficial appearance of prosperity. Although people are constantly under the threat of air raids, various industries are still making progress. However, due to transportation difficulties, daily necessities are often in short supply, while native products intended for export have become stagnant. Therefore, the key to developing the economy of the Southwest is transportation infrastructure. The government is currently actively constructing railways and highways and establishing various means of transportation. In the future, transportation will inevitably become more convenient, and the development of the Southwest economy will be easier to undertake. In summary, it can be seen that the domestic economic environment has undergone significant changes due to the war.

Observing the above table, food prices have not risen significantly. Therefore, the cost-of-living index in Shanghai has decreased from 158.54 in December of last year to 154.93 in December of this year. Compared to January before August 13th, it has increased by more than 41 percent. However, this cost-of-living index refers to the living expenses of workers in Shanghai. If the proportion of food in the consumption of ordinary white-collar workers is less than that of workers, then their index will inevitably be higher than in December of last year. As for the prices of manufactured goods in the interior, they have also risen sharply. The price of 20-count cotton yarn in Chongqing once rose to 1,000 yuan per package. In addition, the prices of daily necessities and luxury goods, such as towels, toothbrushes, cigarettes, and beer, have increased by one or two times, which is almost commonplace. However, native products that rely on exports have instead fallen in price due to transportation inconveniences. For example, tung oil, gallnuts, and cotton are being sold at lower prices in the production areas while their prices are rising daily in other ports. The difference in prices often exceeds one time. All of this is due to transportation difficulties and high costs, which have disrupted the coordination of supply and demand. However, what is gratifying is that, although most prices have increased sharply,

### "Put Down Your Whip"

— Ji Zi

Since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of intellectual youths fleeing to Hong Kong has been increasing day by day. Here, life is temporarily free from threats, but the problem of living resources has arisen. They must find a way to arrange for the most basic living needs. However, Hong Kong is like a narrow box to them; it is truly difficult to turn around and make a living. Thus, an easy path that eventually becomes difficult lies before them—that is, education. Since anyone with a mouth can speak, in other words, anyone who can speak can "wield the whip" (?). Under this principle, intellectual youths have no choice but to knock on the doors of schools and enter the dead end of education. Also, there are too many people who have received education and can speak, as numerous as flies in the countryside, flying around everywhere. Ultimately, the capacity of schools to hire teachers is limited, and the competition for jobs is becoming increasingly fierce. Unemployment is expected, and there is nothing surprising about it. Those who unfortunately find themselves in the ranks of the unemployed are indeed pitiable, but the extent to which those who have entered the "dragon gate" of education can be considered fortunate is highly questionable. Day after day, night after night, they lecture until their lips are parched and they die, but the content of their lectures does not fully meet the needs of the war of resistance education, nor does it fully align with their own aspirations. They relentlessly灌(guàn, force-feed) detached teaching materials into the minds of the future masters of the country every day and night, doing cultural work that they themselves hate. Because the system of education as private property exists, the relationship between teachers and principals is not much different from the relationship between shop owners and employees. One is a cultural merchant, and the other is a craftsman who provides culture. The latter must constantly be mindful of the former's wishes, paying attention to their own rice bowl, because dismissal is too easy. The reserve army of education in society is overflowing, and filling the position does not require much thought. The teachers are consistently poor and exhausted, like camels on the desert carrying heavy burdens, like oxen dragging plows—these oxen must eat especially little and especially cheaply, like aquatic plants, but they must work quickly and bear a great burden. They must contribute all their strength, bones, flesh, and skin to their masters. "Wielders of the whip" are too miserable!

In the occupied areas and guerrilla zones of our country, there are many tasks that have not yet begun or been completed, urgently requiring a large number of intellectual youths to undertake. The old villages are waiting for the transfusion of new youth. Young teachers who are unwilling to sell their souls, put down your whips! For the sake of the motherland and your own bright future, it is futile to drink a few glasses of clear water and sing a few clear songs to entertain others in a small cage. Prolonged delay will eventually cause you to lose the ability to fly. Eternal dependence on others for support is shameful. The fields and skies of the motherland are so boundless and vast. There, the sea is wide, and the sky is vast, and you can roam freely. There, tens of thousands of soldiers need your education, millions of people fighting for freedom need your organization and mobilization, millions of glorious and wounded civilian heroes need your comfort, and millions of victims who are willing to sacrifice need your arrangements. Send your loud songs to those who do not want to be slaves! Pour your broad knowledge into the minds of the masses and soldiers!

In the land of struggle, there are no vulgar and conventional cultural merchants, and no one needs false praise and flattery. The education there, everything there, is all coordinated with the progress of the war of resistance. Living there, you do not have the usual vulgar pleasures, but what you have is endless hardship and pain, yet also endless joy and elation.

Arise! Young teachers, from today on, put down your whips, shoulder your majestic rifles, and I wish you to grow strong in the flames of war!

### Two Touching Stories

— Zeng Zhaoyun

This topic was brought to me by a comrade who had just returned from the front lines.

The first is about a messenger. On a battlefield in Hubei Province, a certain messenger received an order to deliver a confidential document to friendly forces. The distance between the two locations was about ten li, and the territory of the enemy soldiers lay in between.

He ran quickly, wading through water that reached his shins,穿　(chuān, pass through/wear) through deep forests. He thought only of two things: first, how could he complete the task in the fastest time? Second, how could he avoid the eyes and ears of the enemy soldiers? As he ran, he thought, but the thing he dreaded finally happened. A burst of gunfire struck his ears, and more than a dozen enemy soldiers ran toward him from afar. Our messenger quickly lay down and resisted bravely. His marksmanship was superb, and his tactics were excellent. Two or three bullets killed two or three enemy soldiers, and the others were frightened and dared not advance.

Although the first obstacle was overcome, the second obstacle came again. After traveling more than half the distance, he encountered the hateful enemy again. This time there were even more, more than a hundred! They seemed to know that the messenger was carrying something very important, so they surrounded him on all sides. They closed in without any relaxation, closing in, closing in! This brave soldier knew that there was no hope of breaking through the encirclement, so two more thoughts湧(yǒng, gush/surge) into his mind: first, how could he turn the "document" into ashes? Second, how could he kill a few more enemy soldiers in the final moment?

He quickly decided. He took a hand grenade from his waist, attached the "document" to the hand grenade, stood beside it, and pointed his gun at the enemy soldiers. One enemy soldier after another fell, but the soldiers behind finally surrounded him. The final moment had arrived. Our messenger fired a shot at the hand grenade. "Boom!" A deafening blast rang out. This final act killed himself, shattered the "document," and also took the lives of five enemy soldiers.

A foreign journalist who learned of this news said with great emotion: "China is truly a great China. She has produced countless brave soldiers. This supreme spirit is not only absent in Japan, but it is also difficult to find in the armies of other countries in the world!"

The second story is about a wounded soldier.

A green army truck drove from the front lines to the rear. Inside the truck lay twelve seriously wounded soldiers. Some had their legs blown off by artillery fire, and some had lost both legs and arms. At the rear of the truck was a door for entry and exit. A soldier with an injured left arm was sitting on the second step of the ladder. A snow-white bandage was wrapped around his shoulder and wrist, with fresh red blood seeping through. His　恪(gé, appearance) was very tall and large, and his broad shoulders rubbed against the edge of the door, blocking the way in and out. A group of battlefield慰勞(wèi láo, comfort/salute) teams and medical rescue teams were anxious to go inside to pull out the brothers who were groaning and waiting to be rescued, but this wounded soldier refused to give way. Some people stepped forward to explain to him, once, twice, but he ignored them! A thirteen-year-old child walked up to him very sincerely and said: "Uncle, you are injured! Can you not walk? Let me help you, okay?" As the child spoke, he used his small hand to help the injured soldier. The wounded soldier's face changed, and his eyes turned red, radiating a scarlet light, as if he wanted to eat someone. "Slap!" "Slap!" He slapped the child very　(hěn, very) hard twice. This was probably the greatest pain and insult this child had ever suffered since he came out of his mother's womb. But he held back his tears, walked forward with a smile, bowed deeply to the wounded soldier, and said very gently: "Uncle, we have worked so hard to come here, just to bring you comfort and warmth. Did my actions make you unhappy! Look, listen! There are many brothers inside the truck who are still dying. Because I want to save them to contribute to the motherland, that's why I offended you! Good friend, you are also injured, but you still have two legs to walk on. I'm afraid they can't even sit up! Uncle, I apologize to you, please don't hit me like that, if you do, I will be very sad." These words made the　兵(bīng, soldier) cry, cry loudly! He said in a trembling voice: "Please forgive me! I was wrong! I am a murderous demon. When I was a 'bandit,' I cut off fifteen bloody heads in one breath without shedding a single tear, but this time I was moved by a child, a Boy Scout!" He enthusiastically grabbed the child's small hand and said, "I am very sorry to you!"

The reporter said: "The great spirit of this child is enough to be a role model for us adults. If we want to save the country, we must first learn from these Boy Scouts. This little Boy Scout is a little hero of the nation!"

### The Night at Lianjiangkou

— Xin Ding

To go from Shaoguan to the Qingyuan front line in Beijiang, one must first　(zhuài, drag) a car (both train and highway car are available) to Dakengkou, and then transfer to a small boat along the Beijiang River south. From north to south, it is downstream, probably taking one and a half days to reach Liming and Hengshi. If from south to north, it takes four or five days to return to Dakengkou.

This day, we hired a boat at Dakengkou at six o'clock in the morning, and arrived at Yingde County at two o'clock in the afternoon. After a short rest, we set off again at three o'clock, and arrived at Lianjiangkou at around six o'clock. The sun was setting, and dusk was spreading.

Lianjiangkou was originally a very small market, but travelers going south from Dakengkou stopped here, as if officials in the imperial era had to dismount here. They all had to rest here for the night before they could continue their journey the next day. Therefore, this place gradually became prosperous. However, since the County of Hua was occupied by the enemy, the few people who passed through here were mostly local villagers, and most were armed comrades on missions.

Two armed comrades were traveling with me. One was a company commander of the Artillery Corps of the ×th Division, and the other was also a company commander of the Infantry Corps of the ×th Division. They were temporary traveling companions whom I met by chance in Dakengkou in order to share a boat and save money. The infantry company commander was silent and spoke little; the other company commander loved to talk and laugh, and was very outgoing, which reduced the loneliness of the journey. When the boat had not yet arrived at Lianjiangkou, he was clamoring to stay at a hotel in Lianjiangkou that night and have a good time.

The market of Lianjiangkou is next to the river. Many of the buildings by the river are made of wood, looking like pigeon nests from afar, supported by high wooden pillars underneath. Leaning on the windows and doors of the buildings are some heavily made-up women in brightly colored clothes with unbuttoned collars, making it clear that they are the "angels" of the night—prostitutes. When our boat docked at the pier, it was almost dark. We hurriedly went ashore to find a hotel, opened a large room, and then went out to have dinner. At this time, it was not "ten thousand lights," but a dark street. Most of the shops had closed their doors, and only a few food stalls were lit with particularly bright gas lamps. The "angels" were walking back and forth on the street, in front of the food stalls, waiting for their masters.

It turned out that they were all singers who sang southern tunes, mostly around fifteen or sixteen years old. The signs of two or three shops read "XX Hotel", and pasted with 风楼(fēng lóu, literally wind tower, a euphemism for brothel) and 某　楼(mǒu lóu, certain tower) were their main bases. At first, when we went ashore, we did not know the situation and thought they were ordinary hotels.　We went upstairs to take a look, and it turned out that there was a large group of them, talking and laughing; we realized that we were wrong and hurried down. However, a certain company commander among us lingered there, looking left and right. When he went downstairs, he laughed loudly, saying, "It's very interesting, haha!"

After eating dinner at the restaurant, a certain company commander drank two glasses of white wine, and his face covered with　(mǎn, full) dense short whiskers looked particularly ruddy. He said he was going to visit a friend and left alone. The artillery company commander and I returned to the hotel, chatting about artillery life, and soon went to sleep.

Being cooped up in a small boat all day had been very tiring, but how could we sleep? Soon after falling asleep, a defense officer came to check the rooms. After checking, the next-door neighbor called a southern tune singer to come and "flirt and scold" [idiom for playful interaction], singing nonsense for half the night before she came down. But the company commander who went to "visit a friend" never returned to the hotel.

The next morning, we got up at six o'clock. Waiting until about seven o'clock, we still did not see him return. We all laughed and said it was a bit strange, and that something must have happened. We ran to the street to eat porridge, just passing by the "Double Wind Tower". Someone was carrying water inside, and the person who opened the door was a 南　(nán, southern) singer wearing a dotted long shirt, sleepy-eyed and not yet dressed. We tried shouting loudly upstairs:

"Commander ×!" Sure enough, a reply came from upstairs immediately:

"Hey, I'm here!"

We laughed loudly. Commander × was wearing his undershirt and opened the upstairs window to greet us,

"The boat is leaving, if you don't come down, we will leave first!"

"No, wait for me, I'll be right there!" He was anxiously threatened by us.

We went back to the boat first and waited for a while before he leisurely came. We asked:

"Was it sweet last night?" He replied with a smile:

"Not bad! I'll have to come and taste it again next time I pass by here."

### The Heat Burned My Chest

— Xuan Qingfeng

The flames of war illuminate the vast blue sky,

The sound of cannons shakes the wide expanse,

My blood boils, my heart races,

The heat forged my chest;

Rushing to Han Qing to go,

Carrying endless pain,

Throwing a tough body,

Into a hard and beautiful farm.

Under the rustic sunlight,

Gleaming, the dark and oily skin of the farmers,

Glaring with round eyes;

If the poisonous claws of ×× had not stretched into our country,

Our lives would not be so积　(jī, stagnant),

The anger in my heart will never disappear,

The rage burns on.

The rage burns on,

Hoe after hoe,

耙(bà) and 犁(lí) [farm tools for plowing],

Using the firepower of brave 械(xiè, weaponry),

Towards the Han wilderness,

An eruption of private revenge.

Every hot spark,

Burns every cell in my body,

My flesh swells with gasps,

Bursting forth,

Releasing a bold song,

Like the powerful roar on the battlefield.

### Section Chief

— Lin Yingchuang

This section chief was someone I visited when I passed through ×× because of work development and handling procedures. Originally, we were looking for the county magistrate. Later, we learned that the section chief was also in charge of this matter, and he was also the head of the Anti-Enemy Association's Propaganda Work Group.

We ran to the county government three times before we were told: that was not a place to visit, especially for us. Later, due to　(zhēn, true) our child-like sincere visit, we were allowed to see us in the Propaganda Work Group leader’s office!

There was only one "group member" in the Propaganda Work Group, tidying up miscellaneous tasks. Zhong and Hua and I waited from two o'clock to four o'clock. A newspaper had already been　(sàn, scattered) ripped and torn, then we saw the section chief walk in with a short cane. He wasn’t very tall, and his face was like one of the Four Heavenly Kings in a large temple. He was wearing a well-tailored Western suit. As soon as he sat down, he kept pulling at the few　　(xiū, whiskers) whiskers growing under his mouth, looking very formidable, as if he couldn’t have expressed his esteemed position without doing so.

"You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you?" he said faintly.

"Not really　(ba, a particle implying doubt), only two hours," Zhong said mischievously.

"Hmm... where are you from?" He didn't seem to pay attention to our situation.

"We came from our occupied hometown — Xiamen," I replied.

"Hmm, so you're a small refugee team!" he said with some emotion.

"But we want to continue doing national salvation work. So we don't want to be refugees with our parents, to be subservient citizens!" Li said somewhat unconvinced.

"But who do you rely on for a living?" He fiercely pulled out a whisker.

"Hmm, we use work to gain people's sympathy. We eat thanks to the enlightened officials and dear compatriots everywhere. We sleep on the ground all the way, wear straw sandals, and even seven-year-old comrades run seventy or eighty li!" …

"Isn't this kind of life very hard?" he said impatiently.

"No, our slogan is to endure hardship and overcome difficulties; in this great era, not only must we endure hardship, but we must also seek out hardship!" Li continued to explain.

"I think you are so young, you should go back and live with your parents and study hard," he said somewhat pityingly.

"Who wants to go back and study the books of slaves? … But we know that national reconstruction is needed after the war of resistance, and we are also needed, so I always try to educate myself in exile! We use mutual assistance and collective research to study various issues in the war of resistance," Hua said with outward passion, but with some anger inside.

"There is also research, so you must know about communism.一(Yī, one) He thought　(xiē, some) that these children were too advanced, so he hurriedly asked. Suddenly, he urgently asked, "Tell me: what is communism?"

"Hmm, we know that it is a group of people who support the war of resistance and work hard to kill　(dí, enemy)."

"Just these single paper?" He asked again cautiously, "Really?"

"Yes, that's all we know."

"Hmm…" he muttered for a moment: "I'll tell you: now we only have one doctrine... the Three Principles of the People. Violating it is destroying the war of resistance, and that's being a traitor! So you have to work hard to implement it, understand?"

"What the section chief said is correct. We also know that the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is national independence, civil rights and freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness. Therefore, we follow our example to discuss any unreasonable places for the people and officials, according to this to that, so that everyone can understand and cooperate with each other!"

He felt a bit of a headache, so he cast a glance at the　(shàng, up) the ceiling. Although there was no wall clock, he pretended, "Time's up, I have official business!" After he finished, he took his cane and left without even turning his head.

We sighed helplessly and moved on to our goal. When we were in the secretary-general's reception room, the section chief was already shouting loudly over there, precisely because of us.
