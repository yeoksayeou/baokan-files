### Legislative Issues Concerning Ethnic Minorities in Southwestern China

— Ding Yuchang

Anyone who has traveled to or studied the history and geography of China's western border regions knows that our country has many ethnic groups. Besides the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan five races, there are also many ethnic minorities distributed in the western provinces. Roughly speaking, there are the Lolo and Pai Yi of Yunnan, the Fan of Xikang, the Miao and Yao of Guizhou, the Yao of Guangxi, Guangdong, and western Hunan, the Li of Hainan Island, and the Yi of the eight counties of the old Jianchang Dao in Sichuan (now under the jurisdiction of Xikang Province)... totaling no less than several million people, with Guizhou Province having the largest number, where it is said that "the Han account for four-tenths of the population, and the Miao six-tenths." If these ethnic minorities are combined with the Hui in Xinjiang and Gansu, the Tibetan and Fan in Tibet and Qinghai, the Mongol in Mongolia, and the Manchus who have not been Hanified in the far reaches of the three northeastern provinces, the total should be no less than twenty or thirty million people. In our country, because of the large Han population, this is still a relatively small number. According to anthropological research, these ethnic minorities are the closest to the Han in terms of bloodline. And due to historical wars and commercial relationships, they have close political, economic, and cultural ties with the Han. However, on the other hand, they still maintain their unique culture and language and have not been completely Hanified. Even in terms of law, although laws have been implemented in various provinces throughout history and have maintained their uniformity, most of the ethnic minorities mentioned above have been regarded as outside the sphere of civilization. They have not been strictly enforced, and this is still the case today.

Throughout history, the central government's policy towards the ethnic minorities in southwestern China (including the Miao, Yao, Dong, Li, Lolo, and Pai Yi) has been limited to maintaining suzerainty, allowing their leaders to govern their tribes. Apart from paying tribute and engaging in war, there was very little direct contact. They were also unlike the Manchus and Mongols, who once entered the Central Plains and ruled the Han, and who had legally placed themselves in a superior position. For example, the Jin Dynasty legally stipulated three classes: "Zhenren," "Aoren," and "Nanren"; the Yuan Dynasty divided people into four classes: "Mongols," "Semu," "Han," and "Nanren"; and the Qing Dynasty divided people into "Banner People" and "Han People" to oppress the Han. Their economic lives have mostly remained in hunting, nomadic, or early agricultural societies. From a materialistic historical point of view, their ideologies are confined to the tribal or feudal category, which is different from the Han, who have entered industrial and commercial society. Therefore, the laws created by us Han are naturally difficult to apply equally to these ethnic minorities. From the late Jin Dynasty when the Five Barbarians caused chaos to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, the Han constantly used force to conquer them, forcing them to retreat deep into the mountainous regions of the southwest. After the Tang Dynasty, the leaders of the surrendered tribes or generals who had made meritorious contributions in conquest were often appointed as their hereditary officials, establishing the Tusi system. The Tusi was the highest and only master in the tribe he was enfeoffed, but once he entered the Han officialdom, he was in the lowest position. This kind of feudal Tusi had the notion that "I am the law" for his subordinates. He had the power of life and death over the ethnic minorities under his rule, according to his likes and dislikes, and the central government or local officials had no right to advise him. As a result, these people lived in dire straits and often rebelled. After the implementation of the "Gaitu Guiliu" policy in the late Qing Dynasty, the feudal Tusi system was gradually abolished, the regular local government was reorganized, and these ethnic minorities were liberated, allowing them to live as commoners. In all the places where "Gaitu Guiliu" was implemented, most of the ethnic minorities have been Hanified and it is difficult to preserve their culture. But until now, this feudal Tusi system has not been completely eliminated in various border regions. Even in places where officials have been nominally appointed, due to the authorities' poor implementation, it is still a formality, and the real power is still in the hands of the descendants of the old Tusi. Therefore, the status of these ethnic minorities is not equal to that of the Han in fact. The provisional constitution stipulates that all citizens of the Republic of China are equal, regardless of gender, race, religion, or occupation. In the southwestern provinces, it can be said that this has not been implemented, and it is by no means an exaggeration.

In the past, among the southwestern provinces, Guangxi was the most active in seeking liberation for ethnic minorities in politics. Guangxi was also the place where ethnic minorities were Hanified the fastest and most universally. Decades ago, most of western Guangxi was ruled by Tusi, but today, except for the Yao Mountains in the middle of the Liujiang and Guijiang Rivers, which still retain some Yao tribes, there is no trace of Tusi rule. The Yunnan Provincial Government has also set up Colonial Border Commissioner's Offices in the western border areas and implemented special education for the border areas, which has also been quite effective. As for Xikang, after it became a province, it is said that it will also set up bureaus to influence the Yi people (who live in the eight counties of the old Jianchang Dao) who have never interacted with the Han. This shows that after the Anti-Japanese War, as the political center moved to the western plateau, the central government is actively promoting the work of liberating ethnic minorities.

We should indeed liberate the ethnic minorities who are under the oppression of feudal Tusi and make them equal to the Han in law and in fact. However, whether we should eliminate their native languages and thoroughly Hanify them is a question that can be discussed. For the legislation of ethnic minorities in southwestern China, in principle, we should follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. In terms of technology, we hope that the government will consider the following points:

First, the central and local legislative bodies should have representatives from various ethnic minorities participating, so that they can contribute their opinions to the special legislation of their own people.

Second, the validity of the languages of ethnic minorities should be recognized in law, and the use of ethnic names containing insults or contempt for the Chinese language should be prohibited in order to harmonize ethnic feelings.

Third, the areas where ethnic minorities live should be demarcated as "legal domains" different from those of the Han. The current civil, criminal, and commercial laws should be applied according to their economic life and cultural level, and taking into account their inherent good customs, to determine the scope of implementation. Or even enact separate laws and regulations to make it possible to implement them.

Fourth, the Tusi system must be abolished. Special legislation must be enacted for the production and construction, education and culture of ethnic minorities to help them develop.

We believe that legislation based on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings will be the beginning of the liberation of ethnic minorities in southwestern China.

### Weekly Review of World Trends

— Gong Zhao

From June 18th to 24th, 28th year of the Republic [1939]

(1) Hesitating and vacillating, Britain and France ×××× Insist on their stance, the Soviet Union's prestige is greatly enhanced

The British and French governments are still hesitating at a crossroads. For the sake of their own people and world peace, they cannot but embark on the path of anti-aggression. However, the current interests of the ruling class themselves prevent them from having the far-sighted vision they should have, and they stubbornly fear the aggressors' fabricated "Bolshevik aggression" used to scare Britain and France! Therefore, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which were the beginning of the anti-aggression movement, are still in a state of taking two steps forward and one step back. Over the past week, British special envoy Strang continued negotiations in Moscow, but because the so-called new counterproposal of Britain and France is still far from the basic conditions of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, there has been little result. At the same time, the British and French governments are still secretly communicating with the aggressors. The appendix to the Anglo-German debt agreement was signed in London on the 16th of this month, and the scope will be extended to the Sudetenland. The new commercial treaty between France and Japan was also signed in Tokyo on the 23rd of this month. In addition, the German Haidong News Agency also reported that Britain and France will both provide loans to Spain under German and Italian rule!

The Soviet Union is now adhering to its original position, which fully demonstrates that socialist Soviet Union does not compromise or yield to any aggressor; it fully demonstrates that the Soviet Union is strong and is a pillar of anti-aggression, but it is unwilling to be used by others to pull chestnuts out of the fire. As for the Haidong News Agency and the Allied News Agency of the German and Japanese aggressors spreading news that Germany is currying favor with the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union's attitude is strong, this is a shameless rumor. The Soviet Union will certainly not be swayed by the aggressors' conspiracies, and people of insight in Britain and France can also see through the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement and should not delay signing it: Churchill delivered a speech on the 21st, opposing the policy of hesitating and vacillating, and urging the government to complete negotiations on cooperation with the Soviet Union as soon as possible.

(2) Unquenched ambitions, Germany and Italy strengthen collusion

The flames of war are flying, and Asia and Europe are both threatened.

The vacillating policies of democratic and peace-loving countries such as Britain and France directly and indirectly help the aggressor countries, which increases the risk of a world war. The first to suffer, in addition to the small and weak nations, are Britain and France themselves.

This week, Germany and Italy have further colluded. First, Germany and Italy will send personnel to Berlin on the 19th of this month to discuss matters to make the economic cooperation between the two countries closer, and detailed clauses will be established soon, and the commercial relations between the two countries and Bohemia and Moravia will be decided. Second, after several days of consultations, Germany and Italy established an agreement on naval cooperation between the two countries on the 20th of this month. At the same time, Germany and Italy held naval exercises separately. Germany's exercise began on the 16th, and Italy's exercise began on the 19th to demonstrate in the Mediterranean for two weeks.

This week, Germany's military and diplomatic activities were also intensified. In the military aspect, 100,000 German troops continued to be transferred east and concentrated on the borders of Slovakia and Poland. In diplomacy, in addition to creating rumors and undermining the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, they continued to woo small countries in Europe and Asia: The German Army Chief of Staff has confirmed that he will return visits to Estonia and Finland. Germany's enticements and threats to the Near East countries, especially to the Arabs, have been particularly vigorous this week, and negotiations are underway to exchange aircraft for oil rights.

The flames of war of the German and Italian aggressors are about to connect with the flames of the Japanese ×× in East Asia!

(3) Appeasement? Britain backs down on legal cases, the Soviet Union and the United States protest against Japan by speaking righteously

The Eastern ×× Japanese aggressors, targeting the vacillating policies of Britain and France, also took further intimidating tactics, and the blockade of Tianjin was the most eye-catching move. As British Admiral Keikes said in his speech on the 18th of this month: "In the Tianjin incident, Japan obtained the support of Germany and Italy, which is actually equivalent to declaring war on the British Empire. This provocative behavior must be dealt with!"

What countermeasures did the British government take? It is again a two-sided policy. On the one hand, the British government issued an important declaration on the 16th regarding the Japanese × blockade of the Tianjin Concession, saying: "The British government has to consider all rapid and active steps to protect British interests in China." On the other hand, the same declaration also stated: "The British government still hopes that the Japanese authorities will not insist on their refusal to consider the British proposals, so that this incident can be resolved locally and partially!"

However, the Japanese × blockade of the British Concession, as the British declaration stated: "It is obviously using violence to force the British government and other countries with interests in the Far East to abandon their consistent policies in the past." How can this be "resolved locally and partially"? What will be the result of Britain's policy of concession, except to increase the threat to British interests in the Far East?

Although the Soviet Union is "not involved," the national newspapers have published comments one after another, condemning the Japanese × atrocities and calling on democratic and peace-loving countries to jointly impose sanctions. The Soviet government first lodged a stern protest with the Japanese side on the 18th because the Japanese side instigated White Russians to forcibly occupy the Soviet Consulate General in Tianjin.

Although the United States has been secretly wooed by the Japanese ×, the development of the Japanese × forces is actually a threat to the United States. Therefore, the United States has always paid close attention to the Tianjin case. However, the United States has not taken any major action because Britain has not taken any resolute resistance. However, both the American people and the government have successively denounced the Japanese × and expressed their willingness to cooperate with Britain and France. US Secretary of State Hull officially expressed concern about the "broad situation" in Tianjin on the 19th, and the US Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo has repeatedly protested to Japan.

(4) Reaching the end of forbearance, Britain plans to retaliate against Japan by preempting the attack, and the Japanese × suddenly occupy Shantou

The Soviet Union, the United States, and our country's authorities have successively expressed righteousness and indignation at the Japanese × blockade of the Tianjin Concession and pointed out that victory can only be achieved by jointly resisting.

This expression and instruction, combined with the demands of the British and French people and the majority of political figures, has indeed had a significant impact on Britain. According to Reuters dispatches from London on the 17th and 18th, the British Ministry of Commerce, Finance, and Foreign Affairs has realized that it is unbearable to tolerate Japan and decided to take retaliatory measures: (1) Cancel Japan's original most-favored-nation treatment, (2) Abolish the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911, so that Japan loses its great market in British colonies,

(3) Impose heavy taxes on all imported Japanese goods.

If these retaliatory measures are implemented, it will be a serious blow to Japan, which is suffering from economic collapse. At this time, the Japanese × believed that "striking first is stronger" and that Shantou is currently the only port for trade between Britain and our country, so they suddenly landed in Shantou on the 21st, giving the British commerce in South China a final blow. On the 23rd, the spokesman of our Military Affairs Commission also pointed out that the Japanese × occupation of Shantou, the so-called cutting off the import of our military equipment, is only a self-deceiving statement. The purpose is to expel the European and American forces in China, monopolize our coastal ports, and establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia."

It can be seen that the Japanese × invasion and occupation of Shantou is still a continuation of the consistent style of invading Hainan Island, Spratly Island, Gulangyu, and the Shanghai and Tianjin concessions this spring. We see from this that "local solution" and all compromises and concessions cannot solve the Far East issue, the Munich trick cannot be applied to the Far East, and the development of the Japanese × forces is an inevitable trend that will inevitably increase its conflicts with the European and American powers. If Britain wants to maintain its interests in the Far East, it can only strengthen its cooperation with China, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union!

(5) Destroying the enemy at breakfast, Shantou is severely attacked by our army, and the enemy's conspiracy is undermined, and national politics is progressing.

In addition to the main threat to Britain, the Japanese × occupation of Shantou certainly has considerable economic, political, and military significance. We should not evade it, especially should not ignore it. First, the Japanese ×, in view of the repeated defeats in the invasion of China and the rising domestic disputes over the invasion of China policy and the anti-war anger, announced the occupation of Shantou, which had long been under control, as a major victory after Nanchang, in order to cover up its military decline. Second, the Japanese × also wanted to use this to shake our country's determination to resist Japan and help Wang Jingwei and his party of wavering elements and stubborn elements in order to divide the anti-Japanese front and establish a puppet central government. Third, economically, on the one hand, it will prevent the export of goods from our inland areas and strengthen the destruction of our foreign exchange and legal tender, and on the other hand, it will block the economic routes of the guerrilla warfare in the southeastern provinces. In the future, there will be further harassment of the coastal areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. In addition, of course, there are also attempts to contain our troops in northern Guangdong and southern Jiangxi in order to strengthen its consolidation of the occupied areas in the southeast.

However, our defending troops in Chaozhou and Shantou have risen up to resist! We must not only use the spirit of "destroying the enemy at breakfast" and "not allowing the Japanese × to advance," but also give the Japanese × a merciless and serious blow in terms of politics, economy, and international relations. Over the past week, despite the rumors and heresies spread by the Japanese ×, traitors, Wang Jingwei, etc., the new facts in the past week, such as the overseas Chinese groups and individuals from all over the world, the front-line soldiers of all routes, receiving the central government's telegram to strictly arrest the traitor Wang Jingwei, quickly flew to Chongqing; such as the southward migration of the Genghis Khan Mausoleum, the Mongol enthusiasm showed support for the central government's long-term resistance to Japan and strive for national liberation; such as the Shanghai news media firmly supporting the central government and national unity, and Wang Jingwei's peace, anti-communism, and national salvation remarks and terrorist acts have been resolutely fighting; such as our Ministry of Finance on the 22nd took emergency measures to prevent the escape and speculation of gold, stabilize the financial market, and help the domestic production; especially the Central Military Affairs Commission issued an order to all civil and military officials across the country to earnestly respect public opinion and the lives of the people; these facts are enough to undermine the Japanese × current political offensive and the conspiracy to feed war with war, and the international situation is becoming more and more favorable to us.

(6) Far East Joint Defense, the Singapore Conference opens, sharing the same hatred, Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands cooperate

How is the international situation becoming more and more favorable to us? This week, we can list: (1) The Director of the International Labour Office delivered a speech on the 22nd, sympathizing with our country's workers, stepping up the united front to resist the Japanese ×, and calling on people around the world to find ways to provide relief; (2) The British General Assembly of the Anti-Aggression Conference passed a resolution on the 23rd, urging the government to take diplomatic and economic actions independently and immediately to stop Japanese aggression. In addition, what is particularly noteworthy is that the Far East military authorities of Britain and France held a Far East Joint Defense Conference in Singapore on the 22nd. It is said that this conference may establish the following agreement: (1) Establish a Central Command of the Far East British and French Allied Forces, (2) Concentrate the wartime raw materials of the two countries, (3) Draft military plans in the event of war with Japan, (4) The two countries jointly strive to build the Cam Ranh Bay of French Indochina into France's Singapore, (5) Measures to jointly protect the British and French concessions in China, (6) Steps to protect British and French commercial ships in the Far East, (7) Steps to guarantee the transportation lines with Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States. In addition, it is also reported that Britain and France will discuss cooperation with the United States and the Netherlands to safeguard the Far East's interests and genuine peace.

We must point out here that as the Japanese × forces develop, the contradictions with Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries will inevitably develop. Today, it has entered a stage of direct conflict, especially since the × occupied Xiamen in May last year and the × occupied Guangzhou in October, to this year's February, when the × occupied Hainan Island, the end of March, when the × occupied Spratly Island, and May, when they invaded Gulangyu, and more recently, the blockade of the Tianjin Concession and the forcible occupation of Shantou City, all of which can prove that the Japanese × has begun a large-scale offensive against Britain and France, attempting to drive out the European and American forces in the Far East! Today, the only way out for Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands is to cooperate sincerely, help China win the Anti-Japanese War, and take direct actions to resist the Japanese × in cooperation. The Singapore Conference should be the beginning of the democratic and peace-loving countries organizing the Far East anti-aggression front!

Note: Due to the length and time constraints, we have not been able to fully describe the Sino-Soviet, Sino-French New Treaty, the Faludo Agreement, the New Balkan Joint Defense Convention, the British-French Far East Joint Defense, and the British-American Barter Agreement. Please read today's Xiaoxu's "Sino-Soviet, Sino-French New Treaty" and the Japan Newspaper's commentary "Sino-Soviet, Sino-French New Treaty and the High Tide of International Anti-Aggression."

### Our Troops Launch Attacks on the Border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi We Hold the Advantage in Fierce Battles in Southern Shanxi

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] After our troops abandoned Yuanqu and Gaoluo, new arrangements have been made. According to a telephone call from the front line on the 23rd, there are currently over tens of thousands of Japanese troops along the Yuanqu-Gaoluo Avenue. On the 23rd, our troops engaged in a day-long fierce battle with a certain army in Wangmaozhen and its northeastern and southwestern areas. The situation was intense, and our troops had a clear advantage. There was also a bloody battle in Matigou, north of Gaoluo, on the 23rd. After our troops wiped out the remnants of the Japanese troops in the east and west of Majiazhuang and the highlands of Pugu (southeast of Yanzhang), the Japanese troops reinforced with a large number of troops, repeatedly fought for it, and the fighting became increasingly fierce. The Japanese troops also used a large amount of poison gas. At the moment, one of our troops has advanced towards the Kou□□ area and is attacking the Japanese troops in a pincer movement.

### Anti-British Movement Intensifies in the Occupied Areas of North China; Puppets Ordered to Present Four Demands to Britain; Extension of the Blockade of the French Concession in Hankou Implemented

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] On Friday, major cities in the occupied areas of North China, including Peiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, and Kaifeng, held anti-British demonstrations and parades to commemorate the June 23rd Shakee Massacre. Pro-Japanese elements gave speeches to the parading masses, denouncing Britain as an enemy of peace and claiming that China would have no peace as long as Britain continued to aid the National Government.

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 24th] Although anti-British movements are prevalent in Tianjin and other parts of North China, the local Japanese authorities are currently attempting to take strict measures to avoid anti-British demonstrations.

The British Consul-General in Tianjin has telegraphed the details to London for instructions.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A dispatch from Hankou reports that according to reliable sources, the enemy originally planned to implement a blockade of the French Concession in Hankou on the 21st of this month, but has since accepted the request of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Hankou and extended the deadline. The implementation will depend on the outcome of the Tianjin incident. Newspapers in Hankou are extensively promoting anti-British and anti-foreign propaganda, and are demanding that the regime under enemy control implement the recovery of the concessions, but no action has been taken so far.

### Implementation of the Public Treasury Law on Schedule; Temporary Extension Granted to Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Ningxia; Flexible Handling in Guerrilla Areas

### Commendation of Xiao Focheng

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The National Government issued an order on the 24th: Xiao Focheng, member of the National Government, was upright and loyal, with unwavering determination. In his early years, he resided in Siam, joined the Tongmenghui, and engaged in reform movements. He donated funds and provided financial support, leading by example with great righteousness. He mobilized the overseas Chinese with remarkable results. After the Republic was established, he did not compete for positions but cherished the prestige of the Party and the nation for decades. He was expected to offer advice and assistance, but unexpectedly, amidst the ongoing difficulties, he has prematurely passed away. After reviewing his final words, we are deeply saddened. A funeral allowance of 5,000 yuan is granted, and his life's achievements will be recorded and preserved in the History Museum to demonstrate our deep respect and remembrance for this esteemed elder.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 23rd] The Southwest Garrison Headquarters Special Party Branch held a party member oath ceremony on the morning of the 23rd.

### Enemy Politicians Rave, Claiming to Represent National Public Opinion and Requesting the Japanese Emperor to Declare War on China

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Ōtaka, Member of the House of Peers, Honda, and renowned publisher Miyake have jointly submitted a petition requesting the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal to present it to the Japanese Emperor. The petition demands that the Japanese government declare war on China in order to obtain the rights of a belligerent nation. Government officials say that the so-called acquisition of the rights of a belligerent nation refers to declaring war on China. There are two reasons for this: (1) The supply of military goods and assistance from foreign countries to China must be stopped; (2) It is impossible to resolve the issue of foreign concessions in China before declaring war. Without taking effective action on this point, the Sino-Japanese war will never end. Ōtaka and the other two also claim that the reason for directly presenting the petition to the Japanese Emperor is to express the public opinion of the nation, as there is no better way.

### Air Raids in Hunan and Jiangxi; Foreign Church in Changde Destroyed by Bombing

[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 23rd] Thirty enemy aircraft in multiple batches invaded Jiangxi and Hunan on the 23rd. The first batch of six aircraft flew to Luocheng, a locality in Wanzai County, at 7:00 AM, dropping four bombs, destroying over twenty civilian houses, and causing over twenty civilian casualties. The second batch of six aircraft flew west via Zhangshu around 7:00 AM, invaded Hengyang and dropped bombs. The third batch of three aircraft scouted the areas around Xinyu and Yichun around 7:00 AM before fleeing. The fourth batch of six aircraft fled west along the Zhegan Railway to Hengyang and bombed it again. The fifth batch of two aircraft scouted Wenjiazhen, a locality in Linchuan County, for a week around 12:00 PM before leaving. The sixth batch of three aircraft invaded Ganzhou from Guangdong Province around 1:00 PM, dropping several bombs in the suburbs before fleeing along the original route. The seventh batch of two aircraft invaded Shanggao around 1:00 PM, dropping five bombs. The eighth batch of two aircraft fled to Lijia Ferry, a locality in Linchuan County, at 2:00 PM, dropping four bombs. We suffered no losses.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 24th] When enemy aircraft attacked Changde on the 23rd, several foreign churches in the East Gate area and the Muslim Quarter, where our Muslim compatriots reside, were also destroyed by bombing.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 24th] At around 10:00 AM on the 24th, another nine enemy aircraft invaded Changde from Hubei and dropped multiple bombs. Simultaneously, another twenty-four enemy aircraft in four batches attacked Xiangyin, dropping over a hundred bombs.

### Interview with Yan Xishan

— Reporter Lin Huanping from the Minge Society

(Minge Society Dispatch) We—the guide Mr. Yan and the reporter—arrived in front of an old, dilapidated cave dwelling of ordinary people. The reporter heard Mr. Yan say: "This is Mr. Yan's 'mansion'." The reporter was surprised by the ordinariness of this "mansion."

After handing over the card and entering the doorway, Mr. Yan immediately stood up, introduced himself, shook hands with the reporter, and invited him to sit down, smiling and saying:

"You've worked hard. The climate and living habits are different here. Are you coping well?"

His kindness and concern for young people were revealed in the radiant glow on his face.

The reporter felt very apprehensive and quickly replied:

"I am very grateful for Commander-in-Chief's kindness."

Mr. Yan was wearing a gray cloth Zhongshan suit, without a belt, without a collar badge, and certainly without shoulder boards. He was wearing cloth shoes, and his military cap was placed on a low table. He was only wearing a black cloth hat used for sleeping or keeping his hair in place. The cave dwelling was extremely simple, without windows. There was an earthen kang covered with felt, and on top of the felt was a bed sheet folded with two cotton quilts. A small table about a foot high had an inkstone, a writing brush, and a stack of stationery. Two long benches were placed in front of the kang. Two small boxes were placed deep inside the cave. There was nothing else. Who could imagine that this was Commander-in-Chief Yan's "mansion," office, reception room, and bedroom all in one?

"You came from the rear, no, from abroad. What is the status of the overseas Chinese's resistance?"

The reporter interviewed Mr. Yan because he wanted to know more about the heroic resistance on the front lines. Now, he was being asked about the situation in the rear, which shows his concern for the rear. It also shows how the heroic people fighting on the front lines, in a state of information isolation, long to know everything about the rear. After the reporter gave him a brief account, he asked in return:

"What are Commander-in-Chief's thoughts on the current stage of the North China resistance?"

"The enemy will absolutely not be able to take North China." The old general sat up straight, resting his left arm on the table, and said: "If North China cannot be taken, then the enemy's dream of subjugating China will never be realized." He paused, took a sip of tea, and continued calmly: "In reality, the enemy's invasion of us is not simply an invasion war under political and strategic command, and it is bound to fail!"

Mr. Yan usually meditates deeply, and his words often become maxims. In philosophy, he has the "Doctrine of the Mean" with the concept of mother-principle and son-principle as the center of his thought. In economics, he has the original concept of "property certificates and distribution according to labor." Therefore, Mr. Yan's conversation has the demeanor of a Confucian scholar, his words are extremely concise, and he has the spirit of a military man, his words are very resolute.

During our conversation, we happened to have read Chairman Chiang's speech on April 17, declaring the firmness of our basic national policy of resisting to the end. Our topic naturally turned to this. He wiped his palms and looked at the reporter with bright eyes, saying:

"Resistance is the means, nation-building is the goal. Peace and compromise, even if the Japanese unconditionally withdraw their troops and restore the state before the July 7th Incident, my nation-building career will be doomed! Because our two thousand years of great unification (referring to the feudal unified politics from the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty! China) has poisoned the Chinese nation into useless people who have lost self-confidence and have no sense of responsibility. Now, thanks to the enemy's cannons and bombs, the inferiorities in the psychological foundations of our people have been shaken, but they have not been completely eradicated! If the war is once reconciled, then the people will repeat that kind of temporary life, and our country will never have hope of modernization. Judging from the current situation, as long as the resistance is sustained for another year, then those inferiorities in our country will be completely eradicated; the enemy will also collapse. Our country must unite sincerely, progress collectively, and overcome this difficulty, and finally..."

Speaking here, the old general's hatred for the enemy was deeply expressed in his eyebrows, and his confidence in the victory of resistance and the success of nation-building shone on his full face. The muscle movements on that face, under the coarse brown skin tanned by the sun and sand, even more fully symbolized the spirit of hardship and determination when he went to the enemy's rear to supervise the battle when the enemy captured Jixian for the second time.

Mr. Yan talked with the reporter for an hour. He is a talkative person, speaking tirelessly. The reporter was deeply afraid of delaying his important public affairs, so he said goodbye and left. He saw the reporter to the door, and when he shook hands and said goodbye, he noticed that the reporter's clothes were thin and he had no hat, and said with concern:

"Don't you have a hat? You can't catch a cold!"

The old man's kindness moved the reporter beyond words.

### Steel Army and Iron Horses March: One of Our Modern New Army's Grand Exercises (Part 1)

— Zhang Changren

Early summer. A night of heavy rain washed the high sky of the southern country particularly blue and transparent. The morning breeze, saturated with the fragrance of the fields, flowed westward. It is not known whether it is rainwater or dew, but it still remained on the weathered mossy rocks, the green leaves of the shrubs, and the green clusters of grass, crystal clear and round, reflecting the surrounding scenery. In the east, a range of mountains, like an ancient beauty who has just finished her morning makeup, lightly and affectionately, is facing away from the morning sun, surveying the scenery outside the railing.

The vast yellow earth plain, crisscrossed for dozens of miles, after being washed by the rain, is like a vast Gobi Desert after a hurricane, undulating in waves. Here and there, half-height pine trees scattered and spread their slender shadows, swaying on the yellow earth. There are no villages, no farms, no people... If it weren't for a wisp of smoke rising from a small hilltop, serving as a sign of life, it could truly be said that this place is rarely visited by humans.

From the chaotic small mountains at the southern edge of this yellow earth plain, a red signal flare rose, like a ball of fire, streaking across the clear blue sky, and then falling to the ground with a comet-like tail of light. ——The Chinese modern new army began its unprecedented grand exercise: infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, logistics, communications, mechanized, chemical... all arms acted together.

According to the scenario, the South Army's □□ Division, with the greatest determination, launched a dawn attack on the North Army's important stronghold of □□ Town from the □□ direction. The heavy cannons representing the destructive bombardment fired from the rear of the South Army's position. Agile infantry, hidden under camouflage, revealed their reddish-purple faces. Joyfully and tensely, one by one, platoon by platoon, they ran out of the woods, dead corners, and shelters, like a tooth of a huge machine, closely linked and powerfully propelled. Under the cover of heavy artillery, they advanced northward along the entire line. Machine gunners carried more strings of firecrackers than usual. Mortar gunners carried an extra can of kerosene than usual. Snipers carried an extra wooden rifle, and rifle bullets were replaced with wooden bullet heads.

The sentries of the North Army's defensive positions were completely concealed, digging foxholes deep behind favorable terrain or objects. In a cluster of weeds or a small pine tree, there was often a round, black muzzle sticking out. They watched those "moving plants" with cold eyes, like a cat concentrating on catching a mouse, trying hard not to let the other side know their position, aiming accurately, and then "bang!" A shot rang out. The bullet casing jumped out of the chamber and was immediately put into their pocket. This has been the habit of soldiers since the second stage of the War of Resistance. They cherish a bullet casing as much as they cherish a bullet.

When the North Army's machine gunners discovered a favorable target, three or five firecrackers were set off with clear and loud sounds. At the same time, the North Army's machine guns became the target of the South Army's "kerosene cans", striking the ground with a thud.

The North Army's sentries could not withstand the pressure of the South Army's fierce firepower and began to retreat from both flanks, while still resisting step by step to impede the advance of the South Army, just like a battle for a small high ground. It must go through a considerable period of stalemate, but in the end, the flanking attack forced the defenders to retreat.

Before sunset, the South Army's mechanized cavalry—three-wheeled motorcycles—moved out from the rear of the position for reconnaissance, with the cooperation of the engineer corps, attempting to clear the North Army's forward position area and approach the North Army's main position. The drivers, like well-trained warhorses, carried light and heavy machine guns and drifted through the groves of mountains, rolling up a thick fog of dust. They attacked quickly and moved quickly. With the cooperation of the infantry, the North Army was forced to retreat entirely into the main position before dusk, using the □□□ highlands as a support point, controlling the overall situation, and deciding to defend □□□ Town with persistent defensive tactics, trapping the South Army for a long time.

In the evening, the moon rose above the mountains. The clear breeze came slowly, washing away the gunpowder smoke on the battlefield. After a day of battle, the officers and soldiers of both armies were still in high spirits. Under the moonlight, the North Army looked down on the South Army's position from the □□□ highlands, which was faintly discernible. Sparse rifle shots served as signals for mutual strict vigilance. (To be continued) A reporter in a neutral Western suit took a photo with a platoon of soldiers after the grand exercise.

### Completing Agreements in April: Franco-Turkish Agreement Finalized; Signing Ceremonies Held Separately in Capitals; Bonnet Delivers Radio Address

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 23rd] The Franco-Turkish agreement regarding (1) the cession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey, and the issuance of mutual declarations, was signed this afternoon by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and French Ambassador Machiavelli in this city.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] The Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement stipulating the cession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta (now renamed Hatay) to Turkey was signed tonight by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and Turkish Ambassador Suad Davaz at the French Foreign Ministry. According to reliable sources, the agreement also concerns the cession of Antioch to Turkey. A similar signing ceremony was also held in Ankara this afternoon.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The Franco-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement was formally signed at the French Foreign Ministry today. After the signing, French Foreign Minister Bonnet delivered a radio address, stating that the content of the agreement is completely consistent with the Anglo-Turkish declaration issued on May 12th. He also expressed that both the French and Turkish governments understand that establishing the security of the Balkan countries is essential for maintaining peace and strengthening cooperation. As for the supplementary agreement on ceding the Sanjak region to Turkey, it has also been initialed in the Turkish capital. French Foreign Minister Bonnet issued a statement saying, "France has no intention of abandoning its responsibilities in Syria and Paris." The original text of the agreement has not been published today. However, according to a Havas dispatch from the Turkish capital, the withdrawal of French troops from the Sanjak and the transfer of the territory to the Turkish authorities is expected to be completed by July 22nd.

Key Points of the Agreement Released

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The key points of the Franco-Turkish agreement, signed this afternoon at 6:30 PM by the French Foreign Minister and the Turkish Ambassador at the French Foreign Ministry, are as follows: (1) The French and Turkish governments have held lengthy discussions and are conducting ongoing negotiations, indicating complete agreement on both sides. (2) France and Turkey have decided to conclude a long-term agreement regarding mutual obligations for the security of both countries. (3) In order to reach a final agreement, France and Turkey officially declare that they are willing to cooperate and provide mutual assistance and support should any act of aggression occur that could lead to war in the Mediterranean. (4) This declaration and the proposed agreement are not aimed at any country, but are solely for the security of both nations. (5) If the above assistance is indeed necessary, France and Turkey acknowledge that before the final agreement is concluded, a more comprehensive study must be conducted on certain issues, including more specific regulations regarding the conditions required to fulfill mutual obligations. This study is already underway. (6) France and Turkey recognize the need to guarantee the security of the Balkan countries and are conducting negotiations to achieve this goal. (7) Both countries agree that the provisions listed in this agreement cannot prohibit either country from concluding agreements with other countries that are beneficial to consolidating peace. Signed in Paris on June 23, 1939.

[Reuters, Ankara, 24th] After France agreed to return the Alexandretta region to Turkey, Turkey plans to build a highly valuable military base there. In view of the new responsibilities of Britain and France in the Mediterranean, Turkey plans to expand the port of Alexandretta and rebuild the forts, making it a military stronghold.

Anglo-Soviet Negotiations to Resume Soon

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British government today sent new instructions to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union. It is generally hoped that the British and French ambassadors and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will be able to resume negotiations quickly. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky today to explain Britain's position.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 20th] According to sources in Berlin, German industrialists will soon send a delegation to the Soviet Union to seek to improve bilateral economic relations, and it is said that Germany may provide the Soviet Union with a credit line of 750 million marks. Sources in this area say they know nothing about this. German sources have also denied this. Some sources say that while Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are continuing negotiations, it is not very appropriate for the Soviet Union to conduct commercial negotiations with Germany. However, after the Soviet Union signs an agreement with Britain and France, it may be possible to sign an economic agreement with France.

Soviet Union Orders Arms from Czechoslovakia

[Central News Agency, Prague, 23rd] Several Soviet technicians arrived in Pilsen on the 23rd to order a number of weapons from the Škoda factory. At the same time, several representatives from the factory have also gone to Moscow for discussions. According to reports, the Škoda factory had stopped working for the Soviet Union since the Munich Agreement last year, and now it is resuming trade.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 24th] Economic and political figures here are extremely concerned about news in the foreign press that a seven-member German economic delegation will soon travel to Moscow to discuss German loans to the Soviet government. Although commercial relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have never been interrupted, and sometimes trade figures are very large, authoritative circles here did not deny or confirm the news of the German delegation's visit to Moscow on Friday evening.

### Singapore Conference: Britain and France Discuss Defending Hong Kong Against Japanese Invasion

[Reuters, Singapore, 23rd] It is widely believed that the ongoing British-French joint defense conference here is focusing on protecting Hong Kong as an important issue. Defense experts believe that after recent active expansion and modernization of Hong Kong's defenses, Hong Kong is sufficient to withstand a long-term siege.

[Reuters, Singapore, 24th] It is reported that the most important resolution of the "International Joint Defense Conference" held in Singapore is that when war breaks out in the Far East, the commander of the British Far East Fleet will be the supreme commander of the British and French allied forces. At the same time, Singapore will be the base for joint operations. The strategic importance of Siam (Thailand) was discussed in detail at the conference. Japan has recently been carrying out various activities in Siam in the hope of winning over the Siamese people. The conference is currently maintaining close contact with the United States. It is reported that issues such as Japan's southward advance, occupation of Hainan Island, and the Spratly Islands have all been discussed, and representatives have also discussed how to urgently protect the Borneo oil fields in wartime.

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] According to various newspapers, today is the second day of the Singapore British-French military conference, and a military resolution has been passed regarding the task of maritime patrols in the East in the future. The two sides agreed that British and French cruisers stationed in the East Indies and China would jointly undertake the task. In addition, representatives of the air forces of the two countries are currently discussing the use of Indian aircraft to strengthen Singapore's air defense. Representatives of the two armies are considering storing grain for use in the event of war.

### Albanian Royal Couple Plans to Visit the United States

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] According to Baroness Tantra Salza, a Hungarian friend of the Albanian King and Queen, the Albanian royal couple plans to visit the United States in April.

### Anglo-Japanese Talks: No Results; Prime Minister Chamberlain Delivers Speech; Still Does Not Believe Japan Is Arrogant

[Reuters, London, 24th] This Friday afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Halifax received Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi, after first meeting with French Ambassador Corbin.

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Halifax met with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi for 20 minutes this afternoon. He immediately protested again about the abuse suffered by British nationals in Tianjin and asked what Japan's intentions were regarding the Tianjin issue. However, Shigemitsu Aoi was unable to provide any clear explanation on this point, and there was no credible information from Tokyo. Therefore, it is still impossible for diplomatic circles here to understand whether the Japanese government supports the military's demands to generalize the Tianjin incident, or whether it is willing to treat it as a local incident and find a solution. Generally speaking, the British government intends to wait a few more days before deciding on retaliatory measures against Japan. However, according to sources in Congress, the government will wait at most a few days. If Japan is still unwilling to resolve the Tianjin case through diplomatic channels, the government will be forced by public opinion to make necessary decisions, starting with the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911, and then further restricting the amount of Japanese imports and levying special taxes on Japanese goods.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, speaking to demonstrators in Cardiff today, mentioned the situation in the Far East, saying, "Local authorities in Tianjin have started a local incident with the Japanese regarding the handover of Chinese suspects. The Japanese then began to blockade the British and French concessions and applied intolerable insults to search British residents. This matter has been officially magnified by Japanese officials in Tianjin. The Japanese authorities are taking this opportunity to demand changes to the policies implemented by the British and other governments in the region. However, to date, the Japanese government has not formally made such demands. If the Tianjin incident remains limited to the original dispute, it is possible to reach a resolution through negotiation. However, I would like to add that Britain's foreign policy will not be dictated by another country, and I believe the Japanese government has no intention of doing so either."

### US Attitude Gradually Hardens: Determined to Protect Far East Interests

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] The United States' attitude towards Japan has gradually hardened in recent days. According to diplomatic sources, the government has notified the Japanese government that it has ordered Rear Admiral Andrews, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, to declare to Japanese naval and military authorities in China that if American interests are infringed upon, even if the current tense situation is further aggravated by this American attitude, it will not be deterred. In addition, American consuls in China have submitted reports on the treatment of American residents by Japanese authorities in various places. The State Department is now preparing to publish them. The State Department has always tried to downplay these reports, hoping that public opinion would believe that the current situation in the Far East is no different from the past. However, if the reports of the consuls in China are made public at this time, public opinion will definitely be greatly stimulated. It can be said that the arguments in recent newspapers are very different from the official opinions expressed by the State Department, which is noteworthy. According to information received here, the Kwantung Army authorities in Japan are bellicose, while naval and diplomatic authorities do not want to offend American public opinion, lest the American navy take action in the Far East. Therefore, American diplomats are taking a quiet attitude, not wanting to provoke the Japanese government, in the hope that moderate views will prevail. In short, what the US government values most is its interests in China. If these interests are infringed upon, it will inevitably protect them with all its strength.

### British Press Commentary

[Reuters, London, 24th] The "News Chronicle" commented today on recent British merchants' purchase of large quantities of canned salmon from Japan, saying, "Now is not the time to help Japan earn foreign exchange. British merchants trading with Japan beyond the necessary amount is tantamount to helping Japan and being disloyal to their own country. At a time when we are hoping that other powers will take practical action with our country in the Far East, this behavior will suddenly cause suspicion in the United States. In 1937, 37% of the American people supported boycotting Japanese goods, which has now increased to 66%. We must not take any action that chills this view of the American people." The "Daily Mail" said, "If the Tianjin incident continues to exist and cannot be resolved satisfactorily, then Britain should take decisive action and impose a commercial boycott on Japan, which is an effective reprisal."

[Reuters, London, 24th] British newspapers today published the news that Japanese sentries in Tianjin had insulted British nationals in a prominent position. Some British newspapers even used large headlines. Yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the Tianjin incident as an "intolerable insult," and the newspapers attached great importance to this statement. However, Chamberlain later softened the statement, saying, "There is currently no talk of taking retaliatory action." Diplomatic correspondents from various newspapers acknowledged that Foreign Secretary Halifax had conveyed Britain's displeasure to the Japanese ambassador in the clearest terms. The "Daily Express" estimates that there are 15,000 British people living in Japan, who may be insulted, and 50,000 Japanese people living in the British Empire, who are protected by Britain. A Washington correspondent for the "Times" said, "The number of insolent and violent acts by Japan is countless. The patience of the US government is obvious, but there are signs that the US government cannot tolerate it any longer."

### Earthquake in West Africa: Sixty Dead

[Reuters, Accra, British West Africa, 24th] A violent earthquake occurred here yesterday. Sixty Africans and Syrians were killed, and many were injured. Property damage was extensive, but no Europeans were killed or injured.

### Not Worth a Laugh

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] News from Japan claims that Japanese and Soviet aircraft engaged in fierce fighting over "Manchukuo" on the 22nd. Responsible officials here said they knew nothing about it, and that the Japanese claim of shooting down 49 Soviet aircraft was not worth a laugh.

### Bravo, Gafencu! Firmly Rejects Italian Warning: Expands Balkan Entente Obligations to Counter Axis Aggression

[Reuters, Bucharest, 23rd] According to absolutely reliable sources, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, in his capacity as Chairman of the Balkan Entente, is drafting a new Balkan joint defense pact after recently visiting Ankara and Athens. The purpose of the new pact is to expand the obligations of the Entente countries (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece), and to mutually guarantee that if any of them are attacked, they will provide mutual assistance. According to the meaning of the pact, if Yugoslavia is attacked by its "Axis" neighbors, Turkey and Greece will assist Yugoslavia in resisting. Yugoslavia has already stated that it will disregard the warnings of the "Axis Powers" and is currently standing in the ranks of the Balkan Entente. From this point of view, Yugoslavia's accession to the new pact is a rational matter. When Gafencu returned home, he met with King Carol of Romania, who warmly welcomed Gafencu. The Italian envoy visited Gafencu today for a long discussion. It is reported that the Italian envoy warned Gafencu not to adopt a policy close to the "encirclement policy," but Gafencu's response was extremely strong, stating that Romania must decide what is most beneficial to its own interests and world peace.

Brief Commentary

### New Sino-Soviet and Sino-French Agreements

Today, newspapers published two pieces of heartening and exciting news. One is the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty, which was signed in Moscow on the 16th of this month, and the other is the Sino-French Credit Loan Agreement, which is also reported to have been concluded on the 22nd of this month.

Here, we must first recognize that China's persistence in the War of Resistance is for the independence and freedom of our country, and also for the defense of world democracy and peace. Therefore, all those who love justice, freedom, and the international order of peace have the obligation to assist China and contain Japan. The recent UN resolutions on assisting China, as well as the establishment of the new Sino-Soviet and Sino-French agreements today, are all based on this. Any slander that China is being influenced by this or that is shameless and unfounded.

Secondly, we must know that since its founding, the Soviet Union has treated China as an equal, automatically abandoned all privileges and special systems of the Tsarist era in China, and has repeatedly assisted China's national liberation cause. It has been even more enthusiastic since the War of Resistance, and has no other selfish demands. As for France, the pro-China movement has also been very enthusiastic recently. In the future, China, the Soviet Union, and France will fight for the cause of world democracy and peace, and mutual trust will be even more urgent. We must strive to increase the friendly relations between the three countries day by day, and hope that other countries that love democracy and peace, such as Britain and the United States, will cooperate together.

Finally, we must recognize that the increase in international support is entirely the result of our internal unity and insistence on the War of Resistance over the past two years. In particular, the severe punishment of ×××× Wang Jingwei recently has further increased the international prestige of our government and people. We must cherish this glory in order to further enhance our international status and bring about an early victory!

### Do Not Disappoint the Youth

The Alumni Association of the Hong Kong Chinese Amateur School recently sent an open letter to their principal, which roughly said: Zhang is a sincere and frank young man. His concern for the motherland is extremely enthusiastic. He is always willing to do any work that is [censored]. When he left Hong Kong to [censored], he said: "People all have families. If everyone is unwilling to leave because of family problems, then where will anyone be willing to [censored] to sacrifice for the country? After I leave, serious problems will arise in my family life. My elderly parents will suffer from hunger. Perhaps when I enter the military academy, it will be the time of their death. I cannot look back! I will [censored] to the battlefield!" He has left, but now his parents are grieving for their son's departure without saying goodbye, and they are worried about being helpless in their old age. We have such a young man who forgets his family for the sake of the country, which is the glory of the nation and the glory of the youth in Hong Kong. Can we remain indifferent to the appeals of these young people? Moreover, in order to save the country, in order to defend justice and peace, we must mobilize thousands and thousands of young people to return to the country to serve!

### Behind the Scenes of Downing Street: A Sideways Look at British Policy (Part 1)

— Dong Ping

One

We readily admit that on the world's political stage, the British Empire is an elder brother, a leader. It has been so for centuries, and it remains so in recent decades.

However, we cannot deny that in recent years, the facts have shown that Britain seems to be automatically abandoning its leadership. Take Mr. Chamberlain's ascent to power, for example. For two years, all of Britain's actions seem to have been passive responses, rather than active construction. Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War; recognition of the Franco government; signing the Munich Agreement; withdrawing ambassadors stationed in Austria and Czechoslovakia... all these are actions forced upon them.

And in the Sino-Japanese War, we see even less proactive measures. The British ambassador was attacked, and the damage to British lives and property was not resolved. The recent Tianjin incident has seen Britain's passive policy reach its peak.

The only thing that can be considered relatively positive is the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. This negotiation was originally forced by the muzzle of Hitler's guns; however, if this negotiation can truly succeed, it would be a positive and active step in stabilizing the world situation. But, time flies, three months have passed, and the views of the two sides have still not been consistent.

The opinions of both Britain and the Soviet Union have not been fully and clearly expressed; however, we have already seen from general information that the Soviet Union's主張 is active, decisive, and proactive. Due to geographical environment and military technology—please refer to the special article in this edition for the past three days—the Soviet Union's 主張 is reasonable. But why can't Britain accommodate them? This is what Churchill called the "half-hearted policy."

Why is Mr. Chamberlain always thinking about the "half-hearted policy"? Here is part of the answer.

Two

Before studying the source of the "half-hearted policy," we should understand the three factors that influence Chamberlain's policy: traditional British policy, today's British public opinion, and the movements of the people surrounding Chamberlain.

The simplest and clearest traditional British policy is based on three points: First, to safeguard the vested interests of the British Empire. Second, to maintain the balance of power and the status quo in the world. Third, to dislike the Soviet Union. This British policy, based on extreme capitalism, is often adhered to by every British cabinet and every prime minister; Chamberlain is no exception. The key point is to be conservative; not to advance, not to retreat, not to go left, not to go right.

Today's British public opinion is clearly different from [Censored]'s traditional policy. The most obvious, of course, is the third point: the British people feel the threat of fascism, deeply realize that disliking the Soviet Union is futile, and unanimously demand that the government join hands with the Soviet Union. The power of this public opinion is indeed quite large, and therefore forced Chamberlain to "feign cooperation" with the Soviet Union—we are very pained to use these four words to describe the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, but that is indeed the fact. Chamberlain's deliberate negotiations with the Soviet Union, [Censored]; at best, it is just a diplomatic strategy to bargain with Hitler. Although Britain and public opinion are pushing forward, pulling to the left, Chamberlain still does not want to move.

Generally speaking, Britain is a country ruled by law. The government is a party system; but in fact, this is not entirely the case. The manifestos of the various parties in Britain are very vague, so there are many who betray their parties, and speculators emerge endlessly. And the real political line, under the traditional norms and the supervision of public opinion, is still largely manipulated in the hands of people. It was so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future.

Therefore, to understand Chamberlain's policy, one should look at the people who lead the way for him.

On the surface, there are two factions that influence Chamberlain's policy: the progressive former Foreign Secretary Eden, former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper, and Churchill; and the standard hard-liners, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. The former pushes forward, while the latter pulls back. After Eden and Cooper resigned, Halifax, who replaced them, is a centrist—recently he has gradually agreed with Eden's 主張—Simon's stubborn 主張s are very popular, and even during the recent cabinet discussion of the conscription bill, he still opposed it, using his resignation as a threat. And in the Far East, he is even more of an accomplice, creating many troubles.

However, these big figures, although they all hold theories, do not occupy a very important position for Chamberlain. What really influences Chamberlain's policy is that group of people who surround Chamberlain, but do not show their faces—the so-called Chamberlain's "brain trust."

Three

Chamberlain's "brain trust" is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, too numerous to count. But they do not often show their faces outside, and even many do not often go to Downing Street. However, it is indeed the case that Chamberlain's policy is sliding around in their hands.

The most important and most famous in the "brain trust" group are two: the current Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal, the Marquess of Londonderry, and Chamberlain's sister-in-law, Mrs. Austen Chamberlain.

Austen Chamberlain was one of the three outstanding members of the Chamberlain family and had served as British Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was a financial expert and only died last year. But his widow is a diplomatic expert.

Mrs. Chamberlain can be regarded as an "Italian expert." This seems to be the same as many "Japanese experts" in China. Once you are "expert," you will have the suspicion of being "close."

### Anglo-American Sign Agreement for Exchange of Goods Supplying Approximately Six Million Pounds Annually; Hull States Prices Will Not Be Affected

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday during a meeting with newspaper reporters that the Anglo-American exchange of goods will be implemented meticulously, so as not to affect prices.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Anglo-American exchange of goods agreement was signed today. It stipulates that the American side will supply Britain with 600,000 bales of cotton, valued at approximately six million pounds, based on the average price since January 1st. The British side will supply the United States with approximately 800 tons of rubber of equivalent value. Reuters has learned that the authorities have not yet consulted with the International Rubber Committee regarding the supply of this rubber. However, individuals close to the committee believe there will be no material difficulties in fulfilling the agreement promptly, as the authorities will specifically designate a period solely for ordering goods for the agreement. The agreement was co-signed by American Ambassador Kennedy and British Trade Minister Stanley. It is reported that the purpose of this move by the British and American governments is to seek mutual cooperation in supplying the two major commodities mentioned above, in preparation for wartime emergencies. These goods are not to be used for commercial purposes. The agreement states that if war does not occur, the goods must be stored for at least seven years. After the goods are paid for, both governments are responsible for consulting with each other and making every effort to avoid market disturbances.

[Reuters, London, 24th] The "Economic Times" praised the Anglo-American exchange of goods agreement as an "unexpectedly palatable" document. The newspaper also stated that the Rubber Restriction Committee seems to have no reason to attack the plan, adding, "The amount of rubber required in the agreement is approximately equivalent to six months' production within 10% of the quotas. Inevitably, the government will require the committee to prioritize the needs of the agreement over ordinary commercial needs. This plan should be seen as a good strategy to stimulate market activity and make a significant contribution to Britain's defense preparations and the solution to America's cotton surplus."

Current Events

### Weather Forecast

The Tianjin blockade has entered its eleventh day. Chamberlain Yuan-sheng has repeatedly stated that until the final moment, he will wait patiently for the Japanese side to show remorse so that the situation can be resolved locally. An answer has arrived: the puppet "Provisional Government" has presented four major demands to the British Consul in Tianjin. Is this to be seen as the prelude to a local resolution?

The day before yesterday, June 22nd, was the forty-fifth birthday of former British King Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor. No trace of celebration was seen anywhere in the world. In 1936, during his one year on the throne, there was also a frenzied celebration of the "King's Birthday." Remembering this now, it is interesting to compare it with the cheers of Londoners welcoming the current King George VI. It truly gives one the feeling that with each new emperor comes a new set of ministers!

The Overseas Department of the Central Executive Committee has issued a notice unifying overseas fundraising. This is excellent news worth highlighting. This should at least reduce the number of "patriots who profit from national crises" and those self-proclaimed "representatives," "committee members," and "presidents" should also tone it down somewhat. Furthermore, we hope that the central government can also standardize the methods of donation. "Selling kisses," "selling oneself," "dancing"... although perhaps these come from a heart for national salvation, under the banner of spiritual mobilization, it seems they should still be "eliminated."

Yesterday morning, four robbers used guns to rob a fishing boat at sea. The female boat owner, Li Qingmei, fought back bravely, throwing three robbers into the sea, while the remaining one fled in a panic. How brave, female hero! We hereby offer our highest respect. If only every Hong Konger had this ability to automatically defend against thieves, how good that would be!

### World of Cheating

Where Can You Find An Honest Man In The World?

I found a position as a salesman at a company that sold cash registers and accounting books. On my first day, the sales director told me that many salesmen had become rich just by being eloquent and boasting a bit.

However, I didn't think this was very reliable. Selling these kinds of things based solely on a silver tongue and boasting to high heaven probably wouldn't be effective.

For example, if you grabbed a boss and told him how amazing the cash register was or how wonderful the accounting books were, it would be like Wang Xiaoer selling melons; who wouldn't boast about their own goods? No one would believe it. So, you

had to try a different approach: saying, "Your current cash register isn't very good! Maybe people are cheating! Stealing his money would cause so much heartache that he would start to care." However, talking without proof is still not enough. If you want to close the deal, you have to present evidence of cheating first. This is where my talent for amateur detective work developed.

I set out and found the owner of a bar. I started by boasting for a while. Good, wonderful, skillful... but no, he shook his head. So, I moved on to the second step.

"Joe is a diligent and thrifty cashier! How much salary do you give him?"

"Joe? Fifty dollars a week."

That's it. I immediately went to investigate Joe's lifestyle. He had a nice car, rented a house, and the furniture was quite elaborate. Quite a large expense! I estimated that Joe was spending at least two dollars a day.

Of course, when I told the owner that I had such suspicions, he was very unhappy. He believed that Joe was honest and said that he would tell Joe what I said and accuse me of slander.

"Let's make a deal, okay?" I went straight to the point. "If I can't prove that Joe is cheating, then I'll give you a cash register for free. If I prove that he is indeed cheating, then you buy one. Fair deal!"

He agreed. I immediately ran into the bar, ordered a cold drink, and secretly watched Joe. After an hour, I figured out what he was up to.

Joe's boss came as promised. I asked him to call Joe to the back room. When Joe came in, he was still chewing on a matchstick. When I asked him how many broken matchsticks he had in his pocket, he blushed, but he had to take them out.

There were twelve in total. Joe stammered that chewing matchsticks had become a habit. However, I told the boss that he had stolen $1.20 today. Joe glared at me and denied it. I said, "Check it and see, the money in the cash register must be $1.20 more than what's recorded outside." He didn't say anything. As a result, it was true. Joe had to admit that he had been cheating like this for six months.

Joe was fired, and I sold a cash register. This one was much smarter than the previous one. It will be much harder for anyone to rip off this boss in the future.

Gradually, my detective skills seemed to become famous. A friend of mine was the director of the women's underwear department at a department store. He suspected that a few of his female clerks were cheating. Although the daily accounts were correct, there were always some discrepancies between the weekly inventory and the income.

He invited me, and I stayed there for two days. I learned that they all had a uniform and soft-soled shoes. Every day after work, they would go to the cloakroom to change their clothes and then go home. On the third night, after the company was already closed, I ran into the women's cloakroom and inspected all their clothes and shoes in detail. Okay, I found a clue.

On the fourth day, I was ready to solve the case. First, I asked a few people to go to the women's underwear department to buy some small items, paying with silver coins that had been marked!

In the afternoon, I pretended to be a salesman from a shoe company and went to tell them that the shoe company was doing advertising and would give each of them a pair of shoes for free. Who wouldn't be greedy for a cheap deal! All five of them eagerly tried on the new shoes, putting the old soft-soled shoes aside. I poured out a lot of silver coins from the soles of those soft shoes, many of which were marked.

Do you find it strange? Not at all. That night, when I inspected their clothes, I saw a lot of imprints of coins on the soles of the shoes!

Waitresses in restaurants are also master cheaters. Just watch her spinning around in front of the cash register, or drawing circles on the counter, that's to calculate: how much has the cash register "extra" today.

My sales director divides people in the world into three categories: a quarter would rather starve to death than be a thief; a quarter are expert thieves, stealing everything from a matchstick to the Normandy ocean liner; and half are ordinary people, whose principle is to adapt to circumstances.

Finally, I must state: I am an American, and I am talking about America. Whether it is the same in China, I do not know.

### Rare News

After the recent horrific bombing of Chongqing, Chairman Chiang ordered the requisition of all public and private vehicles to transport refugees. Chairman Lin ordered all vehicles belonging to the Chairman and various ministries to be dispatched. When Chairman Chiang's blue sedan arrived to transport people, a group of commoners didn't dare get in. The driver told them that it was okay and that the Chairman's vehicle had been specially dispatched for everyone to ride in. So, they respectfully bowed three times to the vehicle before getting in. When they arrived in the countryside and got out, they all bowed three times again.

The Netherlands is located to the west of Germany. A while ago, there were rumors that Hitler intended to invade the Netherlands. However, the Dutch didn't care at all. They said:

"Did you know? Modern warfare doesn't rely on guns and cannons anymore, it relies on poison gas and chemical warfare. For poison gas and chemicals, you must look at the wind direction. You know, we in the Netherlands have a west wind blowing all year round. An east wind is extremely rare. When the Germans release poison gas, it will all blow back on them."

He was the most picturesque figure on the streets of Edinburgh. One day, Professor Huxley was strolling along the road as usual, when a shoe-shine boy stopped him.

"Sir, shine your shoes? Three pence."

Professor Huxley looked at him. The boy's face was covered in mud and was terribly dirty.

"No need to shine my shoes. If you can go wash your face, I'll give you six pence."

"Okay!" the boy replied and ran to a nearby pond. He washed himself clean and ran back.

"Very good, child, these six pence are yours." Professor Huxley said with a smile, as he scooped out six pence.

"I don't want them," the boy suddenly refused sternly. "I think you should keep them for yourself and get a haircut!"

### Sea Storm

— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi

The previous excerpt described how, in the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Calongbiki" was carrying six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator for the Cuxhaven Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took the ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship ran wildly without a destination. Soon, the radio transmitted news that there was an iceberg nearby. Fortunately, the iceberg soon slid past, but the passengers were shocked and lost their composure, causing a scene. Before long, another British warship came to intercept them…

Jack hurried back to the radio room. He saw Beauvoir's eyes wide open, looking scared.

"Another cruiser is coming from the other direction!" he shouted. "I just heard her talking to the 'Bovick'!"

"Not bad," Jack said. At this moment, Cernano and Lumongaro came over.

"Hey, Bill," he continued, "Now you have a chance to be on the front line."

"What are you talking about?" Bill asked.

"Is the captain really going to stop the ship?" the French aviator asked.

"Stop what?" Jack said, "He's just determined to drag his ship back, he doesn't care about any danger."

"I think she's running faster," Bill said, "Is she prepared to sneak past?"

"That's the plan," Jack said. The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders and said.

"These Germans, they don't understand things."

"More news is coming," Hayes raised his hand, telling them to be quiet.

They all looked down from his shoulders as he quickly wrote:

Final warning, if you do not stop the ship, we will take action.

The signature below was still the "Bovick" that issued the order earlier.

"Friends, the captain had better pay attention to this warning," Garro said, "The British are not used to playing 'intimidation' games."

However, Jack delivered the message and returned, saying that the captain was still as stubborn as ever. His only creed was to tell the ship to go even faster.

"I guess he thinks we can definitely get away and show the sole of our shoe to the British warship"

The cruiser was heading towards them at an angle. On her stern was a British naval flag. They watched carefully for a while, and Jack shouted:

"This is the 'Joeffer'! I believe if we're lucky, we can escape her. The 'Calongbiki' is one of the fastest ships on this route. As long as his furnace doesn't explode, we might be able to avoid this warship."

"I hope we can," Bill said quickly, "I'm not really a coward, but I always feel that now that we've become someone else's target, it's probably very rare to have a chance to slip past!"

"If I can join the war soon, I'd be happy to be baptized by gunpowder." The Frenchman said, "I think I'll be assigned to the air force. I hear Germany has some very good planes and artillery."

"Look," Bill suddenly shouted, "Here it comes——"

A white puff of smoke emerged from the front of the warship's gun emplacement, followed by a piercing sound that flew overhead, followed by a deafening echo.

### Today's Baseball Game: The First Meeting Between China and "Friends Beer"; The Outcome Greatly Affects the Championship; China Must Win to Have Hope; The Second Game is Between South China and Mindinao

(Special Report from this Newspaper) Starting at 10:00 AM today, public baseball will be held at Jia Shan's rehearsal field, with both games featuring Chinese teams competing against foreign teams. The first game is between China and "Friends Beer", and the second game is between South China and Mindinao.

The outcome of the China vs. Friends Beer game could unlock the championship puzzle, so it is of great importance. However, China has previously lost once to the Mindinao team, while Friends Beer has maintained an undefeated record. Therefore, Friends Beer's future prospects are relatively more optimistic.

According to general critiques, China's talent and strength are seemingly not very different from Friends Beer. Moreover, the two teams have not faced off before, so the difference between the levels of skill, whether different or similar, can only be determined after today's game.

From my perspective, China's players are experienced and good at finding opportunities. Their close defensive coordination is unmatched by any other team.

Pitcher Huang Rongjun is very good at using his mind. He throws the ball with both soft and hard pitches and has the stamina to observe the batting style of the opposing batters and use his control skills accordingly. Therefore, although Friends Beer's players are good hitters and extremely aggressive, Rongjun's skills are extraordinary, and he will definitely come up with unique ways to deal with skilled hitters and have good methods to stop them.

Catcher Lin Ye has always been stable at catching the ball, with very few errors. He is also quick and opportunistic at throwing out base runners. Therefore, I dare to predict that in today's game, Friends Beer's base runners will find it difficult to steal bases and will likely not dare to try lightly.

Secret code coordination is a characteristic of the Chinese team. This is due to their rich experience. When facing a strong Friends Beer team, it is expected that they will use even more secret codes, also relying on experience to achieve victory.

However, since Friends Beer's players are good at hitting, China must maintain a tight defense on the bases and try to avoid making mistakes to prevent giving the opponent opportunities. But China's players are skilled and practiced, so there will naturally be extremely coordinated performances, without worrying about negligence, and their path to victory may lie in this.

Some people say that China's players are mostly not good at hitting, good at defending but not attacking, and their weakness lies in this. Regarding this point, I also believe that it is a shortcoming of China. However, the Chinese players' batting methods are different, either bunting or hitting, acting according to the situation, and always able to proceed calmly. Moreover, Friends Beer's pitcher Xia Gaoli relies only on hard-hitting skills. Although his pitches have power, he lacks stamina and is not very alert. Therefore, it is expected that when he encounters China's hitters with various tricks, it will not be easy for him to maintain control.

In short, China is good at defending, and Friends Beer is good at attacking. Each has its own strengths, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. However, the attacking side is always relatively more advantageous. It depends on how well China defends to determine the overall situation. If their defense is tight and prevents the opponent from succeeding, then victory can be assured.

However, the key to the outcome of this game is expected to be determined after the fifth inning. If China can hold firm before the fifth inning without losing, and then use their rich experience to seize the final victory, then the chance for a turnaround will come from the fifth inning.

In any case, China must win this game. If they fail, then the great championship will slip away from China and will fall into the arms of Friends Beer in the future. I hope the Chinese players will strive and strive. The starting players for both sides are as follows:

Position China Team Friends Team

Pitcher Huang Rongjun Xia Gaoli

Catcher Lin Ye Wu Yiwen

First Base Hu Guodong T. Lee Anner

Second Base Chen Lunying Sousa

Third Base Hu Zhiqu Ao Xia Gaohui

Position South China Club Mindinao

Pitcher Zheng Kangyong Lu Ailu

Catcher He Xiancheng Tan Mashi

First Base Chen Yutian Dejilishi

Second Base Tang Rongguang Zhasi

### Reading "Collection of Destroyed Hits"

— Chen Youqin

Because I wanted to study the life of Tang Shunzhi, a Ming Dynasty scholar who drove out the bandits, I specifically went to read Tang Jingchuan's Collection. Mr. Jingchuan highly praised Mr. Shao Kangjie's "Collection of Hits in Yichuan," which aroused my interest in reading "Collection of Destroyed Hits."

The Hanfenlou Secret Collection edition of "Collection of Hits in Yichuan" consists of four volumes and is printed very carefully. The paper is especially white and pleasing. In schools, this type of book is probably only borrowed and occasionally read by unworldly people like myself, besides being eaten by bookworms.

To be honest, Mr. Shao Kangjie's poems have too much of a Daoist air and mostly discuss principles. Some places are no different from straightforward Buddhist verses and dogmas. Although there is a poetic flavor, it is not as strong as the philosophical meaning. It can be said to be a completely philosophical poetry collection.

Speaking of philosophy, let Mr. Ma Yifu talk about it at the Fuxing Academy. I can only extract a few words from the "Collection of Hits" to talk about as personal admonishments.

Ornamented Recitation

Ornamenting the edge is called a good hand, acting as if it were a true home.

Beware of cold-eyed observers, for the puppets have no curtain to hide behind.

Clay and Wooden Figures

Seven wood figures, be careful not to laugh!

When the heavy rain comes, you can only console each other.

There are too many puppets without curtains to hide behind right now. "Called a good hand" "like a true home," but are they really "good hands" or "true homes"? They are just said to be "like" and similar in form (acting as if they are very important).

As for the clay and wooden figures, they seem to be laughing triumphantly for a moment, but when the heavy rain comes, they can only "console each other."

There is a Large Fish in the East Sea

There is a large fish in the East Sea, and the nets cannot approach it. But if it loses its water, even ants can trap it.

What does this big fish refer to? I think anyone with discerning eyes will know at a glance. Right now, it seems that no nets can approach it, but when its power is exhausted, it will immediately turn into "a sore on the back," and its death is near.

Also, Mr. Kangjie said in his "Extravagance Recitation": "Extravagance cannot be extreme, luxury cannot be endless; extreme leads to disaster, endless leads to misfortune." It seems that the Chinese people of today, who are still unable to avoid extravagant habits, should take this as a warning.

He was extremely opposed to bookworms, which shows that he did not advocate reading books to death. There is a poem about drying books as proof.

Bookworms harm books little, but human worms harm books more. Bookworms can be removed by drying the books, but what about human worms?

His proposition for poetry is as follows:

Why is it called poetry? Poetry expresses one's aspirations. Once words are formed into chapters, they convey the matters in one's heart. It is not only about refining the words, but also about refining the meaning. Refining the words yields wonderful sentences, and refining the meaning yields lingering flavors. — On Poetry Recitation

The "Collection of Hits" has four volumes and twenty chapters, and there is too much to talk about. What I have quoted is only a few dozen words above. It is truly the so-called "Let the weak water be three thousand, I only take a ladle to drink."

### Presenting a Flag

— Sheng Dan

—War Zone Journal—

Returning from Macheng to Songbu, it was pouring rain. A open-top truck used for transportation was speeding through the muddy, splashing black night, swaying like a drunkard. We didn't bring rain gear, so we had to huddle together, covering ourselves with dirty tarpaulins. But the rain kept getting heavier, as if a waterfall was pouring down and the rivers were flowing backward, drenching us like drowned chickens. But thinking of the brave soldiers in the trenches, even when it rained and the water was over their knees, they still maintained their original posture with high spirits; therefore, we were not only calm in the face of the storm, but also grateful for the kindness of the heavens for washing away the dust of our journey.

The truck drove into the heavily wooded Military Supervision Department. Councilor Chen had already prepared dinner; after dinner, I started talking about the village visit and told him about it. Director Zheng of the Military Supervision Department had also been in charge of military transportation during the Northern Expedition. According to him, the best political work was done by the Eighth Route Army, followed by Guangxi. With such achievements in Macheng, we can of course be satisfied. "In a mobile war, you can't win without the cooperation of the common people!" he said firmly.

Councilor Chen was very talkative, speaking in the Chongming dialect, which was similar to Cao Juren's Pujiang dialect in "different tunes played in the same way"; to be able to share a bed with him in the wind and rain amidst the raging flames of war was truly unexpected.

"There's no problem with Tianjia Town, Wuhan will not be shaken."

"Even if there is a problem, we will never give up Wuhan."

This is how the conversation ended that night. Therefore, it is said that the withdrawal of troops from Wuhan was related to Guangzhou, otherwise, the three towns would not have fallen so quickly. The next morning, we prepared to depart for Huangchuan; at this time, the battle in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway had begun extremely fiercely. There were even rumors that Xinyang was about to be abandoned. "If they really step into the Dabie Mountains, it will be like sinking into a quagmire, and they can only become ghosts in a foreign land, and never hope to return alive," Director Zheng said, a satisfied smile flashing across his round face. But just as we were about to say goodbye to Songbu, the Military Supervision Department received a telegram from Huangchuan, informing us that General Li Zongren would be coming to Hubei in a few days, and the news that the cultural circles of Wuhan would be coming to comfort the troops was also confirmed. This was truly unexpected good news. Except for me and Lao Yao; the other seven were all representatives of the people of Anhui Province, and their task was to present a flag to pay their respects. After the ceremony, they still had to return to Anhui, so we traveled together along the way.

Only two hours later, General Li had returned from the front, looking heroic and radiant, without any sign of fatigue. After resting for a while, he met with the flag-presenting representatives, and his demeanor was so graceful and cordial that people couldn't help but look up to him with reverence.

"Ah! You've worked too hard!" General Li said first, with a kind smile.

"We should have respectfully gone to the front to offer our condolences, please forgive us, Commander!"

Miss Wu expressed her apologies on behalf of everyone, and in a solemn and respectful ceremony, she presented the red silk flag. Then, she stated the feelings of support from the people of Anhui Province in simple and clear language, and then they took their leave. "A great leader of national resistance!" Miss Wu read with sincere admiration.

### An Translator's Opinion

— Bai Ying

Casually flipping through the catalogs of recently published books, I can't help but notice a noteworthy phenomenon in the publishing industry: translated works have a tendency to surpass general original works. In terms of quantity, original writing is undoubtedly still the majority, but in terms of quality and the ability to appeal to readers, translated works occupy an overwhelming advantage in proportion.

Taking Shanghai as an example, one of the greatest achievements in publishing in recent times has been the publication of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun." But at the same time, translations such as the "Complete Works of Lenin" and the complete translation of "Das Kapital" have also appeared. However, in terms of new creations, we have not yet seen any very powerful works (regardless of their nature). But in terms of translated works, there have been quite a few things that are enough to appeal to a large number of readers. In addition to the aforementioned "Complete Works of Lenin" and "Das Kapital," the more famous translations published in the past year include "Red Star Over China," "More Adventures in China," "Japan Challenges the World," "Japan's Gamble in China," "The New Born China," "Japan's Spies," "Record of Japanese Army's Atrocities in China," "Red Front," "Soviet New Constitution," "China's Fight for Freedom," "Impressions of New China," as well as Pearl S. Buck's "The Patriot," which was recently published, and "Inside Asia," which is currently being translated by a group of people following "Inside Europe." Moreover, there are seven or eight more items in the announcements and that I personally know are being translated.

This "prosperous" phenomenon in the translation industry, on the good side, is a very gratifying phenomenon to introduce the viewpoints and thoughts of foreigners as a reference for the cultural work of one's own country. We can never complain that there are too many translated things. In fact, compared to our × country, our introduction work is still far behind, although the current situation in Japan, in terms of the quality of introduction work, is far inferior to ours.

But here we should reflect on: why do foreign authors write so many works about recent Chinese issues (or Sino-Japanese issues and Far Eastern issues), while our own authors do not have such achievements to show? A foreign journalist comes to China to observe for a year or two, and then publishes a book about Chinese issues when he returns home. In theory, Chinese journalists, who have more convenience than foreign journalists, should have better achievements, but in reality, although it cannot be said that there are absolutely none, the valuable works that have been published are only a minority of the minority.

For example, a novel like "The Patriot." It is not that there is no one among Chinese literary authors who can write it. I personally even firmly believe that if a Chinese writer with literary cultivation and technique handles the same subject matter, they will definitely be able to surpass Pearl S. Buck and write something even better.

However, to date, we have not discovered any powerful new creations. I am personally a person engaged in translation work. My raising the above question is by no means intended to accuse creators of dereliction of duty. Because I know that there are various difficulties in the current environment. But I cannot admit the pain I often feel in my heart. Every time I start translating a good book about Chinese events, I can't help but have such a feeling in my heart: why are these good materials and good themes not handled and organized by our own writers, but wait for others to write them well before translating them back? It is clearly our own thing, but we have to use someone else's name. This phenomenon is too heartbreaking!

Translation work has its own independent meaning, but a translator with a national consciousness does not want to specialize in translating things that could have been written by authors in his own country, and his main responsibility does not lie in this. But currently, those engaged in translation work, because the objective situation is like this, have to temporarily put aside the responsibility of introducing Western culture and return the Chinese issue materials that foreign authors have collected back to their original owners.

My view may be too shallow and narrow, but it comes from the best and purest motives.

### Germ and Anesthetic Warfare

— Written by Ji Muray, Translated by Tian Ren

On November 4, 1937, three New York chemists reported to the American Chemical Society how millions of people could be anesthetized in the next war. They said that the anesthetic that can be loaded into bombs is acetylchlorine, mixed with an irritant that can erode the epidermis, so that the anesthetic can invade the blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and cause loss of consciousness. By changing the ratio of drugs, the effective time can be from a few minutes to several hours.

Many people will not find the use of anesthetics in the next world war to be terrifying, but in addition to this, there are many abhorrent anesthetics, and some war leaders may use them to poison × people due to a great burst of animal nature.

(5) Soviet Russia Rush to Make Wartime Anesthetics

Soviet Russian leaders have publicly declared that if they are forced to fight with people, they will annihilate × people in the shortest period of time. Previously, experts from the German and Italian republics had established great digestive factories for Russia in various places. Russian political party leaders have never concealed that their chemical factories are manufacturing anesthetics and poison gases for war day and night, in order to quickly destroy the × people who invade them. German chemical factories are also making every effort to manufacture anesthetics and poison gases for the next world war. British chemists warned the world a year ago that they might be forced to resort to toxic means in the next world war.

The rebellious behavior of prisoners of war and frequent attempts to escape are annoying. During the World War, it was suggested that prisoners of war be forced to smoke opium in order to eliminate trouble, but fortunately it was not actually adopted. But it may be adopted in the next world war. Or some ruthless countries may give their prisoners of war a "hypnotic pill" for their use. Due to the influence of a malignant anesthetic, prisoners of war can become addicted to killing and mutilation, while being mentally confused and unable to distinguish between enemies and friends, and be sent back to their own country to kill their own comrades.

(6) Humane Warfare (?)

Scientific experts want to use anesthetic poison gas as a weapon of war in order to absolve their responsibility for manufacturing killing weapons, so they write articles and argue that using anesthetic poison gas as a weapon is more humane and merciful than blowing people to pieces with artillery fire. They also say that if the ultimate goal is to make × people surrender, then it is possible to use more humane methods, that is, to make × people lose consciousness with anesthetics. They point out that there are at least a dozen kinds of anesthetics that can make people indifferent, unwilling to do anything, and hate anything, with the only desire being "peace."

Imagine, if the entire population of a country is anesthetized during wartime, then important industries will be shut down, and even a small part cannot be made in arms factories, and naturally they will be defeated.

Several well-known experts have claimed that it is easy to put anesthetics into the drinking water sources of enemy countries during wartime. It is more difficult to put anesthetics in food, while water sources are easy to put anesthetics in.

Even if used on a large scale, this method of anesthetizing × people is not easy to detect, because there are no obvious symptoms, no poisoning, no death, but only an increase in national indifference. The people will not care who wins or loses the war, they only hope for peace as soon as possible, regardless of any conditions.

Now it seems like delirium to say that anesthetics will be the deciding factor in the world war, but we must remember that modern war weapons such as airplanes, submarines, and tanks were also thought to be people's dreams before! (Translated from World Magazine)

###濟南號由英艦護送　衝破封鎖直抵汕頭　×禁起落客貨竟架機槍恐嚇　英當局為維護利益準備交涉

The British naval authorities, in order to protect British interests in Shantou, had already notified British shipping companies the day before yesterday to send ships to Shantou as usual, and ordered them to be escorted by British warships stationed in Shantou. Therefore, the × side attempted to blockade Shantou, but the British side had decided to ignore them. After receiving the notification from the naval authorities, the various shipping companies immediately resumed the original Shantou route the day before yesterday. The first British ship to break through the × army's blockade line was the Taikoo Company's Jinan, which entered Shantou Port at 11:00 am on the 23rd escorted by a British warship stationed in Shantou. However, after berthing, the × side used force to prevent passengers and cargo from loading and unloading. The ship sailed the same afternoon and returned to Hong Kong, arriving here yesterday. Following the Jinan, Jardine Matheson's Fao Seng also sailed into Shantou. In addition, other British ships will sail to Shantou one after another today and tomorrow.

From Shanghai to Shantou, Breaking the Blockade

According to the ship's compradore, Mr. Guo Huajun, the ship sailed from Shanghai to Shantou on Sunday and then came to Hong Kong. When it set off from Shanghai, there was no change in Shantou, so it still took cargo and passengers to Shantou in Shanghai. This time, it transported a total of 5,282 pieces of goods from Shanghai to Shantou, including matches, bean cakes, and various groceries. There were more than 20 male and female passengers traveling from Shanghai to Shantou. On the way from Shanghai to Shantou, they received a wireless telegram, and learned that a war had broken out in Shantou. The ship owner immediately telegraphed back to Hong Kong to ask the company for instructions on what to do. They then received a telegram from the company ordering them to continue sailing to Shantou according to the original schedule. The ship then arrived outside Shantou Port early in the morning of the 23rd. At that time, Shantou Port was full of dozens of × side warships, including an aircraft carrier and a giant smoke-stack cruiser, which were anchored near Nan'ao. The others were transport ships, armed merchant ships, and red-topped gunboats. The original merchant ships in Shantou had all escaped. When the ship arrived outside Shantou Port, it immediately telegraphed the British warship stationed in Shantou Port. Soon, the British warship "Scott" sailed over to escort it into the port. The British warship went first, and the ship followed behind. When entering the port, it passed the place where the × warships were stationed, but the × warships did not interfere. There were no obstacles along the way. At 11:30 am, the ship berthed at the dock. At that time, the Yingzhou was still dry-docked next to the adjacent dock. Apart from this ship and the Yingzhou, no other merchant ships were seen docked.

× Side's Rude Force Stopped Landing

After berthing, seven or eight × soldiers patrolled and monitored the pier. There were also three British soldiers, fully armed, protecting the pier. The situation was very serious. Two executives and Western staff members from the Taikoo Company's Shantou branch were waiting at the dock. The × side prevented the ship from loading and unloading goods, and passengers and crew members were not allowed to land. The × military officer was extremely rude and did not even allow the gangway to be connected to the pier. The company executive tried hard to negotiate, but to no avail. The ship could only lower the gangway, but the × side still did not allow anyone to disembark. The Taikoo Company executive and two Western staff members climbed onto the ship along the rope to meet with the ship owner. When the three were about to leave the ship, they were again stopped from disembarking by the × side. As a result, the British warship had to send a speedboat to carry the three over to the Yingzhou, and then they disembarked from the Yingzhou.

Machine Guns Were Deployed at the Pier to Intimidate

The ship stayed in Shantou for four hours after berthing, and none of the crew or passengers were allowed to disembark. It was impossible to load or unload cargo. From the ship, it was witnessed that there were very few pedestrians along the embankment outside the pier, and the scene was desolate. There were only a dozen people in rags gathered on the embankment, mostly poor people who were unable to evacuate. Two coolies risked sneaking onto the ship to solicit business, but to no avail. They said that the order in the city was very chaotic, with rampant looting by Han × bandits, and the whole city was like a dead place. When the company staff negotiated with the × army at the pier, the situation was quite tense. The × soldiers even placed a machine gun on each side of the pier entrance, and many × soldiers were stationed there to intimidate. The ship left Shantou Port at about 3 pm that afternoon, still escorted by the British warship. The captain ordered all crew members and passengers not to stand on the deck to avoid accidents. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at 7 am this morning (yesterday), and the goods transported to Shantou were also unloaded in Hong Kong.

Foreign Ships Resume Shantou Shipping

In addition to the Jinan, the Fao Seng also sailed into Shantou Port yesterday. It sailed from Hong Kong the afternoon before yesterday and was reportedly escorted into Shantou Port by a British warship. Because the ship had no passengers or cargo for Shantou, it is expected that it sailed to Fuzhou and Shanghai yesterday. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Suzhou will sail from Hong Kong to Shantou at 2 pm today. Its itinerary is the same as that of the Fao Seng, first to Shantou and then to Fuzhou and Shanghai. Butterfield & Swire's Xin Hai Men has not yet decided on its sailing schedule. As for the × side forcibly preventing British ships from loading and unloading passengers and cargo in Shantou, it is heard that the British side is preparing to negotiate with them.

### A Lively, Vivid, and Fulfilling Symposium What Should Be Written in Hong Kong? A Quick Sketch of the Third Symposium of the Literary Association Yesterday

By Qi Zhuo

Special Report by This Newspaper

On weekends in Hong Kong, the arteries of the city beat even more frantically. All kinds of people went their separate ways, each seeking their own pleasures. What is to be reported here is the dynamic of another corner of the great Hong Kong: more than ten literary and art workers gathered at the verandah of the Youth Journalists Association for the Hong Kong Literary Association Symposium, the third of its kind.

Yesterday at 6:00 pm, Wu Liangsong, Chen Later, Mai Sui, Hu Weizhou, Wang Jianming, Zhu Qizhuo, Lu Mouliang, Chen Daren, Guo Butao, Wen Gongyi, Li Chi, Huang Moulu, etc. attended one after another. Lin Huanping and Xu Jingyuan's opinions were also submitted in writing to represent them. Mr. Wu Jingsong was the chairman. The focus of the symposium was originally: "What Should Be Written in Hong Kong in Particular?" However, everyone was so excited that they said whatever came to mind. The atmosphere was lively and relaxed, and very interesting. It was a symposium that was as delightful as possible, completely different from formalistic, boring ones. Precisely because those who spoke were very free and not restricted by form, this can only be a quick sketch.

Regarding "What Should Be Written in Hong Kong in Particular"

The opinions of the various participants were roughly as follows:

Lin Huanping:

1.  In terms of form, attention should be paid to Hong Kong's special environment, Hong Kong's relationship with the War of Resistance against Japan, the relationship between Hong Kong and China and Britain, the relationship between Hong Kong and Britain, France, and the United States, etc., and attention should be paid to learning skills.
2.  In terms of content, it is necessary to grasp the living dynamics and anti-Japanese sentiments of all social strata in Hong Kong, and to express them concretely and profoundly. More specifically, such as the "youth with no way to save the country," the decadent youth, the "high-level refugees" and "retired officials," the patriotic enthusiasm of the middle and lower classes, the indifference of some wealthy people to the War of Resistance, ××××××××, the degree of sympathy of foreigners for our War of Resistance, the ups and downs, etc. All of these can only be expressed profoundly with concrete images. The objective situation also requires our writers to do this step.

Wu Jingsong: I think that writing in Hong Kong, you may as well start from these aspects:

1.  Exposing the darkness of licentiousness and shamelessness;
2.  If we adopt the old-fashioned works loved by the majority of readers, we must add positive effects;
3.  Encouraging overseas Chinese to enthusiastically donate, ××××, is also needed at this time and place;
4.  Writing articles on the War of Resistance should avoid superficiality, and the exposure of the inside story is also necessary.

Hu Weizhou: It is also necessary for the editors and authors of supplements to change their styles and attitudes. No matter which newspaper's supplement, they all have their roles and cannot be treated differently. The attention of all readers must be sought.

Chen Later: It is very important to replace toxic tabloids with tabloids that contain new content.

Wu Jingsong: In supplements, long old-fashioned novels have a climax in each episode every day, which can easily arouse readers' interest. However, most new novel writers do not have this kind of experience and it is not easy to arouse readers' interest. This is not a problem with the works themselves, but rather that they are not suitable for continuous publication in sections in supplements, which is a question worth studying.

Chen Daren: The lifestyle of "Hong Kong people" determines that they like erotic novels. It is okay to add new content to "eroticism" as a theme.

Wang Jianming: Works should be close to the broad masses of working people.

Guo Butao: Environmental relations also have concerns.

Zhu Qizhuo: Writing skills should also be paid attention to.

Hu Weizhou: Articles on theory and criticism are still very lacking in Hong Kong.

Chen Daren: New comic strips need to be promoted.

Wu Jingsong: Our children's education and children's literature are really not enough. In the future, children's books should improve their scientific level, and teachers should have general scientific literacy.

Regarding the center of the next symposium as "The Problem of Reviewing New Books," Mr. Li Chi was appointed as chairman. A lively, fulfilling, and vivid symposium ended after two or three hours of hearty conversation.

The details have been reported previously. It is understood that the special committee held a meeting at 5 pm yesterday. As a result, it was decided that the Student Relief Association would initiate and convene all Hong Kong youth organizations to participate. The detailed measures for consultation and implementation will be discussed at the meeting next week.

### Actively Prevent Cholera The Director of Medical and Health Services Convened a Meeting The Lai Chi Kok Hospital Will Be Opened to Accommodate Patients Clean Up Street Filth and Publish Propaganda Wall Paintings

The Director of Medical and Health Services, Mr. Situ Yongjue, in view of the cholera epidemic, the increasing number of deaths, and the increasingly serious situation, convened an important meeting of medical experts in Hong Kong at the Department of Health yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, various medical questions were raised and discussed on how to prevent the spread of cholera and how to promote preventive measures. Many decisions were also made on the steps to be taken. Moreover, the medical authorities believe that the accumulation of garbage on the streets and the changes that occur are a medium for the spread of epidemics. Therefore, the filth will be cleaned up first. At present, 200 sanitation workers and five garbage trucks have been added to start cleaning up the filth in various districts of the city, hoping to clean up the filth in the narrow streets and alleys and reduce the spread of cholera. At the same time, in view of the increasing number of patients with infectious diseases, in order to isolate and treat them, it is planned to open the vacant part of the Lai Chi Kok Infectious Disease Hospital to accommodate patients. This matter is being actively planned and will be realized in the shortest possible time. As for publicity, propaganda pamphlets and wall paintings have been printed and posted and distributed on major thoroughfares to widely publicize preventive measures for cholera and instill the public with knowledge of prevention, so as to achieve great results and maintain public safety. In addition, the Health Bureau reported that there were as many as seven cases of cholera on Friday, 28 cases of tuberculosis, seven cases of enteritis, two cases of chickenpox, and one case each of dysentery and diphtheria.

### Circular from the Central Overseas Department Strictly Prohibiting Unauthorized Fundraising Overseas Fundraising by Agencies and Organizations Must Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Verification Overseas Chinese Groups Have the Right to Refuse Unauthorized Fundraising

In order to unify overseas fundraising and prevent abuses, the central government authorities have strictly ordered all agencies and organizations not to raise funds overseas without authorization. At the same time, the Overseas Department notified various overseas Chinese groups. Most of the relevant overseas Chinese groups here have received this circular. A copy is as follows:

Instruction No. 112 of the Central Executive Committee Overseas Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, Hai Chong Zi. It is noted that with regard to the matter of domestic agencies and organizations sending personnel to foreign countries to raise funds from overseas Chinese, the Executive Yuan has issued an order that in the future, they must first submit to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for overseas Chinese donations, the Bank of China in Hong Kong has been specially designated to receive them. Regardless of whether the central or local agencies receive donations, they should be sent to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Bank for verification and collection. The government will统筹 allocate and distribute the funds for use. Various agencies are not allowed to send personnel to Hong Kong or other places to raise funds on their own in order to prevent abuses. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance has formulated a general outline of measures for receiving donations, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. However, according to reports from comrades and overseas Chinese in Annam, Burma, the Americas, and other places, there are still local administrative agencies or military officers who send personnel overseas on their own to entrust local overseas Chinese groups to hold fundraising events. Not only does this go against the central government's orders and cause overseas Chinese to have divergent views, but it is also prone to abuses, which affects the fundraising of overseas Chinese patriotic donations. The President has ordered that anyone who reports that any agency or troop is raising funds overseas privately will be strictly stopped and urged the Ministry and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to pay attention. Responsible comrades in our party should uphold the President's profound intention to unify fundraising, prevent abuses, and rectify discipline. Anyone who has not been approved by the Executive Yuan and raises funds overseas without authorization should be frankly told by the fundraisers that they have received orders from the central government and it is inconvenient to assist them. At the same time, report to the Ministry. When the document arrives, I hope you will inform the leaders of the overseas Chinese groups. By order.

The next was the 137-pounder caught by Wong Kwok-cheung of the Sincere Company.

### China Rescue Theatre Performs a Farewell Charity Performance to Raise Funds for the Women's War Relief Association

Under the leadership of Ms. Liu Zhu-huang, the China Women's War Relief Association has spared no effort to raise funds and provide material assistance to the War of Resistance. The Association believes that the China Rescue Theatre's performances are excellent and caused a sensation in Hong Kong last time. It has taken advantage of their last performance before going abroad to invite them to perform one last time to raise funds for war refugees. The Theatre has agreed to perform famous plays such as "On the Banks of the Yongding River," "The Great Earth Robbery," and "Blood Splattered Peach Blossoms" at the Lee Theatre on July 1, 2, and 3, and to comfort the audience who missed the previous performance.

### The Zhongshan Youth Association is Preparing to Organize Nine Preparatory Committee Members

The Zhongshan youth who stayed in Hong Kong recently launched the Zhongshan Youth Association in order to connect their feelings and seek close ties with the youth in various parts of Zhongshan. The first preparatory meeting was convened yesterday and immediately elected Yang Zijiang, Yang Guoning, Fang Leibai, Xiao Yunlan, and other nine people as preparatory committee members to actively promote all matters. The preparatory office is temporarily located in the Student Newspaper Agency on the third floor of 371 Nathan Road.

### Health Personnel The Number of Registrants is No More Than One Hundred Foreign Friends Are Still Helping Us What About Those Who Avoid Facing the Soldiers at the Front?

The Guangdong authorities have recently conducted wartime health personnel registration in various parts of the province and Hong Kong and Macau in order to adjust the health personnel and meet the needs of the wartime. All health personnel of Guangdong origin, such as physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, and midwives, whether or not they have obtained a business license, must register with the registration office in their place of residence. Otherwise, they may be requested to be punished by the Supreme Health Bureau or have their licenses revoked. The registration affairs in Hong Kong are handled by the China Youth Ambulance Corps. Registration has already begun and will end at the end of this month. It is understood that the Hong Kong registration office has received a total of 300 registration forms. It is estimated that the 300 forms will not be enough for the health personnel staying in Hong Kong. However, as of yesterday, less than half a month before the deadline, there are less than 100 registrants. According to Mr. Lu, the cadre in charge of registration, since the sacred War of Resistance, our compatriots at home and abroad have devoted themselves to the work of saving the country under the principle of our supreme leader contributing money and effort, and peace-loving friends have also used their spirit of loving peace to serve us, adding infinite glorious pages to the history of our War of Resistance and National Construction. But the health personnel who are registered this time are so weak. I don't know how to face the soldiers on the front line. We are following the instructions of the superiors to persuade people to register, and we will take the strictest measures against those who take a wait-and-see attitude or even refuse to register.

### China Motor Bus To Open New Routes on July 1 Change of Routes 1 and 2 to Be Implemented at the Same Time To Cope With Passenger Crowding New Buses Will Continue to Be Purchased

The China Motor Bus Company, in order to meet the needs of residents due to the failure of the original bus routes to supply, the company authorities are planning to open new routes and change the original bus routes. This plan has been approved by the Hong Kong government and will be implemented on July 1. The newly added Route 5A runs from Kennedy Town, via Queen's Road West, Leighton Hill Road, Wong Nai Chung Road, from which it turns past the Naval Memorial, turns back to Queen's Road East, and returns to Kennedy Town. The original "running line" between the Whampoa Dock and Happy Valley will be changed to run via Hennessy Road and Hon Ning Road into Happy Valley instead of Johnston Road. Route 2, which runs between the Whampoa Dock and Taikoo Dock, will also run via Hennessy Road instead of Lockhart Road in the future. According to Mr. Cheng Kun, the general manager of the company, the above-mentioned routes were decided by the company's board of directors last Friday night and will be implemented on July 1. It is said that it can be officially announced in about one or two days. It is also said that due to the sudden increase in the population of Hong Kong, the company feels that the original vehicles are not sufficient for distribution, and new vehicles have been purchased from foreign countries to join the fleet. It is estimated that the company has a total of 50 large buses with 35 to 37 seats, more than 30 medium-sized buses with 20 to 25 seats, and more than 20 other small buses. According to the situation observed a month ago, the current vehicles are still not enough. Recently, the company has ordered 12 new buses from foreign countries, half of which are large and medium-sized buses. After the buses arrive in Hong Kong, they will be dispatched to the crowded routes, and it is believed that the crowded situation can be reduced at that time.

### Brave Boat Housewife Barely Defeats Four Thieves Armed Pirates Are No Match Three Thieves Are Pushed Into the Water One Thief Jumps Into the Sea and Flees

Boat 4598, owned by boat housewife Li Qingmei (37 years old), sailed to the side of Fanliu Mountain Bay in British territory late at night the night before and stopped. There were five men and women on board. After mooring at the foot of the mountain, everyone slept in the boat. At about 2:00 am yesterday morning, just as everyone was having a good dream, four pirates suddenly sailed to the vicinity in a small boat. Taking advantage of everyone's sleeping soundly, they sneaked and climbed onto the boat. The boat owner, Li Qingmei, and everyone else were awakened one after another. The four pirates who boarded the boat were about 30 to 40 years old and wore short shirts and pants. Two of them carried short guns, and two carried kitchen knives. After boarding the boat, they didn't say a word. The thief with the gun fired two shots in a row, threatening everyone not to make a sound. The two companions, Feng Da and Feng Baoqi, were shot and injured on the spot. The people on the boat heard the gunshots and saw two people injured and falling to the ground, so they scrambled to escape. It was night, and the situation on the boat was very chaotic. Only the housewife, Li Qingmei, was strong and powerful. Seeing the two thieves shooting and committing murder, she was afraid that something unexpected would happen, so she rose up to resist, pounced forward and entangled with the thieves. The four thieves were caught off guard and were knocked down, twisting into a ball with each other. Li was superhuman in strength and finally pushed three of the thieves into the sea one after another. Seeing that the situation was not good, the remaining thief also jumped into the sea and fled. The four thieves swam to the original small boat and fled. The victim inspected the boat and fortunately there was no loss. She then took the kitchen knife and flashlight left behind by the thieves and took the injured to Tai O Police Station to report the case. After the police took the case, they sent the injured to the hospital for treatment.

### Overseas Chinese Hong Kong Registered Middle School, Graduation Exams to Commence Tomorrow, Changes to Exam Procedures, All Exams to be Held at Original Schools, Inspectors to be Sent by the Supervisor to Oversee Exams at Each School

The graduation exams for overseas Chinese middle schools registered in the mainland for this academic year are scheduled to commence tomorrow and last fifteen days until the tenth of next month. They will be held in Hong Kong and overseen by supervisors dispatched by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education. It is noted that the practice of having Guangdong Education Department supervisors oversee the graduation exams of registered schools began three years ago. In the first two years, all participating students had to go to Guangzhou City for the exams. Last year, this was changed to holding the exams locally in Hong Kong, with supervisors Ma Yanpan and Zhu Baoqin dispatched by the Department of Education to oversee them. This year, the examination methods have been altered somewhat compared to last year. Last year, students went to designated examination halls to take the exams, overseen by Ma and Zhu. This year, all students will take the exams at their original schools, with supervisors dispatched by the Department of Education, Zhang Zimo, sending staff to the exam halls to oversee the exams. All invigilators will be university professors. It is also noted that the number of overseas Chinese schools participating in the exams this year, thirty-seven in total, has increased compared to last year.

### New Tasks for Hong Kong's Young Theater Practitioners, Mr. Jin Shan's Speech at the Farewell Party of the Amateur Association

— By Hu Qi, Recorded by Xian Zhuo

Starting from "Eating Zongzi"

Thank you for the kindness of the friends of the Amateur Association for holding such a meaningful gathering today. This deep friendship will be forever remembered by us —

Today happens to be the Dragon Boat Festival. It is indeed a rare opportunity for us to gather here and eat zongzi. On this day, according to the usual sentiments of us Chinese, we cannot help but feel "missing our loved ones more during festivals." I was deeply moved while silently eating zongzi just now, and my heart was filled with infinite emotion —

I am not missing my relatives. I am thinking, where will I be eating zongzi next year? And then I remembered the situation on this day last year.

Last year on the Dragon Boat Festival, we were in Wuhan, which was the time when we were intensifying the defense of Greater Wuhan. On the one hand, we participated in the defense of Wuhan, and on the other hand, we cooperated with the China Film Studio to shoot "The Last Drop of Blood." Because we were shooting outdoor scenes at East Lake in Wuchang, we ate zongzi at East Lake. At that time, I was thinking: "Where will I be eating zongzi next year?"

Unexpectedly, I am spending this year's Dragon Boat Festival in Hong Kong. Of course, I am not saddened by the loss of Wuhan, because the withdrawal from Wuhan was entirely a matter of overall strategy. The purpose of defending Wuhan was to deplete the enemy and exact a price. So defending Wuhan was only a matter of time. I am not only not saddened, but the development of the new situation of the war of resistance makes us even more excited and optimistic.

The facts tell us: the enemy today is making a final struggle in their dying days. The great victory in northern Hubei and the good news of counter-offensives on various fronts show how riddled with holes the enemy is, while we are showing ever-increasing strength and unlimited power to cope with the situation.

Kicked Out with One Foot

In order to cover up their military setbacks, the enemy has intensified their political conspiracies, using Wang Jingwei to organize puppet organizations, which is a prominent example. In fact, Wang Jingwei has long been kicked out by the compatriots of the whole country since he sent the scandalous telegram. Even if there were another Wang Jingwei, it would not affect our war of resistance.

Therefore, I am very happy to be eating zongzi this year, because the progress of the motherland in the past year has been too great! Many backward elements are trembling in the face of the advancing motherland, many traitors are dying in the face of the advancing motherland, and the enemy is bound to collapse before it.

I believe that we are spending the Dragon Boat Festival in Hong Kong today, and next year today, we may be able to go to Guangzhou or Wuhan to eat zongzi. A year later, the motherland will definitely be more advanced than it is now. Therefore, the mood when eating zongzi next year will definitely be more genuine than this year!

Moreover, we must use all our strength to strive for this day, especially the salvation workers residing in Hong Kong. In the war-torn motherland, there is naturally no "Shangri-La." Today, in Hong Kong, where the international situation is becoming increasingly urgent, there can be no exceptions. The safety of Hong Kong is a big question mark, and our compatriots residing in Hong Kong should be vigilant about this!

The Price of Blood

I remember when I first met you, I said: How the youth in the war zone are struggling in a difficult and arduous environment! How they sacrifice everything and dedicate everything! Their contribution to the motherland is indelible, and they themselves have grown by leaps and bounds in their work! We worked with them in the war zone for twenty months and left a very deep impression. We will never forget them!

Recalling it in Hong Kong today, their work was really too difficult. Take the performance as an example. In Hong Kong, we can still use all the superior conditions on the stage to strengthen the performance effect, but in the war zone, there is nothing at all! Of course, in the war zone, it is not as in Hong Kong: the script must be submitted for review, but the most serious thing about submitting the script for review is only that the performance is banned. In the war zone, it is not a matter of "submission for review" at all, it is simply a matter of life and death. The young drama workers are constantly working under the threat of the enemy's cannons, planes, and bombs until they shed their last drop of blood. Speaking of this, I cannot help but think of Comrade Zhao Shu, who has already died for the country. He was brutally killed by the enemy when he broke through Xuzhou last year. He was still wearing the peasant's clothes he wore during the performance until his death. His death represents the new spirit of young drama workers. His death also shows that the foundation of the emerging drama has been laid as a result of countless hardships and the price of blood of countless young drama workers. And today, countless young drama workers are continuing Comrade Zhao Shu's spirit in the war zone and are making more arduous and greater struggles.

"Friend" and "Enemy"

Why are they able to fight so hard, risking their lives? The reason is very simple, because at that time, there were only two words in their minds: "friend" and "enemy." As soon as they opened their eyes, what was in front of them was the dying enemy, and around them were countless friends. Therefore, their problem was how to unite the friends around them closely, overthrow the enemy, and break through this life-and-death difficulty!

Such a situation is naturally not easy to demand in Hong Kong, but,

Therefore, we should be vigilant ourselves and forge ourselves as strong as steel to undertake today's work, cope with future problems, and actively participate in the struggle.

Speaking of ourselves, I can frankly tell you friends that we have many shortcomings. These shortcomings are constantly occurring in our work, but we are not afraid. We can say that we have been constantly overcoming our shortcomings since we started. Therefore, although we have shortcomings, we have never allowed our work to suffer a great impact.

Unite Sincerely

I am sorry that I do not have good suggestions to offer for your reference. As far as I can see, what is more important in the Hong Kong drama circle today is the issue of strengthening the solidarity movement.

Since the Xi'an Incident, we have deeply realized the meaning of unity. We can say that without unity, there would be no war of resistance, and without unity, we would not be qualified to fight the enemy.

In Hong Kong, there are many drama comrades whose performance in their work makes us very admire. If we make more efforts to strengthen the power of unity, I believe their contribution must be more significant!

Naturally, every department of salvation work must be closely united; however, it must be a sincere unity in order to generate power! Empty slogans of unity will not have any results. We are actors, and every actor has experienced using various expressions to impress the audience, so actors are also best able to distinguish between true and false. From the other party's voice, expression, and actions, we can tell whether they are true or false. It is not easy to deceive an actor or anyone with empty slogans; similarly, genuine sincerity and genuine frankness are also easy to see. We do not have excessively high expectations, as long as all those who sincerely cooperate can be closely united, it is already a great force!

Learn from Practice

Secondly, I feel that each of us should strengthen our self-education. The War of Resistance and National Reconstruction are progressing simultaneously. Once the War of Resistance ends, all the construction work after the great destruction will be very arduous and very urgent. The first step must be to mobilize all workers in the cultural sector to work hard to eliminate illiteracy. Drama is an important part of culture. We must use drama as a tool to educate the masses. To take on the arduous tasks of the future, we should first educate ourselves and enrich ourselves.

Strengthening self-education naturally includes academic cultivation and personality training. I firmly believe that the drama workers staying in Hong Kong have already noticed this problem. However, learning has no end, and we all need to continue learning. I sincerely tell all my friends that I often feel that I am very insufficient, so I often try hard not to give up every opportunity to learn. We should learn from each other and educate each other. Who can say that they do not need to learn? Absolutely not! But who should we learn from? I think learning from each other is a method, but at the same time, it is important to pay attention to learning in practice - learning in work. Friends, I think this is the best and most reliable method.

Hoping to be Younger Next Year

Speaking of this, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about another thing, which is the issue of the view of the term "young drama worker." I think that the youth referred to here should not be understood formally, thinking that those who are young are young, nor should we simply think that those who have performed in dramas for many years, engaged in drama movements for many years, and have many years of stage experience are considered young. I feel that the meaning of youth should refer to those who have rich vitality, strong fighting spirit, high enthusiasm, and can represent a new hope, a new spirit, and a new force. Such fighters are worthy of being called youth!

I am ashamed that I am not qualified to be called "youth." None of the comrades in our group are really worthy of being called "youth," because we have too many shortcomings! Of course, we can overcome our shortcomings, but as long as the shortcomings exist for one day, we cannot be considered youth for one day.

We must respond to the encouragement and expectations of many friends and hope to be a little younger than this year next year. At the same time, we hope that when we gather together in another place next year, there will be more youth present than today!

The words of the younger brother are complicated, but they are all sincere. That's all!

### "China Rescue," See You Again in Work!

— Qi Zhuo

Various Circles of Relief Joint Association and Amateur Association Present Flags and Farewell Before Departure

In order to express their appreciation and encouragement, the Hong Kong Relief Joint Association, together with various overseas Chinese groups, held a meeting at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on the 20th, a very hot afternoon, to bid farewell to the "China Rescue" drama troupe before their departure to promote the cause abroad. A flag presentation ceremony was held, and an atmosphere of harmony and tension enveloped the entire venue.

The hosts participating in the farewell included representatives from various circles of the Relief Joint Association, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Journalists Association, the Women's War Relief Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's New Movement Association, the Chung Sing Charitable Society, the Tung Wah Hospital, the Kwong Lien Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations. After refreshments, Chairman Li Jianfeng, Huang Zhaoruolan, Cao Xueyu, Lu Guomian, and others successively delivered speeches, praising and encouraging the troupe's work performance and the service spirit of the members. Then, the flag presentation ceremony was held. The Relief Joint Association presented a flag with the words "Preaching by Example"; the Journalists Association presented a flag with the words "Winning Hearts Is Paramount"; Li Jianfeng personally presented a flag with the words "Verbal Condemnation," each with profound implications, for mutual encouragement.

The next day, the evening of the 21st - the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival - there was another potluck farewell party at the Oriental Vegetarian Restaurant in Wan Chai, appearing in a lively and solemn posture. The host was the Amateur Association, which is eager to learn from the virtuous and follow good advice. Such a rare gathering was not accidental.

In addition to the "China Rescue" troupe members and the "Amateur Association" community, there were also senior figures in the drama circle participating. About a hundred young people with surging blood were tightly surrounded by a not very large dining hall. The electric fans overhead were spinning non-stop, making people forget the suffering of the heat.

First of all, Chairman Yao Jianhou gave a speech. Although he has worked in the banking industry for many years, his words were filled with youthful activity. Many friends of the Amateur Association are also this type of respectable figure.

He said that sending China Rescue friends to promote the cause abroad is like sending fighters to the battlefield. The commendable qualities of China Rescue that are worth learning from us are, first, a high degree of enthusiasm ××××××××, second, tense work, carrying heavy burdens, third, a simple and strict private life; fourth, a spirit of love, harmony, and unity in the group - these are completely symbols of the new China.

As for the contributions of China Rescue after arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Yao said: hard work has led to great rewards, overseas Chinese understand the great motherland from drama and are convinced of the future of victory, as for improving the level of drama in Hong Kong and giving new inspiration and encouragement to national defense dramas, it goes without saying.

Mr. Yao also contributed that China Rescue should make overseas Chinese: 1. Thoroughly understand the rebirth of the motherland and be absolutely confident in the final victory; 2. Mobilize the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of overseas Chinese to participate in the motherland's ××××××; 3. Crush the surrender theories of traitors and defeatists; 4. Organize overseas Chinese to work hard to strengthen the national diplomacy movement and win the sympathy of friendly countries.

Finally, the chairman solemnly said that this farewell party, in addition to eating and socializing, should launch group research to make the harvest more substantial and beneficial to future work. In order to promote the spirit of China Rescue and fill their posts, we will take "the responsibilities that the remaining workers of the China Salvation Troupe should bear" as the focus of the symposium?

In a burst of warm applause, Mr. Weng Lingwen presented a banner with the words "Propaganda for the Country" on behalf of the Amateur Association, which was accepted by Jin Shan, the head of the China Rescue Troupe. After that, guests and friends present contributed their opinions at the invitation of the chairman.

Lu Fu first spoke: "China Rescue's" past heroic work and activities in Hong Kong for more than two months have deeply moved each of our cultural workers! In their continuous efforts, they have opened up a bright future for the emerging drama movement in China and established the foundation of the new national drama. During the short period of working with them, I deeply felt that they had several special advantages that are worth learning from us: 1. A serious and thorough work attitude and a working spirit of sacrificing everything for the liberation of the nation; 2. A strong willpower and a high degree of enthusiasm of being indomitable, courageous, hardworking, honest, and sincere; 3. A close, solid, and democratic organization and strict work discipline; 4. Diligent and tireless self-education and a hard-working struggle life. ... Now, they are carrying the more great and arduous task of promoting the cause overseas. They are the pioneers of national liberation. How should we, who are left in this "Shangri-La," work harder to be their support, to learn their spirit, to fill their posts, to expand their work, and to shoulder the new tasks we should bear!

Li Jingbo said: Thank you to China Rescue for giving excitement to overseas Chinese and drama workers. Since China Travel came to Hong Kong, the high tide of the drama movement has surged. It will not come in vain.

I dare to solemnly say to China Rescue friends on behalf of the young drama workers in Hong Kong: You will not come in vain; the seeds you have sown will sprout and bear fruit. — A hardworking and excellent young drama worker, with a naive and sincere attitude, made people very moved.

Jiang Ming's speech was as humorous, vivid, and interesting as he was on stage. After everyone had a hearty vegetarian meal - and zongzi - many more people continued to speak:

Weng Lingwen reported on China Rescue's hard life of sleeping on the floor and eating coarse food, and its indomitable spirit of hard work, and said that helping China Rescue perform was as inspiring as studying at China Rescue. This young man, who is keen to learn, was originally a cadre sent by the Ministry of Education to Hong Kong to promote the Mandarin movement and is now a Mandarin teacher at a certain middle school in Hong Kong and an excellent member of the Amateur Association.

China Rescue Liu Danqing said in a scholar's manner: To make the liberation movement of the people win, the ancient national spirit should be fundamentally liberated. The level of civilization between urban and rural areas is non-uniformly rugged; as for Hong Kong, it has also progressed much more than before. I hope that the Amateur Association, China Flag, China Arts, and other groups will advance side by side.

In order to be able to communicate with each other and encourage each other after China Rescue goes abroad, Jiang Ming proposed that the film and drama weekly of this newspaper be used as a communication station, which was applauded by everyone. The editor-in-chief, Lu Fu, officially expressed his determination to do his best to shoulder this task.

After Fan Zheng and Wu Weigeng, Wang Ying also gave a very gentle and amiable speech. She said: It is a rare memory to eat zongzi here today on the Dragon Boat Festival. We are very excited and grateful for the praise, hope, encouragement, and enthusiasm of our friends. The precious friendship is also what supports our work everywhere. We still have many shortcomings ourselves. For the past two years, we have been constantly overcoming them. I hope you will continue to help us overcome our shortcomings.

Finally, Jin Shan gave a speech. The sincere attitude, the powerful, and life-filled performance of the speech captured the attention of everyone. In particular, the hope that drama workers will unite as one and strengthen self-education resonated with every person who has a heart. (Full text will be recorded separately)

After the chairman made a conclusion, Liu Ying, a famous singer, led the singing, and then they reluctantly parted ways. The right-minded drama troupe of the public office organization performed on the evening of May 30th for four consecutive nights. The first night was to entertain various agencies and groups, the second night was to entertain students, the third night was to entertain the armed comrades, and the fourth night was to entertain the masses. This time, the ambition was to use the collective directing method to mobilize drama talents from several counties to perform, spending more than 400 yuan in national currency, which was an unprecedented feat!

In terms of actors, there were several successful ones, and there was no one better than him locally, Huang Jingwen who played Miao Kexiu, Fu Ruyu who played Zhang Sheng, Lai Shiying who played Huang Lao Shuai, Zheng Songxi who played Liu Fangdan, and Li Muzhen who played Kikuko. There were also several others who were good.

Their future work plan is to be able to perform a multi-act play once a month and be able to go to the countryside to perform more one-act plays, so that the drama movement in Gaozhou Six is improved, so that this kind of appropriate propaganda can be combined with the present and increase the strength of the war of resistance. A recent news is that the Nongzhong School is rehearsing "Black Hell" and wants to be able to perform it soon.

On the second day after the performance, people from all walks of life were publicly invited to criticize, and the results obtained were:

In terms of scenery, the first act was the best, the second and third acts had small flaws, and the fourth act was also good.

In terms of lighting, the reason why there was no electric light, so lighting could not be talked about

In terms of makeup, although there were many successful ones, some of them were too exaggerated

In terms of effect, they were all quite flexible.

### The Drama Movement in the South Road

— Min Da

Gaozhou is the cultural center of the South Road, so the new drama movement is easy to develop, because the average young people are very interested in this kind of work. The performance place, wherever it is great, is all performed in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall of the Maoming County Party Department. It has developed from one-act plays to multi-act plays. It began to perform in April of this year, "Spring Breeze Autumn Rain." Gaozhou Middle School classmates raised donations to comfort the征军men, and the director was Mr. Qu Xucai, a former member of the Blue and White Drama Group. The audience was about 1,500 people, and the results were not bad. The second performance "The Night Before" was for the township propaganda fund of the Mao Ge Party Department Guangnan War Work Troupe. The audience was about 1,000 people. Because of technical and various difficulties, the result was not very good. The third time was by the Seventh District Commissioner.

### Raising Funds for the Women's War Relief Association, China Rescue's Farewell Charity Performance Before Departure

Repertoire: Yongding River, Great Earth Tribulation, Blood Splattered Peach Blossom

"China Rescue" is about to go abroad for propaganda, and it is now specially invited by the Women's War Relief Association to decide to hold the 746th farewell charity performance before going abroad at the Lee Theatre Grand Theater on July 123. This is the last performance of "China Rescue" in Hong Kong.

The program for this performance is the three great famous dramas "Yongding River", "Great Earth Tribulation" and "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom".

"Yongding River" is a collective creation of the National Playwrights Association in July of the year before last. The original play is divided into three acts. After several performances by "China Rescue," it has been revised, and a "Prologue" has been added to make it more complete. The whole play is tense and enthusiastic, and the scenery and lighting are unprecedented.

"Great Earth Tribulation" is four independent plays. As the name suggests, it can be known that it is a national defense story masterpiece that has been tempered thousands of times. "China Rescue's" "Defend the Motherland" has moved many audiences in Hong Kong, and "Great Earth Tribulation" is more refined and compact, and it will definitely tell the audience more touching stories.

The heroic and enthusiastic and great "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom" has been known to the audience, and there is no need for the reporter to introduce it.

For this performance of "China Rescue," all the scenery, lighting, props, and costumes were specially made for these plays.

### How to Solve the Script Shortage

— Zhiwei

The script shortage is a serious problem currently existing in the theater world. This problem should have been raised long ago, but it has not been resolved to this day.

Theater takes reflecting reality as its primary task. When the War of Resistance Against Japan has been going on for more than twenty-two months, and countless heroic soldiers and people are defending the motherland with their flesh and blood every day, it is truly a pity that the theater world is still suffering from a script shortage.

This problem needs to be discussed from two aspects. In terms of "quantity," we need to examine whether there are now a large number of scripts sufficient for numerous theater troupes to perform. In terms of "quality," we also need to examine whether these produced scripts have correct content that can meet the needs of the War of Resistance; and the latter is more important than the former, because theater cannot exist independently of reality.

In terms of quantity, I don't think it's very serious. Since the War of Resistance, quite a few plays have been produced. In various books and newspapers, one or two plays can be seen in almost every issue. But unfortunately, most of these works are only regarded as "bonsai" to be appreciated, and difficulties inevitably arise when they are actually staged. Therefore, after much deliberation, only a few old plays are still frequently performed in various places, and very few new scripts have been discovered, which is really frustrating.

There are two main reasons for this: First, the authors lack creative experience and have clumsy skills, and are not familiar with stage conditions. Some works, although they can be read as good literary works, neglect the characteristics of drama, resulting in a confusion between literature and drama. In this regard, we should ask authors to pay special attention to careful research. Drama is a visualized comprehensive art with unique qualities that cannot be neglected in the slightest. Second, the authors lack life experience, so what is reflected in the works is the monotony of the subject matter, and they fall into formulaic and abstract patterns. For example, in the current theater, the most popular story to describe is that of guerrilla teams. Of course, we do not deny that guerrilla warfare is being widely carried out today, and it does play an important role in the War of Resistance, and it is indeed worthy of our depiction, but the problem lies in the fact that the emergence of guerrilla teams is by no means transformed according to a single form. It has various and different changes, but what we can see now are all things that revolve around one plot, nothing more than a certain Japanese soldier insulting or massacring the Chinese people, arousing everyone's indignation, so they can't bear it any longer and unite to kill this Japanese soldier, and then go to fight guerrillas together. This kind of cliché style not only obliterates the authenticity of the guerrilla teams, but also reduces their power, making people suspect that "guerrilla teams are just this one thing." Even from the perspective of the drama itself, it is enough to reduce the effect. Because the impression given to the audience is a vague thing, and because the faces of A and B are no different, they are too lazy to watch it a second time. Therefore, we must oppose this trend, because drama is definitely not just a profile without a mouth or eyes, it is definitely not just a shell without a soul. Drama must delicately describe the lines of every fact in reality, so that the masses can recognize it, understand it, and make them nod and sigh, to the point where they have to draw their swords and attack, this is the full responsibility of drama.

How can we achieve this? First of all, we must ask playwrights to never rely on their own fantasies, or pick up some hearsay, to write about the subject matter, because this is the biggest root cause of formulaization and abstraction. You can never understand the cruelty of war if you don't go to the front line. Listening to air raid sirens in Hong Kong and listening to air raid sirens in the mainland are psychologically different. It is a foolish act for an author to try to take shortcuts in this regard. The author must be able to jump into this great torrent and experience it in practice, in order to discover many new materials, and be able to contact a wider range of reality, then he can not suffer from poverty, not fall into the "old routine," and create countless new roads, and his works will undoubtedly be the most capable of grasping reality, and the most powerful masterpieces of reflecting it.

The War of Resistance is being carried out fiercely, this problem should be resolved as soon as possible, not only to relieve the worries of theater workers themselves. And millions of viewers are also eagerly looking forward to the emergence of more excellent works!
