### Regarding Spain

The situation in Spain has taken a sharp turn. There are widespread reports that "the Spanish Republican Government's Defense Council's attitude is unclear, and ceasefire negotiations between the Defense Council and Franco's government seem to have begun." Although this news has been displayed prominently by newspapers with large, special-font headlines, those with even a little understanding and insight into the current situation will not be unduly surprised. This is because, since the rulers of Britain and France have continued to compromise and concede to the two major aggressors, Germany and Italy, and have effectively recognized the Franco government of the Spanish rebels, it has become clear that the two countries' rulers are using maximum pressure on the Spanish Republican government, which they once formally recognized, to deprive it of any power to resist and continue all-out war, in an attempt to achieve the "peace" and "development" of Spain, as envisioned by the handful of financial capital leaders they represent. Therefore, the questions for us today, especially for the Chinese people who are continuing their heroic resistance against Japanese aggression regarding the situation in Spain, are: Will the heroic struggle of the Spanish people against fascism and aggression end in complete failure? What impact will the evolution of the situation in Spain have on Europe and the world? What important lessons and experiences does the Spanish issue offer to those seeking peace and freedom in the world and in China?

First, we know that the "civil war" in Spain is a war waged by the vast majority of the Spanish people seeking peace and freedom, under the unified leadership of the Republican government of the Popular Front, to resist the Franco rebel army, which is commanded and supplied by German and Italian aggressors, invading the homeland and ravaging their compatriots. Although this war has suffered significant setbacks, and even so-called "peace" negotiations have made "progress" or even achieved "success," due to the frantic attacks of the German and Italian fascist aggressors and the single-minded oppression of the British and French rulers, under the rule of Franco, who is controlled by the German and Italian fascist aggressors, and with the implementation of a thorough policy of compromise by the British and French rulers, the "success" of "peace" will not only fail to bring the Spanish people the true peace, democracy, and freedom they seek, but will also intensify internal autocratic oppression and foreign division and plunder. Therefore, the war in Spain is bound to become more intense in another form.

Second, we know that, regardless of foreign pressure and the collusion and coercion of domestic traitors, the vast majority of the Spanish people who demand true peace, democracy, and freedom, especially those with the experience and lessons of more than thirty months of heroic struggle, will continue to advance a more heroic, resolute, and powerful struggle. This struggle will develop widely in various regions, and they will severely strike at the "development" work of the Franco reactionary regime and any foreign aggressive forces. They will also seriously and practically advance the Popular Front and the anti-fascist, anti-aggression united front, and they will establish their own organs of power of the people in various occupied areas to lead them in their struggle for true peace and freedom. After more than thirty months of fighting, the national economy, agricultural, and industrial production in Spain have undergone tremendous changes. The revolutionary parties and the Popular Front, which correctly, enthusiastically, and heroically lead the revolution, have learned richer and more reliable winning strategies and tactics in the war, and their influence and power are beginning to develop. Moreover, today, the Republican government still controls one-quarter of the central region, with nine important provincial capitals, and more than 500,000 heroic and well-trained troops, and in cities such as Madrid and Valencia, there are arsenals sufficient to supply themselves. Therefore, we can still assert that the Spanish war has not stopped, and an even greater struggle is yet to come!

Third, although the mediation of the Spanish war has reached the stage of "success," and so-called "peace" conferences, even if they make progress under external pressure, none of these can curb the further dangerous ambitions of the Italian and German fascist aggressors in Spain and Europe. Britain and France will certainly not be able to obtain temporary peace in Europe from concessions in Spain. In fact, once Franco's rule in Spain is realized, the fascist countries will gain a great advantage in Western Europe. France is already surrounded on three sides, and the threat to Britain's maritime lifeline is becoming increasingly serious. The fascist countries, which now tout anti-communism, have begun the process of changing the map of the world. With British routes in the Atlantic and Gibraltar controlled, the British and French colonies in North Africa are successively included in the first step of the plundering plan. In addition, Germany is actively preparing to invade Southeast Europe, and Japan has taken the opportunity to strengthen its control over southern China and implement the occupation of Hainan Island, threatening all the colonies of Britain and France in the Far East. "Appeasement and bribery will never buy peace," and here is another fresh example.

Fourth, the drastic changes in the Spanish situation have, of course, already been and will continue to teach the people of Spain, Britain, and France, and their struggle against fascist aggression and compromise will be actively developed under the correct and unified leadership of revolutionary parties. At the same time, the facts of blood and tears in Spain further teach every Chinese soldier seeking liberation to maintain a high degree of vigilance against all internal tendencies to waver, compromise, seek peace, and surrender, and to expand the pursuit of all international sympathy and assistance based on the principle of self-reliance, especially to consolidate, develop, and protect our country's connection with the Soviet Union, the cornerstone of peace, with the greatest strength. As for those traitors who attempt to exploit the Spanish situation and undermine our country's war of resistance with heretical arguments such as "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are not reliable" and "China's anti-communism and pro-Japan stance is the right path," we should use the fact of "internal unity and adherence to resistance" to break this new conspiracy.

### A Week in World Trends

— Pan Lang

From March 4th to 10th

March is a vibrant season, and the first week of March has already passed in vibrancy. In this extraordinarily turbulent world, we clearly see the clash of two major tides. On one hand, there is the fascist aggression front, led by Japan, Germany, and Italy, which, under the compromise and concession policies of rulers in certain capitalist countries, is even more frantically fueling the flames of war. Japan is launching even more rampant offensives towards China and the South China Sea, Germany towards Southeast Europe, and Italy towards North Africa. On the other hand, there is the democratic peace front. Although the rulers of a few countries continue to compromise and concede to the aggressors, the broad masses are striving for the consolidation and development of the democratic peace front. The progress in Britain is quite astonishing. And the Soviet Union is holding the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, unleashing an even more irresistible anti-fascist and anti-aggression force that will spread throughout the world. To develop this force with greater effort is the common task of all the oppressed masses and people of peace and justice today.

A Week of the War of Resistance Against Japan

The Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan, striving for independence and freedom and resisting fascist aggression, has persisted for a full twenty months. The situation in the last four months has appeared relatively stable, marking the characteristic of the war of resistance transitioning from a stage of [Japanese] superiority and our inferiority to the second stage of [Japanese] and us in stalemate. However, our military progress has not yet reached the necessary level, and the weakening and striking of [Japanese] combat power has not reached a fatal degree. The transformation of the situation of [Japanese] superiority and our inferiority is only beginning, so the [Japanese] still retain the power to continue their offensive. At the same time, because the front lines are becoming longer and the war zones are expanding, the [Japanese], although they have the power to continue their offensive, are facing enormous resistance due to insufficient and dispersed troop strength. We must target this situation, increase its difficulties, and weaken its strength. This week, the [Japanese], in order to boost their exhausted morale and strengthen their control of the occupied areas, and also attempting to recklessly continue their advance, adopted an active offensive on all fronts, especially in central Hubei Province, launching large-scale westward offensives along the Jing(shan)-Zhong(xiang) Road and the Han(kou)-Yi(chang) Road, while also frantically bombing Yichang, Xiangyang, and Fancheng. Because our front lines were consolidated and we quickly launched counteroffensives against the flanks and rear of the [Japanese] army, the [Japanese] were unable to cross the Han River and Xiang River. By March 10th, the situation in central Hubei had returned to stability. In South China, although the [Japanese] continued to reinforce, attempting to invade the Nanlu area via Beihai and spy on Guangxi and Yunnan, our proper response has prevented the [Japanese] from making any progress.

Great Victory for Our Army on the Northern Front

In North China, because our armies and parties and the people correctly implement the united front's program of resistance against Japan, they are launching counteroffensives everywhere against the flanks and rear of the [Japanese] army, containing and weakening the [Japanese] army, and instigating the mutiny and surrender of the [Japanese] army and puppet troops. The overall situation of the war of resistance in Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces is showing increasing signs of victory. According to reports from our military authorities, in the second half of February, our army actively engaged in operations in various locations, fighting 404 times, capturing more than 2,000 rifles, and killing 21,385 [Japanese] soldiers. In Shanxi, there were 203 battles, killing 723 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 564 [Japanese] officers and soldiers. In Henan, there were 46 battles, killing 2,020 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 5 [Japanese] soldiers. In Hebei, Chahar, Jiangsu, and Shandong, there were 75 battles, killing 3,490 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 109 [Japanese] officers and soldiers. In Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, there were 56 battles, killing 1,875 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 28 [Japanese] officers and soldiers. Furthermore, according to a Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 2nd, in the two months of December of last year and January of this year, the Eighth Route Army fought 256 times against the Japanese and puppet troops, killing 10,000 Japanese and puppet troops and capturing 1,600 puppet troops alive. In December, there were 109 fierce battles, killing 3,743 Japanese and puppet troops, capturing 555 Japanese soldiers and 882 puppet troops alive, seizing 1,234 horses and 1,743 rifles. The total number of deaths and injuries in the Eighth Route Army was 1,554, and 40 rifles were lost. In January, there were 154 fierce battles, killing 7,010 Japanese and puppet troops, capturing 31 Japanese soldiers and 157 puppet troops alive, seizing 957 rifles, and 2,713 puppet troops surrendered to the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army suffered 417 casualties, of which 1,503 died from poisoning, and 38 rifles were lost. The [Japanese] army is currently preparing to launch a "mopping-up" operation in North China with 18 divisions, including 5 divisions in northern Jiangsu, 3.5 divisions in the Pinghan Railway area, 1.5 divisions in the Daoqing Railway area, 6.5 divisions in Shanxi Province, and 1.5 divisions in Suiyuan and Shaanxi. The Jin-[Japanese] have already launched a three-pronged invasion of Yueyang. This is something we cannot ignore.

New Stage of Women's Liberation

March 8th, International Women's Day, was warmly commemorated by women across the country. Currently, for Chinese women to seek liberation, they must first ardently support and participate in the struggle for resistance against Japan and national reconstruction to achieve national liberation. The liberation of the Chinese nation must also be achieved with the participation of more than 200 million women nationwide in order to achieve final success. Moreover, China is already the China of the world. The liberation of Chinese women and national liberation are also closely related to the liberation of the world's people and oppressed masses. Therefore, we must also consolidate and develop the world's women's united front against fascism and aggression in order to strive for final victory. Women leaders such as Soong Ching-ling, Soong Mei-ling, and He Xiangning have all published insightful articles or speeches on the new tasks of the new stage of the women's movement. The commemoration of March 8th by the women's circles in Hong Kong was particularly enthusiastic, especially the unanimous passage of the resolution to organize the Women's National Salvation United Association, establish a united front for the women's liberation movement, and work hard for resistance and refugee relief. This is such an exciting thing! On the same day, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article praising Chinese women, saying: "Since the start of the Japanese invasion, Chinese women have been most active in fighting for the freedom of their motherland. On the front lines and in the rear, Chinese women can be seen jointly defending their country with their brothers and husbands and resisting the Japanese. The heroic acts of Chinese women have made a glorious contribution to the history of China's national liberation war." It is hoped that every female compatriot will repay the expectations of international friends with even more heroic struggles and, moreover, be especially prepared in the struggle to overcome the even more dangerous future environment and intensify self-education work to cultivate new work cadres.

National Education Conference Concludes

The National Education Conference opened on March 1st, held ten plenary sessions, and concluded successfully on the 9th. The conference discussed more than 300 proposals and received more than 100 suggestions from outside the conference. The first achievement of this conference was the passage of a temporary motion, making President Chiang Kai-shek's address to this conference on March 4th the highest guiding principle for our education in the future. President Chiang's address explained the implementation of educational policies for resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, making the revolutionary Three People's Principles the highest standard for education nationwide and making education serve the unity of the whole country for a sustained war of resistance. This is precisely what all sectors have long hoped for, and the national education sector must make special efforts to follow it in the future. Second, the discussions and declarations of this conference also fully demonstrate that education will serve the resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. For example, in primary school education, attention is paid to the implementation of labor disciplines; in normal school education, attention is paid to student internships; in higher education, physical education is implemented; and efforts are made to make military training universal. These are all major improvements in education in the future. What is particularly commendable is that the declaration clearly states: "We plan to enrich social education facilities and design adult literacy education and electrical education. We want to improve and strengthen the education of overseas Chinese. We want to care for the youth in areas occupied by the [Japanese] and in the rear of the [Japanese], and the compatriots who generally want to receive national education in our war zones. We have a plan and will definitely promote it actively." Yes, it must be actively promoted! Especially the popularization of compulsory education and the cultivation of a large number of anti-Japanese cadres.

New Sino-British Loan Established

The new British loan of 5 million pounds to China was announced by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon in the House of Commons on March 8th. We should recognize that, first, why is Britain able to lend to us? The reasons are: (1) Japan announced that it would control foreign exchange in North China from March 10th and prohibit the use of legal tender, which greatly damaged British investment markets in China, and the Japanese aggressive forces are increasingly developing, threatening British interests in China and the entire Far East. Therefore, it used loans to China as the first step in economic retaliation; (2) The Chinese government, army, and people have bravely resisted Japan for 20 months, the country is united, political progress is being made, and the future is infinitely hopeful. This makes Britain realize that only by actively assisting China can it safeguard its rights and interests; (3) The entire British people, especially those with investment relations in the Far East in industry and commerce, in view of the British government's non-intervention regarding Spain, unanimously opposed it. In order to prevent such actions from appearing in the Far East, anti-fascist, anti-aggression, and aid-China and anti-Japanese movements in various places are like raging waves, forcing the British government to take active steps. Second, what impact will the establishment of the new loan have? There are some: (1) Our country's monetary system will be more stable, and the future of the war of resistance will be more hopeful; (2) British financial, industrial, and commercial enterprises will receive considerable and significant benefits; (3) Japan's new adventurous plans in the Far East will suffer the first major blow; (4) Soviet assistance to China will be greatly facilitated; (5) The aid-China movements in the United States and France may become more active. However, we must still pay attention to: (1) A loan of 5 million is like a drop in the bucket. We must further launch greater British assistance and concerted action by democratic and peaceful countries; (2) The [Japanese]'s efforts to divide and instigate, as well as the rumors that Britain will force mediation of the Sino-Japanese war, and other conspiracies, will inevitably develop accordingly and must be combated urgently; (3) We can only strive for foreign aid under the principle of self-reliance, rather than rely on foreign aid. Self-reliance starts with the mobilization of the national dynamic forces, and striving for greater foreign aid starts with the persistence of national unity and a long-term war of resistance!

Anti-War Tide Spreads in Japan

In contrast to our country's internal political progress and abundant foreign aid, Japan is increasingly trapped in diplomatic isolation and internal chaos. In particular, the impact of the prolonged war has revealed major crises in the domestic financial and economic situation, and the people's lives are becoming increasingly desperate. As a result, the anti-war tide in the country and in the army in China is showing an increasing momentum. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 2nd (from the Central News Agency, same below), "Anti-war sentiment in [Japanese] has spread throughout the country. On the 17th of last month, riots broke out in Kanto Southern Town and Ohtsubo due to intense conscription. Villagers gathered and set fires everywhere, destroying more than 300 households. It was only quelled after a large number of military police suppressed them." Another dispatch from Military Celebration on the 3rd stated, "A foreign dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese anti-war organizations are expanding, and military and police agencies are making every effort to search for them. Their secret activities have become more active. On the 1st of this month, a gunpowder depot in Osaka suddenly exploded. At that time, the fire spread fiercely, and most of the nearby barracks and houses were destroyed. The number of dead, injured, and displaced people was about 20,000 or more, and more than 10,000 military police went to guard and rescue them. After a large number of personnel were dispatched by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for investigation, it was learned that it was caused by arson by anti-war groups." Another Chongqing dispatch on the 7th stated: "A dispatch from Shanghai: Since the [Japanese] army department's [Japanese] army in China has repeatedly experienced internal disputes and anti-war incidents, a large number of personnel have recently been dispatched to various places for supervision. [Japanese] army supervisors Shiraki and Soda in South China arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is said that since landing at Daya Bay until the end of December, there were a total of 27 disputes and anti-war incidents in the [Japanese] army in South China." Also, a dispatch from Tianjin on the 9th stated that at the end of last month, Tianjin military police openly distributed anti-aggression speeches, and six people were shot on the 1st of this month. Statistics show that the military force used by Japan to invade China has accounted for more than 85% of the country's military force, deaths and injuries have reached 700,000, and the war expenses used are about 10 million yen per day. The war expenses for 20 months are approximately equal to all of Japan's property. Now that domestic production has declined, foreign trade has shrunk, military expenses have increased, and the anti-war tide has expanded, it is no wonder.

Exposure of Peace Conspiracy

The voices of "peace" and "mediating the Sino-Japanese War" seem to have risen again these days, and it is obviously the [Japanese] and traitors who are behind it. In fact, we are not opposed to peace. No, all Chinese people sincerely hope for the realization of peace and the coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan. However, since the September 18th Incident, the [Japanese] have attacked our entire nation, revealing their entire pre-determined plan to destroy our nation and conquer the Pacific. Our leader, President Chiang Kai-shek, in view of the fact that compromise, concession, and endurance have reached the final juncture, led the national resistance. Because only resistance can win peace. However, after the launch of the war of resistance, if the [Japanese] have not suffered a fatal blow, have not abandoned their aggressive policies, and have not withdrawn all their troops, then any compromise halfway through is the surrender of our entire nation. But what is the basis for those who are now talking about peace? First, let's look at Japan! On March 8th, a question was raised in the House of Representatives regarding the issue of stationing troops in China. Tsutsumi Yasujiro asked: "Is the scope of troop stationing long-term and quite extensive?" Army Minister Itagaki replied, "Of course, it will be long-term, as has been said repeatedly. The issue of territory must be determined based on the situation at that time." Itagaki also stated: "Maintaining law and order in the occupied areas is the top priority, but Japan's military strength is limited. It is extremely difficult to fully deploy Japanese troops everywhere. Therefore, we have long considered using Chinese troops to help them oppress us." He also stated, "Raise funds locally, use Chinese people to extract Chinese resources, and use Chinese resources to support the Japanese army." However, pro-Japanese traitors say that "Japan is prepared to withdraw its troops and negotiate peace with us"! Moreover, in reality, Japan is intensifying its military operations to attack the Southwest, launching a three-pronged invasion of the Northwest, attacking western Hubei, and frantically bombing Xiangfan and Yichang. A large-scale offensive is being launched. Where is the "peace"? Second, let's look at our country. Heroic bloody battles have been fought for 20 months, and the sacrifices cannot be made in vain. How can the great achievements in the war of resistance be abandoned? Now, apart from a few national traitors who have been expelled but still advocate peace and pro-Japanese policies, from the highest leader, military and political officials, all armies, all parties, all people, and all sectors of society, there is actually no one who willingly becomes a slave and advocates peace and surrender to Japan. Third, internationally, the Soviet Union has already provided and is continuing to provide us with great spiritual and military assistance. Britain has repeatedly loaned large sums of money to us, and the United States and France are also doing the same. It can be seen that the international community has also deeply recognized that China's war of resistance is not only for self-liberation but also to maintain world peace. To preserve their interests in the Far East and world peace, all countries have no choice but to support China's war of resistance to the end. From this, it can be seen that at this time when the situation of [Japanese] superiority and our inferiority is undergoing drastic changes, the [Japanese]'s propaganda of "peace" is actually aimed at relaxing our war of resistance, concealing its new offensive, and facilitating its rapid subjugation of our country! And pro-Japanese [women] are actually helping the [Japanese] to carry out their schemes, advocating "actively seeking peace" and "saving the country by opposing communism and being pro-Japanese," and selectively quoting statements from a small number of political figures and newspapers, spreading rumors and attempting to undermine our united front against Japan and undermine the credibility of our government among the people and internationally in order to help the [Japanese]'s new offensive. We must be especially vigilant!

Future of the Spanish War

After the British and French governments recognized the Spanish rebel Franco's government, the armies and people of the Spanish Democratic Republic have suffered even greater oppression and difficulties, which we cannot ignore. However, recently, British and French news agencies, based on telegrams issued by the Spanish rebels, have repeatedly stated that "the Spanish Republican Army is preparing to surrender" and that "peace negotiations are underway," believing that the Spanish war situation is about to end. But in fact, (1) the resistance of the Spanish people under the leadership of the Republican government is against the fascist rebels directed by foreign aggressors and seeks the freedom of the entire nation and people. Even if the rebels currently have an advantage, if the people do not have freedom, the war of resistance will never stop; (2) although the Republican Army is extremely difficult, it still has a basis for resistance. The main thing is that it possesses a central area accounting for a quarter of the country, more than 9 million loyal people, 500,000 elite troops, revolutionary parties, and the leadership of the People's Front with more than 30 months of struggle experience; (3) international sympathy and assistance continue to be enthusiastic, especially the Soviet Union, which has, is now, and will continue to overcome greater difficulties to provide the Spanish people with all kinds of assistance. We should understand that the struggle of all the Spanish people today is on the one hand, a struggle against domestic reactionaries, defending democracy and freedom, and striving for social liberation, and on the other hand, resisting German and Italian aggressors, striving for national liberation, and defending European and world peace. We not only cannot ignore its significance in assisting our country's war of resistance but must also provide it with spiritual and material support!

(Please refer to today's editorial in this newspaper.)

Soviet All-Union Communist Party Congress

The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was opened in Moscow on March 10th. At a time when the whole world is trapped in the flames of a war of re-division of the world launched by the fascists, and the democratic and peaceful countries are terrified and shocked, the plenary session of the only leading party in this country, which is regarded as the "mainstay of world peace," naturally easily attracts special attention from all sides. A Haipeng News Agency dispatch from Moscow on the 9th even reported that "The Executive Committee of the All-Union Communist Party is scheduled to hold a special meeting on the 15th of this month, at which it will discuss general world political issues, with special emphasis on the current situation in Europe. It is widely believed that the Spanish issue will be the focus of discussion." In this area where news about the Soviet Union is particularly unavailable, it is naturally impossible to speculate. In fact, the focus of discussion at this All-Union Communist Party Congress is on domestic issues. The main agenda items are the third five-year plan for developing the Soviet national economy and the revision of the All-Union Communist Party Constitution. The former seeks to improve the economic and cultural development of the Soviet state and people, so that it can move from a socialist society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to a communist society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." The latter seeks to grant workers, peasants, and intellectuals broad and equal democratic rights based on the new socialist constitution. Both of these will simultaneously increase the strength of the Soviet people and the country, so that it can be unafraid of the encirclement and attack of new fascist aggressors. As for foreign affairs, the principles of "not threatening others and not being threatened by others" and "maintaining world peace and supporting national independence" will not change. Assistance to the struggle for the independence and liberation of the people and world peace will remain unchanged in the past, present, and future, and will be the same for Spain and China. Although there will be differences in the implementation steps due to various special conditions.

Japan Yields to Soviet Union Again

The [Japanese]-Soviet fishing zone dispute can be said to have reached its peak this week, because the old fishing agreement has expired, and the Soviet Union scheduled to auction off fishing grounds on March 15th. Japan stated: Because the Soviet Union did not agree to open up the fishing zones, it would use armed force to protect fishermen fishing in the Soviet fishing zones. The Soviet Union stated: If the [Japanese] side violates the agreement and enters the Soviet fishing zones, the Soviet Union, for the dignity of the treaty's sovereignty, will definitely punish it. According to telegrams these days, the Soviet Union is actively strengthening its Far East army's defense capabilities and adding two new cutting-edge warships to reinforce Vladivostok, expressing its determination to use armed force to protect fishing. Although Japan has been reckless in the past, saying things like "not hesitating to fight the Soviet Union," its purpose was originally to create a "national crisis" to ease domestic anti-war sentiment, intensify the exploitation of the people's blood and sweat to help its military operations against China, and also attempt to divert international attention and smoothly implement its southwestern strategy and threaten the southward policies of Britain and France. Moreover, since the defeat at Zhanggufeng, it has long tasted the taste of the Red Army's iron fist! How dare it directly attack the Soviet Union at this time! Now the [Japanese] have automatically lost heart to the Soviet Union. The Japanese Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, Navy Minister, and Finance Minister decided at a meeting on the 7th to ease tensions with the Soviet Union and announced that Japan would not give up negotiations and would negotiate until the last minute. It automatically cancelled the previous declaration to use armed force to protect fishing before March 15th. From this, we can see the [Japanese]'s embarrassment, and at the same time, we can see the [Japanese]'s determination to focus on attacking China and the Southwest today! This is something we cannot fail to be vigilant about.

### Communications from Guerrilla Areas: War Opportunities in Pudong are Imminent; [Japanese] Army Fortifications in Xinchang are Completely Destroyed; Various Guerrilla Detachments Have Successfully Contacted Each Other

[Shanghai Communication] After suffering repeated defeats, the [Japanese] army in Pudong has dispatched two or three planes from time to time to fly for intimidation and reconnaissance, especially after the tragic defeat in the Battle of Xinchang Town on the sixth day of the first lunar month. The guerrillas also suffered casualties. Although the Japanese army stubbornly resisted on the Wang surname watchtower and set up an electric fence, it was finally destroyed by the guerrillas. Afterwards, the Japanese army targeted Datuan Town in Nanhui County. The various battalion commanders of the guerrillas are now planning to fully drive out the remaining Japanese troops who invaded the border of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties. However, at the time of the general offensive, the Japanese army, after being defeated, will obviously resort to unscrupulous means to poison the rear, and even harm non-combatant people on the pretext of the county government's relationship. Therefore, it was decided to move the Nanhui County Government to an unknown place that outsiders cannot reach. The various departments have been completely moved the day before yesterday, and the Chuansha County Government has also moved away from Heqing Town, so that the traitors cannot guide and the Japanese aircraft cannot use their tricks. It is now heard that the guerrilla contact has been successful in the Pudong area, and the great war will obviously begin at the edge of the Lunar New Year festival.

Sudden Tension on the Shangnan Line

The situation is tense in the area along the Shangnan Railway in Pudong. The [Japanese] army is frequently mobilized. In the past few days, several batches of troops have been dispatched, about three or four hundred people, most of whom were transferred to the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to fight, and a few were added to the defense of the western suburbs, so the defense is empty. At about 4 pm the day before yesterday, more than 100 army troops were transferred back from the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, landed at Nanmatou, and rushed to Zhoupu Town, the end point of Shangpulu, to station. When the Japanese troops landed, the area around Nanmatou was temporarily under martial law for half an hour. It is also learned that the Shangnan Railway was secretly sabotaged by the Chinese army, and the tracks were only repaired until the afternoon of the 28th. The Shangnan passenger car has resumed traffic the day before yesterday, but the [Japanese] army is searching civilian houses in groups in the Dongsanlintang area, among which there are puppet cars, which are extremely disturbing to the local villagers.

Guerrillas Hold Important Meeting

After the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in Pudong were controlled by our guerrillas, the Japanese puppet forces could no longer operate. They are building fortresses at key locations, stationing troops to guard them, in order to prevent our guerrillas from attacking. In order to coordinate the second phase of the War of Resistance, our guerrillas lurking in various places held an important meeting at the Tai-Japanese Overseas Chinese Association in Fengxian County last month. The leaders of the various guerrillas who participated this time included Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, Yu Taosheng, Kuang Xingyan, Zhang Huifang, and Zhang Miaogen, dozens of people. Decisions were made on several major issues, including: 1. Organizing the Fengxian, Nanhui, Minghang, Shanghai, Jinshan, Qingpu, Baoshan, Jiading eight county guerrillas' general headquarters, with Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, and Gan Taosheng serving as the general and deputy commanders; 2. Assembling the troops and scheduling the general attack on the Japanese army on a set date; 3. Organizing a public intelligence team to penetrate the [Japanese] army's defense area and investigate the movements of the Japanese army; 4. Mobilizing the people of the eight counties to use local armed forces to protect the land of China; 5. Abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies to ease the difficulties of merchants; 6. Organizing a mobile troupe to perform anti-Japanese dramas; 7. Requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to select capable personnel to go to the countryside to organize county governments, etc., seven items. The leaders of the various guerrillas have all returned to their defense areas after the meeting.

### Fierce Battles on All Fronts in Western Shanxi; Our Commando Units Achieve Successive Victories; Yellow River Flooding Prevents Concerns About River Defense

[Reuters, Chongqing, 10th] Reports from Chinese sources in Shanxi state that the Yellow River bordering Shanxi and Shaanxi is experiencing strong currents and high water levels, making it difficult for Japanese troops to cross. The report mentions that Japanese troops stationed in the Longmen Mountains southwest of the province attempted to cross the river on the 5th, but failed due to thin ice that could not withstand their passage.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 8th] The Japanese troops besieging Jingle numbered over 10,000. The Japanese troops north of Lishi numbered over 2,000.

### British New Loan to China Sparks Panic in Japanese Authorities; Cabinet, Foreign Ministry, and Parliament Hold Emergency Meetings; Craigie Visits Sawada to Explain Loan Motives

[Central News Agency, Dianqing, 9th] Tokyo News: According to well-informed sources, Japan is about to lodge a protest with the British government regarding the British loan to China, which they suspect is intended to strengthen its exchange equalization fund. As a retaliatory measure, Japan will strengthen its monetary policy towards China and southern China. It is reported that British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, assured Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sawada, that the motivation for the loan was economic and not political. However, the Japanese side expressed considerable doubt about Craigie's words.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] Asahi Shimbun reported today that after British Ambassador Craigie explained the British loan to China to the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. It was immediately decided to issue a warning to Britain.

### Japanese Currency Policy Fails in North China; North China Public Maintains Strong Faith in Legal Tender (Part 1); Confession of Japanese National Mitsudo Chuzo

The March issue of "Modern Japan" published an article by Mitsudo Chuzo discussing the currency situation in the Japanese-occupied areas of our country and Japan's currency operations. The article provides startling information, such as that, with the exception of a small amount of 13 million yuan, the counterfeit banknotes issued in Beiping that circulated in North China were used to pay for Japanese military expenses, rather than being issued solely to recover Chinese legal tender. The article also states that Japanese "military scrip" was also used to pay for military expenses and to exchange for legal tender, and then to use the legal tender to purchase Chinese goods that could not be obtained with Japanese currency or counterfeit currency. Mitsudo clearly stated that the counterfeit currency was not worth the officially set price (i.e., one shilling and two pence, the same as the Japanese yen). Mitsudo's article clearly shows that he believes that the Japanese currency experiment in North China has completely failed. Later, he confirmed the stability of our country's legal tender and the trust of the North China public in legal tender. His arguments are worth considering. The following is a section-by-section translation of the article:

Beginning of the War

No one expected its scale to develop to the enormous scale it is now, so it was decided to use banknotes from the Yokohama Specie Bank to pay for military expenses. However, the expansion of the war zone was unexpected, making it impossible to continue to use these banknotes. Otherwise, Japanese banknotes would bear an unwanted heavy burden, as will be described below. This situation led to the establishment of a new bank to issue banknotes in North China. Initially, it was planned to organize a new bank with the Hebei Provincial Bank as its core, but it was immediately recognized that these compensatory plans were all inappropriate. The first step was to adjust the banknotes previously issued by various banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Jidong Bank, in order to place the monetary system on a solid and unified foundation. Thus, the proposed

Issuance of Banknotes

The bank was established, named the "North China United Reserve Bank," with an approved capital of 50 million Japanese yen. Half of the capital was fully paid, with 12.5 million yuan paid by the "Provisional Government." The Chinese banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank, the Jidong Bank, the Jianye Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, contributed 12.5 million yuan, and Japanese banks also provided credit loans of 100 million Japanese yen. The new bank's resources were greatly enhanced, but the silver held by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications as reserves for the new bank was stored in the British and French concessions. The two concessions refused to hand it over, which caused difficulties. This silver accounted for a portion of the "United Reserve Bank's" 58 million yuan silver reserve.

Silver Shelved

Because the silver was intended to be used as the largest support for the United Reserve Bank, its seizure hindered the smooth circulation of United Reserve banknotes. One obstacle the bank faced was the inability to freely sell foreign exchange, because the United Reserve Bank still did not have sufficient foreign currency deposits. Its banknotes were now on par with Japanese banknotes. In order to make its banknotes the only banknotes circulating in its jurisdiction, the "North China Provisional Government" decided to withdraw the old currencies issued by the various North China banks that had branches in Beiping and Tianjin. Within a one-year period starting on March 10, 1938, old currencies could be exchanged for United Reserve banknotes at par. Banknotes issued by Chinese banks with headquarters in Shanghai were

Prohibited from Circulation

It is estimated that there were 430 to 450 million yuan of old currency circulating in North China, most of which were banknotes from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. In the nine months from March 10, 1937, the United Reserve Bank had recovered no more than 13 million yuan of old currency. The circulation of United Reserve banknotes was approximately 150 million yuan, most of which was issued to pay for military expenses. The United Reserve Bank followed the example of the Central Bank of Manchuria and adopted the method of the Central Bank to solve the same problem of dealing with old currency. When the Central Bank was established, there were approximately 140 million yuan of old currency circulating in Manchuria, 99% of which were

Recovered Within Two and a Half Years

However, the situation in North China was very different from the situation in Manchuria when the Central Bank was established. The existence of foreign concessions was the biggest obstacle, because foreign banks not only did not cooperate with the work of the United Reserve Bank, but also hindered it. The North China public trusted old currency more than new currency. Because the old currency in Manchuria was low in value and lacked credibility, the Central Bank of Manchuria was able to sell foreign exchange on demand at the beginning of its operation, while the United Reserve Bank could not do so. Another important obstacle was the business situation, because North China, unlike Manchuria, had a large trade surplus, except for trade with Mongolia and Tibet. All of these situations

Made it Difficult to Obtain Foreign Currency

The progress was very slow. United Reserve banknotes, although not worth one shilling and two pence, were on par with Japanese banknotes. Because of this fact, the situation continued to worsen. Merchants were soon encouraged to buy United Reserve banknotes with old currency and to use United Reserve banknotes to pay for imported Japanese goods. This method ultimately sacrificed Japanese banknotes and caused equal losses to Japanese banks. The fact that foreign banks refused to recognize the new currency further hindered the United Reserve Bank's foreign exchange situation. According to what I have heard, the intention of foreign banks seems to be that they cannot accept inconvertible currency.

### Tense Situation in Tianjin; British and American Navies on High Alert; Japanese Build Wooden Bridge to Cut Off Concession Traffic

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 10th] The British Navy patrolled the Bund outside the British Concession all day today. Although the British Navy was not on special alert, it canceled tonight's regular leave for the troops. At the same time, the British and French consuls jointly issued a statement saying, "Due to environmental needs, the area for inspecting pedestrians has been expanded." However, the nature of this move was not specified.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 10th] The Japanese army has recently built a wooden bridge on the river bordering the Italian and Japanese concessions. It is said to be very strong and can be used for the passage of trucks and armored vehicles. It is rumored that this facility was approved by Rome in advance. At the same time, due to the Japanese army's transportation of a large number of bridge-building materials, it is rumored again that the Japanese army will build another bridge connecting the old German and Russian concessions, thereby cutting off traffic to the British and French concessions.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tianjin Foreign News: The British Concession authorities published a report in the Tianjin Times today, stating that in order to maintain law and order within the British Concession, the British authorities will adopt certain control measures for the residents of the concession. The French Consul General in Tianjin also issued a similar announcement on the same day. Since last night, British troops have been armed and deployed on various streets in the British Concession, and armed French troops are also patrolling in the French Concession.

### Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Guanzhong; Some Residents of Xi'an Evacuate

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 10th] Because Xi'an is a non-armed defensive city, the Chinese authorities, in view of the Japanese army's continuous devastation in recent days, ordered the evacuation of some residents. Tens of thousands of people have been retreating westward in recent days. At the same time, various government agencies are stepping up air defense equipment.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th] Eighteen Japanese aircraft disturbed various parts of Shaanxi Province in four sorties on the 9th. Eleven aircraft flew to Jian, Siyuan, Jingyang, and Dali to reconnoiter. Seven aircraft arrived in Weinan at 11:35 a.m., wantonly bombing the county seat and Xiguan, dropping more than 50 bombs, killing and injuring more than a dozen people, and destroying more than 40 houses. They also dropped several incendiary bombs in Xiguan, causing fires in three places, resulting in heavy losses for civilians.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 10th] A Japanese military spokesman here said that many Japanese army aircraft bombed Chinese positions along the Longhai Railway on Thursday.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The Japan Times, which is close to the Japanese government, commented on the bombing of highways and other nearby cities between Xi'an and Lanzhou by Japanese Air Force aircraft, saying that the Japanese side will continue to carry out air raids to carry out military attempts to "manage" the northwest and to "control" the entire Longhai Railway.

### American Church in Yichang Bombed; US Consul Protests to Japan

[Reuters, Hankou, 10th] The American Consul General here visited the Japanese Consul this morning to strongly protest the Japanese aircraft's bombing of American church property in Yichang, and stated that in June of last year, the American Consul, at the request of the Japanese, had reported the locations of American properties to the Japanese side, questioning why Japan would deliberately destroy them again.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Hankou Foreign News: The American Consulate in Hankou protested to the Japanese side because the St. 公会 Church was affected when Japanese aircraft bombed Yichang twice on the 8th. According to reports, during the first bombing, four bombs were dropped on the St. 公会 football field, which originally had an American flag. The second time, seven bombs were dropped nearby, completely destroying the Catholic Church adjacent to the St. 公会 Church and three houses next to the church.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 10th] It has been learned that during the recent Japanese bombing of Yichang, seventeen bombs were dropped around an American church in the area, one building was completely destroyed, and three other buildings, including the church, were damaged. All American church personnel were unharmed. At the time, the American flag was hung on the buildings, but the Japanese aircraft ignored it.

[Associated Press, Hankou, 9th] The Japanese army bombed Yichang fiercely on Wednesday, and the American church was also destroyed. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Officials from the American Consulate notified the Japanese side of the location of the American property in July of last year, and a flag 22 feet high was hung, but the Japanese side ignored it and has now protested to the Japanese side.

### North China Bans Legal Tender; Japanese Have No Remedy in Most Areas

[Reuters, Beiping, 10th] The order of the puppet provisional government prohibiting the people of North China from using Chinese legal tender was originally scheduled to take effect tomorrow, but today the puppet government suddenly announced a change of policy, saying that North China would be divided into two zones. One zone is the "United Reserve Bank Currency Zone," containing eleven cities and towns in Wanlu Jinyu, such as Beixiao, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai. Within this zone, people are not allowed to use Chinese legal tender, and violators will have their money confiscated and fined. The other zone is called the "Bandit Zone," because the puppet government has no ability to interfere in this area.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 10th] The foreign exchange office of the puppet United Reserve Bank has been scheduled to be established separately in Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, with Zheng Ji, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Zhang serving as directors of the three places of Pingjin and Qing. Banknotes from the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Jitong Bank will still be used to purchase foreign exchange, but cannot be circulated in the market. In addition, Fang, the Deputy Minister of Education of the puppet government, is now appointed as Acting Minister of Education.

### Japanese Newspapers Attack Britain

[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] Japanese newspapers today have criticized Britain's loan to China. The newspapers' comments are obviously instructed by the authorities. Hochi Shimbun advocates that the Japanese government should lodge a serious protest against the British side for this "unfriendly action," and at the same time take active countermeasures. If Britain continues to take this "unfriendly action," Japan will take retaliatory actions against British interests in China.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] Nichi Nichi Shimbun said, "Britain's maintenance of Chinese legal tender can be called participation in China's economic guerrilla warfare. Japan is not lacking in countermeasures. For example, the current issue of navigation on the Yangtze River can be delayed indefinitely."

### British Opinion Supports Loans to Aid China; Newspapers Express Satisfaction; Hope for Cooperation Between the US and France

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] London newspapers have published the news of Britain's loan to China to strengthen its exchange equalization fund in a prominent position. The newspapers have unanimously expressed satisfaction with this. Opinion and financial circles here believe that the result of Britain's loan to China will make it impossible for Japan to implement its attempt to prohibit the use of legal tender in North China. The military pay for the Chinese army in North China is directly arranged by the Chinese National Government. Although the region is vast and transportation is difficult, the Chinese government is still able to send military pay to various parts of North China on schedule. Therefore, increasing the exchange equalization fund is also supporting the legal tender in North China on the side. According to authoritative sources, in the past nine months, the use of China's original exchange equalization fund has actually had a surplus, so this new fund should not be regarded as supporting China's monetary system to avoid falling. The authorities notified the major countries before announcing it to the House of Commons. It is reported that in the British note to Japan, the point that Japan recently said "also wants to consolidate China's monetary system" was raised. The Financial Times stated that countries with interests in China should cooperate to avoid the risk of the Chinese trading market losing its current situation. Business circles in the United States and France have also established close contacts with each other. London's business community is paying close attention to all of these points. The Chinese section of the London Chamber of Commerce held a meeting here this Monday, and the Paris Chamber of Commerce also sent representatives to participate. The meeting discussed the issue of mutual protection of their commercial interests. In general, people have expressed support for the proposal to provide financial assistance to the Chinese government to prevent Japanese troops from invading China again.

### Refuting Rumors!

Mr. Wang Jingwei's advocacy of peace talks has long been spurned by the people of the whole country. Besides the Wang faction's mouthpiece, the ×× Daily in Hong Kong, no other newspaper has failed to sternly denounce him. As for Shanghai, it was the Shen Bao that first published the full text of Mr. Wang's original telegram advocating peace and vehemently criticized it. The facts are clear, and it is naturally unacceptable for those who are accustomed to spreading rumors to maliciously slander!

Who would have known that on the eighth and ninth of this month, the ×× Daily would repeatedly spread rumors and falsely accuse the Shanghai Shen Bao of publishing pro-peace remarks, reversing right and wrong, and confusing black and white. It is extremely despicable and utterly shameless! The newspaper falsely claimed that the Shanghai Shen Bao's editorial on March 1st, which reported on Japan's "Kita Peace Plan," was evidence of the Shen Bao advocating for peace. In fact, the article stated: "China's war of resistance will soon reach its twentieth month... and only strives for final victory. With stubborn enemies in front, there is no turning back. Rather endure all hardships than seek temporary peace." Furthermore, it stated: "Therefore, the reporter deeply sighed that Mr. Kita, who is known as an authority among the Japanese 'China experts', his backwardness of thought, his alienation from the Chinese situation, and especially his lack of understanding of the general ideas of the Chinese people in recent years, are so profound. Therefore, it is even more firmly believed that Japan will not repent until it is utterly defeated and falls into an irrecoverable situation. There is no hope for a compromise to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. Therefore, it is even more boldly asserted that China's attainment of final victory through a protracted war of resistance is the most convenient way to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. There is no other shortcut." With such a "categorical" anti-Japanese stance, the ×× Daily actually dared to falsely claim with large headlines that "The Shanghai Shen Bao Published Pro-Peace Remarks," hoping to justify itself by implicating the Shanghai Shen Bao and attempting to deceive the people of the whole country. Therefore, we must directly denounce it as extremely despicable and utterly shameless!

What handle does the ×× Daily think it has on the Shanghai Shen Bao? It's truly laughable! It turns out that the so-called Kita's Peace Plan included a clause stating that "Japan would withdraw its troops from central and southern China but continue to station troops in North China." The Shanghai Shen Bao's March 1st editorial first exposed Kita's "狰狞面目" (狰狞面目 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "ferocious face") and his "ambitions" and "conspiracies." It then took a step back and considered Kita's own position, suggesting that if he wanted to show his sincerity in proposing this condition, he should first implement the troop withdrawal clause before discussing anything else, or else he would not be qualified to propose any conditions. The original text did not contain a single word implying that Japan could station troops in North China after withdrawing its troops from central and southern China. Moreover, any reader who read the entire article would never have doubted that the Shanghai Shen Bao, which strongly advocated for "protracted war of resistance" to seek "final victory," would abandon its established position and echo Mr. Wang Jingwei's fallacious view of allowing Japan to station troops in specific locations in North China. The ×× Daily stubbornly insisted that the Shanghai Shen Bao advocated for conditional peace and falsely claimed that the Shanghai Shen Bao indicated that Japan could station troops in North China. Such despicable tactics are simply "含血喷人" (含血喷人 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "maliciously slandering") and cannot even be described as "断章取义" (断章取义 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "taking things out of context").

As for the ×× Daily's claim that "the chief editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao, Mr. Pan Gongbi, is a special envoy of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai... he has a more substantial background," that is "白日见鬼" (白日见鬼 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "utter nonsense") and "胡说八道" (胡说八道 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "pure fabrication")—the chief editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao is not Mr. Pan Gongbi, and since the Shanghai Shen Bao resumed publication last year, all editorials have been published without the author's signature. The ×× Daily's malicious rumors provide yet another irrefutable proof of its dishonesty!

We know very well that the ridiculous remarks of the ×× Daily have long been despised by readers in Hong Kong. However, this time it dares to "言之凿凿" (言之凿凿 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "make definitive statements") and maliciously slander the Shanghai Shen Bao. Moreover, the original text of the Shanghai Shen Bao's editorial on March 1st may not be available to all readers in Hong Kong. To avoid causing possible misunderstandings among readers, we specially reprint the entire article below on behalf of the Shanghai Shen Bao, so that readers can understand the truth of the matter and prevent the despicable and shameless ×× Daily from using its tricks.

The So-Called Japanese "Kita Peace" Plan

What gives people the strongest stimulation is, in times of peace, nothing is more significant than the bloody sword, and in times of war, nothing is more significant than rumors of peace. This is human nature, which cannot be concealed, and it is also a matter of course, which need not be avoided. China's war of resistance against Japan will soon reach its twentieth month. Although the government and the people are working hard and morale is high, mindful of the survival of the nation, we only strive for final victory. With stubborn enemies in front, there is no turning back. Rather endure all hardships than seek temporary peace. However, every time we hear about peace talks, we want to investigate their origin, distinguish their truthfulness, examine their content, and study their consequences. This is also a constant human sentiment and a matter of course, because one cannot help oneself. For example, the Chongqing telegram of the Associated Press reported the other day, and the London telegram of the German Hai Tong News Agency reported yesterday, both concerning peace talks. Regardless of the psychology of the parties involved, it can be asserted that readers will not dismiss them lightly.

The two telegrams differ in their origin and their main points. However, both use the so-called peace plan of Japanese Major General Kita as the only source of information. The Chongqing telegram refutes it, while the British telegram focuses on interpretation. This reporter is ignorant and has not had the opportunity to see the original version of the Kita plan. However, based on the Chongqing and British telegrams, we can get a glimpse of the content of the plan, which has six points: first, Japan expresses respect for the Three Principles of the People as the basis for Sino-Japanese peace; second, the peace process will no longer use the puppet organization in Peiping as a puppet, but China and Japan will conduct face-to-face negotiations; third, the Chinese government after peace will still be called the "Kuomintang Government," with Wang Jingwei as the chairman; fourth, there will be no more "overthrowing" and "toppling" of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but he will be invited to participate in the so-called "Kuomintang Government" and hold prominent positions; fifth, if the National Government agrees to these conditions, Japan will withdraw its troops from central and southern China, but continue to station troops in North China; sixth, Japan will cooperate with foreign countries that mediate peace talks to develop the economy of North China. According to the Chongqing telegram, a certain official in Chongqing denounced the Kita plan's invitation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as an absolute insult and exposed the Japanese people's so-called Kuomintang and so-called Three Principles of the People as another trick to borrow names to deceive people and make the Party and the country exist in name only. Furthermore, it revealed that this is the same as the rumors that have been circulating for months that the Japanese are plotting to organize a so-called "New Kuomintang." Such a view and refutation by a certain official is almost universally felt.

After analyzing the two telegrams, the reporter learned that what Mr. Kita and his like hope for is the above six points. Furthermore, the reporter feels that Mr. Kita's military is more superior to Konoe and those he represents, because Konoe and those he represents are deceiving their own people and numbing themselves, thinking that the military aggression has been quite successful and that China is about to submit. They can use the prestige of a false victory to cover up the situation of impending defeat and expect China to stop resisting and accept the conditions for national subjugation. Mr. Kita's attitude is slightly different. He knows that the war cannot be won and that the Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek are factors for stabilizing China. Therefore, he makes an attempt to steal the sky and replace the sun, thinking that if he slightly modifies his ferocious face, his ambitions may be realized, his conspiracies may be sold, and China may be fooled. However, it is a mistake. Therefore, the reporter deeply sighed that Mr. Kita, who is known as an authority among the Japanese "China experts," his backwardness of thought, his alienation from the Chinese situation, and especially his lack of understanding of the general ideas of the Chinese people in recent years, are so profound. Therefore, it is even more firmly believed that Japan will not repent until it is utterly defeated and falls into an irrecoverable situation. There is no hope for a compromise to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. Therefore, it is even more boldly asserted that China's attainment of final victory through a protracted war of resistance is the most convenient way to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. There is no other shortcut.

In fact, the Kita plan is either harboring malicious intentions and vainly hoping to fool China, or Mr. Kita's understanding is insufficient. Judging from his intentions, he probably thinks that the Chinese people only care about the surface of the Three Principles of the People, the central government, and national sovereignty, and that they can be manipulated and replaced in essence. He probably thinks that the Chinese people only respect Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's position and are not loyal, passionate, supportive, and loving of him as their sole leader. He probably thinks that the people who have been praised by the Chinese people in the past, no matter how confused their recent situation or how wrong their behavior, can still be managed to make the Chinese people blindly praise them again. He probably thinks that the leader who is supported and loved by the Chinese people is interested in money and fame and can be lured by the position of "Eastern goods." If he does not have such an insufficient understanding, how could he have such a plan for the peace he hopes for?

Of course, the Japanese side's ideas cannot be completely the same as China's. Therefore, conditions that are considered unacceptable by the Chinese side may have been presented with sincerity by the Japanese side, who already feels unable to continue the war and unable to win. As for what Mr. Kita said, even if he is said to have insufficient understanding, how can we be sure that he is not very sincere? This is for future determination, but it is not enough to serve as proof. If there is one, it is only to withdraw troops from central and southern China first, then talk about principles, and then talk about conditions.

### British Air Minister Presents Air Force Budget, Twelve Times Higher Than Five Years Ago, London Balloon Network Ready for Completion

[Reuters, London, 9th] British Air Minister Wood, when presenting the £200.5 million Air Force budget in the House of Commons today, used charts to illustrate the progress of the British Air Force, saying that the current number is twelve times higher than any year between 1929 and 1934. This year's Air Force budget has increased by £74 million, which is equivalent to the entire national defense budget of 1913. The largest items are aircraft and balloons, totaling £93 million. Thirty-five Women's Auxiliary Air Force units are being organized. It is expected that the British Air Force plans to add another 20,000 people this year, bringing the total to 102,000. There has been significant progress in the manufacture of engines and the expansion of the balloon obstacle network. Last June, the government recruited 31,600 pilots, reconnaissance personnel, etc., with excellent results. The predetermined number was exceeded last week, and the quality was excellent. Mr. Wood also announced that the above Air Force budget includes the Air Reserve and Supplementary Force. There are currently 33 reserve units in rural areas, and it is planned to establish 20 more next year. The Ministry of Aviation has decided to expand reserve flight training overseas and hopes that branches will also be established in Malaya, Hong Kong, East Africa, etc., so that local citizens can participate in the volunteer reserve force. Mr. Wood then mentioned the balloon obstacle network, saying that this obstacle network is ready in London and can be used when necessary. It is expected that the installation of this obstacle network will be completed throughout the country by the end of this year. There are 1,400 civil aviation personnel with flight licenses, and another 3,800 are in training. He also said that the standard of pilots has been raised. By April 1st of this year, the Imperial Headquarters will have 1,750 first-line aircraft. There are currently 30 air force units stationed overseas, and 7 more are being added according to plan, to reach the number of 500 first-line aircraft overseas. Mr. Wood also mentioned new aircraft, saying that Britain's bombers and fighters are the best in the world. He said, "We have not dared to abandon our traditional concept that counter-attack is the essence of war. A strong offensive is not only the most effective way to stop the opponent's attack, but also an indispensable element of any perfect air defense system. Recent developments have reduced the supreme concept of offense and increased the defensive power of the air force. However, this does not mean that we only rely on warplanes and ground defenses for air defense. There are currently eleven aircraft manufacturing plants proceeding under the 'shelter' plan." Mr. Wood then reported on the progress of the aircraft production organization, saying that he has ordered three or four factories to form a group. The government orders a certain type of aircraft, which is then divided and cooperated by the factories in the group. In this way, large-scale plans and orders can be carried out conveniently. Once a war occurs, the manufacturing plants will not be disrupted, resulting in the inability to manufacture that type of aircraft, and the design of the aircraft can also be reduced. Aircraft production is currently progressing rapidly. Britain's daily aircraft manufacturing reaches £250,000, and this number will increase further. Mr. Wood concluded by saying that last November, he estimated that next year's aircraft production would be four times higher than in 1938. This increase is expected to be achieved by the end of this year.

[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] Germany has a rather critical comment on British Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha's speech yesterday, saying that Germany is less concerned with the achievements of British military expansion and more concerned with the psychology expressed in his speech. Germany has no intention of invading France, and France has no intention of invading Germany, but it is strange that the British Secretary of State for War announced that he was preparing to transfer 19 divisions to France.

### Franco Blockades Haikou: Britain States Its Position, Sends Cruisers to Escort Merchant Ships, Resolves to Resist Interference Beyond Territorial Waters

[Reuter's, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax, in yesterday's House of Lords debate on the Spanish question, explained the British government's attitude towards General Franco's blockade of Haikou. Reportedly, the original text of Franco's announcement of the blockade did not indicate any intention to interfere with ships beyond territorial waters. The British government also believes that Franco has no intention of taking such action. What the Foreign Secretary wants to make clear is that if Franco intends to take any action beyond territorial waters, the British government will be forced to resist such action, as in the past. Furthermore, the government has fully stated that if British merchant ships are sunk by Franco's aircraft within territorial waters, the government will consider it a serious incident, especially if adequate warning is not given beforehand and sufficient steps are not taken to protect the safety of the crew. British warships have received government instructions to provide full protection to merchant ships under attack and to retaliate against submarines that take unjustifiable action.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] According to a British naval radio station in Gibraltar this morning, five British cruisers, ordered to return to the port of Gibraltar after participating in Atlantic naval exercises, arrived on Tuesday evening.

Brief Commentary

### War Clouds Over Southern Guangdong

Recently, the situation in the war of resistance has gradually become tense, especially in central and southern China. However, although the ambitions of the × in central China are great, their strength is insufficient. With our strong military force using new tactics to counterattack, the situation is expected to be safe. In the southern Guangdong area, since the × army invaded Guangzhou and then landed on Hainan Island, the situation has become serious. It has recently been reported that the × army held an important meeting, indicating even greater ambitions for the southwest. In recent days, the × army has concentrated more than 30 warships and transport ships on Hainan Island, while troops have also been concentrated in Hainan and Weizhou, preparing to land on the Leizhou Peninsula. According to a Guangzhou Xunxun report late at night, the × ships are still constantly increasing off the Xuwen coast, and speedboats are sent to carry × soldiers back and forth to reconnoiter, showing signs of attempting to land. Although this action may not be a sign of a large-scale invasion of southern Guangdong and Guangxi, we must be on strict alert. What we should pay particular attention to is that the × are spreading rumors of "peace" at this time, alienating our anti-Japanese unity and weakening our anti-Japanese forces, in an attempt to conceal their new offensive actions. Traitorous newspapers are also exaggerating and confusing people, acting as accomplices for the ×. The press and education circles should first awaken the × hatred of compatriots and give a powerful blow to the ×'s conspiracy.

### Exhibition of Scenic Spots in Occupied Areas

When we read Li Houzhu's poems, such as "The jade railing and carved steps should still be there, but the vermilion faces have changed" and "The old country is unbearable to look back upon in the moonlight," who would not be saddened and tearful? The Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association will hold an "Exhibition of Scenic Spots in Occupied Areas" in Hong Kong starting today, and in Kowloon starting on the 17th. The exhibition includes historical sites in more than a dozen regions in northern, central and Guangzhou China. Compatriots who have fled from the north and south occupied areas to Hong Kong, seeing this news or visiting this exhibition, I wonder what they will feel. Perhaps some will resonate with Li Houzhu! However, at this time! There is no need to groan those "when can I return to my beloved hometown" of depressed and disappointed tone, President Chiang Kai-shek is right: "To be born a slave is worse than death!" We don't have to be attached to a broken homeland! We must not dream of surviving under the iron hooves of the ×! We must revitalize the self-esteem and self-confidence that the Chinese nation should have, strengthen unity, and under the leadership of the central government and the supreme leader, fight back to our old home and complete Yue Fei's unfinished ambition, "Wait until we reorganize the old mountains and rivers", and recover our splendid hometown to create a new China!

### Transformation of International Form

— Uncle

(Special Correspondent of this newspaper in London)

The new international crisis brewing by the world's aggressor nations is gradually showing a tendency to be pushed back head-on. Comparing the situation two months ago with today, the obvious progress is something that anyone can see.

Japan's sudden occupation of Hainan Island at that time, within a day or two, the atmosphere in the UK and France, in fact, showed signs of unusual tension. Many people had doubts: perhaps this is the first powerful step planned by the aggressor nations, then, what follows must be the threatening actions of Germany and Italy. As a result, the issue of recognizing the Spanish rebels immediately showed a sharp turnaround. Many people advocated: Regardless of how Spain's future internal affairs evolve, Britain and France should take the lead and quickly occupy Milia Island to ensure the traffic of Britain and France in the Mediterranean. However, after three to five days, Germany and Italy did not make surprising moves to respond to Japan, so this proposal was abandoned. After another two or three days, everyone had determined that Japan this time was making a profiteering idea of ​​taking advantage of the fire, thinking that the UK and France were trapped by Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean issue and had to submit to it, accepting the blockade of the borders of Myanmar and Annam, and cutting off China's military transport. In fact, this move was not a joint action with Germany and Italy. Instead, it wanted to use its alliance with Germany and Italy to make a thorough betrayal, the price of which was: Britain and France helping it monopolize China or forcing the Chinese government to submit. However, Japan's estimate has completely failed. The evidence is that in the past two or three days, in the week after Japan occupied Hainan Island, the British newspapers suddenly poured out page after page of articles rebuking and warning Japan about this move. Why was everyone silent at the beginning, but now suddenly warning and rebuking Japan for this move? This is worth our attention and reflection!

The reason, of course, lies in the overall international situation. Judging from the speed of military expansion of the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, everyone agrees that as long as another year or two pass, the power of the three countries of Germany, Japan, and Italy will even more fall behind. At that time, the so-called Germany, Japan, and Italy group will fundamentally lose its threatening effect. Then, it may automatically disintegrate and gradually succumb to international justice and fairness. So, if they want to put forward their ambitions to redistribute the world, they can only do it now. Otherwise, the more the days go by, the more渺茫 the chance of realization will be. Taking the UK's situation as an example, roughly two months ago, everyone was worried about the sudden actions of the aggressor nations at any time and any place. In the past month or so, the worries have been decreasing day by day; what has replaced them is guessing: When and in what way will these three countries prepare to put forward their various plans that create international war? Until recently, even this guess is not often heard. Everyone's unanimous belief is that if Britain, the United States, and France always persist in this way, Germany, Japan, and Italy will never have the courage to pose a total threat to world peace.

So, in the end, the only major key lies in whether Britain, France, and the United States can maintain their attitude; and what is especially important is: In the process of being strong, will the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union always stand on the same front facing the threat of Germany, Italy, and Japan? In other words, will they be defeated one by one?

Roughly in early February, a secret military conference was held in Berchtesgaden, Germany. Those who participated were all the major military and political authorities in Germany, discussing Germany's current major policy. The result was still the same as before, and it was divided into two factions. One faction was the so-called "radical", led by Police Chief Himmler, who strongly advocated that Germany should quickly put forward all its demands. Otherwise, it should propose to Britain and France the idea of ​​restricting military expansion. However, the general military personnel present unanimously opposed this countermeasure, because doing so would definitely require a military demonstration first. Otherwise, it would never take effect. If a demonstration is to be made, it must at least wait until the military projects currently being built in Spain are completed. Moreover, in the event that the demonstration is ineffective and a war starts, then Germany, even if united with Japan and Italy, is still not sure of fighting together against Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China. At this point, Ribbentrop, the current Foreign Minister who is famous for being anti-British, put forward a plan: to negotiate with Britain a "non-interference agreement" that Germany and Britain will not participate in the event that a war is caused by the Franco-Italian dispute, on the condition that only recovering the pre-war colonies is regarded as satisfaction. According to him, this move will definitely be welcomed by the British Chamberlain Cabinet; the reason is: (1) Britain's absolutely unwilling mentality to fight, even if France is attacked, as long as it is sure that it will not be affected, will not change; (2) On the issue of colonies, there are many pro-German dignitaries in Britain who agree that the pre-war German colonies taken over by Britain can be returned to it first. He said that this way, France can be isolated and defeated; in that situation, the most important point is that the United States does not get involved. However, this plan was immediately opposed by Goering, thinking it was a fantasy. As a result, it was not passed. However, Germany has recently temporarily bundled aside other urgent issues, and is talking loudly about the return of colonies (in fact, this contradicts her most fundamental plan: the principle of postponing the issue of colonies until the navy has sufficient strength). This point is worth our attention. Hitler has long stated: "Germany will not meet other countries with soldiers for the sake of the colonial issue."

Admittedly, what is worrying is still the wavering nature of the British Chamberlain Cabinet. However, if the US attitude does not change, the Chamberlain Cabinet probably will never go to a major downfall risk and come up with any new tricks. Judging from the current situation, as long as Roosevelt gives a few fierce speeches attacking Chamberlain, it will immediately cause major unrest in British domestic politics. This can be asserted.

What is the US attitude? Everyone knows that there is absolutely no problem; saying that it is unreliable is just an excuse for British Chamberlain and Simon-like figures. Recently, a senior US congressional figure said very interestingly: "If President Roosevelt wants to participate in the war, then most Americans will follow behind him. The reason is: Americans have long hated the fascist Germany, Japan, and Italy, and hope to give them a lesson!" According to him, there are three powerful factions in the United States that hate these three countries: (1) Jews, (2) Catholics, (3) Negroes (ie black people). And recently, a fourth faction has been added; that is: all American capitalists facing the dumping competition of Germany, Japan, and Italy in the world market. (February 17)

### Strengthening Air Defense Capabilities: Hong Kong to Recruit Air Force Volunteers, Prepare to Enlist in Times of Emergency, and Increase Aircraft and Anti-Aircraft Gun Units Stationed in Hong Kong

In order to cope with the treacherous world situation, the British military authorities are implementing military expansion, especially focusing on the expansion of the Air Force, planning to establish 500 air force squadrons overseas to protect British colonies. In the Far East, Singapore and Hong Kong will both significantly increase the air force stationed there. Before 1940, the strength of the Hong Kong Air Force, both in terms of pilots and the number of aircraft, will be greatly expanded in accordance with the planned schedule. In order to adapt to this step, the Hong Kong Air Force authorities are proceeding to recruit Royal Air Force reservists in Hong Kong, and registration will begin during the day. All Hong Kong residents can register to participate. The Hong Kong Army Volunteer Corps currently has a flying squadron, and its pilots are sent by the government to the Far East Flying School at Kai Tak Airport for training. However, the number of people is very small. The Air Force Volunteer Corps currently being planned is different from this organization. At the same time, those who participate in the team must enlist in the event of an emergency. Singapore will also make similar recruitments. The detailed regulations will be promulgated once they are sent by the British government. According to another news report, the British military authorities will increase the number of anti-aircraft gun units stationed in the area, so that the air defense fire net is complete and leaves no room for enemy aircraft to operate. Hong Kong has high mountains of more than 1,800 feet, and the New Territories also has many majestic mountains, making it most suitable for setting up anti-aircraft gun positions. As it stands, the air defense force is quite solid. In the future, after the expansion of the Air Force and the completion of the plan, its power will be even stronger. The Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Air Force is currently stationed in Singapore. In the future, after the completion of the military expansion plan, Hong Kong may need to set up a deputy commander or a higher-level commander. Since the opening of the air defense exhibition, many Chinese and Western people have gone to visit. The exhibition continued to be open for the past two days, and the audience was even more crowded, reaching five or six thousand people every day, showing that Hong Kong people are very interested in air defense work. Air defense expert, Stephen Perkins, has received many letters from residents of Wan Chai, Kowloon, and other places requesting that air defense exhibitions be held in the area. If the environment permits, they will be held in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon in sequence to popularize the public's air defense knowledge. The air defense exhibition is open all day today and will close at noon tomorrow.

### Supply Depends Entirely on Imports: Hong Kong Coal Industry's Pessimistic Future, Supply Cut Off Once War Comes, Over 720,000 Tons Imported Last Year

The Hong Kong Weida Company released its seventh annual report yesterday, which details the situation of the Hong Kong coal industry last year, and is pessimistic about the future of the Hong Kong coal industry, believing that although prices have remained at a high level last year, unless shipping returns to normal, the prospect of large-scale transactions is very slim. Hong Kong is in an unenviable position, as the supply of coal in Hong Kong depends entirely on imports. If war breaks out and the source is cut off, it will be greatly difficult. The problem of coal supply is not only related to shipping, but also worthy of the attention of those who make defense plans. Last year, Hong Kong imported 725,063 tons of coal from various places, worth a total of $13,800,3826. After exporting 56,363 tons, the remaining 668,700 tons were for use in Hong Kong. The largest amount of the above-mentioned imports was from Japan (including Korea and Taiwan), totaling 285,900 tons, worth a total of $5,257,982. The year before was 529,826 tons, worth a total of $7,989,889. Last year, the average price of Japanese coal was $18.90 per ton, while the year before was $15.

### Meningitis Outbreak: Acute Contagion, Alarming Spread; Nearly Seventy Patients Admitted; Medical Director Urges Residents to Take Precautions

Cerebrospinal meningitis (commonly known as meningitis) is an acute infectious disease. Last year, the disease spread considerably in Hong Kong, reaching an intensity unseen in twenty years. Since the beginning of spring this year, the spread has been particularly severe. According to statistics from the health authorities, the number of cases is double that of the same period last year. The increase has been especially pronounced in the past few weeks. Regarding this matter, Hong Kong's Medical Director, Sze-to Wing-kok, yesterday issued a special notice advising residents to take extra precautions. He stated that there are nearly seventy patients currently admitted to the Kennedy Infectious Diseases Hospital. People of all ages are susceptible to infection. According to statistics on patients last year, most were children or adolescents under the age of fifteen, and even infants died from the disease. Despite receiving the most comprehensive medical care, one out of every two patients treated last year died. The transmission of this disease is mostly due to recovered patients or current patients carrying the bacteria in their throats. Those with weak constitutions and poor hygiene are also more likely to contract the disease. In addition, two important factors serve as a medium for the spread of this disease: overcrowded housing and poor ventilation. The symptoms of the disease include headache, fever, stiff neck and back, and vomiting. Children may also experience convulsions or even loss of consciousness or rashes. The most important preventive measure is to ensure good ventilation in one's home.

### Maintaining Trust in Solicitation: Guangdong National Defense Bonds Begin Paying Interest; Guarantee Committee Allocates Sufficient Funds of 600,000 Yuan; Hong Kong Office Notifies Overseas Chinese to Collect

The Hong Kong office of the Guangdong Provincial National Defense Bonds Solicitation Committee recently notified all solicitation team leaders that interest payments on the bonds have begun. They requested that they inform bond purchasers to go to the Hong Kong branch of the Guangdong Bank to collect their interest. The notice stated, "The Guangdong Bank has announced that February 28th of this year is the date for the first interest payment on the Guangdong National Defense Bonds. The Guangdong Provincial National Defense Bonds Fund Management Committee has allocated sufficient national currency of 600,000 yuan to the bank to ensure that interest payments are made on time, thereby maintaining trust in the bonds. To facilitate the collection of interest by bondholders, interest can be collected at the bank and its branch offices at maturity. For interest amounts of 200 yuan or less in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, the local exchange rate can be used to convert and collect the interest in local currency. For amounts exceeding 200 yuan, a head office draft will be issued for payment." Considering that interest payments on the Guangdong National Defense Bonds have begun, this not only maintains trust in previous solicitations but also boosts the morale of the people to save their hometowns in the future. This information should be conveyed to your team leaders, and you are respectfully requested to immediately and effectively notify your members and former solicitors to inform bond purchasers to go to the Hong Kong branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank on Ice House Street to collect their interest.

### The Long-Established and Highly Reputed Purely Practical University: Recent Developments at National Tongji University; New Students to be Enrolled in Hong Kong Today and Tomorrow

No one can deny that all cultural departments should develop equally, and that there should be no discrimination against arts and law subjects. However, no one can deny that promoting practical science education is an urgent need in China today.

From the bloody lessons, we know that we have suffered greatly from eating the "scientific young thorn." There is much that the great cause of "resistance against aggression" and "national construction" depends on science for. The leader also made it clear at this national education conference: "This battle of ours is not only about striving for national survival, but also about transforming our nation and reviving our country during this period. Therefore, our focus in education should not only be on the wartime period, but also on the post-war period. We need to estimate what level our national knowledge and abilities should be raised to in order for our country to become a modern country. To build our country into a modern country, we need tens of thousands of specialized scholars, hundreds of thousands or even millions of technicians and engineers, and millions of teachers and cadres for public training in various departments. These all need to be supplied by our education sector. These problems all need to be solved by our education sector." This clearly illustrates the importance of science education. Moreover, since the outbreak of the war of resistance, we have focused on propaganda and mobilization efforts, while abandoning the promotion and efforts in natural sciences, which are urgently needed for the war of resistance and national construction.

Therefore, we cannot help but place infinite hope on the nationally renowned purely practical university, National Tongji University. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Yongqing, director of the school's Hong Kong office (and also director of the school's advanced vocational department), and learned about the general recent developments of the school. This urgently needs to be reported to readers here, in order to arouse readers' renewed attention to science education.

Tongji University has a history of more than thirty years, initially established by Germans. It has been formally nationalized for more than ten years. Administratively and economically, it has no connection with Germany and is a genuine national school.

The school currently has over a thousand students, with the College of Engineering accounting for the most at over four hundred. The College of Medicine has two hundred students, and the College of Science has over one hundred. The affiliated high school has about three hundred students. The affiliated advanced vocational school also has over two hundred students. The College of Engineering is divided into departments of Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Surveying, and Naval Architecture. The College of Science is divided into three departments: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The advanced vocational school graduates high school students who take the entrance examination and graduate after four years of vocational study. It is divided into two departments: Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering. The school does not have arts or law subjects and is a purely practical university.

Tuition fees for university students are only ten national currency per year, high school students are only five national currency per year, and advanced vocational school is completely free. This cannot be compared to the aristocratic education of capitalist societies. Like Jiaotong University and Beiyang Institute of Technology, the career prospects of the school's students are in greater demand than supply. Graduates can avoid the misfortune of unemployment.

The school's original site was in Wusong, Shanghai, and it has been reduced to ashes under the "August 13th" × human artillery fire. Fortunately, the staff and students retreated safely. Except for large-scale machinery that was inconvenient to move, the rest of the school's instruments, machines, books, and other school equipment were moved inland. After a long journey, all staff and students have now arrived in Kunming, Yunnan. Although the school buildings of our schools have been destroyed by the × human artillery fire, our educational spirit has become even stronger. The Fifth Rehabilitation Hospital of the Military Affairs Commission is jointly operated with the school. This is truly infuriating to the "Japanese Imperial Army"!

The school's professors, apart from about twenty who are German, are all Chinese professors. Because Germany is a friend of our × humans, more than a dozen German professors have left their posts since the outbreak of the war of resistance. Sacred scholarship has borders; this is also a new record created by Mr. Hitler of the "卐" brand and his "good friend," the Japanese Imperial Army.

The school was also included in the joint new student examination for national universities sponsored by the Ministry of Education, and classes officially started in Kunming on the 2nd of this month. However, to facilitate the enrollment of students, the Ministry of Education has specially approved the school to enroll students again, holding examinations in three locations: Kunming, Chongqing, and Hong Kong. It is reported that there are already more than one thousand students applying in the three locations, but the number of admissions in the future will only be four hundred.

In Hong Kong, as of yesterday's interview, there were more than ninety applicants. The entrance examination will be held at Wah Hsia College today and tomorrow. Among these ninety-plus people, there are the most from True Light Girls' Middle School. Most of them are graduating seniors from the third year of high school, because those who are eager to study fear that it will not be easy to have the opportunity to recruit in Hong Kong in the future. It is also because of the convenience afforded by the "equivalent academic ability" regulations.

Except for the Chinese course in high school, the school mostly uses German textbooks. Therefore, among the ninety-plus new applicants in Hong Kong, those who plan to enter the German remedial course account for more than sixty people. After passing the German remedial course for one year, they can formally enter the university undergraduate course next year. This is a feature of the school.

In the tempering of the war of resistance, politics has gradually improved, and science is about to rise. In addition to having sophisticated technology, a scientific talent should also have political awareness. Under the leadership of the school's president, Mr. Weng Zhilong, and with the assistance of the capable new secretary-general, Mr. Chen Shaoxian, the future is unlimited. For the sake of the soaring progress of scientific education in the motherland, we place infinite hope on National Tongji University, which is purely practical!

### Labor Department Prepares to Improve Workers' Lives While Child Laborers Suffer

How are these children struggling under inhuman oppression?

Factories have always exploited underage child laborers to save money, or make workers work overtime, impacting workers' health. Therefore, we feel that improving the lives of child laborers not only enhances their health but also upholds humanity!

Due to the pressures of life, many parents send their children, barely of school age, to workshops and shops as apprentices. If we pass by iron shops and other small workshops, we see children in dirty clothes, their faces pale, sitting on the ground, heads buried in their work. These are the apprentices!

They work from six or seven in the morning until six or seven in the evening. All day long, they do heavy work, like delivering iron tools to customers and hammering with iron hammers weighing more than ten pounds. Even though they are extremely exhausted, they dare not take a short rest. Sometimes, they can't bear the weight of the iron tools, but they have to clench their teeth and carry them desperately. Their spines, which have not yet fully developed, are bent. That kind of miserable situation is enough to bring tears to one’s eyes!

Every day, besides doing strenuous labor, they also do cleaning and other trivial tasks. Some shops don't even hire cooks. So, these teenagers have to shoulder the responsibility of cooking. Let me tell you, being a "cook" is not an easy task! If you are not careful, you will burn the rice or spoil the dishes, and you will surely be beaten, or at the very least, severely scolded, because employers will never understand a child who makes mistakes.

These apprentices, after eating two meals of plain rice, often don't even get a monthly salary of one dime. Nutritious food is out of the question. Even wanting a "cooling tea" is difficult. Due to an unbalanced diet and extreme fatigue, they gradually become ill, especially with lung disease being the most common. This disease progresses slowly, and because they don't know how to treat it, many are disabled before they even finish learning their skills.

Naturally, this situation is not limited to iron shops. As far as we know, many similar incidents occur in wood shops and other shops. Generally, bosses are frantically using these child laborers as stepping stones for their businesses. It is said that a certain association in Kowloon is using a group of ignorant children to make various crafts for them and even using them as salesmen to promote these products. The reward is only two meals and a place to sleep. What a profitable business this is! When reporters asked the children who came out of the association to promote the products about their treatment, they stared at me with blank eyes. Although they dared not speak, their pale yellow faces were covered with traces of pain—naturally, these child laborers are in a slightly better environment than the apprentices groping in the dark.

We feel that the lives of these child laborers and apprentices are like gambling, and success or failure is only a fine line apart. But in fact, many parents, even though they have heard of such unfortunate events, are willing to gamble with their children's lives because they are poor. And some parents who want to send their children to be apprentices can't even find a way to do so!

Investigating and warning those employers who abuse child laborers, and punishing them, is a quick fix for improving the lives of child laborers. But how to ensure that these unfortunate children all have equal opportunities for work and education is the fundamental solution!

### Murder in the Tea Fragrance Room: Japanese Man Dies from Injuries, Li Bingjin Charged with Murder, British Prosecutor Requests Change of Charge Yesterday, Li Listened Calmly

Li Bingjin, the defendant in the blood case at Tea Fragrance Room, No. 81 Hennessy Road, appeared again at the Central Magistracy yesterday morning before Judge Fuller. The chief prosecutor, British Detective Superintendent Deakin, stood up and told the court that the plaintiff, Japanese national Aihara Yoshimichi, died in the hospital on March 4 due to his injuries. Therefore, he now charged the defendant with murder and asked the court to allow the case to be adjourned for a week. The judge granted the request and corrected the name on the file. The defendant was remanded in custody. The defendant was a waiter at the Tea Fragrance Room. On the early morning of January 29, he suddenly went mad in the store and stabbed the Japanese man with a knife. He then went to Police Station No. 2 to turn himself in. The police then arrested him and charged him with two counts: one was that he had attacked the Japanese man Aihara Yoshimichi, and the other was that he had injured Aihara Yoshimichi's body, committing attempted murder. Now that the Japanese man has died, the police, according to regulations, have changed the charge against the defendant to the above-mentioned crime. The defendant appeared in a velvet-collared Western suit yesterday, his eyes sunken. When he heard the interpreter read out the charge, his expression was unaffected and he remained very calm.

### Xijiang Army Busy Rotating Troops, X Tian Secretly Arrives at Hekou, X Secretly Discusses Invasion Plans but Feels Troops are Weak, I and X Confront Each Other Across the River in Gaoyao and Sihui

(Xijiang Quick News) The Xijiang X Army has been frequently rotating its troops recently. The Guangsan Main Road, Guangyun Highway, and Jiangfo Highway are bustling with X Army activity. According to reports, the X Army has indeed increased along the lines, reaching about 3,000 men on the Xin Line, suggesting a planned action. Xijiang X Commander Que Tian secretly arrived at Hekou from Foshan on the 6th, summoning X Army officers from various units to secretly discuss invasion plans. It is said that X currently feels that the force on the Western Line is still weak and intends to temporarily take a defensive position in the short term, waiting for the troop strength to be replenished before launching an attack. Therefore, while transporting the X Army, they are also actively building fortifications in the southwest Hekou Makouganggen area, strengthening the defenses of Jiujiang, Heqing, and Mumian, enhancing their strength to prevent our army from counterattacking.

Our Army Counterattacks

On the one hand, they send troops to harass our villages in an attempt to eliminate our guerrilla team strength. However, since our elite troops have successively arrived in Xijiang, a strong line of defense has been formed in the Gaoyao, Sihui, Gaoming, and Heshan areas, confronting X across the river and closely monitoring and controlling X. Deng Longguang, commander of the X X Army, is still on the front line summoning generals from various units to plan offensive and defensive strategies. Therefore, although there is no major contact in the Xijiang battle at present, both sides are secretly preparing for the coming of a major war. Furthermore, it has been found that the Jiujiang Heqing X Army has been wantonly harassing nearby villages for days. On the 6th and 7th, more than a hundred X soldiers, divided among more than ten steamships and rubber boats, went from Shakou to Taiping Xaxu, claiming to be searching for guerrilla teams, taking the opportunity to rob property. At that time, the villagers in the area were caught off guard and suffered extensive looting. The X Army also forced the villages to accept the orders of the Jiujiang puppet maintenance association, recommending village chiefs to be responsible for ensuring that no guerrilla teams emerge in the village, otherwise the township head would be held accountable. The people there, under the X's tyranny, dared not disobey, but feared the blame of siding with X when our army counterattacks. Therefore, local gentry with some influence have been fleeing in recent days to avoid humiliation.

### Guangdong Finance Seeks to Make Up Deficit, Plans to Increase Tax on Imported Luxury Goods, Slight Adjustment of Internal Finance Department, Actively Training Skilled Personnel

[Shaoguan Quick News] In order to increase work efficiency, Gu Yiqun, Director of the Finance Department, has made slight adjustments to the internal organization and abolished redundant agencies to save public funds. In total, the department now has one secretariat and four sections. Gui Jingqiu will remain as the director of the secretariat, and Yang Zhongli and others will be newly appointed as secretaries. Xu Rongyin is the head of the first section, which handles general affairs; Lin Xijing is the head of the second section, which handles land tax; Du Meihe is the head of the third section, which handles donation tax; and Zhu Shenwei is the head of the fourth section, which handles county finance. The Provincial Tax Deed General Office and the Regulations Review Committee, and the Miscellaneous Tax Review Committee and other redundant agencies are also abolished. Several people familiar with local finance and donation experience are appointed as inspectors to step up guidance and improve tax and finance matters in various tax bureaus and county and municipal governments. Currently, the main sources of revenue in Guangdong Province are (1) tax on imported goods, (2) land tax, and (3) business tax. Since current revenues are insufficient to cover expenditures, the revenue part may increase the tax on imported luxury goods that do not affect people's livelihood to make up for the deficit. This matter is currently being planned. Director Gu also intends to establish a financial personnel training institute to cultivate a large number of skilled financial management personnel and eliminate malpractices.

### Active Taishan Female Conscripts, Posture of the Taishan Women's National Salvation Movement

[Taishan Correspondence] To meet the needs of the new phase of the War of Resistance, the women's community has appeared in Taishan society with an extremely active posture.

In the past, the achievements of the Taishan women's movement left us with a very deep impression. Since the tide of the National Revolution swept into Taishan, the Taishan society, which had always been silent, bravely raised the banner of the women's movement. The work at that time not only coordinated with the revolutionary situation at the time, but also laid the foundation for the Taishan women's movement. The Taishan Women's Liberation Association became a permanent legal organization under the leadership of the government at that time. Its work developed with the development of history. After the Great Northern Expedition of 1925-1927, affected by the world economic crisis of 1929 and the objective conditions of the unbalanced cultural development of various places in Taishan, the Taishan women's movement was temporarily silent. The Women's Movement Association was reorganized and affiliated to the Party Headquarters.

The "July 7th" Incident ignited the flames of the War of Resistance, and the national salvation movement in Taishan also rose. The women's community was of course no exception. Thus, along with the great torrent of the War of Resistance, a women's national salvation organization affiliated to the Taishan Support Association was created. This organization, under a momentary enthusiasm, had done some things, but due to the unsound internal organization and the scramble for leadership by those who were concerned with the limelight, it finally stopped working.

After the successive fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, Taishan entered a state of war. The Taishan women's national salvation movement also embarked on a new direction. They tried their best to avoid the disturbance of those who were concerned with the limelight and planned to carry out their work, and they also achieved great results. The central organization of the current movement is the Alumni Association of the Taishan Women's Military Training Cadre Training Class.

The work in the past few months has been rapidly developed. The first phase of women's training has ended, and the results are very good. In the county urban area, except for the female employees and prostitutes in the tea houses, it is not easy to see a woman with powder and rouge on the street. The young ladies who were hidden in their boudoirs in the past are now heroic heroines in majestic military uniforms. In the countryside, they are no longer like the shy women who peeped from under their bamboo hats in the past. Moreover, you can easily hear them speak. Once, I went to the countryside for some things, and on the mountain road, I heard two young women clearly say,

"This place can be used as a stronghold for military defense."

"If the Japanese soldiers occupy Taicheng, I will definitely sneak up on them from this place."

"If there is a light machine gun in this bunker, I dare to guard this pass."

The end of the first phase of women's training has already yielded such results. The second phase followed immediately. They recently published the Alumni Association Journal, striving to improve women's knowledge of the War of Resistance and eliminate illiteracy among women in wartime. It is also written in the opening speech of this publication,

In addition to the skills given to the female conscripts in the tactical course, we also need to declare political consciousness and mobilization.

Obviously, in the second phase of women's training, they will go to the countryside to implement their planned training for political consciousness mobilization.

In short, the Taishan women's movement has sprouted. No matter where in Taishan, we can see majestic women practicing with live ammunition. Not only that, but currently, the women of Taishan who work in the fields or walk on the fields are no longer chaotically chattering like three women acting as one horse, but have become a solemn and majestic song of "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves."

### Yunnan and Guangxi Actively Connect Transportation, Guangxi Sends Personnel to Yunnan and Guizhou to Discuss Plans

[Gezhou Quick News] Xia Wei, Chief of Staff of the Fifth Route Army and Acting Commander-in-Chief, recently stated that the conspiracy of violent X to spy on Guangxi is becoming increasingly urgent. The national defense of Guangxi Province is becoming more and more serious. In addition to stepping up the mobilization of the military and civilians to resist Japan and defend the territory and actively deploying military affairs on the border, since Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces are adjacent to each other, and are important bases for the overall War of Resistance, all water conservancy, telecommunications, and transportation should be closely linked and developed. Therefore, the headquarters recently sent the director of the Transportation Department to visit Guizhou and Yunnan to meet with the military authorities of the two provinces to discuss everything. A concrete plan has now been discussed. It is heard that regarding the communication of news among the three provinces, it has been decided to increase the wired and wireless network to exchange news at any time. As for land transportation, it has also been decided to increase the number of highway escort teams and engineering teams so that they can be repaired at any time in case of X damage. In addition, branch roads will be expanded to connect the provinces to facilitate transportation.

### Amidst Tension in Jiangmen, Jiangfo Road is Destroyed Again, Xinhui and Heshan Have Made Practical Connections, If X Invades, We Will Gladly Fight

[Jiangmen Quick News] In recent days, the atmosphere in Jiangmen City has been quite tense, rumors have been rife, but public security is still good. The military, police and teams are strictly guarding day and night. Yesterday, the reporter went to the headquarters of the Fifth District Guerrilla Area to meet with Deputy Commander Zhou Hanqian to inquire about everything.

If X Invades, We Will Gladly Fight

Zhou said that the X has been clamoring to attack Jiangmen for more than just today. However, according to the information obtained by this headquarters, the X in Jiujiang are indeed eager to try to attack Xinhui and Heshan counties. Jiangmen, a coastal city, is also one of the targets of the X people. Our defense forces and teams do not distinguish between the severity of the defense based on whether the X people are invading or not. If they attack, our army will be happy to fight. As for public security in the city, with strict patrols, we can ensure that there is no trouble. At present, the most important task is to prevent it. Therefore, the inspection of travelers must be particularly meticulous.

Destroy the Highway to Prevent X from Peeping

As for the Jiangfo Highway, its fourth section is in Xinhui, from Yugang to Shuanglong, very close to Jiangmen. It was initially ordered to be destroyed, and then repaired to restore military communication, the reason being to facilitate our military transport. Currently, the defense deployment in Xinhui has been completed. At the same time, in order to prevent the X from attacking Heshan and peeping at Xinhui along the Longlu Road, the authorities will thoroughly destroy that section again. From the 8th of this month, the military can no longer pass. The military authorities of Xinhui and Heshan have also made practical connections and are preparing step by step.

### Battlefield Inspection, Visit to the Xijiang Outpost "Dian," Interview with the Commander of the Hantang Bitter Battle

Dasha, which belongs to Sihui County, is one hundred li away from Zhaoqing and occupies an important position on the outer defense line of Xijiang. The X's artillery shells and bombs have completely destroyed everything in the market, and at the same time awakened the people here and embarked on the road of resisting Japan. They formed organizations to defend their homeland and armed themselves.

1.  Paying Respects at the Battlefield

During the outpost inspection, the reporter was accompanied by Deputy Squadron Commander Huang Xiqiu of the X Brigade of the Revenue Police Corps, and went from Dasha to Daligang "Zaogang and Hantang" on the front line. This is separated from the X's position by only a small river a few hundred yards wide, and machine guns are firing back and forth every day. Fortunately, there was silence on this day. There were no dark clouds of war in the sky, and the X planes did not come to talk. Crossing the uneven and already damaged highway, the magnificent project of the Dasha Bridge can no longer be seen, but the traces of the iron men guarding Xijiang can be seen at any time. Among the villages, under the big trees, and in the fields, they are everywhere, talking, admiring, three or five of them.

In the desolate hills and grassy areas by the river, the soldiers of the outpost are hidden. Although the sea breeze blows in the face and there is a deep cold, the soldiers' blood is hot. They single-mindedly hold the iron guns, aiming forward, and do not have half a minute or half a point of spare energy to care about the issue of "clothing."

Life in the trenches is infinitely warm and tense. If there is any movement from the X ahead, our heroes will all be eager to try and wait for a good opportunity to show their skills. But when they find that the X have quietly left, everyone can only sigh, "We can't fight this time, when will we have the chance?" Yes, our warriors are hungry, urgently wanting to eat barbarian meat and drink Japanese slave blood.

Our materials are indeed quite lacking, and the front-line fortifications cannot fully utilize the latest science to build them up. However, the warriors on this front line have experienced the "January 28th" battle, and they have rich experience in "knowing yourself and knowing your enemy" in combat. They skillfully built various simple fortifications. Deputy Squadron Commander Huang showed us the traces of the shells fired by the X, which were full of holes in the mountains, but did not have much impact on our soldiers' hidden trenches.

2.  Talking About the Battle Situation

The old Sanshui and Daligang Zaogang Hantang area near the river have been lost and regained. On a certain day in February, the X made a major move, landed and fought with us for a day. It was the largest battle on the western front after the fall of Guangzhou.

Deputy Squadron Commander Huang was the commander of this battle. Speaking of the various reports of the battle situation, he expressed regret. "The X suddenly attacked at about 6:00 a.m. that day, with more than 30 large and small steel cannons and five aircraft. They used three-dimensional tactics to bomb and bombard our front-line positions in the old Sanshui Xialigang Zaogang area. The entire position was plunged into an encirclement of smoke and flames. More than 800 X soldiers landed in the old Sanshui Gomei area under the dense artillery fire. We prepared our firepower, discovered the target in Xialigang, and concentrated our fire with a sound. The X charged fiercely, and we fired densely. The two sides were getting closer and closer. The X's big roar had at least 20 rounds every minute, destroying our fortifications completely. Our brothers scattered quickly and continued to fight. After an hour, they retreated to Zaogang.

"At about 9:00, Squadron Leader Zhou Zhongshi was too brave and disregarded his own safety to defend this 'point.' He rushed into the X's position and broke a few hand grenades, gloriously sacrificing himself. The brothers gnashed their teeth and vowed to avenge him. Unfortunately, Zaogang also retreated to the main positions of Jiugang Zhuzhou Hantang area in an environment where there was no danger to defend. The X people did not know whether to live or die and continued to charge fiercely. At this time, the brothers led reinforcements and rushed to counterattack head-on.

"After taking in the scattered soldiers who had retreated from the front line, they held on to the main position. The Ma Fang side was also notified to prepare for a flank attack. The brothers from Dasha also rushed to help. We didn't know what time it was in the fire. Charge, charge, charge fiercely, and don't allow half a step back. The brothers were like crazy, not knowing that they were dead. Hand grenades and bayonets were used together, and they did their best to kill more than seventy X soldiers. The X's momentum gradually collapsed. We charged and killed again, not giving them half a second to breathe. We always maintained the main position and did not change after being bombed by the cannons.

"At about 12:00, we rushed to the original positions of Zaogang Xialigang. The brothers were very happy and ran forward, killing anyone they saw. The X people couldn't stand, so they had to retreat to the old Sanshui Gomei. We didn't pursue it any further in order to adjust the position. However, the X soldiers did not dare to stay and retreated to Sanshui Hekou at 4:00 p.m. that day.

"I dare to conclude that the casualties of the X people were indeed more than one hundred, including some lieutenants. As for us, only a few brothers were injured or killed. The ratio of fighting was one to five, and the settlement was one to ten. This is unprecedented glory and the greatest honor of the country. We mourn Squadron Leader Zhou's sacrifice on the one hand, and celebrate his sacrifice for the country on the other. He was brave and glorious.

"The X people consumed more than 6,000 shells and countless machine gun bullets that day. The only thing they got was the corpses of Japanese soldiers who had air coming in and no air coming out.

"All the original positions are now under our guard's control. These days have been very quiet. Maybe the X people have tasted the taste here and dare not come again." Deputy Squadron Commander Huang passionately recalled the course of this bitter battle.

"We and the brothers who have returned from the Nanxun line are now holding hands tightly and building a long wall that is not easy to shake to protect Xijiang. Tell the compatriots in the rear to work hard to support the brothers on the front line." Huang, a tall deputy squadron commander, said firmly to the reporter on the way back.

We are infinitely grateful to the national defenders on the front line of Xijiang, and at the same time, we sincerely and earnestly hope that our compatriots in the rear will give them enthusiastic assistance and work together to strive for the realization of the final victory. Xiao Pin

Movies and Dramas

### One Hundred and One Hollywood Shortcuts to Success (Continued from Yesterday)

(29) Know someone who knows that someone is needed to hire a double (who stands in front of the camera to adjust the lighting for the lead actor before they arrive). Jean Chatburn started as a stand-in for Belle Bennett.

(30) Know someone who knows that an office worker is needed at that studio. Margaret Tallichet started as a stenographer in the publicity department.

(31) Learn to speak with a British accent. Walk confidently into the manager's office and tell him about your theatrical experience in England. Margaret Lindsay achieved great success this way.

(32) Have your mother take a good photo of you and send it to people looking for actors, with a note saying, "You should see him in person." Bob Baker got a screen test this way.

(33) Play football in college, then become a lifeguard on Venice Beach in California. Like Andy Devine, one day someone looking for actors will be looking for a burly comedic character.

(34) Keep the newspapers guessing about you. Is she married to that big star already? Or is she just a long-term houseguest? The reporters had a hard time figuring out Paulette Goddard.

(35) Marry a husband who can help you improve your elocution and supports your screen ambitions. Then, play roles in Hollywood with a demure and mysterious air, like Sigrid Gurie.

(36) Be a Hollywood eccentric. Wear strange clothes and stroll down the street, loudly reciting Shakespeare. John Carradine was rewarded for this.

(37) Be able to play three hundred different roles. If Hollywood hasn't come calling yet, then take the initiative and go to them. Whatever your past experience is, there's always some use for it. Just look at Ralph Bellamy and George Brent.

(38) Win a beauty contest – and you also need to have some brains. Hollywood is full of beautiful, brainless girls, so only a few of those who win awards and succeed in the film industry are those who can learn a little more, like Gail Patrick, Ann Sheridan, and Marjorie Weaver.

(39) Be an artist's model, and this artist is often visited by people who discover talented actors. That's how they found Norma Shearer, Jean Arthur, and Kay Francis. Garbo was also discovered when she was a hat shop model.

(40) If you can sing, have your sister encourage you to perform at a concert, and those people looking for actors just happen to be listening. There you go, you're another Shirley Temple!

(41) Announce all the Hollywood gossip in newspapers or on the radio, like Walter Winchell and Jimmie Fidler.

(42) Have a beautiful figure to help you sing in a dance band. Look at Alice Faye, Michele Morgan, and Priscilla Lane.

(43) Go to college near Hollywood. Play the lead roles in the school's drama club, and be beautiful. Remember Robert Taylor?

(44) Fall in love with a Hollywood reporter. He will sing your praises, and sooner or later he will bring someone to ask you to audition. Janet Gaynor entered the film industry this way.

(45) Make funny faces and funny poses. Be a model at Walt Disney's cartoon studio. Eddie Collins, who modeled for Dopey in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, became an actor.

(46) Work as a manicurist in a large Hollywood beauty salon. Wait for an honest person to suggest you try out for movies. Arleen Whelan only waited two weeks.

(47) Work at a soda fountain or delivering sodas in a Hollywood candy store. There are also opportunities. Ellen Drew only waited a year.

(48) Through a friend's introduction, become a substitute actress for the lead in a major Hollywood theater. When that lead retires, you'll be the next Olivia de Havilland.

(49) Join a chorus line. Try to get into the front row of dancers. That way, people looking for actors can easily see you. Joan Crawford did it this way.

(50) Be a brilliant player on a famous Western football team, like John Mack Brown.

(51) When a film company goes to the South Seas to shoot on location, rush there and pretend to be an explorer, like Errol Flynn.

(52) Have a face like the girl painted on the cover of a major magazine, like Larry Simms.

(53) Sing in the shower at the gym, hoping that the music director from a film company hears you, like Anthony Marlow.

(54) Go to Hollywood High School. Eat breakfast at the diner across the street from school between classes. Suddenly, a friend from a film company comes in. Lana Turner became an actress.

(55) Try to be an extra – these opportunities are rare now. Extras refuse to let newcomers join, but if you are already an extra, wear clothes that are much better than the other extras. This method is very helpful to Achille Mauzan.

(56) Be a photographer for eighteen years, and then perform some funny poses in front of your own camera. David Oliver became a comedian.

(57) Lead an American jazz band performing in Venice, Italy. Then, Merle Davis convinces him to try acting in films. This was Scott Colton's method.

(58) Perform outstanding programs in nightclubs, like the Ritz Brothers, Martha Raye, and Margo.

(59) If you look like a certain star, and you can speak in the same manner as them, then run into the film company and ask for an audition. Frankie Burke got the role of the young James Cagney in "Angels with Dirty Faces" this way.

(60) Run into the company and insist that you are the brother (or sister) of a famous actress, and ask for an audition. One child used this method, and before it was exposed, not only did he get an audition, but he also got a role. As long as he performs well, the company won't pursue the matter.

(61) Know the phone number of someone who works at a casting agency. Make a long-distance call to him and ask for a role in a new film. Mary Bovard got her first role this way.

(62) If you can draw, draw a picture of a certain director from a photograph, and then send it to him to show your talent. This gave Myrna Madison a chance for a screen test.

(63) Take a set of your own funny photos and send them to a director, like Robert Trasker recently did, and ask for an audition.

(64) Look like a Latino, but speak English. Perform the tango in a nightclub. Talent scouts discovered Cesar Romero. (To be continued)

### Two Strong Teams from the Chinese Community Battle It Out for the Silver Medal Finals Spot. Held at So Kon Po Ground This Afternoon at 4 PM.

[Report from Our Newspaper] In this year's Special Silver Shield Football Tournament, in the First Division, there have been several instances of draws leading to two or three extra games to determine the winner, thus prolonging the schedule. Now, there is one more semi-final match, to be held this afternoon at 4 PM at So Kon Po Ground. This is the match between South China South and Eastern. The winner will gain the right to play in the finals against the Police team for the championship.

In the quarter-finals, South China South eliminated Kowloon Club after three matches. Eastern also eliminated South China Hua after two matches. Therefore, today's semi-final is not accidental, but a victory forged with sweat and blood. However, it is regrettable that these two powerful Chinese teams are in the same group, unable to compete in the finals together. It only benefits the dark horse in the other group, the Police team. However, the Police team does not have the aura of a champion, and their place in the finals is due to luck.

Based on the situation, the Police team is not a strong team and lacks the strength to compete for the championship. Therefore, today's match is equivalent to the finals, and the winner will surely have the championship in their grasp. However, when two tigers fight, one will be injured. Regardless of who wins or draws, the loser will be on a divergent path, declaring despair. Therefore, the boundary between success and failure is at stake. Who can win the leadership position in Chinese football will also be determined here.

Both this semi-final and the final will be played with a ninety-minute format, unlike the preliminary and quarter-final rounds. The General Association, considering the frequent occurrence of draws in the past, realizes that the outcome of today's encounter between the two strong Chinese teams is difficult to predict. If the game ends in a draw, it would be within expectations. Therefore, at the monthly meeting held a few days ago, it was decided that if the two teams are still tied after the full regulation time and extra time, a replay will be held tomorrow. If tomorrow's game also ends in a draw, a final match will be held on Wednesday of next week.

The weather has been erratic for the past few days, alternating between sunny and rainy. What will it be like today is still hard to predict. Let's hope that the heavens are merciful and do not spoil the football match. Then, this great battle will surely be filled with wonderful performances. If the heavens do not cooperate, the field will be wet, and the ball will be heavy, which will affect the players' performance and lack good contributions. Moreover, fighting in the rain means that the outcome cannot be judged solely based on technical skills. Therefore, the weather is a matter worth paying attention to.

To what extent have the two teams reached in terms of strength? Are they evenly matched? This match will reveal it clearly, giving the spectators a clear view. Estimating the strength, it cannot be lightly concluded that they are evenly matched simply because the two teams have each won once in the league process.

Speaking factually, South China South is a team that is good at employing tactical approaches, with deliberate attacks and well-coordinated connections. Therefore, they often win by skill. Another advantage is that each of them has been in battle for a long time, with rich experience. They do not panic in big battles, and they become stronger when facing strong enemies. It is said that this has been proven time and time again. Now, at this important juncture, they have prepared early. It is expected that their performance will not be too hasty, resulting in abnormal technical flaws. On the other hand, since being promoted to the First Division, Eastern has never touched the league and Shield titles. Now, at a time when the whole team has made great progress, they have obtained this semi-final opportunity, which is a rare opportunity. The players are eager to win and want to win quickly. Moreover, the only difficult hurdle is today. If they can win in one fell swoop, the great championship will be theirs. Because of this, all the players have made up their minds to win. They must attach too much importance to victory and be too excited. However, this kind of influence, if successful, will make the momentum stronger, and if defeated, will make the heart more anxious. Therefore, the key to the question of victory or defeat depends on which side scores the first goal. If Eastern concedes a goal first, they will inevitably become more anxious and chaotic. As for their past battles, there is no so-called style. The striker is good at raids, and the defenders are loyal to their duties. Their ability to overwhelm South China South today also depends entirely on whether the raids can succeed. However, South China South is not easy to deal with, and Eastern may not be able to succeed easily.

### Football Intelligence: Wu Derong Suspended, Hou Chengtuo and Pak Ga Selected to Replace Players for Philippine Tour, England Team Lineup for International Match Finalized

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last week, during the league match between South China Hua and St. Joseph's, St. Joseph's player Wu Derong punched Xie Jinhong and was seen by the referee, who sent him off the field and reported the incident to the Executive Committee of the General Association. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, the Executive Committee held a meeting to review the incident and unanimously decided that Wu's illegal action should be punished with a suspension of games until December this year. Chen Yishaoquan, a player from the Second Division Kitchee team, also committed a similar offense and was punished with a suspension of games until the end of this season.

The Management Committee of the General Association discussed the selection of the Hong Kong team for the Philippine tour a few days ago. After determining the 15-member team, they sent letters to each person to inquire if they could spare the time to go. According to the replies from Navy players Lie Li and Kent, they said that they would be at sea at that time and could not help, and asked to select other people to fill the vacancies. After receiving the letters, the Management Committee selected Pak Ga of the Police and Hou Chengtuo of Eastern to fill the vacancies, and inquired their opinions. Although Li Yutang and Tan Jungan were on the list, they both work at Swedish Trading Company. The manager of the company has gone elsewhere and has not returned, so the issue of asking for leave is still under consideration and will be decided after the manager returns to Hong Kong.

Before the Philippine team returned south, they requested that Hong Kong send a team to the Philippines in April to compete, and to send referee Aoma to accompany them. However, Aoma is occupied with business and cannot spare the time to go, so the General Association plans to send Costa instead.

The International Football Quarter-Finals, China vs. England, is scheduled to be held on the 19th of this month at 4 PM at the So Kon Po Ground. It is understood that the English team lineup is roughly finalized, but the British players of the Navy are at sea with the ship during the day and are difficult to help. Therefore, the strength of the English team has not been fully utilized, and there are some Second Division players included. The lineup is recorded below.

Pak Ga, Yi Hualishi

Wei Jianchen, Ju Lidi, Feishi Woshi

### Important Leg Muscles

— Wang Xuezheng

When it comes to muscles or physical strength, people who are considered strong usually pat their chest or roll up their sleeves to show off their arms. Very few people pay attention to their legs.

Building a physique is no different from building a house. To make a house solid, the most important thing is a strong foundation. The legs are the foundation of our body.

Our physical strength is closely related to our legs. If the leg muscles are underdeveloped, even if we have strong arm strength, it cannot be fully utilized. Moreover, to have great physical strength, we must have a strong back. Underdeveloped leg muscles mean a person lacks a strong back. Because to make the back strong, we must do strenuous exercises, and most strenuous back exercises are interrelated with the legs. In other words, most strenuous back exercises are also the best leg exercises, such as "Dead Lift" and "Deep Knee Bend," which have the greatest effect on developing the muscles of both the back and legs.

To develop the arm, shoulder, and chest muscles to the fullest extent, it is necessary to engage in strenuous exercises. However, if the muscles of the back and legs are underdeveloped, even if one can handle strenuous exercises, there is a risk of injury. Many people have very developed arm muscles, but their strength is not very great, which is because the exercises are too easy. Engaging in easy exercises, such as increasing the number of repetitions until the muscles are fatigued or even sore, can also make the muscles develop quickly, but it has little effect on developing physical strength. From this, we can see that if the leg muscles are too underdeveloped, not only will we be unable to unleash the great physical strength of the upper body, but it will also greatly hinder the development of the upper body and even all parts of the body.

If we neglect leg exercises and focus solely on upper body exercises, we may have good results at the moment, but muscle development and physical strength training are not just for the present. If we neglect leg exercises, various problems will inevitably arise after a certain period of time, such as slow or even complete cessation of progress, a lean state of muscles, or the drawbacks of muscle stiffness, and an imbalance in the development of physical strength and muscles.

To develop muscles to the fullest extent, we must consider both light and heavy exercises, and the same applies to the legs. However, the legs are the strongest part of our body. If we only engage in callisthenics, we will never be able to develop them to the fullest extent. We must engage in strenuous weight training. (1)

### The Shanghai Cultural Scene Deserves Concern

— Huang Sheng

The bombing of Luohu in the British Concession and the coercion of the Shanghai Concessions are spicy tricks of Japanese 'political offensive'. They have stabbed the opponent's weakness and achieved initial success, using a 'misbombing' compensation of 20,000 yuan to conduct discussions on some issues; using complete empty threats to complete the conclusion of the 'Shanghai Agreement'.

Although such an advance cannot predict the consequences, the so-called 'Shanghai Agreement' has made the Shanghai Concessions a de facto Japanese-administered colony, a complete world of terror. The sovereignty of the Public Concession originally belonged to China, and the Municipal Council privately signed an agreement with the Japanese side, which is a disregard for our sovereignty! This is what we must resolutely oppose!

In this very serious situation, we are particularly concerned about the cultural circles in Shanghai. In the 'Shanghai Agreement', there is a clause that 'bans anti-Japanese newspapers', and since Japan has become the de facto master in the Concessions, it will certainly impose high-pressure bans on all progressive cultural activities. In the future, all actions of the progressive cultural circles will become very difficult. Therefore, how to sweep away this dense dark cloud is not only the task of the cultural circles in Shanghai, but also requires special attention from the national cultural circles.

Before the War of Resistance, Shanghai was the main base for cultural people and the center of publishing. In terms of spreading and improving culture, Shanghai became a source of power. Not to mention the distant past, the patriotic movement in cultural thought was launched in Shanghai. This movement was simply a signal for national liberation and a prelude to the War of Resistance. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the cultural war songs of August 13 became a huge echo, followed by the planned 'evacuation' of cultural people, arranging a new national and universal development. Although the mother of cultural power has also experienced a temporary decline, the workers' hard support and active struggle soon made Shanghai culture embark on the road of rejuvenation, and a new active appearance reappeared. Especially in publishing, it still stands at the highest position. Therefore, Japan's attempt to 'conquer' the Shanghai Concessions must first target the progressive cultural circles as the primary target, because the high-speed development of Chinese anti-Japanese culture is a powerful guerrilla force against Japanese aggression.

Therefore, we must use all our strength to defend the progressive cultural circles in Shanghai!

After observing the crisis of the isolated island of Shanghai, our eyes naturally turn here. The edge of this 'comfort zone' has been hit by Japanese bombs, and strange planes have swept over our heads. This is no longer a peaceful harbor. The treacherous waves of the Pacific Ocean will sweep this place into a 'troubled autumn'! In particular, the pursuit of compromise policies that are not up to us will at any time lay thorns on our path, so we must prepare for cutting through them.

Cultural workers, unite! The slogan is already ringing out. Yes, unity is strength. Collective strength is enough to overcome all difficulties. The conclusion of the 'Shanghai Agreement' between the Municipal Council and Japan gives us not only a slogan, but more importantly, practice!

You must know that our achievements are not as good as the authors in Shanghai, and our strength appears very weak, making us more vulnerable to setbacks. Moreover, toxins are spreading around us, so we must quickly lay a solid foundation for our joint work, and our 'fly-swatting' work must be carried out effectively!

Forward—Tang Yingwei

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

The white clouds in the sky and the white snow on the ground are gradually dimming, dimming in the dusk. Between these white clouds and white snow, there is an indistinguishable expanse of white: is it clouds? The clouds and snow have been mixed by the storm, mixed into a blurred whole, and everything is losing its original shape in the haze. This is the most ordinary scenery in the frigid zone, and it becomes a strange dream that people in the tropics cannot imagine.

The cold here can destroy all animal and plant life. People say that the frigid zone is a terrible place, where you can freeze your hands and feet, freeze your blood, and freeze the ground until it cracks. The stories caused by the cold are based on facts. People fight against nature to conquer the cold, which also inspires their courage and wisdom. Yes, Manchuria is cold. However, if someone's birthplace is Manchuria, and they have been away from Manchuria for a long time, they will often cry out:

'Manchuria, my lovely hometown!'

At this time, Manchuria is his friend, his mother, and his lover's embrace. At this time, Manchuria is not cold, but warm. Especially for exiles driven away by iron whips, as long as he remembers Manchuria, he will become homesick and go crazy on the way to exile, and he will not hesitate to sacrifice in order to return; at the same time, for the sufferers locked within Manchuria by shackles, as long as he does not forget Manchuria, he will fight for the freedom of Manchuria until death.

Manchuria will always occupy people's memories; for example, the snow in Manchuria is great and holy.

It is the embodiment of Manchuria, the messenger of snow!

The bustling cities are also transformed from prosperity to decay in the wind and snow. The streets, which used to be crowded with people under the clear sky, have also become deserted open spaces. On the streets, the wandering accordion players have stopped calling for sympathy, and the impoverished beggars no longer reach out their hands from their sleeves to the passers-by; they have already begun to look for a place to spend the night in the corners abandoned or forgotten by the broken people. Everything is gradually resting. The only thing that seems to be not resting is the flag that betrayed the motherland, a not-so-strong flagpole, supporting its inevitable fate, struggling and fluttering—on the bank of the Songhua River.

### We Defend Tongbai Ridge

— Li Huiying

Our line is responsible for the defense from Gushi to Shangcheng. The 30th Division in front has already made contact with the enemy. In addition to attacking from Yejiaji Fojinshan, the main route for the enemy to capture Shangcheng is to go south from Gushi and attack the north side of Shangcheng. Twenty miles to the east is a mountainous area. The division commander pointed to the map hanging on the wall and recited: 'Tongbai Ridge, Dangjinshan, Yejiaji.' He marked the serial numbers of our troops resisting the enemy locally.

'Now we have entered the situation,' the division commander said, 'Everything must be extra careful and well prepared. At any time and anywhere, we may encounter enemy attacks.'

'The enemy's target of attack is Shangcheng, and the other is Gushi. Our area is right in the middle. Although there is no major contact in front, the position is very important.'

In this area, the people seem calm instead, and no one is seen running away. The war has not attracted their attention. Instead, they are taking advantage of this time to do business with the army. The cannons roar all day long, but they are not afraid. Airplanes often fly over to bomb, but they cannot see the planes, and they still return to their homes.

'Aren't you afraid?'

'Your officers are not afraid, so what are we common people afraid of!'

Various forms were sent down from the division headquarters, and everyone filled out one, including name, place of origin, age, mailing address, and other items. The comrades smiled as they filled them out, saying:

'What, is this a resume to prepare for promotion?'

Someone next to him immediately expressed a different opinion:

'You are thinking too well, you don't have that kind of luck for promotion.'

'In my opinion, it's to prepare for an investigation after we die in battle, right?'

'Yes, it must be this meaning.'

At the same time, an order was received from the division headquarters to remove all symbol armbands and armed belts. Regardless of officers or soldiers, all wore horizontal leather belts. Everyone was excited. This was clearly the situation on the eve of battle.

Everyone was rubbing their hands and stamping their feet, happy beyond measure, and a rare smile burst out from their hearts, floating on everyone's faces. Excited, nervous, and calm.

'Let's do it, look at this time!'

'Damn it, a coward is not a good man!'

The comrades were busy printing mimeographed battle reports and propaganda cartoons, and some people were doing the work of mobilizing the masses, so that they could understand the meaning of the War of Resistance and help the army do some things.

The comrades who came back from the brigade headquarters discussed going to the front to write slogans against the enemy. In the mountains less than ten miles away from the brigade headquarters, enemy plainclothes teams were already active, and they had also learned that there were six or seven hundred puppet Manchurian troops in the mountains. The slogans were prepared to be carved on tree trunks and written in large chalk letters on the walls. Those puppet Manchurian troops were our family, and we wanted to make them sober. The pre-written slogans were:

'Chinese people don't fight Chinese people!'

'Northeast brothers, unite and overthrow the Japanese militarists!'

'Northeast brothers, turn your guns and shoot our common enemy - the Japanese Imperial Army.'

'Northeast brothers do not be slaves, welcome you to bring your weapons and return.'

That night, at ten o'clock, the order from the regimental headquarters arrived: attack Tongbai Ridge.

It must be launched before twelve o'clock, and arrive at the designated location before dawn to begin the encirclement.

This order has finally arrived. At dawn, we must obtain a victory as bright as the sunlight.

This will be a great start...

### Creating Healthy Comic Books

— Hanbo

Occasionally, I found several comic books with new themes on the comic book stalls, such as "Love, Tears and Blood," "Midnight Desires," "Thunderbolt," "Pearl Shirt," "Mr. Wang," and "Bull Nose." These stories, which were originally in movies and comics, have now been moved into the world of comic books one by one. From the tattered covers, it can be seen that they have been read by countless people and have etched impressions in the minds of countless people, producing a huge impact.

However, what is regrettable is that we have not found one or two comic books that introduce the heroic deeds of the War of Resistance or excellent anti-Japanese literature. On the one hand, they want to put on the clothes of the times, but on the other hand, they cannot get rid of the shackles of tradition. This is the new trend in recent comic books.

The obstacles that limit the upward development of comic books are:

1 A strong entertainment consciousness;

2 Ignoring the theme and only seeking the business tactics of being lively and pleasing the readers;

3 Crude artistic forms and clumsy literary explanations;

4 False and outdated old themes;

The combination of these points has formed a special department of Qiong paintings in literature.

Comic book merchants want to use old forms to match new themes, but they have not overcome the above-mentioned obstacles. Putting new wine into unsterilized bottles is the same old wine in a new bottle. Comic books have now entered the stage of adopting new themes. However, if we choose scripts such as horror, detective, funny, and love, there is no doubt that we will make a great mistake. Moreover, if we do not abandon the old dross, even the best themes will be misinterpreted. Therefore, the first thing we should do is to eradicate the deeply rooted bad habits of many years and use a brand-new posture to accommodate the themes suitable for the War of Resistance in non-toxic old forms and build a healthy comic book fortress. Of course, we also know that merchants have their own business tactics, but we also understand that this is a task that will not lose money. All we ask of them is a transformation. Why don't merchants stand on the side of the majority?

When it comes to issues such as consciousness, themes, and artistic forms, that should be the responsibility of cultural people. It is a very gratifying thing that there is a chance for comic books to change. We should have someone to lead this movement, contribute opinions, and promote its multi-faceted development, so that it does not deviate from the right path. At the same time, we must not only consider the needs of school-age children in the city, but also consider the needs of soldiers on the battlefield and the masses in the countryside. Popular pictures and texts with correct consciousness are most suitable to be used as the vanguard of articles going to the countryside and articles joining the army. Some people advocated this matter before, and now it is time to revive it urgently. From the perspective of pure literature, comic strips are also the best tool to introduce masterpieces and famous works to beginners. "Dead Souls" and hundreds of pictures gave the readers a profound impression and helped them understand the content of the original text, which was particularly powerful. This is something that current cultural drawing staff should advocate. Comic strips are the backward people of this era's culture, but if we can create a sound comic strip front, then its effectiveness will stand at the forefront of the cultural world.

### The Sea of Bloodshed

— Rui Lin

Surging sea tides

Flow through how many lands,

Flow through how many days,

From our ancestors in ancient times

To our generation.

It flows ceaselessly

— This eternal life!

On the reefs by the sea,

On the beach,

Under the dome of the sky,

Rolling with roaring laughter;

The wind sways the evergreen grass on the ridge,

And in the deep seabed

Hides the distant dream of centuries.

From that time on,

Evil clutches stretched out from the other shore,

Thousands of compatriots fled,

When the island lost its color,

The sea fell silent.

It mourns the brave warriors who bled for their country,

The exiled people,

The lost land,

Now, bestiality is devouring this land,

In this world, where is there pure land?

Fresh blood records

The historical traces of the struggle between justice and tyranny,

The blood of the nation's descendants—

The sea is roaring,

It sings the praises of heroic war,

It sings a lament,

For the sacrificed warriors,

It gives blessings

To those who live for war.
