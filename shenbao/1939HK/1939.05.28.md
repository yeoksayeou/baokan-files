### Striving for the Final Five Minutes – A Critique of Defeatism

— Guo Moruo

Ever since Wang Jingwei published his scandalous telegram on December 29th of last year, echoing the statement of the former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and openly advocating for peace, his arguments have already been subjected to the most severe criticism. On January 1st, the Central Party Headquarters permanently expelled him from the party and removed him from all his positions; this was the government's stern criticism of him. On March 21st, five patriotic individuals from overseas broke into Wang's residence in Hanoi at night, intending to eliminate this traitor for the country. Although Wang managed to escape death, his secretary, Zeng Zhongming, took his place; this was the people's stern criticism of him. He has received such consistent criticism from the nation from top to bottom. If Wang Jingwei still retained any sense of national consciousness, he should have been awakened and become cautious and silent. However, recently, he has disregarded everything and increasingly acted perversely. At the beginning of this month, he published an article called "Giving an Example" in his newspaper, the South China Daily in Hong Kong, in order to prove that his advocacy for peace was justified. He altered a confidential document from the central government and published it without authorization. Mr. Wu Zhihui's rebuttal to his article, titled "A Further Explanation of Wang Jingwei's 'Giving an Example'," can be said to be a very gratifying event. On April 8th, he published another article, "Reply to a Certain Overseas Chinese Gentleman," in which he wantonly slandered the soldiers fighting heroically at the front. According to him, it seems as if our brave soldiers are not even as good as the soldiers who lost the country during the Song and Ming dynasties. The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission recently issued an article in response to his letter, titled "The Crime of Wang Jingwei Slandering the Officers and Soldiers Fighting the War of Resistance," which severely criticized him. In addition to Wang Jingwei's own articles, his newspaper continues to publish many absurd statements, and his faction is also actively spreading rumors and confusing people, seemingly determined to destroy the entire situation of the War of Resistance. This should be something that all of our citizens cannot tolerate.

Wang Jingwei and his faction's argument for peace is always based on Konoe's so-called statement of "establishing a new order in East Asia." Looking at their statements, they consistently believe that this thing is completely reliable, which is truly a bit incredible. Konoe's statement was issued on December 21st of last year, and on December 26th, our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, already delivered an incisive speech, refuting it completely, saying that it was "a total exposure of all the planned content of the Japanese to destroy our country and annihilate our people; a total confession of all the wild hopes and conspiracies of the Japanese to completely swallow China, dominate East Asia, and then attempt to conquer the world." After such a refutation, people throughout the country understood the Japanese treacherous plan. However, Wang Jingwei still published a telegram on the 29th to echo it, saying that the proposed peace conditions were not conditions for national subjugation. He was dazzled by seeing Konoe say that he did not want China to cede territory or pay reparations. In fact, if China joined his so-called "new order," it would be no different from becoming a vassal state of Japan, and Konoe clearly demanded that Japanese citizens be able to freely reside and do business in the interior of China. This means that the entire land of China would become Japanese territory, so why would he still ask you to cede territory, and why would he still ask you to pay reparations? Wang Jingwei even sincerely believed that the demands in Konoe's statement for "China to recognize Japan's stationing of troops in specific locations for anti-communism, and to designate Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone," and "to grant Japan active facilitation in the development and utilization of resources in North China and Inner Mongolia," were so-called non-conditions for national subjugation, and that what Japan wanted was only Inner Mongolia and North China, and not Central and Southern China. The Japanese troops in Central and Southern China could be completely withdrawn, so even if China lost half of its territory, it would still have half left to serve as a small court in a corner, so it could not be considered national subjugation. Wang Jingwei was explaining it this way in his scandalous telegram. However, after the publication of his telegram, the Japanese side had already stated in the newspapers that he had "misunderstood." The statement in the newspapers was naturally not enough, so we can also reveal the formal responses of the Japanese Minister of the Army and Minister of the Navy in their parliament this year.

On January 30th of this year, at the Budget General Assembly of the House of Representatives, in response to a question from Representative Kita Ryokichi regarding the issue of stationing troops in China, the Japanese Army Minister Itagaki and Navy Minister Yonai both gave clear answers. Itagaki said that it was necessary to station troops in China for a considerable period of time, so the army was also considering and preparing facilities for semi-permanent troop stationing, and the Japanese troops' food, clothing, and housing would all be supplied by China. He also said, "Since the statement on December 22nd, there have been rumors outside that the Japanese army would withdraw troops from Central and Southern China. This is completely a rumor and absolutely untrue." He also added words such as "special solemn declaration" to this sentence. Yonai then praised Itagaki, saying that it was extremely appropriate for the Japanese army not to underestimate Central and Southern China, and that the Japanese navy would continue to strictly guard Central and Southern China even after the incident, in order to contribute to the "construction of a new order in East Asia." This can be considered clear and reliable evidence, right? We believe that Wang Jingwei and his faction must have seen such a clear answer. Therefore, Konoe's statement was already refuted completely by our leader in our country, and even the Japanese military department itself exposed its deception in Japan itself. However, Wang Jingwei still believes it, and after issuing the telegram, he still wants to "give an example" and "reply to a certain gentleman." In his "giving an example," he still says that Konoe's statement is not harsh and can be used as a basis for negotiation. In his "reply to a certain gentleman," he even more vigorously says that as long as the conditions for peace are not conditions for national subjugation, we should show the determination and courage to negotiate peace. His true intention, needless to say, is still to stubbornly insist that the conditions in Konoe's statement are not conditions for national subjugation. Please also see his "important statement" published in the South China Daily on April 9th. He said that since he had published the scandalous telegram, then all subsequent actions would be based on the telegram, consistently implementing the advocacy of peace. He also said that he opposed Japan changing its understanding and changing its conditions due to further military victories. He even had a hope for the Japanese authorities, hoping that "the Japanese authorities would deeply observe the facts, sincerely consult, and ensure that China is a country with complete territorial sovereignty." This is truly a dream. The conditions proposed by Konoe are no longer conditions, yet you are still afraid that they will "change" them. Our Republic of China, a dignified independent country, cannot be independent and autonomous, but instead wants to hope that the Japanese authorities will "make" us become "a country with complete territorial sovereignty." What kind of talk is this? Isn't this Wang Jingwei himself clearly expressing his heart's desire to kneel and surrender to Japan? Therefore, all of his actions, such as the Wang-Pingnuma Agreement, such as sending Gao Zongwu to Japan to beg for peace, such as secretly contacting [Japanese] in Shanghai and Hong Kong, these are all put aside for the moment. Just based on Wang Jingwei's own publicly published statements, it is enough to prove that he is intent on surrendering to Japan.

If you want to surrender, then just surrender. There is no harm in telling a little bit of the "truth" here. Why must you insist on saying that you are advocating for peace? Ultimately, this is a bit "dishonest."

China is not a warlike country. We also feel that we can make peace at any time, but there is one prerequisite, and that is for the Japanese to stop their aggression. Through our long-term War of Resistance, the Japanese crisis is becoming more and more significant every day. Consequently, some people within Japan are also aware of the danger to their own country and hope to seek peace with China in order to eliminate their own internal and external troubles. This is a fact, and we do not deny it. We even believe that this is the great harvest of China's War of Resistance, that our War of Resistance has forced Japan to the brink of crisis, and produced a desire for peace. However, the desire for peace within Japan has not yet formed a concrete force sufficient to subdue the current war-mongering faction of the Navy and Army ministries. This is also a clear fact that cannot be denied. Take Konoe as an example. He had just published his peace statement when he was soon forced to resign. Also, look at Japan's military budget for this year. Is there the slightest breath of peace and truce in it? Moreover, recently, Koiso, one of the leaders of the young officers, has newly joined the Japanese cabinet and is serving as the Minister of Colonial Affairs. All of these prove that the young officers who advocate war still maintain their control, and the desire for peace is still insufficient to sway the overall situation. Therefore, if we were to respond to the Japanese inducement for peace at this time, we would be falling for the Japanese trick of using Chinese to control Chinese and subjugating us without a fight. Such a pursuit of peace is no different from seeking surrender to Japan. I think even elementary school students can understand this. However, Wang Jingwei and his faction stubbornly and publicly advocate for it and openly engage in activities. What is their intention?

The country seems to be not unkind to Wang Jingwei and his faction, only expelling Wang's individual party membership and not punishing his party members, only removing Wang's individual positions and not issuing a warrant for his arrest. The Japanese land combat power has already been weakened, its finances are on the verge of bankruptcy, and it is surrounded by strong enemies on all sides at sea, and even competition in building warships makes it breathless. The Japanese are shouting "The national crisis is serious!" and "The national crisis has reached the most urgent juncture!" These are the facts, not their alarmist talk. Therefore, at present, we should intensify our counter-offensive forces in order to achieve our victorious future. We should be striving for the final five minutes. How can we relax at this time? Wang Jingwei is an extremely intelligent person. I don't believe that he cannot even see this point. Currently, it is also his own time to strive for the final five minutes. I hope that he will appreciate the country's kindness to him, remember the difficulty of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in creating the Republic of China, and remember the preciousness of the five thousand years of continuous national heritage. Do not continue to act perversely until the end.

### A Week's Trends in the World

— Pan Lang

From May 21st to 27th, Year 28

The battle-filled, revolutionary May has reached its final week.

This week's current events fully demonstrate the increasingly fierce struggle between two fronts. On the side of the aggressor nations: Germany and Italy have already cast off the "anti-communist" smokescreen, declaring a military alliance ready to attack democratic countries, while Japan, the ×× in the East, has made ××'s ×× against the rights and interests of various democratic countries like Britain, the United States, and France from Shanghai to the north, Tianjin, and as far south as the waters off Hong Kong! On the side of the democratic and peaceful nations, unity has made new progress, mainly in the form of the Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, which news agencies in Britain and France have declared is established. However, in reality, there are still many shortcomings that need to be addressed through continued effort, because the crisis of world war is still approaching its point of full-scale outbreak.

China's War of Resistance Against Japan has seen no major changes this week. Because of our insistence on unity and continued resistance, we have aroused greater international sympathy. The League of Nations has already recognized our country as an aggressed nation and appealed for assistance from member states, and our domestic military and political situation is also progressing day by day. However, the political offensives of the Japanese ×× and traitors have become more vicious and poisonous, so we must raise our vigilance and deliver even greater blows against them!

(1) Germany and Italy Sign Military Alliance

The long-rumored German-Italian military alliance was signed on May 22nd in Berlin by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The agreement contains three articles: (1) The two countries must maintain close contact with each other forever on (a) all issues related to the interests of each country, or (b) the overall situation in Europe, until both parties reach an agreement; (2) Should the international situation affect the common interests of the two countries, the two countries shall jointly consult to protect them; (3) If the security or other important rights of one of the two countries are threatened by external forces, the other country shall provide full assistance in political and diplomatic matters, and if one of the two countries is threatened by one or more powerful nations and is in danger of being drawn into war, it shall provide assistance with all its naval, land, and air forces. In addition, there are accompanying clauses: (1) Germany and Italy will step up cooperation on economic matters in both peacetime and wartime; (2) To implement the above-mentioned Articles 1 and 2, a permanent committee shall be established, under the command of the foreign ministers of both countries; (3) In the event of war, an armistice can only be concluded with the full consent of both countries; (4) The two countries must strive to maintain friendship with common allies, most notably Japan, "Manchukuo," and Hungary; (5) The validity period of this agreement is ten years.

Since the establishment of the "Anti-Comintern Pact," all the facts of crazily challenging and annexing the weak have proven that the three aggressor nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan had already formed a military alliance. Now, it is only because they want to intimidate Britain and France before the anti-aggression front is consolidated and expanded that they dare to remove the shameless anti-communist smokescreen and formally announce the establishment of this military alliance! At the same time, the annexation of certain "intermediate countries" in Europe can no longer satisfy the desires of the aggressors, and France and even the British mainland will immediately become the targets of aggression! As for Japan, the issue of participating in the German-Italian military alliance has caused a great uproar this week. According to a May 25th Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy, Oshima and Shiratori, even suddenly resigned because the authorities did not participate, and Foreign Minister Arita was even about to resign! But one must know that the vast majority of the Japanese people and informed people originally opposed joining the German-Italian Anti-Comintern Pact. Due to the seriousness of the crisis and difficulties of the invasion of China, internal strife and contradictions in Japan will inevitably become more intense. However, the Japanese ×× authorities' failure to participate immediately still involves their political conspiracy to induce and threaten Britain, France, and the United States. It would be a great mistake to only see that Japan has not participated and assume that the Far Eastern interests of the European and American powers are therefore guaranteed, or to believe that Japanese aggressors still have peaceful intentions!

(2) Dangerous Situation at Sea in the Far East

The events that have occurred in the Far East this week alone prove that the above assessment is quite close to the truth. The Japanese ××, while reserving the time to participate in the German-Italian military alliance, and even issuing some untrustworthy statements that they will never participate, are at the same time beginning a large-scale offensive against Britain, the United States, and France, preparing to seize all of their positions and interests in the Far East. What is manifested in concrete facts is mainly (1) the Gulangyu landing incident, where the Japanese side's attitude has become even more unreasonable and aggressive, and they have actually implemented a blockade starting on the 25th, cutting off transportation to Xiamen; (2) the seizure of concession incidents, the situation of oppression of the Shanghai concessions continues to be serious, and according to a Tianjin foreign dispatch on the 26th, the Japanese scheme to seize the Tianjin concessions is being actively planned; (3) In addition, the Japanese ×× also announced this week a comprehensive naval blockade of China's coast, implementing searches of all foreign ships, and on the 24th, the British merchant shipping company's "Rampura" was suddenly attacked one mile off the coast of Hong Kong, and the French postal ship "Athos II" was illegally searched seventeen miles off the coast of Hong Kong!

The greatest purpose of this kind of ×× behavior by the Japanese ×× is to seize the positions and interests of Britain, France, and the United States in China, to strengthen their rule, looting, and oppression in the areas they occupy in China: in order to alleviate their difficulties and prepare to conquer all of China and further dominate the Far East. The reason why the Japanese ×× dare to take such barbaric actions at a time when their international situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable and isolated is entirely because after the establishment of the German-Italian military alliance, Britain, France, and other countries vainly hoped that Japan would not participate, vainly hoped that they would not immediately confront the Japanese ××. Therefore, after the joint Anglo-French-American demonstration against Japan over the Gulangyu incident last week, instead of following up with resolute and further effective measures, they willingly retreated to a passive and inferior position to hold talks with the Japanese ××; this allowed the Japanese ×× to obtain unexpected benefits after their initial fear and to turn from an inferior to a dominant position. They greatly ×× × act while the four countries were talking on the Birmingham warship! In addition, the Shanghai concessions willingly serve the Japanese ××, forcing the Chinese and American newspapers that reported on aid to China, such as the Ta Mei and Chung Mei, to cease publication, arbitrarily accepting the opinions of the Wang faction ×× and the Japanese ×× and searching bookstores, arresting progressive journalist Mr. Hu Zhongchi, and so on. All of these ×× retreat measures are ways of handing the knife to the Japanese ×× and willingly sacrificing themselves! The fact that the Birmingham four-nation meeting yielded no results was expected, and what we are worried about is that if Britain, France, and other countries continue to adopt this attitude towards the Japanese ××, then a greater threat is probably right in front of us!

(3) The Reality of Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations

Just as the war clouds in the East and West are rising again, news agencies in Britain and France have reported progress in the Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance negotiations. Several news agencies and newspapers have even used phrases such as "after the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement." But what is the reality? ? It is true that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have made progress, as can be confirmed by the news from last week, especially after repeated discussions between Britain and France over the past week, followed by discussions in the British Cabinet this week. The attitude of the British authorities is indeed different than before. By the 26th of this month, French Foreign Minister Bonnet had handed the final draft of the joint Anglo-French proposal to Soviet Ambassador Suritz and asked for a prompt reply so that the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement could be announced as soon as possible. It is reported that the contents of this new proposal are roughly as follows: (1) The mutual assistance agreement will take effect when Britain, the Soviet Union, and France are invaded in European territory. However, before a formal agreement is reached, the three countries will issue a joint declaration stating that they will jointly deal with this threat. (2) Whenever the territory of any country guaranteed by the three countries is directly invaded, the three countries shall jointly consult and decide on actions. The question of which countries should be guaranteed is still to be discussed and decided. At the same time, any country that is invaded must resist first before it can enjoy the protection. (3) The three countries will convene a staff meeting to achieve the most efficient cooperation between the three countries' naval, land, and air forces. This proposal is generally closer to the principles of the mutual assistance agreement proposed by the Soviet Union, proving that the anti-fascist, anti-aggression, democratic, and peaceful front has indeed made great progress! However, this new proposal still has major, and it can be said, fundamental flaws. The first is that it does not include the Far East. London sources claim that if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement will immediately expand to the Far East, meaning that there is no need to organize a Far Eastern anti-aggression front at present. Of course, one should not overlook the psychology of the Anglo-French financial capital authorities ×× in expanding the power of the Soviet Union and China. However, the current Japanese ××'s increasing offensive against British and French positions and interests in the Far East can precisely explain that this kind of psychology should be washed away immediately, right? Second, this new proposal is still "half-hearted." They want to first use a joint declaration to suppress the German-Italian military alliance, and then proceed with formal negotiations on signing a mutual assistance agreement and holding a three-nation staff meeting. This kind of slow and relaxed step is certainly not enough to truly sanction the aggressors, nor is it enough to effectively save democracy and peace. However, we do not need to be overly worried. The needs of the international environment, the demands of the British and French people and the majority of informed authorities, the improvement of the Soviet Union's international reputation and the expansion of its influence due to its anti-fascist, anti-aggression peace policy, and the persistence and progress of China's united resistance will all force the formal establishment of the Anglo-Soviet-French mutual assistance agreement and the rapid realization of the expansion of the anti-aggression front to the Far East!

(4) Opening of the First Soviet Parliament

The first Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union in 1939 opened on the evening of the 25th at the Kremlin, with 1,600 delegates attending, representing more than 100 nationalities participating in the Soviet Socialist Federation. At a time when the old world is filled with the flames of a new war, this grand congress of the new socialist world will naturally be the focus of attention for people all over the world and will be wished for by all peaceful and just people and the vast oppressed masses. This congress will last for a week or ten days, and the topics of discussion will be foreign affairs, national defense, and the third five-year plan for the development of the national economy. Major decisions on these issues were already made at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from March 10th to 21st, which were endorsed by the entire Union and received worldwide attention. This congress will then be used by 1,600 representatives from all over the country to jointly decide on concrete measures to develop the Soviet Union's national strength, increase its international reputation, defend world peace, and realize the liberation movement to aid oppressed and invaded nations. When Finance Commissar Zverev announced in Congress that the military expenditure for 1939 was 40 billion rubles, accounting for about one-quarter of the total national budget, the attending delegates cheered for as long as nine minutes! Zverev also said that the Soviet Union's army and navy are now prepared with three times the strength to respond to the attacks of war merchants! From this, we can see the guarantee for the smooth implementation of the Soviet Union's internal and external policies.

The strength of the Soviet Union and the progress of our country's united resistance against Japan both tell the world: China and the Soviet Union, the two major countries, and their current strength, have become the mainstay force in defending world peace, upholding democratic politics, and safeguarding human culture! If the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement wants to succeed effectively, it cannot force or weigh the interests of China and the Soviet Union. China and the Soviet Union must achieve equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. However, to achieve this today, the first thing is for China and the Soviet Union to have even closer cooperation, and then to encourage Britain, the United States, and France to increase their friendship with China.

(5) League of Nations Resolution to Aid China and Sanction Japan

The credibility of the League of Nations has further declined due to the ×××××××× of its main member states, Britain and France, at the Munich Conference last year, but it is still the highest international organization currently aimed at maintaining world peace. Apart from the fascist aggressors, no one wants to see it destroyed, and everyone hopes that it will revive and fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, when the League of Nations convened this week, our country's representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, presented two requests to the International Executive Council on the 22nd in moving terms: First, to notify member states to expand their financial and material assistance to China in order to enhance its strength to resist aggression and carry out refugee relief work, to avoid any actions that would weaken China's resistance to aggression, to stop supplying Japan with war equipment and raw materials, especially aircraft and gasoline, and to restrict the import of Japanese goods. Second, to form a group to jointly promote the above steps. On the afternoon of the 24th, the League of Nations Executive Council held a closed-door meeting to discuss the resolution. The key points proposed by the drafting committee for our country's request were: (1) Member states should take all possible and effective measures to assist China's war of resistance; (2) The Executive Council is satisfied that a number of member states have been able to take consistent action on the Far East issue; (3) The Executive Council expresses its condolences for the steps taken by certain countries to aid China; (4) It hopes that countries will continue to aid China and increase the degree of aid; (5) It requests the consulates of member states in the Far East to study the practical effects of the steps taken by various countries to aid China. According to a Geneva dispatch on the 26th, the League of Nations Executive Council will close on the 27th, announce that China is an aggressed nation, and notify member states to strengthen individual aid to China. It is probably only up to this point that the League of Nations can do today. Although this cannot but make us feel regret, we can also, based on this decision of the League of Nations and based on the requests made by Representative Koo, step up our national diplomacy efforts and strive to promote the progress of the democratic and peaceful countries' movement to aid China and sanction Japan: The League of Nations' resolution will naturally be more beneficial to our country's activities to win foreign aid.

6. The Situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan This Week

Finally, although there have been no major changes on any battlefield in the War of Resistance Against Japan this week, there are still several characteristics worth reporting:

First, General Chen Cheng gave a clear report on the overall war situation at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in Chongqing on the 22nd. He said, "We do not hope to win this year or next year, but if we continue to fight for three to five years, we will definitely win the final victory." He said, "At present, Japan is not only unable to make any further progress, but is also trapped by the Chinese army in its occupied areas. In the rear areas of the Japanese army's front line, not counting guerrillas and mobile units, there are still more than 60 divisions of the Chinese regular army." General Chen finally clearly pointed out a very important point, he said, "The worst period in China has now passed! The beginning of the July 7th Incident was the most dangerous time for China, because at that time, opinions on war and peace were divided, and the national crisis was the most serious. Secondly, after the fall of Nanjing, China did suffer a tragic defeat in this battle. However, the Japanese army did not cause a decisive defeat to our army in the battles of Nanjing and Hankou. Now, this kind of opportunity will never come again!"

Second, × Army Distribution According to General Chen Cheng's report, the Japanese × currently have 30 infantry divisions and 3 cavalry brigades in China, distributed as follows: 3 divisions in Guangdong and Hainan Island, 3 divisions along the Jinghu Railway line and southern Anhui, 5 divisions on the border of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, 3 divisions east of Xiangfan, plus 1 cavalry brigade, 2 divisions in northern Anhui and along the Pinghan Road, 4 divisions along the Suhua and Jinpu Road lines, 3 and a half divisions in Hebei and Chahar, 2 divisions in eastern Henan and the Daoqing Road area, 1 division in Shanxi Province, and 2 divisions on the border of Shanxi and Suiyuan. Due to the increasing development of our × rear combat, it has become extremely difficult to move this force, and its offensive power is naturally even more limited.

Third, War Situation on Various Fronts (1) On the northern Hubei front, the × army concentrated 3 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry brigade in an attempt to encircle Tang Enbo's troops, but after three days and nights of fighting north of Zaoyang, the × army's encirclement plan was shattered. Now, Sun Lianzhong's and Liu Ruming's troops are stationed in Xinye, and Liu Heding's army is stationed in the Dabie Mountains. This week, up to the 26th, there were fierce battles in Zhehe, Anlu, Dabie Mountains, Guangcheng, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang, and more than 2,000 × were annihilated. The × has been unable to expand towards Xiangfan. (2) The fighting on the border of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, especially in the Dongting Lake area, has been fierce again this week, but the victories won by Chen Cheng's troops in Nanchang have caused the × to suffer injuries. Our counterattacks on Gaoan and Nanchang have further prevented the × army's plan to encircle our army on the border of Hunan and Hubei. In northern Hunan alone, the × launched a full-scale offensive on the 24th and 25th, and more than 1,000 of them were killed. (3) In Guangdong Province, our army has completed various deployments and is waiting for an opportunity to launch a counterattack. The guerrilla warfare in the province is also progressing day by day under the active planning and leadership of the provincial authorities. (4) On the Jiangnan battlefield, since the Jinhua Conference at the beginning of the month, our army has continued to win victories in counterattacks. One unit has already recovered Tongxiang, and another unit of the Jiangnan Army has crossed the river again to counterattack Hangzhou. (5) On the North China front, the fighting in Shanxi and Hebei continues to make progress, and on the Shandong front, Jinan has been counterattacked for days, and at one point, they even broke in.

Third, Japanese ×'s Difficulties The current difficulties of the Japanese × are becoming increasingly serious. In addition to the international situation, as mentioned earlier, militarily, they are increasingly feeling the shortage of troops, dangerous traffic, unfavorable terrain, difficulty in using troops, and the emptiness of the rear. Economically, they are facing financial poverty, reduced production, declining foreign trade, and the severance of the people's livelihood, leading to the repeated fall in the price of the yen. Politically, there is a high anti-war sentiment in the country, and the contradictions between warlords, financial groups, small and medium-sized asset holders, and civilians are growing. The contradictions and conflicts in the policies of the ruling class are all increasingly exposing the development of all the difficulties of the Japanese ×× in her barbaric and regressive war.

Fourth, the Conspiracies of the Japanese × and the Traitors What is even more serious is that these difficulties of the Japanese × cannot be overcome by Japanese strength alone. Therefore, they have recently been trying their best to use China's land, population, and production to alleviate their increasingly serious crisis. They are using political offensives in conjunction with military offensives to implement this new plan. The first step is to strengthen anti-communist and peace propaganda in order to alienate our internal unity (and then prevent national mobilization), prevent our political progress (prevent democratic politics and improve people's livelihood), and weaken our strength for long-term resistance. The next step is to step up the expulsion of European and American powers, seize concessions everywhere, control coastal shipping, then massively bomb Chongqing and plan the Xiangfan and Hubei-Hunan battles in order to consolidate and open up the occupied areas east of the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways. Finally, they will use Wang Jingwei and others to actively organize a puppet central party and government organs in an attempt to strengthen the rule, looting, and exploitation of the occupied areas in preparation for further conquering all of China and dominating the Far East. This new conspiracy has become more obvious this week. Here, we should repeat the conclusion of yesterday's editorial in this newspaper: "From this, it is already clear the importance of developing the rear battles of the × people in the occupied areas today! The importance of stepping up our efforts to combat anti-communist and peace fallacies and to combat all traitors, puppets, and the proactive pseudo-Central Committee such as Wang and others today! We should also understand the importance of stepping up national unity, stepping up national mobilization, and promoting political progress today!"

### Ten Warriors on the Western Front

— Special Correspondent in Southeastern Shanxi, Di Ping

The city was in turmoil like a boiling pot. Merchants hurriedly closed their doors, and the common people dared not walk on the streets, daring not move, and huddled in the alleys.

The seventy-plus troops of the invaders in the City God Temple all panicked, carried out machine guns and swept across the south gate and the city wall, and the rest of the troops gathered at the north gate, planning to flee north.

The three warriors ran out of bombs, and one was injured. Not daring to linger, they jumped off the city and ran south with all their might, of course, taking the small paths, and sometimes even rolling in the ditches.

Enough guns were fired in the city, and reconnaissance was carried out everywhere. There were no guerrillas in the city. All the clothes of the common people were stripped off for inspection. Until dusk, the city was still filled with an atmosphere of terror.

In the evening, the invaders were even more apprehensive and guarded.

Six, The Common People Learn to Be Clever

The guerrillas are clever, and the common people are also learning to be clever.

The area less than twenty miles from the railway line is the demarcation line, and at the same time, it is the guerrilla war zone.

One night, there was no moonlight at all, and the night was as black as pitch. From the villages in the east, west, south, and north, several young farmers came out, carrying several empty kerosene cans and holding several grinding bags, quietly walking into the dark wilderness.

In a village where the invaders' army was stationed, on the small curved waist trees in the fields outside the village, and in the dense thicket of small cypress trees, they hung kerosene cans and loaded them with bundles of firecrackers and gunpowder, installed firecrackers of unequal lengths, and tore open long strings of firecrackers and hung them on the withered stalks at various important intersections.

After the work was completed, people from the east and west villages met in a small agreed-upon floating ditch, smoked a few bags of dry tobacco, and dispersed to go home to sleep.

In the middle of the night, all was silent, and dense stars blinked their eyes. The dark wilderness hid humor and mystery.

East: Bang! Bang bang...

West: Bang! Bang bang...

South, north, all intersections sounded.

In the cypress forest: Boom! Snaps!

Why is the surrounding area full of gunfire?

The invaders, who never stood guard, panicked like rabbits frightened by a gunshot, and put on the pants of Hori's messed up trousers on the legs of the regular army.

The whole village was in turmoil. The invaders' troops were flustered and anxious, not knowing exactly what was going on. Machine guns were hurriedly set up, and the artillery horses were also stuffed into the shafts. All the baggage was loaded onto trucks.

The officer gave the order to resist desperately in the dark and take the opportunity to pull out at dawn.

The firecrackers outside the village continued to sound intermittently, and even got closer and closer. So the machine guns set up at the entrance of the village howled back to their hometowns like a gust of wind. The sound of gunfire outside never stopped, so the machine guns kept firing until dawn. In fact, they fought all night, and did not see any shadows. Before the east turned white, the sound of gunfire in the wilderness stopped.

When it got dark again, those few farmers went to retrieve the kerosene cans and swept up the ashes of the firecrackers.

A game is over. Men, women, old, and young in nearby villages are talking about this intense game war.

As for the residents of that occupied village, they are even more laughing for this game. (End)

### Intense Fighting Resumes in Northern Hubei, Our Troops Display Valor on the Shores of Dongting Lake

【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 27th】 The battle situation on the 27th remained unchanged. The [enemy] who again invaded Suizhou, Dahong Mountain, and Xinji were severely struck by our forces, suffering nearly a thousand casualties. Fierce fighting continues in the vicinity. One of our units has cut off the [enemy]'s communication lines near Zhongxiang. In the battle on the shores of Dongting Lake in Northern Hunan, we hold the advantage. The continuous mountains and lakes in the area provide our guerrilla forces with ideal cover, posing a significant threat to the [enemy].

【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 27th】 In the past ten days, our guerrillas have approached the outskirts of Guangzhou three times, eliminating many [enemy] troops.

【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 27th】 According to reports, our troops attacking Jinan have safely withdrawn. However, the [enemy] remains on guard day and night. Jinan city is alarmed multiple times a day. One of our units besieged Anqiu County, an important stronghold of the [enemy] in Eastern Shandong, and approached the city walls by the 24th, commencing the assault. A portion of our troops entered the city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the [enemy]. The [enemy] within the city numbers only three hundred and is on the verge of annihilation. Over a hundred [enemy] troops in the nearby Mount Mou Pseudo-Village were completely wiped out.

The Fierce Battle in Northern Hubei in Detail 【Central News Agency Dispatch from Suixian, 26th】 Regarding the situation in Central Hubei, the [enemy] and our troops have been facing off on the Suixian-Jingshan line for six months. At the beginning of this year, the [enemy] intended to capture Xiangfan and control Jingyi, advancing westward from Jingzhong and Hanyi in two directions. After occupying Xiushui and Jiukou, they were suppressed by our main forces in the Suijun area, unable to cross the river and advance west. The Suizao troops also launched an offensive last month, pressing towards Wuhan and threatening the city. The [enemy], left with no other choice, changed their strategy, concentrating all of their Central Hubei forces in Northern Hubei, attempting to encircle and annihilate our Suizao main force. As a result, the [enemy] deployed the 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions, as well as a cavalry brigade, along with hundreds of heavy artillery pieces and several squadrons of aircraft, to attack our left flank along the Suizao three routes, one along the Xianghua Road, one from Dahekou, and one northwards along the Xiang River from Zhongxiang. The [enemy] facing Suizao was met head-on and fiercely attacked by one of our units, preventing their success. The [enemy] in the Tianhekou area were also heavily damaged by our forces. They then moved from Zhongxiang, scurrying north towards the border, and spreading to areas like Xinye and Tanghe, attempting a large-scale encirclement to cut off our rear. Our forces had long detected their plot. On one hand, they bravely resisted along multiple routes, and on the other hand, they shifted positions. After fighting for over ten days, the [enemy] suffered heavy casualties. Their bodies were scattered in the valleys and wheat fields along the roads, totaling no fewer than two to three thousand. Subsequently, our forces deployed significant forces at Dahong Mountain and Tongbai, cutting off the [enemy]'s rear. At the same time, troops from all directions, including Zhongxiang, Eastern Hubei, and Southern Henan, encircled the [enemy] who had broken into Suizao. Our main force also launched a fierce counterattack. The [enemy], with unstable footing, heavy casualties, and deep in the mire, coupled with cut-off food supplies and no resources to plunder in the wild, began setting fire to the cities of Suizao on the 17th and retreated fiercely towards Anlu and Yingshan, leaving corpses scattered along the way, and abandoning many wounded soldiers, supplies, horses. The [enemy]'s plan to encircle and annihilate our forces ultimately failed. As a result, the two county towns of Suizao were successively recovered on the 18th and 19th. It was determined that in this campaign, the [enemy] relied on the most stubborn 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions as their main force, rushing around wildly with great ferocity. However, the result was over 20,000 casualties. Although we suffered considerable sacrifices, we achieved the goal of attrition warfare and inflicted significant damage on the [enemy], shattering their scheme of encirclement and annihilation. This is truly a great victory in our second phase of the War of Resistance.

Defeating the [Enemy] North of the Xinqiang River 【Central News Agency Dispatch from Guilin, 27th, 2:00 PM】 On the 25th, the [enemy] again advanced in two columns, each with three hundred troops, towards our Tangjiapai head position, launching an attack on the stronghold. After our counterattack, the [enemy] suffered significant damage. The [enemy] at the river mouth was repelled. The [enemy] at Tangjiapai head is still engaged in fierce fighting with our troops.

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Miluo, 27th】 On the 26th, the [enemy] advanced on Kou (10 kilometers northeast of Xinqiang) and Yanjiadashan (6 kilometers northwest of Xinqiang), with six to seven hundred troops each. After our separate counterattacks, by noon on the 27th, in the Kou area, one of our divisions dispatched a capable force to circle around to the [enemy]'s rear from the foot of Mount Dayun, launching a two-pronged attack with our troops at the front. The [enemy] suffered over 400 casualties and retreated to Wujiang Bridge. At present, our troops in Kou have joined forces with the units that entered the [enemy]'s rear, and are pursuing that [enemy] force. In the Yanjiadashan area, the [enemy], repeatedly frustrated in their attacks, switched to defending their strongholds on the 27th, only occasionally using artillery to shell our positions aimlessly, hoping to impede our troops' advance.

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Changde, 27th】 Frontline reports indicate that the [enemy] troops in Yueyang have been increasing in numbers in the past two days. The [enemy] in Xitang once launched a fierce attack on us yesterday, immediately resulting in intense fighting. After a long stalemate, our position remained unmoved. The [enemy], unable to succeed, ceased their attack and retreated to that area.

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Changde, 27th】 Huarong telephone report: At noon on the 25th, four [enemy] small motorboats sailed from Yueyang to the vicinity of Qiganzui along the shore of Dongting Lake, attempting to land. They were discovered by our defending troops, who immediately opened fire fiercely. The [enemy] used machine guns for cover and fled backwards.

Guerrilla Warfare on the Nanxun Line 【Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Location, 26th】 Our certain guerrilla unit, after transforming from a lone force in Mount Lu, has mostly gathered in the Minshan Mountains, establishing close ties with the existing troops in the mountains. Their momentum is even greater than before, and they frequently attack the [enemy] on the Nanxun Line. The [enemy] army considers them a thorn in their side and has attempted to encircle and attack them, but they have suffered heavy losses. Starting on the morning of the 21st, the [enemy] again gathered over eight hundred of their remaining troops, along with over ten artillery pieces, and launched a fierce attack on Lingshangwang, an important stronghold in the Minshan Mountains, in three routes. One route, with approximately four hundred [enemy] troops, attacked Chenzhuang and Dielong from Heliyu, attacking the east of Lingshangwang. Another route, with over two hundred [enemy] troops,迂迴ed around the Minshan Mountains, attacking the north of Lingshangwang. Another route, with approximately two hundred [enemy] troops, attacked the south of Lingshangwang from Pingfeng. Their artillery was deployed in the Xiaoyangpu and Quanshui Cave area, concentrating firepower to bombard Lingshangwang fiercely, firing over a thousand rounds, to provide cover for the [enemy] infantry's advance. The certain battalion commander of our unit commanded his troops to counterattack separately. After fierce fighting for over an hour, the [enemy]'s artillery fire was too intense, causing both the Dawulong and Chenzhuang lines of defense to be broken through. Our troops retreated to the positions near Lingshangwang, resisting strongly. Fierce fighting continued until noon, with over ten hand-to-hand combats. One of our companies suffered relatively heavy casualties and retreated again to the Jinpangu Temple position, the highest peak of the Minshan Mountains. The [enemy] continued their fierce assault, but we relied on the advantageous terrain and our soldiers fought bravely, with one soldier acting as a hundred, holding out until night. The [enemy] ultimately failed to succeed. A certain general commander of our unit urgently deployed certain two battalions, and coordinated with the Jiuduan De'an people's self-defense force, leading them personally, rushing to their aid overnight, and using the strategy of besieging Wei to rescue Zhao, launching fierce attacks on the [enemy]'s rear in Heliyu, Huanglaomen, Mahuiling, and Daoshimen in four routes. At the same time, our troops trapped in Jinpangu Temple also seized the opportunity to counterattack. The [enemy]'s forces were attacked from the back and front, and gradually became unable to withstand the pressure, collapsing and retreating. By noon on the 22nd, after bloody battles, we finally recovered the stronghold of Lingshangwang, and then took advantage of the momentum to pursue and kill, with the remaining [enemy] fleeing back to Heliyu, Jigongling, and other places. The fierceness of this battle can be said to be unprecedented. Our loyal and brave generals, neither eating nor drinking, bathed themselves in artillery fire for two days and nights, and finally made the stubborn [enemy] submit. It is estimated that over a hundred [enemy] troops were killed or wounded, and one light machine gun, dozens of rifles, and countless other war materials were seized. We also suffered over thirty casualties of officers and soldiers.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Serious Stance Rejects the [Enemy]'s Demands, Negotiations Conclude

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 26th】 Shanghai dispatch: Regarding the concession issue, the Municipal Council believes that negotiations on the various demands put forward by the Japanese side have come to an end. At present, the Municipal Council's attitude towards negotiations with the Japanese side is extremely serious. The Municipal Council resolutely refuses to accept the demands put forward by the Japanese side that violate the land regulations and the agreements signed with the National Government. The reason is that the land regulations and the agreements signed by the concession and the National Government were signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries with the National Government. The Municipal Council has no right to refuse or agree to them. Therefore, regarding the demands put forward by the Japanese side that involve the above two items, the Municipal Council will only report them to the consular body, and the Japanese side should directly negotiate with the governments of various countries. The Municipal Council's reply to the demands put forward by the Japanese side is also based on the above principles, it is said.

The Shanghai Shooting Case

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Shanghai dispatch: At 7:30 AM on the 27th, a shooting occurred in room 122 of the Hubei Andong Hotel in the Public Concession. A Hubei native named Xu Zhifu was shot once in the waist and once in the chest, dying from his injuries. Another Yangzhong County native named Gu Tianming was shot once in the right arm. The two shooters fled after achieving their objective. According to investigations, Gu confessed to being the section chief of the pseudo-Yangzhong County government, and Xu was a silk cocoon merchant. They came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang four days ago to negotiate a transaction. As for the reason for the killing, it is speculated that it was due to a dispute over business.

Our Attack on Wusong

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Shanghai dispatch: Our guerrilla teams in the suburbs of Baoshan have been advancing towards Wusong for days. It is heard that our troops encountered the [enemy] garrison on the evening of the 25th. Our large units arrived at night and joined the battle. The [enemy] is currently constructing fortifications in the city and along the river to prevent a major battle from breaking out. On the 26th, all trains between Shanghai and Songjiang were suspended, while trains carrying large numbers of [enemy] troops were sent to Wusong as reinforcements.

### The [Enemy]'s Blockade of Our Coastline, the United Kingdom and France Maintain a Consistent Attitude, the French Government Instructs Commander Douke to Protest Strongly Against the Interception of French Mail, the US Authorities Are Also Closely Monitoring

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Paris, 27th】 The French government has ordered its commander of the Asian fleet to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese side regarding the Japanese side's order for the French ship "Alinmeier" to stop sailing. The French government is studying the Japanese side's blockade of the Chinese coast, and the final attitude will be decided in consultation with the United Kingdom. It is heard that the United Kingdom has decided to safeguard its rights.

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 25th】 The State Department is closely monitoring the attitude of the Japanese Navy towards foreign merchant ships on the Chinese coast. So far, no American merchant ships have been intercepted. According to observations from people close to the State Department, the government will still closely monitor the development of the situation. However, it is not convenient to come forward to participate in the retaliatory measures taken by the United Kingdom and France for the time being. As far as Japan's implementation of the blockade of the Chinese coast is concerned, the State Department has not received any credible information. It is rumored that the British government has consulted with the United States on countermeasures, which is also not true.

### Gulangyu Negotiations, the Four-Nation Naval Conference Fails, Future Negotiations to be Handled by the Consular Corps

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Shanghai external dispatch: According to the US naval authorities here, the four-nation naval conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan in Gulangyu ended without result, and will probably be handled by the diplomatic representatives of each country. The Domei News Agency's Tokyo dispatch severely criticized the conference, denouncing it as "fraudulent", its purpose being to shift the responsibility for the stalemate in the negotiations to the consular corps.

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Tokyo external dispatch: According to Xiamen Japanese sources, the Japanese Consul General Uchida visited Hockert, the acting Director-General of the Municipal Council, yesterday to exchange views on ways to ease the situation in Gulangyu, paying particular attention to the five demands for reform of the Municipal Council put forward by the Japanese side. Hockert promised to submit a reply within a few days after consulting with the directors.

### Our Negotiations with British Business Circles on the Use of Loans, Totaling 3 Million Pounds, to Purchase Military Supplies and Rolling Stock

【Haitong News Agency Dispatch from London, 27th】 The British government recently loaned 3 million British pounds to the National Government of China. The Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom and British business circles have recently been discussing the issue of the allocation of the loan. According to the British Parliament, the British government has been authorized to loan 10 million pounds to foreign governments, and must obtain a special permit from Parliament. The above-mentioned 3 million pounds is allocated from the 10 million pounds. Any losses suffered by British business circles in trade with China can be compensated for. British commercial firms will export various commodities to China, especially military supplies and military vehicles, which will account for the majority. In the future, if there are any losses, the British government will bear 75%. According to private estimates, 30% of the loan, or 900,000 pounds, has already been utilized.

### Southern Fujian, Haicheng, Auctioning of Plaques, Buyers are Very Enthusiastic

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Yong'an, 26th】 Haicheng County in Southern Fujian has recently promoted an auction movement. The New Life Movement Association has specially initiated the auction of plaques. The method is to have local party, government, military, and social leaders write plaques and invite major clan groups to purchase them through voluntary donations. Elders of each clan have stated that because of the brutal invasion by the [enemy], the ancestral graves and temples of our ancestors have also been ravaged, which is the greatest shame for all descendants of Yan and Huang. This move is to report to the nation, bring honor to the clan, and the ancestral halls of each clan mostly still have property. By gathering strength, the capacity of resisting the enemy may be enhanced, which is easy to achieve. Therefore, they are enthusiastically supporting it. Currently, over thirty clans in the county have registered to purchase ancestral halls. One plaque, with the highest price of one thousand yuan, has already raised 17,700 yuan. If this move can be promoted nationwide, tens of millions of dollars can be easily raised, which will be beneficial to the War of Resistance, nothing could be better. It also serves as a way for the elders and gentry in various places to repay the nation and protect their homes both spiritually and materially.

### The Plunge of the Japanese Yen is Difficult to Reverse, the [Enemy]'s Economic Straits are Fully Exposed

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 26th】 Shanghai dispatch: Due to runaway inflation, the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai has plummeted, once tragically falling to 88 cents (i.e., 100 Japanese yen is only equivalent to 88 yuan of Chinese currency). The [enemy] authorities in Shanghai are urgently seeking remedies and ordered the puppet Huaxing Bank to make large purchases, causing the price to rise from 88 yuan to 93 yuan, reaching a high rate of 997 yuan. However, the puppet bank then stopped purchasing, and by noon on the 26th, it had fallen back to 94 yuan and 20 cents. At the same time, the puppet currency of Special Xing also fell to 155 yuan before it could be exchanged for 100 yuan of legal tender. The number of [enemy] banknotes in Shanghai has never been accurately accounted for. Previously, there were only 10 million yuan, but according to reliable investigations, it has reached as much as 50 million to 100 million yuan. The number of banknotes issued in [enemy] territory has also increased dramatically. According to statistics, the amount of [enemy] currency in circulation in January 1937 was only 1.5 billion yen, but by the end of last year, it had increased to 2.5 billion yen, and now it has increased to 2.9 billion yen. Regarding the exchange rate between the [enemy] currency and the legal tender, between June and July of last year, it was 130 yuan of legal tender for 100 yen of [enemy] currency, and in September it was 120 yuan. In May of this year, it fell to par, and has since continued to decline, becoming the current situation. According to financial observers, the [enemy] has no way to reverse the runaway inflation. The price of the [enemy] currency will continue to decline and become more volatile, and the economic exhaustion of the [enemy] is now fully exposed. It can be seen that the period of being mired in economic troubles is approaching.

【Reuters Dispatch from Shanghai, 27th】 This morning, the Japanese yen showed a slight improvement. The market price for purchases was 97 cents of Chinese currency per Japanese yen, an increase of two cents compared to yesterday morning.

Two Kinds of Puppet Currency Divided by the River 【Shanghai Correspondence】 The members of the Investigation Committee organized by the puppet "United Reserve Bank" and the liaison department of the Japanese Koa-in will come to Shanghai soon to discuss the cooperation between the "Lianhua" currency and the new "Hongkou" currency with the newly established puppet "Huaxing Commercial Bank." According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, a Tokyo-based news organization, the puppet regimes in Beiping and Nanjing have agreed in principle that the two puppet currencies should be interconnected at a fixed ratio, but both currencies should maintain a fixed and non-excessive transitional area. The Japanese financial community expects that the circulation areas of the two puppet currencies will be divided along the Yellow River, with the "Lianzhun" currency circulating north of the river and the "Hongkou" currency circulating south of the river.

### Remembering Zhongshan Taide (Part Two)

— Zhang Changren

A Pioneer Among Anti-War Japanese Soldiers

It was around mid-April that Battalion Commander Yang sent someone to escort Zhongshan to see General Fan Songfu. General Fan had already begun commanding his troops, entering the triangular area of ​​Wuchang, Xianning, and Yangxin in northern Jiangxi and Hunan, attacking the flanks and rears of the Japanese army at any time and place. They walked for eight days, finally meeting Fan in the dense forests between Xiushui and Tongshan. Li Panhou, the chief of staff of Fan's troops, and Lei Zhen, a staff officer who was a student at Japan University, treated him very well, and he was very grateful.

He took out a stack of inscriptions from his small bag and handed me two of them. He smiled and wrote with a pencil on a notepad: "General Fan Songfu wrote it for me after inviting me to drink." The first one read:

"Vast is the universe, boundless are the mountains and rivers. Striving for cities and seizing land, how long does human life last?!

May your family be harmonious, and may you find joy in your wife and children. Enjoy yourself and maintain heavenly harmony.

To my friend Zhongshan, From Fan Songfu, in ancient style"

Another one was given to him by the commander of the 4th Security Regiment, which read:

"Understanding the [enemy]'s aggressive nature is wisdom; not participating in blind wars is benevolence; resolutely leaving one's home country is courage. Friend, you are a pioneer of the god of peace, a foreseer of the Japanese people, and we have infinite respect for you. From now on, let us work together to make the Japanese military clique realize their mistakes and change their ambitions. Then their achievement will be paramount."

I asked him about his impressions of the Sino-Japanese War. He also said, "Last month, in the headquarters of General Fan Songdong, I wrote a 'Reflection' in Japanese, but only those who can read Japanese can understand it. That night, I translated it into my rough Chinese under the moonlight, but I always felt that it didn't express my meaning well."

The "Reflection" was written sloppily on maobian paper with a brush:

"Today's war between China and Japan is the realization of a dream—that is, the continental policy of Japanese capitalism. Their government uses the beautiful words 'loyalty to the emperor and love for the country' for false propaganda to manipulate the people. Starting an aggressive war is a blind policy in which we brothers go to our deaths for nothing. The military and capitalists tell us, 'Our national life is guaranteed only by peace in the East,' but our comrades' experiences are completely the opposite. If we really want peace in the East, can we achieve it by killing indiscriminately in this way? We have become running dogs of the invaders. Even if we die in battle, peace will not be achieved. The high officials of the military receive gold badges and are smug; the financial cliques are making profits because of the war, and their pockets are full. We so-called 'noble sacrifices' are giving our lives in vain. We comrades, for the sake of the country, for the sake of our families, and for the sake of opening ourselves up, must overthrow the violent military and financial cliques. Let us unite and launch a movement against aggression."—April 22.

When asked about his life in the army, he said that it was much worse than when he first came to China. His monthly salary was 180 Japanese yen. When spending money in China, he had to exchange it for military notes first. In this way, it was as if he was returning his salary to the military and financial cliques again. What was even more painful was the situation of the Chinese people in the occupied areas, who could only exchange the products they had obtained with blood and sweat for worthless military notes. In the occupied areas, even a regimental commander could issue banknotes, print them on any piece of paper, stamp them with a private seal, and force the Chinese people to use them. This is something that no country in the world could think of, but the Japanese warlords did. He had been fighting in China for about eight months and had accumulated savings of 1,625 Japanese yen, which he had remitted to his old mother before he fled.

Because he was a trainee officer in the staff department, he knew the situation of the Japanese army in southern Hubei and northern Hunan very clearly. He made a report of about 50,000 words to the staff office of the commander. (This reporter had the privilege of reading it first, but it cannot be published for the time being because it concerns military secrets.) Zhongshan believed that our country's destruction of roads to hinder the advance of the Japanese army had gradually succeeded. He believed that Chinese regular troops should penetrate as deeply as possible into the rear of the Japanese army; Chinese spies should establish closer relations with various puppet organizations in the Japanese-occupied areas to scout out the [enemy]'s situation and assist the work of the national army. He also said: "The anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers has already gone from ideological to action. I hope to organize them in battle. China is not far from winning the war against Japan, whether militarily, politically, or economically."

When we shook hands to say goodbye, the reporter told him that he might be able to go to the rear in Guilin to rest for a while in the next few days. He asked, "How many miles is it from Changsha to Guilin?" He was very happy that he could travel by car and train because he had sores on his feet and had difficulty walking.

The press in Changsha is preparing to convene a large welcome meeting for the arrival of Zhongshan Taide with the cultural circles in Changsha in the coming days. May 15, in Changsha.

### Losses of [Enemy] Aircraft in Raids on Chongqing, the [Enemy] Admits to the Recent Loss of One Aircraft, Two Majors, Naito and Masuda, and Others Were Executed

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 6th】 External dispatch from Shanghai: A Japanese naval spokesman admitted today that one [enemy] aircraft was lost during the [enemy] air raid on Chongqing on the evening of the 25th. It is said that a total of two batches of [enemy] aircraft raided Chongqing that day, the first batch with 30 aircraft and the second batch with 15 aircraft. Chinese anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce, and one [enemy] aircraft was shot down, it is said.

【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th】 According to reliable information, regarding the aerial attacks launched by Lieutenant Colonel Okuda Kikuji of the [enemy] Naval Air Corps, which targeted our Hengyang, Changsha, Zhijiang, Kunming, Yushan, and Guixi urban areas with ground attack aircraft commanded by Majors Naito Koka and Masuda Dan of the [enemy] squadrons on the 4th, 5th, 8th, and 10th, the indiscriminate use of incendiary bombs on our undefended urban areas served only to strengthen the anti-war sentiment among our rear areas' population. Later, on the 3rd, 4th, and 12th, they launched a series of attacks that heavily bombed the downtown area of Chongqing. The bombing has also affected diplomatic missions and other friendly entities, causing the condemnation of international entities. According to news released by the [enemy] after the incident on the 3rd, two [enemy] aircraft shot down by our troops over Chongqing airspace were the leading aircraft of the first squadron and the second squadron piloted by Majors Naito and Masuda, respectively. Killed were a total of fourteen men including Majors Naito and Masuda, and Petty Officers Ishii and Kanemoto, [enemy] pilots executed. Listeners rejoiced. Majors Naito and Masuda, both 36 years old this year, graduated from the [enemy]'s Naval Aviation School. They served as ensign candidates in July of Taisho 13, and were commissioned as ensigns in December of Taisho 14. They were appointed as lieutenants in December of Showa 2 and captains in December of Showa 5, and were promoted to majors after the war. They were among the few long-distance aviators and mechanical talents in the [enemy] navy. Now that they have all died in battle, it is a great loss for the [enemy].

【Associated Press Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 According to an officer on the American ship U.S.S Tutuila anchored off the south bank of Chongqing who spoke to a reporter from this agency, he saw a Japanese plane being shot down the other day during the bombing of Chongqing. After the Japanese planes finished bombing Chongqing, they also dropped multiple bombs on Chinese airfields, but did not damage any Chinese planes on the ground. At that time, the ship's officers saw a [enemy] aircraft flying towards the ship, seemingly with the intention of attacking. They ordered all officers and soldiers to prepare their guns for defense, and they would fire back if the [enemy] aircraft charged down to bomb them. However, since the Japanese heavy bombers were from Hankou, they could not carry out a bombing operation. Therefore, the American ship's officers did not expect them to attack. A bomb was also dropped on the foreign-run wounded soldier transport station in Chongqing, destroying the entire building, but all the staff were safe.

### Returning from Inspecting the Jiangnan Guerrilla Areas: Zhou Enlai Discusses the New Situation (Part 1) Organizing the Masses After × to Launch a National Combat Turning × into the Frontline, Crushing Economic Conspiracies

[Chongqing, 22nd Dispatch] According to an Associated Press report, General Zhou Enlai, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission, recently returned from inspecting the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. In a conversation with visitors, he stated, "Our country's strategy lies in utilizing manpower and material resources to contend with the Japanese ×, so that Japan's strategy of conquering China cannot be realized." The Japanese × have not yet changed their fundamental policy of subjugating our country, nor have they changed their determination to eliminate the interests of foreigners in China.

× Military Strategy According to Zhou, "The new policy of the Japanese × has the support of Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Japanese financiers and bankers. The purpose of this policy is to eliminate the Chinese resistance forces in their occupied areas and to advance further when the opportunity arises." Currently, 85% of the Japanese army in China is engaged in clearing up the rear areas. Therefore, in the past two months, the Japanese army has only launched two large-scale battles. However, this strategy of the Japanese side has not been successful. Generally speaking, we have been able to maintain our existing positions and have also dispatched a large number of regular troops to the rear of the Japanese army.

Our Military Strategy Our strategy is to launch guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Japanese army. Many people believe that this tactic has not developed much to date, but in fact, it has made considerable progress. Our goal is to establish multiple operational bases in the rear of the Japanese army to deplete × people's strength and to thwart the Japanese attempts to exploit Chinese resources to replenish the depleted Japanese economy. After the establishment of these guerrilla military bases, the × army has found it difficult to cope and has been unable to advance. As a result, we have greater freedom. These guerrilla warfare military bases are not only established in mountainous areas, such as the Wutai Mountains in Shanxi Province, but also on plains. For example, in the plain area near Wuhu, 55 miles wide and 75 miles long, they have managed to tie down the strength of an entire Japanese division. The Japanese army in that area has been forced to build countless fortifications around it. The Japanese army tied down in the Wutai Mountains amounts to as many as 50,000 men. The Japanese side has launched four sieges against this area, but all have failed. A small team of plain guerrillas can kill about ten Japanese soldiers every day. If each area kills 100 Japanese soldiers every day, then if 100 such bases can be established, 360,000 Japanese soldiers can be killed each year.

### League of Nations Council Passes Resolution on Aid to China, Invites United States to Intensify Assistance Far East Situation is Developing

[Reuters, Geneva, 27th] The League of Nations Council held a meeting this morning and passed a resolution on assisting China in its resistance against Japan. It invited the United States to intensify all possible assistance to China. The resolution also suggested that the diplomatic representatives of member states submit reports on the indiscriminate bombing of innocent people. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo expressed dissatisfaction with the resolution, but indicated that he would accept it on the condition that this issue would still be included on the agenda at the next meeting. Koo had requested a collective boycott of the transport of aircraft and oil to Japan.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 26th] The League of Nations Council is scheduled to hold a public meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow to pass a resolution on the application submitted by China. In addition, regarding the issue of fortifying the Aaland Islands in the Baltic Sea, after the Soviet government requested an extension for discussion, the rapporteur for the case, Belgian representative Mr. Ergin, suggested to the Council that it temporarily adjourn for two or three weeks to allow Sweden and Finland to conduct direct negotiations with the Soviet Union. The meeting would then be reconvened.

[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union opposes the fortification of the Aaland Islands (which belong to Finland in the northeastern part of the Baltic Sea and are closest to Swedish territorial waters). Britain and France are both willing to back the Soviet Union. According to the British and French mutual assistance plan, the two countries intend to ask the Soviet Union to find a way to blockade German shipping in the Baltic Sea, so that the German navy will be busy defending itself in the Baltic Sea. As for the Soviet Union, it believes that if the Aaland Islands are fortified, they will be occupied by Germany in the event of war, making it impossible for the Soviet Baltic Fleet to operate.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] According to opinions in political circles here, after the conclusion of the alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the three countries will adopt a more active policy in the Far East. This alliance strengthens the Soviet Union's position in Europe and allows it to implement a forward policy on its eastern border. It is widely believed that the war materials that the Soviet Union transports to China via Xinjiang will soon increase substantially. Britain will also adopt a tougher Far East policy after the situation in Europe clarifies. Political circles here believe that the recent landing of British, American, and French sailors in Gulangyu is sufficient to indicate the future trend of development.

The French Chargé d'Affaires will accompany the British Ambassador. It is rumored that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin will also be present.

In addition, the Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement may also be concluded within the next week.

As for the Franco-Turkish negotiations, they are currently being accelerated. According to a report from London by the "Le Radical" newspaper, Britain, after concluding the three-country agreement, is preparing to expand the anti-aggression front and convene a world peace conference.

Proposals to the Soviet Union Notified to Various Countries

[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] The governments of Eastern European countries that have accepted British and French guarantees, as well as the governments of British Dominions and the United States government, have all received notes outlining the new British proposals to the Soviet Union. The British Ambassador to Poland and the British Minister to Romania have notified the governments of Poland and Romania, respectively, of the content of the outline before the new proposals are sent to Moscow. At the same time, Dominion Minister Inskip has also informed the High Commissioners of the various Dominions in London of the outline of the British new plan. It is rumored that the governments of various Dominions have expressed that if the British government firmly believes that this new policy will succeed, the various Dominions will not oppose it. According to official sources here, the British new plan includes a provision that if Britain and France are drawn into the vortex of war due to fulfilling their guarantees, the Soviet Union should immediately come to their aid. However, it is rumored that Poland and Romania both demand a firm guarantee that if Soviet assistance is needed in the future due to war, Soviet troops must withdraw from Polish territory immediately after the end of the war.

The note contains about 400 words. If the Soviet Union accepts it, it will become a formal alliance treaty. Britain believes that the Soviet Union will accept it.

### Difficulties in German Industrial Raw Material Production Increased Burden of Transportation After Annexing Three Regions of Czechoslovakia

[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] According to the report of the economic investigation agency for the first three months of this year, German industry is currently facing serious problems in terms of labor, raw materials, and transportation. The number of laborers has exceeded 21 million, but the working hours of workers in the construction, mining, and agricultural industries have also been extended. In terms of raw materials, domestic production has difficulties in both quantity and form. Although iron ore has been mined, it cannot be used to manufacture the most in-demand steel due to its sulfur content. Since Germany strengthened the Western Wall and annexed the Sudetenland, Bohemia, and Moravia, the burden of transportation has increased even more. It is rumored that the production volume of various industries has "increased, but this progress has been achieved through great effort and huge expense."

### Polish Ambassador to Britain Returned to London Day Before Yesterday

However, whether British Army Minister Hore-Belisha will visit Soviet Russia has not yet been arranged. However, non-official circles speculate that Hore-Belisha will visit Soviet Russia in return and will also visit the Red Army headquarters.

[Haitong, London, 27th] It is rumored that Army Minister Hore-Belisha intends to make a trip to Moscow, but this has not yet been confirmed by the War Office. According to usually reliable sources, if the European situation is good, Hore-Belisha may accept the Soviet invitation and go to Moscow. Political circles here expect that Voroshilov will accept the British government's invitation and come to London to observe the British Army's grand exercises in September. Political circles also believe that this move is sufficient to indicate that the new plan that the British government sent to the Soviet Union yesterday must have been accepted by the Soviet side, and there will not be any further difficulties in terms of details.

### US House to Pass Neutrality Act Amendment

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Hull today discussed the issue of American neutrality with several congressmen from both parties for two hours. Afterwards, Congressmen Saul and Bloom told people that, according to their predictions, the House of Representatives will pass a bill in the next few weeks with the following contents: (1) Abolish the old regulations regarding the transportation of munitions and the embargo on munitions; (2) Grant the president the power to designate "dangerous areas" in order to prohibit ships from sailing to those areas; (3) Prohibit loans to belligerent countries; (4) Retain control over the export of munitions, in a way that requires ownership to be transferred before the munitions are exported at American ports. Bloom also stated that the committee on this matter had also been studying a similar bill in the past few weeks. For the convenience of discussion, a separate printed copy of the bill has been made as a blueprint for the members to study. Some people also believe that Hull's determination to ask the House of Representatives to pass a bill is quite firm, because the American government has the strongest influence in the House of Representatives. As for the Senate, there is also a bill proposed by Senator Key Pittman. Key Pittman admitted that the motivation for proposing the bill was also influenced by the State Department. It is said that Hull's main goal is to abolish the embargo on munitions. Key Pittman's bill also has the same suggestion, but Hull himself prefers the bill in the House of Representatives.

### Germany's Plot for Danzig More Urgent Hitler Instructs Anti-Polish Policy Propaganda to Abolish Polish-Danzig Agreements

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 25th] Well-informed sources here have announced that German leader Hitler has already decided on a policy for the issue of the city of Danzig, that is, in the next few months, arrangements should be made in both political and spiritual aspects, and then action should be taken once the opportunity is ripe. Yesterday, when he met with Forster, the leader of the National Socialist Party in the Free City of Danzig, in Berlin, he personally gave instructions on the policies that the National Socialist Party should implement in the city. It is rumored that his intention is to announce the abolition of all agreements signed between Poland and the city of Danzig after August 15, 1933. In addition, the leader also ordered the promotion of the following measures: (1) Actively boycott shops and companies established by Poles in the city; (2) Danzig newspapers should attack Poland and accuse it of hindering normal traffic between the city and the German province of Pomerania. All these instructions have been secretly implemented after Forster returned to the city of Danzig today. For example, the National Socialist Party organ, the Danziger Vorposten newspaper, began to comment today on the agreement of August 15, 1933, and blamed Poland for not fulfilling its treaty obligations, advocating that it be abolished. Such promotion is worthy of attention.

His wonderful music is truly a source of inspiration for countless people.

Short Commentary

### Guangdong Province Adjusts Taxes

According to reports, Guangdong Province is working hard to adjust taxes throughout the province to meet current needs, and is formulating wartime tax rules, with a focus on "increasing military reserves, fostering civil power, and considering both." This is a very noteworthy event.

Since the Japanese × began a large-scale invasion of South China last October, the tax revenue in the Guangzhou area, which used to be a major source of tax revenue for Guangdong Province, has been cut off. The central area and Hainan Island have also successively become war zones, and tax collection has mostly stopped. In addition, the current tax rules in Guangdong Province were all formulated before the war, and they are not fully suitable for the needs of the current situation and environment. Such a modification is absolutely necessary.

As for the principle of "increasing military preparedness and fostering civil power while considering both," it is also in line with the program of resisting the war and building the country. However, in terms of specific regulations and implementation methods, we believe that two points still need to be paid attention to: first, in terms of new tax regulations, we should absolutely abide by the program of resisting the war and building the country, and refer to the resolutions of the third National Political Council, on the one hand, increasing inheritance tax and effectively implementing income tax with progressive taxation, and on the other hand, not forgetting to support production and construction enterprises to increase new tax sources. What is particularly important is to abolish the remaining exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies as much as possible, reduce the burden on farmers, businessmen, and workers, and clear the obstacles to tax collection. Second, in terms of implementation methods, it is necessary to effectively eliminate the remaining corrupt elements and all malpractices, promote a style of work that is not afraid of hardship, is honest, and is devoted to public service, and promote young talents with ability, accomplishment, and integrity as much as possible. The propaganda and explanation work of "those with money contribute iron, jointly save the country from disaster" should also be carried out in conjunction.

### Taixian County Children's Brigade

Since the war of resistance, Chinese children and teenagers have also grown up under the baptism of × people's artillery fire, shouldering the arduous task of resisting Japan and saving the country, and working hard for the construction of the country. Among them, the achievements of the Boy Scouts, children's theater troupes, the Xin'an Brigade, and the Young Pioneers and Children's Service Corps in various battlefields in North China are particularly praised by the whole country.

Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Taixian County Children's Brigade in Jiangsu Province, in order to expand the children's organization and mobilize the children of the entire county to participate in the war of resistance, convened the first symposium of children from various schools and private schools on the 10th of this month. At that time, it was decided to hold a meeting every week, publish a joint declaration of children in the county, and promote singing movements. Regarding the patriotic spirit and efforts of children in the rear of the × army, everyone, think about it calmly, can you not blush with shame?

We primary school teachers who are companions with children every day, seeing the participation of children everywhere in the work of resisting the war and building the country, ××××××××! We cannot personally go to the front lines and occupied areas to work, but we should also care about the lives of our students and family children, who are the future masters of our country! Uncle Di

### The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East

— Uncle Di

[London Correspondence] In the three years since the alliance of the German, Japanese, and Italian aggressor groups, especially in the two years since China began its resistance, we can broadly summarize that the direction in which the fate of the world and the future of the Far East are heading has been consistent and unwavering. The only event that could have potentially changed their course, the only attempt to rewrite history, was undoubtedly the "line" of the current British "Chamberlain Cabinet" that formally appeared on the world stage since last spring. However, this line had completely failed by the beginning of this year, on the eve of Prime Minister Chamberlain's famous "Birmingham Speech." Subsequently, when the British government decided to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union, the current British cabinet had taken a big detour, only to return to its original starting point. What is most interesting is that the individuals in charge of this detour have remained unchanged from beginning to end. What makes us feel uneasy is the thought of the long list of weak nations and countries, such as Austria, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Albania, who have become their victims. Therefore, when the British government turned around and made promises to guarantee the independence of small countries in Eastern and Southern Europe, it meant that British diplomacy had returned to its starting point a year ago, embarking on the right path anew.

Whether this second departure will once again lead astray, we still cannot say for sure. However, there is another point that we can confidently predict. If the first attempt yielded nothing but sacrifice, then even if there is a second attempt, the result will undoubtedly be a complete failure. The difference is that if, unfortunately, there is indeed a second attempt, then the sacrifice will be much greater than the first time. And after this time, whether there will still be an opportunity for Britain to return to its original starting point and try again is highly questionable. Summarizing the evolution of the past year, even now, we can say that the steadfastness of the Soviet Union and the United States, coupled with the great struggle of our China, are the three pillars that have supported the overall global situation for the past year. Therefore, even today, Britain and France still have the opportunity to return to the right path and salvage the fate of their empires.

Based on the current global situation, the first major event is:

(1) The ongoing cooperation negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union.

First and foremost, there is the issue of the foundation of this cooperation. The notion that Britain and the Soviet Union are opposed to each other has long been common knowledge. Now, if we are to talk about cooperation, what is its foundation? First, since the Soviet Union abandoned the "world revolution" line, the transformation of social systems has generally become the internal affair of each country. Second, after the failure of British intervention in the Soviet social revolution, it has adopted an enlightened policy not only towards the Soviet Union but also towards its own socialist tendencies and parties. Third, the threat posed by the Axis powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy is common to both Britain and the Soviet Union.

In accordance with this foundation, cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union can be established under the forms of an "anti-aggression front" or a "peace front."

However, apart from this, there is another very important point, which is the subjective awareness and determination of both Britain and the Soviet Union. Currently, there is a major divergence here, which is that Britain, in order to maintain its current imperial content and scope, is using any means to avoid war. As for the Soviet Union, its consistent foreign policy over the years has been to avoid provoking the formation of a fascist anti-communist crusade. However, on the other hand, in order to completely eliminate the threat to the only socialist country, it is ready at any time to join hands with any large-scale international anti-aggression group to fight together. Although the establishment of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union does not necessarily mean that war will break out, before it is established, there must be at least such a minimum understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union as a prerequisite: the ultimate goal of cooperation is to maintain peace. However, when peaceful means of restraint are ineffective, each must have the automatic determination to fight at all costs. Extending from this, the inevitable conclusions are: (1) Britain must abandon the illusion of breaking up the German, Japanese, and Italian alliance, and (2) abandon the only secret of satisfying aggressor nations and avoiding major wars by sacrificing small nations and countries. And (3) this spirit of cooperative resistance must be thoroughly disseminated throughout the world.

The fundamental awareness described above has not yet matured in the current situation in Britain. However, the general trend is indeed moving towards maturity.

[Reuters Ottawa, 26th] The King's visit to Canada has been met with enthusiastic welcomes everywhere. The affection of the public has been so profound that it exceeded expectations. The King is amiable and approachable, acting in a commoner manner, often changing the predetermined schedule to accommodate the public's welcome. When the King's train passed through the Canadian wilderness, he did not stay in the carriage according to the original schedule but personally got out of the train to meet the people in the crowd. When the King and Queen's train passed through the smallest stations, they stood on the rear platform to respond to the welcoming crowds, sufficiently demonstrating sincere royal courtesy. The King also ordered the installation of an electric bell. When the driver saw people along the way, he would press this bell. After hearing the bell, the King and Queen would go to the nearest window to wave to the people on the roadside. It is expected that the King and Queen will also receive a warm welcome from the American people when they arrive in the United States.

### Italian Ambassador to England Criticizes the French Press, Causing Comments from Various French Newspapers

[Reuters London, 27th] The Italian Ambassador to England, Count Grandi, gave a speech severely criticizing the French press, which has caused comments from various newspapers in Paris. The speech was given at the Italian Embassy here on Thursday of this week due to the signing of a military alliance between Germany and Italy. The German ambassador was also present at the time. Italian newspapers have prominently published this exchange, but it has not been publicly released in London. One newspaper claimed that an ambassador should avoid publicly expressing political opinions in the capital of the host country, which is the duty of the ambassador. Ambassador Grandi has disregarded this traditional etiquette. Various newspapers believe that the Italian ambassador's actions were instructed by Mussolini.

### Hong Kong's Military and Police Expenditures Have Been Enormous Over the Past Year, the Hong Kong Government Announces Financial Revenue and Expenditure Statistics for the Year, the Surplus After Offsetting Revenue and Expenditure Breaks Previous Records

The Hong Kong government authorities announced yesterday in the Government Gazette the financial revenue and expenditure situation for the first quarter of 1939. According to the announcement, the total financial revenue for April was HK$14,649,618.51. This figure is an increase of HK$2,477,330 compared to the same period last year. As of the end of April, the total surplus in the Hong Kong treasury was HK$16,258,310.09. This figure has also created a new record in history, indicating that the financial revenue and expenditure situation of the Hong Kong government has gradually improved.

Good Financial Situation This Year

Taking the month of April alone, the total revenue for April was HK$3,500,650.51, and the total expenditure was only HK$2,626,021.29. Comparing the revenue and expenditure, the surplus for the month of April alone reached HK$904,629. Among the revenue items, the income from the sale of government land was the highest, totaling HK$1,200,787.73 from January to the end of April (HK$120,302.35 for the month of April alone). This figure exceeds the budget for this year by HK$457,872. The income from the sale of government land during the same period last year was only HK$151,913.93. The increase in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year is substantial. In terms of tobacco and alcohol tax, the total revenue for April this year was HK$592,104.43, while it was HK$772,839.31 in the same period last year. This year's license fee is slightly reduced. The total revenue for April this year was HK$1,615,734.13, an increase of HK$100,000 compared to the same period last year.

Reduced Revenue from Post Office and Railway

In addition, the Post Office and the Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau have seen a reduction in revenue due to the severe impact of the war in South China. The Post Office's revenue for April this year was HK$356,533.78, while the figure for the same period last year was HK$270,160.30. The Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau's revenue for April this year was only HK$69,135.56, while the figure for the same period last year was HK$175,257.50, a difference of more than HK$110,000. In addition, the total miscellaneous income totaled HK$354,540.79, an increase of approximately HK$300,000 compared to the same period last year. The reason is the large increase in the population of Hong Kong and the increase in various consumption activities.

Military Subsidy of HK$500,000

As for expenditure, the largest item among the various expenditures in April this year was the army subsidy. In recent years, the British military authorities have actively strengthened Hong Kong's military defense, so the Hong Kong government's responsibility for military expenses has also gradually increased. The total amount of army subsidy expenditure by the Hong Kong government in April this year reached HK$500,000. At the same time, the police expenses have also increased compared to normal times due to Hong Kong being in an extraordinary period. The total expenditure in April this year was HK$291,891.54. Other items include HK$253,723.21 for charity expenditures, HK$14,511.49 for education expenditures, HK$217,181.18 for medical bureau expenditures, and HK$139,843.69 for public works bureau expenditures. All of the above figures are an increase compared to the same period last year. Statistics show that from January to April, the total amount of various expenditures has accounted for 30% of the total expenditure budget for 1939.

### Unenthusiastic Registration of British Nationals, Closing Date Approaching, Number Still Far Away, Severe Penalties for Late Registration

The registration of British nationals in Hong Kong has been in effect for nearly two months since the authorities announced its implementation. During this period, the British people's filling out the forms for registration has been extremely slow. In order to urge registration and expedite matters, the authorities have posted notices on public buses and government agencies, ordering British people to register as soon as possible to avoid penalties for late registration. However, after the implementation of this method, the registration is still not enthusiastic. According to official sources yesterday, the authorities have implemented various methods to urge British people to register, but the results obtained are still not good. The number of people who have registered as of now is far from the authorities' budget. There are only five days left until the final closing date (until the 31st of this month), and there will be no extension to implement penalties as a warning to those who are slow. The authorities hope that the registration can be completed within this period.

### HKU Vice-Chancellor Gives Speech in Chongqing, "Impressions of a Trip to Chongqing," Central Radio Station Broadcasts It, Europe, America and Hong Kong Can Listen

HKU Vice-Chancellor Mr. Schloss gave a pre-recorded English speech entitled "Impressions of a Trip to Chongqing" at the invitation of the Central Broadcasting Station when he was in Chongqing. The station broadcast it to Europe, America and the Nanyang area on the 25th and 26th respectively. The translation is roughly as follows: I have had a very good impression of this trip to Chongqing. I will tell you about it in five points. (1) There is an optimistic atmosphere here. All residents are aware of the importance of their responsibilities, work hard, are serious, and have a spirit of responsibility for the long term. (2) Displaying the map of Chongqing after the bombing proves that the Japanese planes bombed without a target. The results of three bombings have been that civilians have been killed and injured. However, the city's rescue work is carried out very quickly, and the people are especially calm. (3) Various constructions are carried out quickly. There are dedicated and skilled workers. The establishment of a rural economy will surely deceive Chinese villages. (4) The construction of the Central University's campus in Chongqing was completed in just 32 days. The faculty and students are very happy and healthy. These are talents for various constructions in the new era. After this arduous training, the quality can be imagined. (5) The deepest impression is the image of the great leader President Chiang. His personality is unparalleled in the world. His extraordinary spirit of fighting to maintain national survival and world peace is unforgettable. Mrs. Chiang's efforts to assist in the war of resistance and national construction are also admired by the world.

Also, radio listeners in Hong Kong heard the Hong Kong broadcasting station rebroadcasting HKU Vice-Chancellor Mr. Schloss's speech from Chongqing XGOY Central Broadcasting Station at 10:00 PM the night before. The speech was given by Mr. Schloss in Chongqing recently. The original speech was recorded and was originally scheduled to be broadcast on the 25th of this month, but it was postponed until the night before because it happened to be a day when planes attacked Chongqing. Mr. Schloss recently went to Chongqing and met with our country's military and political leaders, and witnessed the construction and relief activities in the rear of our country, and paid tribute to the excellent spirit of our people in resisting the war of aggression. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, planes bombed Chongqing, and on the 24th, they bombed again. Mr. Schloss happened to be in Chongqing and witnessed all the tragic situations. Mr. Schloss was deeply impressed by the Chinese industrial cooperative movement, the perseverance of Chinese youth, and the Chinese women led by Mrs. Chiang in rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees. Mr. Schloss's impressions in Chongqing are detailed in his speech. Mr. Schloss returned to Hong Kong from Chongqing five days ago.

### Hong Kong Student Union Plans to Participate in the League of Nations Student Congress, Meeting Scheduled for Early Next Month to Discuss, Soliciting Opinions from the Entire Hong Kong Student Community

The League of Nations Student Congress, initiated and convened by the World Student Association, is scheduled to be held in Nice, France in mid-August this year. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association is currently planning to send representatives to participate. According to the person in charge of the association, the convening of the League of Nations Student Congress has great significance. All the current problems of all countries in the world will be raised for discussion at the congress. The convener of the congress, the World Student Association, sent representatives to our country last year to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the extreme situation of our country's war of resistance. The association expressed great sympathy for our war of resistance. After the representatives returned to Europe, they promoted our war of resistance along the way in various countries. It is believed that the League of Nations Student Congress will discuss our country's problems. The student community in our country should send representatives to participate in this congress to take this opportunity to announce to the world's students the various acts of aggression by aggressors in the Far East, and to arouse the sympathy of the world's students to jointly sanction aggression. According to what this association knows, the preparatory committee of the League of Nations Student Congress has now printed letters of convening the meeting and charters, and sent them to various countries around the world, inviting them to send representatives to participate. It is believed that they will be sent to Hong Kong soon. This association is currently considering the issue of selecting representatives to participate. This matter is the responsibility of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee has already scheduled a meeting in the first week of next month, at which time it will discuss and decide on issues such as "whether to send representatives to participate in the League of Nations Student Congress", "election of representatives", and "whether the Hong Kong Student Union should join as a member of the League of Nations Student Association". At the same time, the association will send letters to all overseas Chinese schools and youth organizations to solicit proposals for the congress, so as to integrate the opinions of the entire Hong Kong student community and draft proposals for Hong Kong student representatives as a basis for discussion.

### The Isolated Army of Ma Tau Chung: Leaving the Camp to Serve the Country Rewarded with Jail Time - One Month Sentence

During the fierce battle in Shenzhen, our country's soldiers who crossed the border were placed under supervision in the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp. After several months, a number of them attempted to secretly escape to serve their country again but were intercepted by the guarding troops and sentenced to imprisonment. It was investigated that around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, five individuals including Peng Si, Zhang Guoqi, Gan Bojiu, Xiao Qihan, and Peng Jianwen, agreed to hide themselves in a truck loaded with hay, intending to escape when the truck was transporting hay to other camps. Unfortunately, they were discovered by the guarding troops when leaving the camp. They were then handed over to the police for investigation. Yesterday morning, they were charged in the Kowloon Magistracy for the crime of unauthorized departure from the camp. The defendants pleaded guilty, and the judge sentenced each of them to one month in jail.

Special Report from Our Newspaper

### "China Salvation's" Most Refined Masterpiece: Impressions of "Fleeing to Hong Kong"

Don't cry, bring out your strength - Qi Zhuo

Because resistance against Japan is above all else, everything is subordinate to the resistance. Drama, therefore, becomes the most effective cultural tool for publicizing and educating the masses.

Look—the front lines, the rural areas, where are there no footprints of anti-Japanese drama troupes—look! The creation of anti-Japanese scripts is flourishing like bamboo shoots after a rain—in this process, I don't know how many soldiers have been inspired, how many compatriots have been moved—and which play is the most fluent, the most widespread, the most interesting, and the most effective? Needless to say, of course, "Put Down Your Whip" comes first. Because this is the most successful work of "expressing new content in old forms"; performing on the streets is especially suitable for the broad masses.

"China Salvation" marched north and south for twenty months, performing 741 times. "Put Down Your Whip" is the most frequently performed, technically the most refined, and most satisfying representative work. The day before yesterday evening, the troupe performed "Defending the Motherland" at the Lee Theatre as a charity performance, and "Fleeing to Hong Kong" was adapted from "Put Down Your Whip". Although the reporter was unable to see the first three acts due to scheduling conflicts, it was anticipated that when it came to the performance of "Fleeing to Hong Kong", it would be necessary to put aside other matters and rush to see it.

Tell the readers: After watching, the reporter was not only not disappointed, but also felt an unexpected gain.

The curtain opens with a street performance scene. Jinshan plays Zhang San, dressed in ragged clothes with all white hair, every word and action vividly resembling a pitiful old man. Wang Ying plays Xiang Jie, perfectly like a charming folk girl.

Fan Zheng also braided a red braid on his head and became a young helper.

With a clang of gongs and drums, a call and a response: with light and heavy, harmonious rhythm, the abilities of the three of them are truly great, we really feel like we are watching a street performance. Originally: Xiang Jie and her father, Old Man Zhang San, are northerners, and lived a comfortable life farming. Unexpectedly, the devil's hand stretched over, Xiang Jie's mother was killed—the family also went bankrupt. The father and daughter were left dependent on each other, wandering homeless. The few coins they carried with them were long gone. Without any relatives to turn to, they had to make a living by performing in the streets. Fortunately, Xiang Jie is naturally intelligent and talented in her skills, wandering everywhere, and is able to attract some viewers. Their daily income can barely maintain the lives of the father, daughter, and young helper. These days of wandering have recently brought them from the mainland to Hong Kong. The hardships of life have only made them feel haggard and weak.

This day, while performing in the streets, Xiang Jie, following the old man and the young helper, performed many skills. But, because she was too weak to support herself, she could not sing, and fell down several times. Zhang Laotou, for the sake of livelihood, began to whip Xiang Jie painfully. The audience, feeling sorry for such a delicate woman, were all indignant. They shouted, "Put down your whip!" Two straightforward young men, moved by chivalry, even stepped forward to intervene. Xiang Jie, seeing that her father had provoked public anger, explained the situation in detail to the audience. The young men, realizing the truth, regretted their rashness and comforted the father and daughter.——This is a summary of the plot development. The old man's teeth are missing, and the makeup is very realistic. The performance of spitting saliva at tense moments, as well as the "but then again" tone, is simply identical to a street performing old man. The young helper scolds Wang Jingwei in his dialogue and drum lyrics, ever-changing, full of fun. The audience shouted "Do it again!"—"Do it again!"—The atmosphere is extremely tense.

Xiang Jie sings moving tunes, accompanied by the old man playing the strings. Whether it is expression, voice, lyrics, stage steps, it can be said to be the pinnacle of perfection—the focus of the audience is concentrated, and the applause bursts forth like thunder. The atmosphere is both tense and enthusiastic. It is a rare entertainment event, and also a lecture to promote the resistance against Japan. "Don't cry, bring out your strength." Both solemn and humorous, both serious and lively. When the old man whips Xiang Jie again, it provokes public anger, fully expressing sympathy.

These three characters are versatile and are completely street performers. They are completely different from the Jinshan, Wang Ying, and Fan Zheng seen on ordinary days. The reporter shed tears of sympathy for their plight, really forgetting that they were acting. In fact, isn't this also our Chinese people's common experience? Without a high degree of passion and real-life experience, "China Salvation's" acting would certainly not have achieved this great success. Therefore, the reporter was reminded of their story of performing for the troops in Shangcheng: "The brothers were all sitting neatly on the ground, halfway through the play, the sky suddenly became阴雨. It rained harder and harder. At that time, we (China Salvation) and the officers of the division discussed that, in order to avoid the brothers getting rained on, we would be willing to walk thirty miles tomorrow to perform again in the barracks. The officer stood on the high ground and asked: "Comrades of the National Salvation Drama Troupe are afraid that we will get rained on and are willing to perform again in our barracks tomorrow. Now, go back or not?" "Don't go back!" This was the brothers' loud reply. "We will keep watching!" - Another loud shout."

Also, recently when they were performing for the troops in Shaoguan, they moved all the officers and soldiers. General Zhang Fakui personally ordered all the soldiers to salute all the members of the China Salvation troupe. ——It turns out that the drama that moved the soldiers and civilians is right before our eyes. Under deep emotion, in addition to expressing respect to the China Salvation friends, I must also give a faithful report to the readers! The fourth act of "Defending the Motherland" is "Fleeing to Hong Kong". Today, the performances at the Lee Theatre, both in the afternoon and evening, are to entertain students and citizens. Go see it, you will know that what the reporter can praise is only one in a hundred.

### Expanding National Salvation Propaganda: The National Salvation Drama Troupe Continues Performances - Special Discounted Ticket Prices for Hong Kong Residents - Seven Performances in Three Days Starting This Morning Still at the Lee Theatre

The China National Salvation Drama Troupe's first overseas performance, which caused a sensation in Hong Kong, is finally fleetingly slipping away. The facts have given us a strong proof that the "China Salvation's" charity performance, everything from the plot, acting, scenery, lighting, costumes... all the conditions that constitute the art of drama, are great and unprecedented, making people praise and marvel. "Running through the north and south battlefields for twenty months, beloved by hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians, it is truly worthy of the name. The audience who has had the opportunity to personally witness the China Salvation's performance is greatly inspired and reminisces, those who have not seen it, inevitably feel a sense of loss and regret. "Recalling the memory, the audience hopes for "another performance" to feast their eyes; the audience who missed it also hopes for "another performance" to make up for the regret. Therefore, urging the "China Salvation" to "have another performance" has become the common request of the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese and drama enthusiasts.

Although the "China Salvation" drama troupe's performance has been sold out for three consecutive nights, the audience is mostly from the middle and upper classes, which is more focused on completing the task of raising funds to aid wounded soldiers and refugees. In order to promote to a wider range of students and the general public, and to achieve greater results, they responded to the request for "another performance" and, starting today, for three consecutive days, will have the 743rd large-scale performance to entertain Hong Kong students and the public. This is the news that the readers love to hear, right?

In the past, "China Salvation" had more than 700 performances in China, all of which were free public receptions. However, Hong Kong is not like the mainland after all. The countryside is a theater everywhere. Since it is performed in the theater, due to the theater rent, seats and other environmental conditions, it has to be slightly limited. Therefore, the ticket prices are set at three types: 40 cents, 20 cents, and 10 cents. However, such popular ticket prices are unprecedented in Hong Kong, right? The performance times and play names are: today (Sunday) 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM will be "Defending the Motherland"; tonight 8:00 PM "Spring in Taierzhuang"; tomorrow (29th) 3:00 PM and 8:00 PM "Long Live the Nation"; the day after tomorrow (30th) 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM "Spring in Taierzhuang". This can be regarded as an unprecedented and meaningful great achievement in the Hong Kong theater world.

In order to facilitate students from various schools to visit, "China Salvation" yesterday entertained the principals of various schools to discuss the matter. All schools or organizations that provide a letter of proof can reserve seats at the Lee Theatre one day in advance. When the reporter wrote this manuscript, I heard that most of the tickets for today have been sold. The previous three days of "China Salvation's" performances were originally record-breaking charity performances. This time, the expansion of publicity is even more meaningful. "China Salvation's" hard work and dedication are even more admirable. To receive the baptism of the War of Resistance, to appreciate the most advanced theatrical art, to visit the China Salvation performance at an unprecedentedly low price is really an unprecedented opportunity. I hope that the broad masses of overseas Chinese will not miss this opportunity. After "China Salvation" finishes performing, they will go abroad to take on a greater task. Everyone who has seen "China Salvation" performing is deeply moved by it. Go see "China Salvation's" play, it will definitely not disappoint you.

### Over a Thousand Japanese Troops Attacked Tanbu Yesterday, Suffering Heavy Blows From Our Forces - Over 200 Japanese Soldiers Killed, Extremely Large Haul of Military Supplies - Our Army Takes Advantage of Opportunity to Attack the Japanese Rear, Charging into Shizhang

(West River Express News) For the past ten days, our army on the Northeast River front in Guangdong has repeatedly attacked the Japanese forces from Zengcheng, Conghua, and Hua County, achieving repeated victories. The Japanese have also continuously increased reinforcements, attempting to struggle. After the Japanese reinforcements were dispatched from various lines, they became restless again, attempting to advance on our positions. The Japanese forces around the areas of Chancheng, Tanbu, Yanguan Yao, Fengyong, and Jinshan Temple have been repeatedly ambushed by our forces in the past ten days. In recent days, seven or eight hundred infantry, cavalry, and artillery soldiers, as well as more than a dozen mountain cannons, have been transferred from the Foshan area to increase defenses. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese forces in Fengyong dispatched a mixed Japanese unit of over a thousand troops, with several cannons and five tanks, advancing along the Chancheng-Tanbu Road to attack Tanbu. They used artillery to fiercely bombard our positions, covering the infantry and cavalry surging forward. Our 12th Army Group's Zhao Division, stationed there, immediately deployed its forces to meet the enemy, fighting repeatedly and advancing repeatedly. By 3:00 PM, over 200 Japanese soldiers had been annihilated. The remaining Japanese forces, unable to withstand the attacks, fled south in disarray. Our army relentlessly pursued them, the Japanese leaving behind many corpses and weapons, retreating back to Fengyong. In this battle, our army suffered only a few dozen casualties, while the Japanese had already been routed. Our forces are currently pursuing the victory. In addition, when the Japanese forces attacked Tanbu, our Yu Brigade's assault team took advantage of the emptiness of the Japanese rear, launching a surprise attack, with a certain battalion dividing into three routes to encircle Shizhang Township, west of Fengyong. The Japanese forces there were mostly newly recruited soldiers from Taiwan and Korea, with weak combat power. They were defeated with one blow. Our heroic army charged into the Japanese positions, searching for as long as two hours, killing several dozen Japanese soldiers before safely withdrawing. Currently, the Japanese troops in the nearby villages of Wengang, Mingtang, and Ningbian near Fengyong are all afraid of being pursued by our army, increasing the number of sentries day and night, their defenses being heavily guarded.

### Our Army Vigorously Implements a Scorched Earth Policy - No Stockpiling of Materials Within 100 Kilometers of the Front Lines - Each County in Qingyuan, Hua, and Conghua Mobilizes the Masses to Form Assault Teams

[North River Express] There are still minor skirmishes along the North Guangdong front lines. In order to prepare for a large-scale offensive, military authorities are actively implementing various adjustments and deployments to strengthen their strength. The latest situation regarding the North River is as follows:

Stockpiling of Grain and Materials Prohibited on the Front Lines

The Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Fourth War Zone, following the instructions of Bai Chongxi, Chief of the Southwest Headquarters, vigorously implemented a scorched earth policy in order to blockade Japanese-occupied areas. It specially ordered the commanders of the front-line defense forces, guerrilla commanders, and county governments to destroy and relocate as much material as possible that could be used by the Japanese forces in advance, so as to prevent it from falling into Japanese hands when the Japanese army invades. Unless absolutely necessary, no stockpiling of food, resources, or wealth is allowed within 100 kilometers of the front lines. Qingyuan, Hua, Conghua, and Fogang counties in the North River area have been designated as scorched earth zones. In addition to the destruction of all transportation lines and blockhouses in each village, all rice, miscellaneous grains, fuel, copper, iron, livestock, and various equipment and materials must be continuously transported away from the front lines, to the extent that it can supply the needs of the people on the front lines. Each county has received orders and is implementing them one after another.

Mobilizing the Masses to Form Assault Teams

In order to launch a broad guerrilla war and mobilize the people of each county to participate in killing the Japanese, the North River military authorities specially ordered Ouyang Lei, the county magistrate of Qingyuan County, Cui Guangxiu, the county magistrate of Hua County, Li Linggen, the county magistrate of Conghua County, and Wu Guanhong, the commander of the Second Guerrilla Column, and the commanders of each defense force, to organize assault teams in each village, to use the local armed forces to attack the Japanese and assist in the counter-offensive. It has been found that each village in Qingyuan and Conghua has been organized and established under the supervision of the commander. They are currently active on the front lines and in the rear of the Japanese army. In addition to the regular army guerrilla units, assault teams have sprung up and expanded their activities, constantly attacking the Japanese in recent days, reaping significant battle results.

### Our Army's Surprise Attack on Zengcheng from Mount Luofu Achieves Victory - Blocking the Japanese Army's Supply Line is Showing Great Effect

(East River Express) In the East River counter-offensive, our army is steadily advancing according to plan, and is now paying attention to blockading the Japanese army's transportation lines and cutting off its supplies. Therefore, small skirmishes are constantly occurring on the front lines. The military situation in recent days is as follows:

Surprise Attack on Zengcheng

Chen Shuying Regiment's Chen Wukui Unit of a certain army stationed around Mount Luofu, along with Bu Zhiyang Unit of the Third Detachment of the Third Zone Column's guerrillas, crossed the Zeng River on the 21st and launched a fierce surprise attack on the Japanese army in Zengcheng. A fierce battle took place on the Bo Zeng Road on the eastern outskirts of Zengcheng. The Japanese army tried to prevent us from entering the city, destroying the wooden bridge at the East Gate. However, our regiment showed extraordinary bravery, swimming across the river and leaping forward. The Japanese army relied on machine-gun positions built along the riverbanks, firing fiercely to stop our advance. However, Chen's unit eventually used clever methods to reach the other side, engaging in close combat with the Japanese army and completing their mission, before automatically withdrawing. As a result of the surprise attack, dozens of Japanese soldiers were annihilated and many Japanese military supplies were seized. When our regiment made contact with the Japanese army, cannon fire was also heard in Boluo.

Blockading Japanese Areas

In order to blockade the Japanese forces in Zengcheng and Shilong and cut off their supplies, our army on the East Road has now completely blockaded the water and land transportation lines in the lower reaches of the East River. All grains and daily necessities, industrial raw materials, are prohibited from entering the Japanese areas. Considerable results have now been achieved. It has been found that the Japanese army, due to the cut-off of supplies, is in a state of panic. In recent days, they have instigated traitors to sneak into the interior to buy grain, rice, oil, salt, firewood, and other goods and transport them for their use. Yesterday, several civilian boats loaded with the above-mentioned items were attempting to smuggle them through Boluo, but were discovered by the local defense forces. The boats were immediately detained for investigation, as they were deemed to be providing supplies to the Japanese. In addition, the Third Zone Guerrilla Column Headquarters issued a proclamation yesterday, explaining the meaning of the blockade to the people and earnestly advising them not to smuggle goods to supply the Japanese in the future, otherwise they would be convicted of undermining the war of resistance.

### Japanese Planes Attacked Dajin Island the Day Before Yesterday - Two Bombs Dropped, Two Casualties

(Taishan Express) In recent days, Japanese planes have often passed through the Taishan area, raiding various parts of the Siyi region. At around 8:00 AM on the 25th, two Japanese planes flew to the skies above Chixi, circled, and then passed over Dajin Island, dropping two bombs. One hit the leprosarium pier on the island, destroying the pier. The other fell next to the Macau Xinfat Ferry near the pier, damaging part of the ferry's stern with shrapnel, resulting in one passenger dead and one wounded. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes fled towards Xinhui.

### The Japanese Calamity in Lielou - All Japanese Forces Have Withdrawn to Jiujiang

(Nanhai Express) Since falling into Japanese hands, Lielou in Shunde County has been subjected to thorough searches by the Japanese, with all merchants' and civilians' assets being looted. Local residents, unable to endure the Japanese army's brutal trampling, have mostly fled, particularly those with wealth. Consequently, the Japanese army has withdrawn entirely to Jiujiang to reinforce defenses, as there is nothing left to plunder. It has been found that commercial business in Lielou city has come to a halt for the most part, and the area is desolate. Looking back at the prosperity of the past, one cannot help but feel moved.

### The Fourth War Zone Water and Land Transportation Management Office - Established in Early June -

[Shaoguan Express] The provincial government's preparatory organization for the Water and Land Transportation Office was previously suspended. It was then transferred to the Fourth War Zone for handling. Commander Zhang now believes that wartime transportation requires unified control and management, and assigned the responsible organization to the Military Affairs Section of the headquarters for preparation, with a deadline of early June for its establishment. It is said that the scope of the joint order is as follows: the rectification of trunk highways and waterways within Guangdong Province, the use of vehicles and ships during wartime, and the method of requisitioning will all be handled by the office as the environment requires. The principle is to coordinate with the war of resistance.

### Advances and Retreats on the Jiangmen-Xinhui Front Lines - We Capture Xiangshan, Japanese Advance to Muling and Lucun - A Japanese Plane Harassing Liantang Shot Down by Our Forces

(Zhongshan Express) Our forces attacking Jiangmen-Xinhui have advanced into Baishi and Dahui, and the road connecting Jiangmen and Xinhui may be cut off. To contain our forces, the Japanese launched a full-scale offensive on Xinhui Road on the 26th, but our strength is strong, and the Japanese army's conspiracy failed again. The battle situation is as follows: (1) Jiangmen area: Our forces advanced into Baishi, Dahui, and Qibang on the night of the 24th, and the Japanese forces in Jiangmen are already in critical condition. On the 25th, they used all their strength to break out from the Xinhui Station and launch a counter-offensive on Muling and Duran. Another unit attacked Tangxia from Zhutou Mountain, with approximately three thousand soldiers. Our forces immediately blocked and attacked at Beiwulai Village and Shizitan in Muling, with fierce battles. The Japanese forces on Zhutou Mountain took advantage of the cover of shallow-water warships, landed near Zhoujun, and used tanks to charge at our positions. In order to avoid overextending, our troops approaching Jiangmen withdrew to Mulang and blocked the attacking Japanese forces. Therefore, the Japanese army was able to drive straight along the Xinhui Station Road, breaking through the Mulang defense line. However, the Duran position is still in our hands, and rear troops are rushing to the front lines for reinforcements. (2) Xinkai Road area: Our forces have continued to attack the remaining Japanese troops in Xinhui. On the 25th, the Japanese army withdrew a unit to rescue Jiangmen. On the 26th, our forces took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on the Xiangshan blockhouse behind the Xiping People's Hospital in Xinhui, encircling the two hundred or so Japanese troops stationed there. The Japanese stubbornly resisted with dense steel cannons, but our morale was high. We rushed to the top of the mountain in one go, annihilating more than half of the Japanese troops and eventually defeating them, capturing four small steel cannons and a large amount of ammunition. The remaining Japanese troops trapped in Xinhui have lost their western defenses and feel extremely threatened. Our attacking troops, with the cover of Xiangshan, are continuing to encircle Xinhui. (3) On the morning of the 25th, a Japanese plane flew to Liantang Station to drop bombs, and continued to fly to Pingdiling to spy, but was hit in the tail by our artillery with anti-aircraft machine guns, caught fire, and crashed near Baisha. The fuselage was completely destroyed and two pilots were burned to death. (4) On the morning of the 26th, more than a thousand Japanese troops boarded shallow-water warships and transport ships to Bei Street, reinforcing Jiangmen. After the Japanese forces that had infiltrated the Xinhui Road re-occupied Muling, Lucun, and Old Village, they advanced to Fozi at noon on the 26th. Our forces bravely rose up to meet them, and fierce battles broke out with the Japanese. The situation is still deadlocked.

(West River Express) It seems that the Japanese army still wants to defend Jiangmen and Xinhui, and is building cannon fortresses in Qibang Township near Jiangmen, and has also built fortresses and machine-gun nests along the two strongholds of Luoshan and Zhuzi Ridge between Jiangmen and Xinhui. Two fortresses have been built on Guifeng Mountain near Gangzhou Road in Xinhui City, in order to ensure that the liaison line between the two places is not cut off by our forces. Iron cables and sandbag fortifications have been set up at Zhizheng Bridge (in front of the county government), and the Yiji Bridge and Hanlu Bridge on the west gate in Xinhui City to prevent our forces from breaking in during the siege.

### All Public Servants in the Province Donate One Day's Salary - To Be Used to Comfort the Soldiers

(Qujiang Express) The Guangdong Province Recruitment and慰劳 Association has launched a campaign to collect goods and funds to慰劳 soldiers on the front lines and wounded soldiers in the rear. People from all walks of life in the province have responded enthusiastically and generously donated. It has been found that the association yesterday also decided that all public servants in the province will donate one day's salary for the慰劳 of soldiers fighting against Japan. In addition, the慰劳 delegations organized by the association have been prepared and are scheduled to depart on June 1, first going to Conghua, Qingyuan, Hua County, and then to the East and West Rivers.

### Discovery of × Submarine in the Beihai Area, No Unusual Movement of More Than Ten × Warships

(Beihai Express) Warships along the southern coastal route, suddenly erratic, their purpose unclear, seem to be trying to contain our forces. Coastal surveillance posts reported on the 23rd that between Yangji and Fangcheng, seventeen or eighteen enemy warships were spotted, and × warships frequently traveled to and from the waters off Xuwen, but there was no unusual movement. Near Zhou Island, there was a × giant cruiser, with three attached aircraft. At approximately 8:00 AM on the 22nd, a × submarine was discovered in the Beihai area, but it quickly escaped without a trace. It has been found that the × army is currently planning to build a submarine base in Yulin Port, Qiongya, and is actively proceeding with it.

### Guangdong New Games Planned, Savings Deposits for Civil Servants to Be Implemented Starting in June

(Qujiang Express) The Guangdong New Life Movement Promotion Association believes that as we are in the second phase of the war of resistance, all Chinese people should strictly practice thrift and savings, saving material and financial resources on the one hand, and increasing national resources on the other, to strive for final victory. Therefore, in addition to formulating measures to promote savings among ordinary people, it is also planning to organize savings for national salvation among civil servants. According to its content, the association plans to invite various government agencies and the Guangdong Provincial Bank to jointly draft detailed regulations, with the provincial bank responsible for collecting savings monthly. Letters have already been sent to various agencies to solicit opinions, and a meeting is planned again in the coming days to decide on detailed measures, which will be implemented starting in June.

### A Record of the Brave Killing of × by Qingyuan Civilians

— Ye Naibing

At 3:00 AM on the 20th, more than 600 × troops truly arrived at Baitu via Maizhu from Conghua (about fifteen li northwest of Maigan). The Self-Defense Corps had been on alert there and immediately rose up to meet them. The × troops, encountering interception, were unable to advance, retreated slightly, and divided their forces to circle around our Self-Defense Corps. At that time, all our villages sounded [missing character] to summon the members to mobilize. In a short time, more than two thousand members came out and encircled the × troops in two groups, one in Zhuer and the other on Dwarf Ridge. The × troops used houses as cover and resisted stubbornly. However, because our Self-Defense Corps did not have artillery, they could not break through the houses, so there was no way to eliminate the × troops. After a night of fierce fighting, on the 21st, our regular troops rushed to help, and another unit was dispatched, led by Major Ma, to raid the left flank. As a result, the morale of the people was even more invigorated, and they rushed forward to eliminate the × troops in Zhuer. At that time, sixty or seventy × troops were killed, and of course, more were wounded. At the same time, several × machine guns, dozens of rifles, and countless bullets were seized. On the same day, another unit of our army, diagonally out of Taipingchang, attacked the flank to cut off the × troops' retreat. On the 22nd, three × aircraft came to help, bombing our positions, strafing with machine guns, and dropping bullets and dry rations to supply the trapped × troops, and reinforced with a thousand infantrymen. This was the first time that our Self-Defense Corps had fought against external forces. Because they lacked experience, they were afraid of the × aircraft, and at the same time, the × reinforcements launched a fierce [missing character] against our outer lines, so the encirclement line wavered, and the × troops were able to break through. We retreated and defended the highlands around Louling, more than thirty li southeast of Guanzhuang Pajiankou, but we continued to launch fierce attacks against the × troops. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, on the morning of the 23rd, the × troops suddenly fired wildly at us [missing characters]. Most of the strong artillery fire missed, and we ignored it. The × troops then retreated automatically.

It is very clear that this time the × troops invaded Qingyuan, but they were ultimately defeated by our people's anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps. This is only the first time.

As a result of this battle, more than 400 × soldiers and officers were killed or wounded. We captured more than 20 rifles, 5 machine guns, 2 artillery pieces, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Our civilians suffered more than 30 casualties, and more than 300 civilian houses in the Aotou Furnace area were burned by the × troops [missing character].

After this, the × troops hated the Self-Defense Corps in the Pajian area of Qingyuan even more. Out of anger, they even used × aircraft to distribute leaflets in the Conghua Huaxian area, publicly offering a reward of fifty yuan for the capture of a member of the Self-Defense Corps.

As a result, the people of the Pajian area actively purchased guns and strengthened their self-defense forces, newly purchasing more than 50 [missing character] machine guns and more than 1,000 rifles. In view of the failure of this war of resistance, the lack of bullets, lack of medicine, etc.; and at the same time requested the government to replenish bullets, issue wartime military rations and medicines, and provide pensions to the families of the fallen soldiers.

Keep up the good work.

After the defeat, the × troops were even more unwilling to accept it. On the morning of April 6, one division of × troops, [missing character] and other cavalry, totaling more than 10,000, crossed the river from Taipingchang Shen [missing character] and invaded north in three routes via Mumen. Another route came from Huaxian to contain our right flank. The × troops from Taipingchang were intercepted when they reached Qilong Mountain and could not advance, so they detoured to invade Yuncao. Another unit went straight to Aotou, and another unit diagonally out of the Qing Cong Highway, joining forces with Maigan Renhe. On the Aotou Huaxian side, one branch also invaded Baishi [missing character] attack [missing character] Dun, attempting to join forces at Miaodun. Unexpectedly, the × troops were blocked by our army at all the points they passed, and after a disastrous defeat, they were trying to detour to our rear via small roads, but everywhere there were self-defense groups, densely distributed and waiting in formation. The × troops were fiercely attacked by our people in Keng, Lianhu, Huangluo, Aotou, Shuixi, Xihuli, Yangmacun, Baitu, Renhexu, Miaodun, etc., making it impossible for the × troops to escape and collapsing into disarray, and hurriedly fleeing back to the original place (Taipingchang).

About 700 members participated in this battle. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the corpses of the × troops were immediately rushed away. Although it is impossible to accurately estimate, the casualties of the × troops were over 1,000. Two of our members were wounded and one died, and many spoils of war were captured.

Currently, there are more than 4,000 members of the Self-Defense Corps in the Pajian area, fully equipped with new rifles and bullets, and more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, all under the command of the Pajian Office of the People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps.

Their steps are unified, their spirit is brave; everyone is facing the great era, and they have become an anti-Japanese vanguard that cannot be taken lightly!

Movies and Theater

### Lin Huain's Virtuoso Jascha Heifetz Appears on the Screen, Completing a Musical Masterpiece

A year ago, production giant Sam Goldwyn announced that he had signed a contract with world-renowned Lin Huain virtuoso Jascha Heifetz and would begin filming "Angels Making Musfc," a film about a Jewish musician being expelled from Nazi Germany. Unfortunately, less than a week later, the situation in Europe suddenly changed, and the project had to be stopped.

However, Heifetz's contract was not cancelled. Goldwyn invited a group of famous orchestras to accompany his Lin Huain, all of which were filmed and stored in Goldwyn's box for nearly a year because of a lack of a suitable storyline.

Recently, Miss Cuba Irmgarde Von Cube's screenplay depicting the situation of a music school was very much to Goldwyn's liking, and he decided to [missing character] produce it. At the same time, he found the film he had made last year from the box as a performance scene, so Xia Haifaiz had the opportunity to meet us on the screen.

It is said that the film has now started shooting, starring Margaret Stephenson, Zomike Livarde Blena. As for the title of the film, it was first called "The Exiles" and later changed to "The Restless Age."

### The King and Queen of Song

Under the silver screen, the fans will not forget that pair of emperors and queens in the land of song, Jenny McDonald and Neil Eddie. The great musicals over the years have made everyone intoxicated, and the gates of the theaters are crowded. This grand occasion shows the appeal of those two great figures. In fact, their works are becoming more and more superior, and both the plot, scenery, singing, and expression are worthy of the word beautiful.

In the past, their works were all period costumes, and the colors used were simple black and white (except for the pink scene in "Peach Blossom Hate"), but in this "King and Queen of Song," there was a [missing character] human reform. They wear the most beautiful fashions, especially Jenny MacDonald's several fashion exhibitions, with novel styles and harmonious colors. None of the coats are original, and both Chinese and Western clothes are very suitable. The color of this film is rare; the bright natural color films are all outdoors, with beautiful landscapes and bright flowers and plants, which instinctively show beautiful colors. However, the scenes in "Winged Wings" are all indoors. Under this special situation, the bright colors depend on the beautiful costumes and pleasing scenery. Whether it is a table or a few, there are wonderful places that make people feel pleasing to the eye. Coupled with the great stage scenes, beautiful dances, and colorful backgrounds, even if this is a film without a plot, the color is enough to make people feel excited, let alone there is a very emotional story. You can think of it as satire, you can think of it as advising the world. In short, "Winged Wings" is a giant film produced under the equal development of plot, color, song, dance, and scenery. There are also many jokes there. If you feel that this spring is too annoying, I advise you to hurry up and go there to relieve your boredom.

### Trivia about the King and Queen of Song

The opening day of the filming of "Winged Wings," June 18, 1938, was Jenny's birthday and the anniversary of her wedding week.

In "Winged Wings," the person who taught MacDonald to sing was Al Baitiana, Lai Qu, who was MacDonald's dance teacher when she first appeared on stage in New York at the age of ten.

MacDonald has red hair, green eyes, is five feet five inches tall, and weighs one hundred and eighteen pounds.

In the production of "Winged Wings," a total of 15,000 yards of fabric and 50,000 feet of silk were used.

The greatest scene is the scene of singing the theme song of "Winged Wings." Neil Siam Eddie and MacDonald stand at a height of eighty feet, surrounded by clouds and stars.

There are forty motors used to open the stage curtain, which shows the vastness of the project.

The most expensive and hard-to-see thing in the whole film is the Warren-style rubber heels on the shoes worn by the eighty-six Dutch women.

### Drama School, MGM Production, Starring Louise Rainer, Alan Marsale, and Dowren Gaodai

Young Pascal and Irving are in love. Simon has the most beautiful legs in all of Paris and also has a job in the dance troupe. Fraley's future hopes are great. Mandu, Mimi, and Claire are good friends. Nana has leather clothes, beads, and an arrogant face. They also have a common ambition, hoping to become famous artists in the future. This drama school is affiliated with the French National Theater and is a stepping stone to success.

Isma Peng also has ambitions, and many. If she is not beautiful, then passers-by have not noticed it, because quiet demeanor and shabby clothes cannot show beauty. If she has talent, the guidance of Pascal's brother, the school, has a bit of this feeling. He is too eager to believe that he wants to stand out in a class.

The rest of the people are happy, dissolute, and ambitious children, all young speculators, hoping to gain fame, fortune, and pleasure from this. But Iseros's hope is different, she wants to dedicate herself to art, until she is no longer Louise Mabon, and is the soul of thousands of celebrities - Camille, Juliet, Joan of Arc, Marie Antoinette, Electra, Egren - reappearance.

"I will play all these roles one day," she often said emotionally to her straightforward roommate Annie. "Wait and see. I want to make the people of the whole world worship me. I want them to shed tears, laugh - their lives are moved by emotion and beauty."

The realistic and persevering Annie did not always think so. "I hope you can get money from this at the same time"!

Louise would reply carelessly: "Of course. A lot of money, but it's not important."

They are always in debt for rent; they only eat some hard bread and sausage. "House, not bad!" Annie mocked, "It's not important at all! Every rich man will say that to people." In the dark, she felt that her friend was a little crazy [missing character]. But she loved her anyway - respected her tenderness, her innocence, and her perseverance. (To be continued)

### On the Depreciation of the Japanese Yen in Shanghai

Recently, the value of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market has been [missing character] depreciating. Ten days ago, the prices of Chinese legal tender and Japanese currency were slightly different and almost the same. However, for three days, the lowest time for 100 Japanese yen could only be exchanged for 89 legal tender. Moreover, according to the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, this situation is not very different, and it is feared that there may be continued development in the future. The Japanese yen circulating in the occupied areas of China is part of the banknotes issued by Japan. The rapid decline in the price of this part of the Japanese yen has revealed the extent to which Japan's currency inflation has reached.

China and Japan are at war, and the currency values of the two countries are barometers of the economic situation of the two countries. The two countries have adopted foreign exchange control policies and have their own statutory foreign exchange prices, and the prices are the same, that is, each Japanese yen is equivalent to one shilling and two pence in British gold, and each yuan of legal tender is also equivalent to one shilling and two pence in British gold. However, the foreign exchange prices of the Japanese yen flowing into the occupied areas of China in markets such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hong Kong are far from the statutory standards of the government, just like the legal tender. In June last year, 100 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for slightly less than 95 Japanese yen. In December, it could be exchanged for 92 Japanese yen. At that time, the outer price of legal tender in the black market was 8 pence per yuan of British gold. Therefore, the foreign exchange price of the Japanese [missing character] in the black market was indeed only between 8 and 9 pence per yuan. The statutory exchange rate of legal tender is one shilling and two pence, and the black market price is 8 pence. The Japanese side has tried to take this as an excellent material for publicity to prove the weakness of the Chinese legal tender base. In fact, the real price of the Japanese yen is just as bad as the legal tender. Now, the price of Shanghai legal tender in the black market still maintains the price of 8 pence, and the exchange rate of the Japanese yen to the legal tender is only 89 yuan of legal tender for every 100 Japanese yen. This means that the foreign exchange price of the Japanese yen is only 7 pence or more. The occupied areas of China are under the control of Japan. Japan can manipulate the Japanese yen and legal tender at will, but why can't Japan maintain its statutory standards for the Japanese yen in the occupied areas, and let its price be reduced below the Chinese legal tender? What does this barometer explain?

The sharp drop in the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai this time is by no means an accidental phenomenon, but the result of Japan's implementation of wartime economic policies. Since Japan's war against China, the source of military expenditure has been almost entirely derived from the issuance of public bonds and banknotes. Among them, the issuance of banknotes has increased by more than 1 billion yen by the end of last year. The scope of circulation of this huge amount of banknotes is not only in Japan, but also throughout its colonies. Recently, Japan's war against China has gradually expanded, and the war expenses required have also gradually increased. The increase in the issuance of banknotes has become an unavoidable fact. In March of this year, the Japanese government was submitting a bill in the National Assembly, advocating to increase the issuance amount of the three major banks in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea by 40% to 60%. In the past, the currency increase in Japan has caused the general public to feel extreme pain. Now, in order to maintain the social tranquility in Japan, it is necessary to exhaust the increased banknotes, that is, the phenomenon of currency increase, with the occupied areas of China as the tail. Therefore, they are flooded and depreciated.

In order to increase military expenditure, obtain various resources in the occupied areas of China, and establish the so-called "yen group" that is convenient for trade with Japan, and at the same time, to avoid the irreparable adverse effects of the yen increase on the domestic market, Japan has adopted a disguised indirect method.

### Football Charity Match - Rain or Shine, Held Today at Kai Shan - South China to Play with Original Lineup - League Team May Adjust Dickson to Center Back, Strengthening Offense and Defense

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Rainwater can irrigate the growth of all flora and fauna, and can also hinder general outdoor activities. It seems that every weekend lately, there has been incessant rain, causing all ball games to be stopped. Ballplayers sigh with disappointment, all wanting to ask the heavens why they are playing tricks.

The football charity match originally scheduled for last Saturday was postponed due to rain. South China's tour to Southeast Asia was also delayed due to this matter. Therefore, the charity match was re-scheduled to begin yesterday. Unexpectedly, the weather was uncooperative, with continuous rain, spoiling the good thing for the field again. The general public was also very disappointed.

To complete this charitable act, the South China authorities decided to change the match to today at 5:30 PM, still at Kai Shan. Even if it rains again at that time, it will not be postponed, because the team is scheduled to depart for Southeast Asia on the [unclear] day of this month. Due to the limited schedule, it is difficult to delay. If it cannot be performed today, it will have to wait until the cool autumn season to have a chance.

The lineup arranged by South China is not entirely of those going on the Southeast Asia tour, because one or two of them may not be able to go together. However, as of today, the list of those going to Southeast Asia has not been completely decided. It is unknown what the reason is. Some say that the person in charge is being cautious, but I say, "The more you hit, the longer the night becomes."

On the league team's side, the navy is the main force. It so happens that the "Eagle Ship" returned to Hong Kong from Singapore yesterday. Perhaps there will be minor changes to the lineup today. If they can improve the inside line and strengthen the defense, then there will definitely be a satisfactory performance. Good things are ahead, but heaven is in charge.

It is said that Dickson will be transferred to center back. This fellow is extraordinary. He is good at attacking, and his defense is good enough. However, the inside midfielders are still not suitable, and there will be many loopholes. Even if Dickson often retreats to help defend, it may not help. However, if Dickson plays, South China should not use the usual method of breaking through the center, but should focus on attacking from the left and right flanks to be more effective. The lineups of the two armies are as follows (Field Grand Duke):

South China Club

Bao Jiaping

Li Tiansheng Hou Rongsheng

Li Guo Rongzhao Liu Songsheng

Luo Douwen Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Deng Guangsen

New recruits: Yang Yongyi, Guo Yingqi, Chen Dehui,

### If It Clears Up Today, There Will Be Two Baseball Games - South China vs. Mindanao Makeup Game Tomorrow

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Yesterday's baseball league, originally a match between the South China Club and the Yubei team, was blocked by rain, so this good show could not be performed. This morning, if the sky clears, there will be two games at the Kai Carolina Hill Navy Stadium. (1) The Chinese team vs. the Western Society will begin at 10:00 AM. (2) Mindanao vs. Hong Kong Club will be held after the first game is over. Some say it is South China vs. Hong Kong Club, but according to the order, it is the Mindanao-Hong Kong Club battle.

The Westerners are not a strong team, having lost both of their previous two games. Today, when they meet China, they will probably not escape disaster again. The Mindanao-Hong Kong Club match will be a fierce battle, because their strengths are evenly matched, so it is expected that the contest will be intense.

China will transfer Chen Lunying to second base and use former Pui Ching star Hu Guodong to replace Chen's position. It is believed that after this improvement, the defense will be better. The list of team members is as follows:

Position Chinese Team Western Society

Pitcher Huang Rongjun Pala Ci

Catcher Lin Ye Ya Lu Shi

First Base Hu Guodong Baros

Second Base Chen Lunying Mendosa

Third Base Hu Zhengqu Bule Da

Shortstop Chen Fang Ma Shi

Tomorrow (Monday) is a public holiday. The League will hold the South China Club vs. Mindanao game tomorrow as a makeup game.

### Unreasonable

— Hua Fu

Although humans are the "spiritual beings of all things," surpassing all things in every aspect, it is regrettable that they have not completely detached themselves from the realm of "things." They still retain some "thing" nature and are unreasonable.

It is perhaps understandable that unreasonableness comes from illiterate people, commoners, or barbarians because these people are often regarded as "things" and deprived of the elegant title of "spiritual." However, unfortunately, unreasonableness can also come from scholars, high-ranking officials, or those who claim to be civilized. Moreover, the degree of unreasonableness in the latter sometimes seems more severe than in the former.

In the past, those who plotted to seize land, rape women, and monopolize lawsuits, implementing the principle of "what's yours is mine, and what's mine cannot be touched," were they not all scholars? "Magistrates" could "set fires," while "common people" could not "light lamps." "A lord can command his subject to die, and he must die; a father can command his son to perish, and he must perish." "There are no wrong parents under heaven." Following this line of reasoning, a person could be sentenced to slow slicing death, and the one being executed still had to kneel three times and kowtow nine times to "thank the emperor" for the sentence. ... Examples like these are either forcibly twisting "reason" or violating the laws of nature and "reason." Compared to robbing on the road and demanding "road toll," what is better about having a teahouse "adjudicate" before engaging in a full-scale armed fight?

Now, things are even worse, perhaps indeed an increase in degree. Let's not talk about anything else; just look at the countries that claim to be the most civilized. Their unreasonableness has simply created a new record, not only unprecedented but also unsurpassable, leaving future generations unable to catch up. They readily seek to destroy other countries, seize their lands, trample on innocent people, and plunder their movable property, disregarding treaties and agreements. They are unwilling to engage in "reasonable" consultation, negotiation, or discussion, and even if one appeals, pleads, or begs them, they pay no "attention" and act according to their own will. What is particularly hateful is that they still constantly claim that this is for peace, for the stability of a certain region, and for the happiness of the world. Their viciousness, cruelty, and brutality have truly reached the point where "reasoning is impossible," and it truly reflects the saying that the "plum tree" is planted in front of their door. Therefore, of all that is "reasonable" in the world, only this one family—one of the Trinity—exists, without division.

Some "gentlemen," who consider themselves kind and benevolent, believe that there is only one "right reason" in the world, but thousands of "wrong reasons." They choose to walk where there are more wrong reasons, and they have their own reasons. If the "right reason" were opened up and more were added, they would not exclusively walk the "wrong reason." Unexpectedly, this only makes things worse. It's like a tiger originally not knowing the taste of humans, but a "benevolent person" seeing it hungry sprinkles some blood for it to eat. Once it tastes it, it simply wants to eat people. It's also like Mr. Dongguo, who saved the wolf but it then wanted to eat him.

I believe that people who are unreasonable certainly have something wrong with their brains. Otherwise, why would they disregard human feelings and the laws of nature? The way to deal with them, besides offering appropriate persuasion like treating patients with medicine and injections, is to give them a sharp rebuke to make them suddenly realize. Otherwise, one can only lock them up and let them live or die on their own. Because reasoning is ineffective against the "unruly," one can only resort to this measure when dealing with the truly "unruly." Unreasonableness means having no sense of right and wrong: "Without a sense of right and wrong, one is not human." When dealing with "non-humans," one can only do this.

"When a person is about to die, their words are kind." Kind may be interpreted as "reasonable." The treacherous hero Cao Cao, who did so many unreasonable things throughout his life, had a will to "distribute incense and sell shoes" when he was about to die, which was "kind," which was reasonable. I think that those who are generally unreasonable now will probably only realize it when they are about to die!

Then, today's "gentlemen" or "benevolent people," if they truly want to see the Buddha to the Western Paradise and do things thoroughly, should find ways to prompt these unreasonable people to reach the stage of "their words are kind" as soon as possible! Saint Dan

### General Lu - Battlefield Memoirs

— Sheng Dan

After the old man went to Ruichang military headquarters, Jian Yin was about to leave for Xianning in a few days because his holiday was over, and I, after going from Liu'an to Hankou, also had to return to the Dabie Mountains to continue the work I should be doing. At this time, the war on the periphery of Wuhan had entered a critical stage. However, because I had an appointment with General Lu Han, I had to postpone it slightly to see the demeanor of that Yunnanese general. Moreover, he had made special achievements in the Battle of Taierzhuang, and in order to collect some valuable historical materials, I also felt it necessary to meet him. Therefore, although I was packed and ready to go, I did not immediately say goodbye to Wuhan. At the same time, the defense zone he was currently in charge of was precisely at the end of the Yuehan Railway in Hunan Province. If the three towns were swallowed up, then his responsibility in the western Hubei region would be great. Therefore, my return to the Dabie Mountains was extended by two weeks.

I remember it was a day of heavy air raids. Several more deep pits were added to the Hanyang airfield. Fortunately, it was just the soil that suffered, flying up for no reason. They were always desperately fighting with the soil for what they "collected" as taxes. It really felt like a waste. Therefore, friends who returned from the battlefield all expressed indifference to the bombings. After the air raid alarm was lifted, the telephone rang: "General Lu is waiting for you at Dingyu Lane in Hunan Street. Please come immediately. He will be crossing the river this afternoon." It was the voice of Director Peng of the Political Training Department, with a heavy Yunnan accent.

When I arrived at Dingyu Lane, the first thing that appeared before me was several young women from the Yunnan Women's Battlefield Work Team. They had broken through from Xuzhou and walked a long distance of seven hundred miles. They did not seem tired at all, and they were as spirited as the Anhui University Women's Battlefield Work Team I had seen in Huayang. "Santa Claus is here. He must have brought some gifts!" The girls were really good at joking. I had only visited them once, but they were already very familiar with me. But what gifts did I have? I had none. All I had was a respectful greeting.

I met General Lu. His attitude was so "gentle and refined" that one would suspect he was a scholar, no, a university professor? His conversation was so orderly that he resembled a "skillful orator" diplomat. The conversation lasted for two hours before it stopped. The topic was, of course, the past Battle of Taierzhuang. Finally, he said: "When we return in triumph in the future, let's meet at the Yellow Crane Tower!"

With a sincere smile, I shook hands with General Lu and said goodbye.

### Learning to Cry

— Yi Chu

It seems someone once said, "Crying is a sign of weakness." Yes, when two children fight, the weaker one will surely lose, and if they lose, they will surely cry. From this, we can prove that the statement "crying is a sign of weakness" is correct, so why should we "learn" it?

However, clever people say that crying is a way to conduct oneself and a secret to success. Their reasoning is that "everyone has a sense of compassion," and the way to move others' compassion is through "crying." They also cite a large number of successful figures, such as Liu Bei, Shen Baoxu, etc., to prove that "crying" is the secret to success. Since "crying" is the secret to success, its importance is evident, and why shouldn't we "learn" it? Then how to learn it? How to "apply" it after "learning"? Let's illustrate with examples:

For example, when you see that people's hearts in society are no longer what they used to be and that social morals are declining, you give a speech in public about ways to remedy the situation, but you must shed a few tears. Or, you publish a paper, but you must not omit the words "alas" (or "ah" for a more Westernized version) because that's how people will be moved and give you the title of "moralist." When you encounter refugees on the street asking you for money, you can turn your head and walk away—the faster you walk, the better. However, when you return home, you must compose a few ancient or modern poems of "grieving for the people" or "crying for the suffering compatriots" in a "level-oblique" tone and use a classic quote such as "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are bones of those who have starved to death." Publish it in a newspaper or magazine, and people will call you a "poet elder" and give you the title of "philanthropist." When your parents or other elders pass away, you might as well watch a movie or go to a dance hall, but the most important thing is that in the "obituary" or "death announcement" advertisement, you must not omit words such as "weeping blood," even if you are not feeling any pain in your heart. But when you see friends, your eyes must be as red as blood, and when you speak, your voice must be slightly trembling. Then people will say that you are able to "grieve to the point of emaciation" and give you the title of "filial son." Similarly, when talking about national affairs, you must cry bitterly or sob uncontrollably to show that "your patriotism is second to none." Therefore, people will still give you the title of "patriot." ...

If you don't want titles, then is crying useless? No, there are other uses.

For example, when you want to borrow money from someone, you must have a crying face. (If you can really cry, that's even better. If not, you must at least have a crying expression.) Then people will believe that you really have no money and are truly poor. Otherwise, you will surely be rejected and get a face full of dust. If you fail in school, you only need to go to the teacher, cry bitterly, preferably with tears streaming down your face, explaining the reasons for the failure. Then you can pass and be promoted. If you argue with your husband or get into a fight and lose, then you just need to "cry," "cry" to the ancestral altar for an hour, two hours, a day, two days... then your husband will surely be conquered and bow down to your short qipao, obeying your every command.

Since the way of crying came into being, it has spread like wildfire, and everyone is competing to imitate it, putting their own spin on it, creating a gloomy and eerie atmosphere of ghosts crying and gods wailing. Therefore, I take up my pen and declare:

"The way to conduct oneself lies in hypocrisy, and the way to be hypocritical lies in crying. As long as clever people do not die, disasters will not cease!"

### A Plea

— Qian Changnian

Not a low groan, nor a wild roar. Just the tears of our millions of people, flowing into the sea, and from this sea comes the sound like a giant wave. Our millions of suffering hearts—perhaps the most unfortunate. Those whose fates are different have never thought of this heart that has suffered. Who knows that sometimes being subjected to deep pain makes us forget that our bodies are also wandering without support? Who gives us friendly feelings? That's a dream—after all, they have their own destinies, sometimes throwing us a glimpse of sincere sympathy for a moment. However, after turning their heads, they are even more deeply in love with their own destinies. To whom do we appeal? Truth has steadily entered deep valleys, having long forgotten about our group of people.

We are directed to play a tragedy. Truth, has it given us a bit of light? There must be a ray of light in the darkness, as long as it can give us a bit of hope, we can go and explore.

Why should our home become rubble? We haven't had excessive enjoyment inside. Why do those shapeless flesh and blood cover our rice fields? Why take away our beloved child? He won't be hungry, wanting milk, and no longer intimately lean in our arms and cry "scared"? Why let tears be on the tight hug to the already broken arm? …

Truth, illuminate this world again, don’t lightly leave our group of millions of suffering people, give us a ray of hope.

Moored, homeless walking, eternally seasonless wandering. During the blazing hot summer, let the sun mercilessly scorch, sweat soaking the un-dry ragged clothes. There are also big houses there, but we dare not step in because they do not need truth. The days still slip away like this, the seasons are not forgiving to us, and the biting cold wind attacks the body in the dead of winter. What we are wearing is still the ragged clothes worn in the hot summer, although the body is frozen stiff, but there is still a knowing heart that has not frozen to death. This heart is eternally marked with a question: "Is this the judgment of truth?"

Heaven! This is not a curse, because this may be destiny. Looking at the bright and warm places, but we do not have the courage to knock, who is willing to listen to our plea, which door is willing to accept us, the homeless wanderers. Even if the gale blows down the body that cannot withstand hunger and cold, in other people's eyes, it may be equal to a frozen dog.

Who has ever witnessed the blood of their aged parents smeared on sharp knives, collapsing in the rubble in painful groans? Their hearts were as loving as other people’s parents and children, but they encountered encounters that were contrary to reason and emotion, and they never complained that their children were not as good as others, but at the time of their eternal parting, they were still concerned about a thought, deeply afraid that the children suffering on this bloody land would suffer more cruel devastation!

Whenever we are praying for the coming of truth, we feel like something is stuck in our throats, like blood dripping from our hearts. Our deep past becomes a trembling sob, what more suffering awaits us? But we do not expect to die, perhaps at the end of the tongue we will eventually be saved, enduring the pain, holding such hope; after the layers of dark clouds are covered, the sun, darkness will always be driven out of the world one day!

### On the Way Home (Middle)

— Wang Li

— Is it taking a car?... Are the yellow-clothed people going to the countryside? —

I pondered.

On the road ahead, farmers were fleeing this way in twos and threes. I walked up a mound and looked ahead. Behind a row of trees, black smoke suddenly rose, and then black smoke rose in one place after another.

I asked the farmers who were approaching from the front in a panic and learned that the yellow-clothed soldiers were repairing the destroyed bridge, venting their inherent rage.

I retreated to a small village I had just passed and detoured around the highway in the evening.

The next day, I walked along with a commoner. Along the way, we talked like familiar friends. Every time we encountered a tea shed, we would rest for a while and drink a few bowls of tea or a bit of baijiu (he was a friend who loved to drink).

As we walked down a yellow earth slope and passed the Huangshan Temple, from behind us, probably from the direction of Xiepu, came loud and dense artillery fire.

I don't know why, but over the long years, I have developed a love for the sound of guns and cannons, like the sound of bugles stirring in the morning air.

Listening to the artillery fire, my steps became more powerful. Every particularly loud artillery fire made me feel a sense of indescribable psychological pleasure.

Along the way, the common people were mixed with joy in terror, and terror mixed with joy, anxiously talking to each other or standing blankly, looking towards the distant direction where the artillery fire was sounding.

As the sun was setting in the west, I parted ways with the commoner and went to a small town. (To be continued)
