(II) Achievements in Mass Mobilization Work A. Based on the actual work of the past six months, our mass mobilization work has been established in most areas, whether in the front or rear. Precisely because of our efforts in mass mobilization, the mass movement has developed considerably. We have organized broad masses of people around our operational areas, which can be said to be our achievement. B. We have established a considerable number of mass organizations among the majority of the people, especially around our army in southern Anhui and in areas surrounding our troops in southern Anhui, where the effectiveness is greater than at the front. C. Because we paid considerable attention to improving the lives of the people, the people in this area have a heightened understanding of the War of Resistance. Their participation in the War of Resistance has not become a formality but is active and able to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance in certain aspects. D. We have especially established popular armed forces among the general populace at the front. Many poor popular armed forces have been reorganized and trained to become War of Resistance units. E. Due to the achievements of our mass mobilization work, our army and the people have truly become one, especially at the front where we can get great help from the masses. These are the main points of our achievements.

Future Trends of the War Situation in Jiangnan

When we talk about the trends of the war situation in Jiangnan today, we can divide it into two aspects: one is the movements of the × people, and the other is our future strategy.

(I) Speculation on the Movements of the × People A. First, in terms of the war situation, the × people are still in defensive counter-offensives, with defense as the objective, in both Jiangnan and southern Anhui. Based on the overall changes and developments of the war situation, the situation in Jiangnan may and will inevitably move from defensive counter-offensives to large-scale offensives against the guerrilla areas in the Jiangnan region. The entire strategy will shift to actively attacking guerrilla areas. B. Second, in military terms, based on past experience, the tactics of Japanese imperialism in dealing with us may largely adopt the methods used during the Chinese civil war, or build fortresses as strong points, construct roads, and use a bridge or a city as a stronghold. Therefore, we say that the × people may adopt the methods of dealing with guerrilla warfare used during the Chinese civil war in their tactics. Of course, they will not completely copy them, but will add their own tactics. This shows that we should pay attention to the future development of Japanese tactics. At the same time, we should also use past experience and, based on today's situation, develop our past experience. C. Third, Japanese imperialism will use various methods to buy off some wavering and unstable armed forces and guerrilla units to disintegrate and weaken our War of Resistance forces. In addition, they will organize many new puppet troops to create a force for attacking guerrilla areas and actually achieve the goal of using Chinese to control Chinese. I think this is possible both militarily and politically. D. Fourth, regarding the implementation of political disintegration, the × people will use various methods to sow discord and division to divide China's forces, divide the unity of China's War of Resistance, and cause some people to waver. They will use both kindness and power, using both favors and threats to sway wavering elements and undermine the unity of the entire Chinese people. Disintegrate the War of Resistance forces in these areas. E. Fifth, is to carry out economic oppression, on the one hand, implement a blockade policy against the guerrillas, on the other hand, sell Japanese goods in large quantities in other places, use Chinese materials, and buy Chinese materials in large quantities, implementing armed plunder of Chinese resources, and raising a large number of traitors and double-dealers, establishing their regime, and consolidating their rule over the occupied areas. This is a general description of the possible movements of the × people. In such a situation, what methods should we take to deal with them when the × people have adopted such policies?

(II) Our Future Countermeasures First, our future should emphasize politics over military affairs. Relying solely on military force is not enough. We must launch guerrilla warfare from political, economic, and military perspectives. We must rely on political forces to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and launch the masses. We must rely on the combination of politics and military affairs, and use political power to disintegrate the × people, expose the deception of the people, strengthen wavering elements, and consolidate national unity. Second, the masses are more important than the army. An army without the support of the masses around it is an isolated army. It is impossible to persist in the War of Resistance under such difficult circumstances. Therefore, mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses are more important than the army. Third, propaganda is more important than combat. The × people use divisive and destructive means to disintegrate and weaken our forces. We must expose the deception of the × people and unite the people to join the War of Resistance. At the same time, we must use propaganda to disintegrate the internal ranks of the × army. This propaganda work is more important than fighting. Fourth, spirit is more important than material. Our army's understanding of the War of Resistance is not enough, so we must strengthen the political work of our army, arm our minds, and strengthen our will, so that we can fight on relentlessly. Fifth, in order to develop the War of Resistance situation in this area, we must make guerrilla warfare a mass guerrilla war, not a separate army guerrilla war, and a mass armed struggle, not just an army action. Only in this way can we strike the × people at all times. Sixth, mobile warfare should be combined with guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare alone is not enough. We must simultaneously use mobile warfare to continuously annihilate the × people and give the × people greater consumption, so that the × people can only guard a few strongholds in such a large area across the country, and cannot maintain rule over a vast area. Seventh, we believe that future operations must have unified military and political command, so that military and political affairs meet the requirements of our war. For the convenience of the war, political and military cooperation must be consistent. Eighth, in terms of economy, we must lock the × people, and we must have our own methods and be self-sufficient. We believe that in such a war trend, in terms of the movement of the × people, we must adopt these principles and guidelines to win the victory of the future war, and the development and completion of the second stage of the War of Resistance, so as to quickly prepare our strength and strive for the rapid arrival of our counter-offensive stage.

Conclusion

The final conclusion: Our conclusion is very simple, it is three conclusions, combined into a general conclusion.

A. Based on the experience of the War of Resistance over the past year, we should: (1) Develop the achievements and advantages we have gained in this year. (2) Correct the shortcomings that existed in the War of Resistance this year.

B. Based on the lessons of the past year, we should: (1) Strengthen our political work and maximize the effectiveness of our political work. (2) Continuously improve our military technology to the necessary extent to suit our operational requirements. (3) Thoroughly eliminate the habits of guerrilla-ism and make our army all regularized. (4) Based on this lesson, consolidate and improve various systems, so that our army becomes the most flexible and most effective machine.

C. Based on the future trend of operations, we should: (1) Learn mobile warfare so that guerrilla warfare is combined with mobile warfare. (2) We must organize and launch mass guerrilla warfare everywhere. (3) Strengthen our propaganda work and mass movement. (4) The work of the × army (ie, propaganda to the × army and the work of winning them over to rebellion) should be launched throughout the army and become the common work of our entire army's operations, and at the same time become the War of Resistance work of the broad masses. (5) Maintain and develop the excellent traditions of our New Fourth Army. And create our new excellent traditional style. This is our adaptation to the combat tasks of the 28th year, the War of Resistance tasks of the second stage, and the completion of the tasks of the second stage. Only in this way can we make ourselves healthier day by day, and make us overcome our weaknesses day by day. Our summary of the experience and lessons of the past year is not only to find out our achievements, but mainly to recognize where our achievements come from, and at the same time to find out our weaknesses, what obstacles there are in the War of Resistance, and how to overcome them? Make us the most sound and most powerful War of Resistance army, so that we can make greater contributions and greater victories in the second stage of the War of Resistance to complete our mission!

### Our Five-Year Agricultural Plan

(Shanghai Correspondence) In order to develop agricultural production nationwide, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has specially approved the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to issue agricultural bonds and plans to complete a five-year agricultural plan, handle agricultural loans to increase agricultural production, plan reclamation to develop cooperation, and purchase major local products. The details are as follows:

Complete a Five-Year Agricultural Plan

The purpose of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank is to adjust agricultural products, circulate funds in the industry, and seek the development of rural areas nationwide. When necessary, it may submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to request the government to approve the issuance of agricultural bonds, but the amount is limited to the total amount of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank's fixed capital. The general manager of the bureau, He Lian, has considered the industrial and transportation conditions, delineated regions, and established agricultural adjustment offices to handle agricultural adjustment affairs during the extraordinary period, and plans to complete it within five years. The agricultural divisions are (1) farmland water conservancy, (2) increasing agricultural production, (3) planning reclamation, (4) developing cooperation, (5) agricultural loans, and (6) agricultural sales.

Handle Loans and Purchase Local Products

We have cooperated with the governments of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces and water conservancy agencies to handle water conservancy loans and production loans, including seeds, fertilizers, and plowing cattle. Currently, 8.3 million yuan of water conservancy loans, 4.87 million yuan of production loans, and 2 million yuan of agricultural product loans have been lent out. 81,000 yuan was allocated for agricultural improvement expenses. As for the purchase of major local products nationwide, we have purchased food, cotton, etc. in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces, with a total value of 10.17 million yuan. In addition, we have held transportation and sales loans in Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, with a total amount of 2.7 million yuan, but only for agricultural products.

Increase Production and Plan Reclamation

It is stipulated to increase food production in the west and cotton production in the southwest. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Last year's cotton production in the southwest increased significantly compared with the previous year. (1) Wheat fields in Shaanxi Province increased by 2 million mu, and production increased by 12 million dan. (2) Sichuan produced 900,000 bundles of cotton, an increase of one time compared with the previous year, and 74,000 mu of cotton fields were promoted. As for the planning and reclamation of Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, reclamation areas have been designated and refugees have been relocated to reclaim wasteland. Regarding agricultural cooperation, it has been actively promoted. Forty-seven cooperative treasuries have been established in various places, distributed in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces. Agricultural warehouses have been established everywhere to store agricultural products.

Water Conservancy Undertakings are Actively Underway

To develop agriculture in the inland, it is best to build water conservancy projects to facilitate irrigation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a central hydraulic laboratory to conduct hydraulic experiments and water conservancy research. Shaanxi Province has the most water conservancy projects. The Mei-Hui Canal has been completed, irrigating 200,000 mu. The Luo-Hui Canal project is also nearing completion, and can irrigate 500,000 mu. The Pai-Hui Canal can irrigate 200,000 mu, and the Hei-Hui Canal can irrigate 100,000 mu. The Tiao-Hui Canal in Gansu has now been completed. The Min-Hui Canal will be completed soon, and each can irrigate tens of thousands of mu. The southwest provinces have also been approved separately. A total of 200,000 mu can be irrigated in Sichuan, 190,000 mu can be irrigated in Guangxi, and 200,000 mu can be irrigated in Hunan.

Editorial

### New Atmosphere on the Front Lines

After the exposure of the secret agreement between Wang and Hiranuma, the 'anti-communist' and 'peace' conspiracy plotted by × traitors suffered another major blow. The atmosphere on the front lines of the War of Resistance has also been renewed. What is particularly noteworthy is that our army in the Northwest crossed the Yellow River to attack Jin ×, that our army in Hebei, Chahar, and Jin marched outside the customs to launch the Northeast War of Resistance, that our army in Longhai divided its forces to attack Kaifeng and Xuzhou and severely damaged the × army, that the remaining guerrillas along the Pinghan and Jinpu lines were reactivated, and that guerrilla warfare on a large scale was launched in the border areas of Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Especially in South China, our army divided its forces from Zengcheng, Huaxian, Foshan, and other places to create a situation of surrounding Guangzhou. The realization of this strategic advantage can be said to be the new atmosphere seen only in the more than 20 months of the War of Resistance. No wonder the British 'Times', 'Daily Express', 'Daily Telegraph', etc., which are usually known for their rigorous arguments, have also unanimously praised that our country's War of Resistance has already gained an advantage.

We must recognize that the main reason why this new atmosphere has been discovered on the front lines of the War of Resistance is that our entire nation and soldiers unanimously support the government's most steadfast leader's spirit of resolutely fighting to the end, that is due to the strong unity of all ethnic groups, parties, and strata of our country, is due to our great progress in politics, military affairs, economy, and diplomacy, and also due to the growth of the international democratic and peaceful anti-aggression front and the sympathy and assistance of the whole world for our War of Resistance. If we can accurately recognize these main reasons, we can further maintain and develop these main reasons, then a more optimistic new atmosphere will be discovered on the front lines of the War of Resistance until the final victory is realized.

But at the same time, we must also be clear that these new atmospheres on the front lines of the War of Resistance are not a sign that we have already entered the 'strategic counter-offensive stage', but only a necessary step for the War of Resistance to shift from the first stage of defense to the second stage of stalemate. Because we know that the × people are trying to take advantage of the progress of the German and Italian aggressors in Europe and the difficult situation of Britain and France to step up their military speculative and adventurous steps in the Far East, in order to consolidate their occupied areas, establish a unified and strong puppet regime, and then use the 'anti-communist' and 'peace' movements as an auxiliary to complete the plan to subdue the entire China. The widespread offensive currently launched on the front lines of our War of Resistance is to break this plan of the × people, prevent the offensive of the × people, and then increase the difficulties of the × people, weaken the combat effectiveness of the × people, promote the realization of the stalemate stage, and prepare for the execution of the war of resistance and counter-offensive.

Based on this new understanding of the current War of Resistance, at least it should be clear that: to adapt to this new atmosphere that has already been realized, we must maintain and develop this new atmosphere, that is, we must quickly and effectively enhance the combat power of our front lines, widely develop guerrilla warfare behind the × lines, and at the same time step up the cultivation of new forces in the rear and promote all preparations for strategic counter-offensive. This is the overall task of our entire nation's current War of Resistance. In order to smoothly complete this task, everyone must do their best to maintain those essential reasons for the victory of the War of Resistance mentioned above. We must effectively implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence. We must strive to eliminate traitors and eliminate traitorous remarks and actions such as 'anti-communism' and 'peace', and support persevering in the War of Resistance and striving for final victory and true peace. We must consolidate and expand the national united anti-Japanese front and the international anti-aggression peace front, in order to concentrate the strength of the entire nation and concentrate more and greater foreign aid. And when the new atmosphere is initially presented on the front lines, our entire nation, especially overseas Chinese, in addition to the above-mentioned tasks, must also be doubly enthusiastic to return to the country and serve their hometowns, must also be doubly enthusiastic to donate money and goods to relieve refugees, and must also redouble their efforts in propaganda and mobilization work to win international sympathy and assistance for me. The new atmosphere on the front lines has illuminated our great road of struggle with the glory of victory!

### A Meeting with General Zhang Fakui and Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng

— Ye Juesun

Friends of China in China (8)

In the early morning of the 19th, Li Meng and I returned from a teahouse after 'drinking tea'. He expressed great appreciation for many sweet pastries. Just as we stepped into the entrance of the hostel, the waiter told me that Commander-in-Chief Zhang's headquarters had called. However, he did not know who called and what they said. In order to visit Mr. Zhang Xianghua, the 'Iron General' who came to Guangzhou to take charge, I called the headquarters. Unexpectedly, General Zhang himself answered the phone. Therefore, I expressed my intention to him and made an appointment for the meeting time. He said that he was busy with a meeting now and would send someone to pick us up at twelve o'clock. With this appointment, we sat patiently waiting for the clock to strike twelve!

At twelve o'clock, someone knocked on the door. The person who came in was a very capable-looking officer with a few short mustaches on his upper lip. After exchanging business cards with each other, it turned out that he was Section Chief Liang from the Adjutant's Office. At the invitation of the local, we arrived at the reception room of the headquarters. As soon as we sat down, a tall and large hunting dog ran out of the room inside. It sniffed everyone's feet, and then lay down very gently next to us. It seemed to be telling us that the host was about to come out. At this time, the surrounding air seemed to suddenly tense up, and there was silence. After a while, Mr. Zhang came out of the side door with a smile. He was not tall, and had a thin figure, with the 'short and capable' characteristics of the average Cantonese person, just like what Brother Xia Yan said; The tiger general who was famous in the Northern Expedition, the founder of the Fourth Army of the "Chinese Iron Army," the commander, the ×× commander-in-chief, and the general of the team army… From these reputations, experiences, and positions, I mysteriously associated with a General Zhang Huanhou-style with a leopard forehead and curly beard. However, when he appeared in front of us, and shook our hands diligently and enthusiastically, he was an intellectual class person with a figure similar to ours and a pair of kind and often smiling eyes. Moreover, it is said that he also likes to play tennis and swim... lively with the demeanor of a college student. When speaking, the two small mustaches kept moving on both sides, adding a lot of gentle ingredients. When Li Meng asked about the military situation in Guangdong, he said, "I have not been here for a long time, so what I know is only a general situation. All the detailed situations can be asked to Deputy Commander Yu in the future. He is naturally more familiar than me." This humble and amiable expression made us constantly fortunate for the future of Guangdong. The lessons of Guangzhou in the past; tell us that personnel coordination is absolutely sufficient to improve work efficiency. Then, Mr. Xianghua said, "There are a total of ninety-seven counties in Guangdong. The area occupied by the × people is only a few county towns and a few large towns. This is also the biggest weakness of the × people. In a country like China with such a vast land and so many people, he has no power to go further and deeper. Moreover, since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of guerrillas in Guangdong has increased rapidly, and there have been many facts of people automatically rising up to kill ×. As of now, it can be said that there is a stalemate between × and me. There are no major battles on the lines, but only small contacts. The cooperation between the guerrillas and the regular army has also become more closely. Now the power of the × people in Guangdong is also very weak, with a total of only about six or seventy thousand people."; Is there a possibility of a major battle in Guangdong in the near future! Mrs. Li Meng asked curiously, "Of course there is a possibility. In my opinion, there are only two ways to go here, one is the offensive of the × people, and the other is our counter-offensive. Both of these developments are enough to cause major battles." Of course, the possibility of the former is greater than that of the latter. Our counter-offensive force is still being cultivated, and the timing of the counter-offensive is not yet ripe. Moreover, if the counter-offensive is started, it must be a national strategic issue rather than a separate action in Guangdong. Finally, General Zhang said, "Due to a understanding I have gained from participating in the war in the past year, I firmly believe that the final victory will definitely be ours. The facts have now told us that the × people are not good at mountain warfare. In Shanghai, the ratio of casualties between × and me was probably one to four. We died four people and the × people died one person. By the time of the Battle of the Longhai Road, the ratio had become three to one, and we could die one person less than before. As for the Battle of Jiujiang, the contrast in mortality has become two to one, and now it will slowly reach equality. After that, the area of operation will mostly be mountainous areas, and transportation will be extremely inconvenient, and action will naturally become difficult. In our case, we can save a lot of ammunition due to the inconvenience of the terrain; the × people will have a lot of new difficulties. What's more, our army is getting stronger and stronger, and the morale is getting stronger and stronger. The guerrilla areas behind the × people are also growing. Naturally, these many situations can make a foreign friend who sympathizes with China optimistic about the future of the war and can deeply believe that we will definitely win. At the same time, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to friends who have come from afar and hope that you will expose the atrocities of fascist Japan in China to the international community, so that everyone can understand that China has already had many conditions for sure victory." This solid sentence containing infinite energy expresses what kind of awesome figure this famous general who has fought on the battlefield for a long time is. While mutually hoping that the relationship between China and France will not be improved and that the people of China and France will strengthen their unity, we nodded goodbye to Mr. Zhang, who was standing at the gate of the camp.

### The Jiangxi-Guangdong War Situation is Extremely Stable; South of Nanchang, We Have Switched to the Offensive; Remnants of the Enemy in Zengcheng are Annihilated

[Chongqing Telegram, 16th] The battle situation on all fronts has been extremely stable for the past two days. Jiangxi and Guangdong remain the center of the war, but there have been no major changes. Our troops south of Nanchang have continuously switched to the offensive against the enemy forces along the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for several days. On the 12th, they recaptured places like Xiliang Mountain and are pressing towards Xiangtang. On the afternoon of the 14th, about four or five hundred enemy soldiers at Huangnigang (southwest of Xiliang Mountain) retreated to Shabutang.

[Zhangshu Telegram] In recent days, our counter-attacking troops towards Gao'an recaptured Shi'er City, west of Gao'an, on the evening of the 14th, killing many enemy soldiers. Remnants of the enemy fled into the city, and our army is taking advantage of the victory to advance towards Gao'an.

[Xiushui Telegram, 15th] A small detachment of the enemy, six kilometers southwest, at Yanziling, was surrounded by our attacking troops on the evening of the 14th. The enemy's attempt to break through failed and they were eventually killed by us, with over thirty casualties, including two officers. Several dozen rifles were seized, along with many documents.

[Wengyuan Telegram, 16th] A delayed report states that enemy troops near Zhucun and other places along the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway engaged in fierce fighting with our troops on the 14th. Currently, our army has surrounded the enemy. Furthermore, after Zengcheng was captured by us on the morning of the 14th, a part of the enemy troops within the city were completely annihilated.

[Gualin Telegram, 15th] Over a hundred enemy soldiers attempted to surround our Nantou City from Dengmu the day before yesterday, engaging in fierce fighting with our troops. By 4 p.m. yesterday, the enemy had been driven back by us.

[Central News Agency, Yingde Telegram, 15th] Our troops in Huaxian launched a fierce attack on the enemy at Tulongfang (south of Hua) and Longkoujiang on the morning of the day before yesterday. After several hours of intense fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and abandoned over a hundred corpses, fleeing towards Xinjie and Huling. Our army pursued and attacked. A certain unit of ours launched a flanking attack from Juntian southwards. The battle was extremely fierce. By yesterday morning, the enemy had set fire to all the houses in Xinjie and fled towards Jiangcun. Our army is currently pursuing vigorously.

[Central News Agency, Sihui Telegram, 15th] A certain unit of ours launched a fierce counter-attack towards the enemy in the Xinhui direction on the 13th, engaging in extremely fierce fighting with the enemy in the Duruan Jinggen area. Our troops fought bravely, killing many enemy soldiers. On the evening of the 13th, the enemy could not withstand the attack and fled in different directions. We recaptured the strongholds of Guifeng, Duruan, and Sanyao, and captured an enemy armored vehicle. On the morning of the 14th, we launched another fierce pursuit of the enemy and are currently engaged in fierce fighting near Dayuanqian.

The Recaptured Huangchuan

[Central News Agency, Huangchuan Telegram, 16th] A reporter set out from a certain place in northern Hubei at the beginning of the month, broke through the enemy's cordon, crossed the Pinghan Railway at a certain place, and arrived in southeastern Hubei. After seven days of arduous travel, he arrived safely in the Huangchuan County seat, which had been recaptured. Huangchuan had fallen into enemy hands in September of last year, lasting seventy days. It was recaptured by a certain guerrilla detachment of a certain war zone of ours. When the enemy retreated, they left behind many corpses and military supplies. After our troops entered the city, it took many days to bury all the bodies. Efforts have been made to restore order, comfort refugees, reorganize the Baojia system, train young men, and eliminate traitors. The results are very good. Currently, half of the city's residents have returned, and the market is recovering to its pre-war state. Today, the reporter observed piles of broken tiles on the streets of the north and south cities. Although there are signs of recovery, the sight of broken walls and ruins is everywhere. In the villages within a few miles of the city, there are dangerous walls and bullet holes like beehives. The general population, having suffered such a great trauma, hates the enemy even more and is united in resisting aggression. The military and civilians are cooperating closely, waiting for an opportunity to attack the enemy, causing them to be overwhelmed.

### The Counter-Offensive in North China is Progressing; The Battles in Shanxi and Henan are Intense; Our Army's Counter-Offensive in Central and Southern Shanxi is Repeatedly Victorious; Our Air Force Bombs Taiyuan

[Reuters, Zhangping Telegram, 16th] Yesterday, official Japanese telegrams received here stated that the Chinese army's offensive in North China has not slackened. Fierce fighting has repeatedly occurred in southern Shanxi and south of Kaifeng. Japanese aircraft reports state that the Chinese army is reinforcing the Kaifeng area from Zhengzhou. There is also fierce fighting northwest of Shijiazhuang in eastern Shanxi.

[Minge News Agency, Xingji Telegram, 16th] On the 9th, our brave air force flew over Taiyuan and dropped dozens of bombs on enemy concentrations, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. We also dropped leaflets in the city, ordering civilians and businesses to quickly evacuate outside the city. In recent days, the enemy in Taiyuan has been very panicked. Most of the enemy's families and Japanese merchants have fled eastward on the Zhengtai Railway.

[Minge News Agency, Xingji Telegram, 16th] (1) The order in Taiyuan has become increasingly chaotic in recent days. Every day after dusk, robberies occur frequently. Screaming can be heard next door to the residences of the enemy, but the enemy does not dare to step out, fearing attacks by our plainclothes units. (2) The enemy in Wangfeng (west of Taiyuan) strictly prohibits villagers from entering or leaving after dusk, and streetlights are not allowed. Entrances and exits of the village, as well as the ends of important streets and lanes, are surrounded by barbed wire. Several cannons are also set up around the village to defend against our attacks. The enemy in various villages near Taiyuan city is forcibly conscripting civilians to form auxiliary imperial teams. Many villagers are fleeing to avoid this.

[Minge News Agency, Xingji Telegram, 16th] Our units in the eastern and western mountains of central Shanxi have been mobilized in recent days to counter-attack the enemy. A certain unit of ours once charged into the south gate of Taigu, killing many enemy soldiers. There has also been contact near Qingyuan and Xugou, with the sound of artillery constant throughout the day. The enemy in Wenshui and Jiaocheng is very panicked. The enemy in Kaizha (southwest of Jiaocheng) are preparing to go undercover. Eight of them fled on the 11th.

[Minge News Agency, Xingji Telegram, 16th] Since our large army in southern Shanxi launched a counter-attack against the enemy, the enemy has suffered heavy losses.

[Minge News Agency, Lanxian Telegram, 16th] Military intelligence indicates that around 4 p.m. on the 11th, enemy troops who had invaded Shenchi from the west invaded Wuzhai. We withdrew to pre-determined locations. There was fierce fighting near Wuzhai on the morning of the 11th, with many enemy casualties. Other intelligence indicates that enemy troops who invaded Wuzhai at around 5 a.m. on the 11th advanced towards Lanxian in different directions. One route advanced to the Sanjing Qiuzijian (50 li northeast of Lanxian) area and constantly shelled Lanxian city. One unit of our army confronted them head-on, while another unit attacked the enemy's flank. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated to Wuzhai. Another unit of several hundred enemy soldiers attacked Sancha and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with a certain army of ours.

Our army recaptured the county seat and pursued the enemy. The enemy attacking Sancha has also been defeated by our army. By the evening of the 13th, our army had cleared out the enemy near Sancha and are advancing towards Shenchi. Over eight hundred enemy soldiers from Pinglu invaded Pianguan on the 12th. We are closely monitoring them.

[Xingji Telegram, 16th] The war situation yesterday afternoon, as reported by the front lines by telephone, is recorded as follows: (1) After our capture of Yicheng city, over two thousand enemy soldiers from Quwo, with the support of over ten aircraft, reinforced the area. On the morning of the 14th, they were intercepted by us north of Nanfanzhen (southeast of Quwo) and are engaged in fierce fighting. (2) After our army captured Lucun, northeast of Jiangxian, on the 12th, they are now approaching Jiangxian, launching a fierce attack. Another route is advancing towards Lengkou. (3) The battle in the Zhangdianzhen Ershililing area is extremely fierce. Our army is launching a fierce counter-attack, but the enemy's fortifications are strong, and we have been engaged in bitter fighting for days. (4) Three to four hundred enemy soldiers from Dongzhen (north of Wenxi) counter-attacked Xiangshanzhuang Songcheng on the evening of the 12th. On the morning of the 14th, our army attacked the enemy who had retreated to Ruyicun, and the enemy retreated to Wenxi. We are currently pursuing them.

### The Battle of Mabu Dashan (Report)

— Zhang Changren

[Special Report] On March 23, 1939, the ×××th Division, defending our Chen Di north of the Miluo River, under the command of General Zhang ×× of the ×××th Army, was ordered to attack from the Xinqiang River. The task was to feign an attack on three enemy strongholds on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway: Guozhen City in the front, Matang Railway Station on the left flank, and Xinkaitang on the right flank, in order to contain the enemy troops fiercely attacking Nanchang in northern Jiangxi.

Since the beginning of November of the previous year, the enemy troops in Yueyang, Quan and Xianning had only left a small number of troops—including recruits and puppet troops—to garrison after rushing to build stronghold fortifications. The enemy troops in Yueyang were under the banner of the 9th Division, while those in Puqi and Qi Ning were under the 6th Division. They knew that they were facing Guan's troops, who had made them tremble in Lunan and Ruichang. Therefore, even when they were in groups in the nearby countryside during the day, robbing homes and looting, they would hide in the strongholds surrounded by two layers of barbed wire at night to prevent sudden attacks by guerrilla troops.

Cheng Jiahuang, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the ×××th Regiment, led the fighting soldiers of his battalion from the camp near the Xinqiang River. He had shed blood twice for the national revolution during the Northern Expedition and had been wounded in Shanghai, Lunan, and Ruichang since the "August 13th" Incident. Years of life in the battlefield had made this strong man from central Hubei as strong as iron. The khaki woolen uniform had been on him for two winters, but he still wore it as neatly as new. His purplish-brown square face and majestic round eyes made the brothers feel that he was respectable and awe-inspiring. He was particularly kind when talking to the old people and always said that China would definitely have a way under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, which made the old people and the brothers feel that he was kind and lovely.

For five months, they had gone through snow-covered mountains to fields full of yellow flowers, going in and out of the mountains east of the abandoned base of the Yuehan Railway. Now, Battalion Commander Cheng and his subordinates were even more familiar with the area than returning to their hometowns. They felt as close to those peaceful villages, some of which had been dilapidated and some of which were still being built, as they did to their own homes. Once, they watched the enemy dismantle the beams and pillars of those villages on the mountain to build fortifications. Several brothers were so angry that they gnashed their teeth and stamped their feet, demanding to rush down and kill them all. He comforted them, saying, "There will be that day. I will be ordered to kill them with you."

The mountains and fields of Hunan are as lovely as the farmers of Hunan. The yellow soil hills sometimes reveal ochre-black boulders. The young pine forests and the seemingly countless layers of terraced fields seem to be saying to everyone, "This is one of the guarantees for the inevitable success of national construction." These days, it has been raining from time to time. The fields are full of water, pouring out in layers towards the lower ground. On the hillside, farmers wrapped in black headscarves are walking with oxen in the mud. Hearing the rustling sound from the foot of the mountain, they pull the ox rope with one hand and shield the sun above their heads with the other, looking down. The flashing bayonets and the flower-patterned single-file column reflected in the paddy fields. He watched them with a smile until the last one. He realized that these brothers were going to fight the enemy, and perhaps his own brothers were among them.

The door of a farmer's house by the roadside is open. Enemy soldiers often appear in this area, and women and children cannot let them see their faces. They all go to secluded mountain recesses. Adults work in the fields, and the elderly sit守 at home, not opening the door unless they see their own army. When the point man passes through their fields, they know that the follow-up troops will arrive soon. They quickly burn pine firewood to boil water, fill a large bucket, and wait at the intersection with a few rough bowls. If they need to camp, they move the precious fodder into the house for the animals and insist on letting the officers sleep in their own beds.

Bypassing Yingzui Mountain and taking the road through Shachong, the team goes from west of Dashan, around the right side of Mabu Dashan, to the right front. This mountain, at an elevation of 380.5 meters, is located between Xinkaitang and Matang Railway Station, and only 15 li from Guozhen City. The advance troops made contact with the enemy's guarding troops. Bullets burst out with a clear sound, and then each trailed a bee-like tail,划 over the sky. Our imposing aura tightly compressed the enemy, forcing them to溃 scattered, leaving behind the pitiful corpses of the "Imperial Army" and fleeing north. A part of us detoured northeast near Taohuadong, destroying the bridge near Maolipu between Xinkaitang and Guozhen City. Most of us continued to advance northwest.

### Guangdong Enriches Anti-War Strength; Improves County Teams; This Chairman Has Ordered Thorough Verification; Organization of the Masses Emphasizes Persuasion

[Shaoguan Express News] Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, believes that at this critical time of the anti-war effort, the organization and training of anti-Japanese self-defense corps in various counties and cities in the province is extremely urgent. In order to improve the quality of the teams and enrich the strength of the anti-war effort, he has specifically ordered the administrative inspectors of each district to urge the city and bureau chiefs under their jurisdiction to quickly send personnel to the gathering places of each team to verify the number of personnel. If the number of personnel is insufficient, they should be given a deadline to make up the full quota. Those who submit false reports or embezzle food supplies shall be punished. As for the captains of each county, if they are indeed incompetent, the city and bureau chiefs shall order a re-election. Team members who are old or weak, or whose guns are inferior, shall be immediately sent back and replaced with strong men with good guns. If ammunition is lacking, they may submit a request to be verified and issued accordingly. After the verification of the gathered teams is completed, they shall continue to work with the district and township chiefs to verify and conduct general training of the teams, weeding out the weak and retaining the strong. If the number of personnel is insufficient, they shall be ordered to supplement or merge them. If there are still good guns hidden in the countryside that have not been incorporated, they should be made to join teams with vacancies. If there are no vacancies in nearby teams, then a new team should be formed, and according to the number of people and guns, they should be formed into squads or platoons, belonging to the nearby large company. If some people are not fully aware of the meaning of organizing self-defense, they should first be given sincere劝导 to make them voluntarily join. Those who do not listen shall be given a warning by the district and township chiefs and ordered to join.

### US Wartime Insurance Stops for Goods Transported to Germany and Italy; Prices for Goods Transported to China Also Rise

[Central News Agency, New York Telegram, 15th] Insurance companies here recently announced that wartime insurance has been suspended for all goods transported to or from Germany and Italy. It is said that this is because the hard-line naval policy pursued by various democratic countries in the Mediterranean has led to a sudden increase in tensions. In addition, the insurance fee for goods transported to China through the Suez Canal has increased from 62.5 cents per $100 to $1.25 per $100, the highest rate ever.

### The New Provincial Capital of Guangdong: A New Posture in Qujiang

— Tang Shi

Continued from yesterday

3. Youth Groups

The situation encountered by the youth groups is similar to that of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Corps, but the losses after the withdrawal from Guangzhou were heavier. Now there are only about 30 people left, some of whom are participating in the work of the Qujiang County Party Headquarters, and some of whom are participating in the work of the Provincial Party Headquarters. The focus of work is 重民衆 schools.

4. New Sports Association Women's Working Committee

The women's movement after the fall of Guangzhou was very dull for a period of time. Recently, Mrs. Wu Jufang, the wife of Chairman Li, initiated the organization of a women's training class to train women cadres, who will be assigned to various places to be responsible for carrying out the women's movement and re-establish it. Note: The national women's working committee is led by Mrs. Chiang, and each province is presided over by the wife of the provincial chairman.

5. 4th War Zone Political Work Brigade

This brigade has not been in Qujiang for long. In the past, it has always worked as a traffic and communication officer and troop worker with the political department. The main task is to bring the masses and the army closer together and to create military-civilian cooperation through organization, training, and education. After coming to Qujiang, in addition to the general oral and written propaganda, they also founded several mass night schools and compiled mass textbooks according to the local situation.

6. Military Commission Fifth Political Work Brigade

This team is肾 staying in Qujiang and is expected to go to Xijiang in the future to assume political training work in the army. They previously worked in Shixing, Wengyuan and other places. The Military Commission once had a first performance brigade come to Qujiang and performed several national defense plays, which were widely welcomed by the public. Their fundraising tickets were snapped up by everyone, because many of the members had considerable experience in the theater world, such as Zhao Dan.

7. Provincial Relief Committee First Brigade

This is a famous rescue team in the province. They have previously worked on the front lines of Shi'an Zengcheng and are now temporarily in Qujiang and will return to the front lines. People in society admire them very much.

8. Social Service Office

The Social Service Office is sponsored by the Provincial Party Headquarters and is a semi-group, semi-institutional organization. The purpose is to serve society and establish good relations with the masses. It has mass schools, mass inquiry offices, and job introduction offices. If compatriots who are "new to the area" have any difficulties, they can try their best to help solve them.

In addition, the Security Political Brigade and the County People's Education Center are both for mass education and propaganda. The People's Education Center has　 reporting offices, mass weekly meetings, current affairs forums, and literacy classes.

In the past two days, the political work team of the Central Movement Committee, which was transferred back from Xijiang, selected about 100 people and concentrated them in the county middle school for training. The training is presided over by the Fourth War Zone Command and will last for three weeks before being assigned to various guerrilla areas. In the second stage, the importance of this work is self-evident. It is hoped that the authorities will continue to train them in batches and transport them in large quantities to the occupied areas. After the enemy arrives, they will launch containment, harassment,　 attacks, and annihilation of enemy guerrilla warfare, and should pay special attention to organizing the masses in the occupied areas.

The above is just a brief introduction to the situation of the various salvation groups here. Because the reporter passed through Qujiang and stayed for two days, it was a fleeting glimpse. There must be many details that are not clear. It is hoped that each community will often report the situation of activities, exchange observations, and encourage each other to promote progress towards the bright road of anti-war national construction!

March 30, 1939, in Qu.

### Singaporean Elementary School Students Comfort Anti-Japanese Soldiers; Little Angels' Patriotic Enthusiasm is Admirable

[Central News Agency, Changsha Telegram, 15th] The Changsha Central Daily News recently received 808 letters of comfort from Chinese elementary schools in Singapore, completely written by the hands of adorable little angels, full of pure and innocent enthusiasm. The newspaper has quickly forwarded them to the front lines to be distributed to the anti-Japanese soldiers for reading.

### The Establishment of the Balance Fund Committee Makes Our Finance More Stable; Rogers Will Go to Chongqing to Meet with Our Authorities; Our New Loan from Britain Should Be Successful

(Hong Kong News) Our government, in order to stabilize foreign exchange and enrich the wartime economy, previously held credit loans from Britain and the United States to stabilize the foreign exchange fund, with a loan of 25 million yuan to the United States and a loan of 10 million pounds to Britain. The British loan is guaranteed by the British government and paid by the British bank. The method of disbursement is that HSBC Bank accounts for 3 million pounds, Standard Chartered Bank accounts for 2 million pounds, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications account for a total of 5 million pounds. This loan has been successfully completed. The Central and British countries have set up a balance foreign exchange fund committee to manage everything. The members of the committee are Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications, Carey of HSBC Bank, Jin Bizhi of the Standard Chartered Bank, and British financial expert Rogers. The balance foreign exchange fund committee office was established in Hong Kong.

Successful Loans and Stable Finance

After Rogers was appointed as a member of the committee, on the 2nd of this month, he accompanied his wife from Britain by Imperial Airways plane to Hong Kong, arriving at the port on the evening of the 8th, staying at the Repulse Bay Hotel. Rogers came to China this time with the task of reorganizing Chinese finance. When Rogers left the UK to come to the East, he had several meetings with Sir Leith-Ross, who had been sent to China to help reorganize the monetary system, to discuss the reorganization and implementation of Chinese gold coins in detail. As for the content, it involves the entire financial plan and cannot be published in Hong Kong. With the success of China's loan to Britain and the United States this time, and the joint reorganization by China and Britain, the consolidation of China's wartime finance will inevitably be a reality. Recently, the Chinese government has again borrowed 3 million pounds from the British side and is currently in discussion, which is believed to be successful. It is just around the corner. With this support, China's finance will be more enriched. Even if there are disputes in the international community, the financial turmoil will not affect and shake Chinese finance. In addition, Rogers, after arriving in Hong Kong, also conducted an investigation and observation of the financial situation in Hong Kong and met with the local authorities to briefly discuss the general situation. He will stay in Hong Kong for a considerable amount of time before leaving Hong Kong to go to Chongqing to meet with our highest authorities, and then return to Hong Kong. The trip is scheduled to return to the UK in four months to report to the British authorities on the situation, and then come to the East again.

### Unexpected Statement on Current Affairs: Maintaining the Anglo-Italian Agreement [Reuters, Rome, 15th]

Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, speaking at the Fascist Party headquarters tonight, expressed agreement with Chamberlain's statement on maintaining the Anglo-Italian Agreement. He stated, "Currently, no incidents have occurred that would alter the Anglo-Italian Agreement. On our part, we have contributed significantly to this agreement, which was concluded between our two nations in April of last year."

Norway Considers Tax Increase to Strengthen National Defense [Central News Agency, Norway, 15th]

Smooth Progress in Anglo-Franco-Soviet Talks: Designated Outcome Expected, Strengthening Baltic Guarantees [Reuters, Moscow, 16th]

It is learned that since French Foreign Minister Bonnet and the Soviet Ambassador to France held a meeting in Paris tonight, negotiations regarding inviting the Soviet Union to participate in mutual assistance are proceeding satisfactorily. It is reported that methods to resolve several aspects have been found, and a designated outcome is expected by Sunday. These negotiations are apparently not limited to aviation measures; it is also rumored to concern the supply of various munitions and raw materials to Poland and Romania in wartime.

[London, 15th]

Europe is experiencing a quiet weekend with no startling or unexpected events. However, it would be a mistake to interpret this silence as a sign of peace, as democracies and Axis powers are engaged in intense diplomatic maneuvering and covert activities to consolidate their respective positions. These activities can be broadly categorized into four areas: (1) Germany and Italy: Göring is currently in Rome discussing matters with Mussolini; (2) Yugoslavia and Bulgaria: While the content of their discussions remains undisclosed, it is reported that the Yugoslav envoy to Bulgaria has departed for Belgrade after lengthy discussions with the Bulgarian Prime Minister (Note: The actions of these two countries are noteworthy, as Yugoslavia's stance has remained ambiguous since Italy's invasion of Albania, significantly impacting the Balkan front); (3) Poland and Greece: Polish Foreign Minister Beck met separately today with the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, and Italy, as well as the envoys of Romania and Turkey; (4) The Backbone of the Democratic Front—Britain and France: The Anglo-Soviet talks regarding an air force assistance alliance are drawing the most attention. After British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Soviet Ambassador Maisky held discussions, instructions were issued to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to continue discussions with Litvinov. Both London and Paris acknowledge new developments in the negotiations with the Soviet Union, with the French Foreign Ministry expressing extreme optimism. Simultaneously, there is consideration of inviting Turkey to join the anti-aggression front. Since Britain declared its guarantee of Romania, newspapers have paid particular attention to the actions of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu. Following his visit to Berlin this month, Gafencu is scheduled to visit Brussels on April 21st. The British side has already expressed its welcome to Gafencu's potential visit to Britain. While no formal invitation has been extended yet, there are numerous issues awaiting discussion between Britain and Romania. If Gafencu could visit Britain after Brussels, it would provide an opportunity to exchange views.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 15th]

The proposed Soviet-Polish-Romanian air force cooperation plan has become the focus of British press commentary on Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Diplomatic circles believe this policy is feasible. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Manchester Guardian" stated that, according to informed sources, the agreement sought by Britain and the Soviet Union would fall between existing Anglo-Soviet relations and the Anglo-Polish agreement. In other words, it would surpass existing Anglo-Soviet relations but not reach the comprehensiveness of the Anglo-Polish agreement. In the event of war, both Poland and Romania must be considered, and their supply lines must be protected. Informed diplomatic sources share this view and recognize that the current objective of Anglo-Soviet negotiations is to lay the foundation for a series of future agreements, ensuring that Poland and Romania receive adequate supplies of raw materials and munitions in the event of war. British and French newspapers are predicting cooperation between their respective air forces, with some reports suggesting that the Soviet Union will supply aircraft to the Baltic states. According to informed sources, another crucial point in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is the unrestricted passage of British warships through the Dardanelles Strait in wartime, thereby safeguarding the transport of supplies to Romania.

[Reuters, Athens, 15th]

The Greek Prime Minister today requested the British envoy to Greece to convey to the British government the Greek government's profound gratitude for the British guarantee.

Romanian King to Meet with Yugoslav Regent [Reuters, Rome, 15th]

Romanian King Carol convened a Royal Council today, attended by Prime Minister Calinescu and Foreign Minister Gafencu. It is understood that the discussions revolved around: (1) Gafencu's visit to Berlin next week; (2) The Hungarian diplomatic note and the Hungarian Foreign Minister's speech, which recently prompted Romania to mobilize several classes of older reservists; (3) King Carol's visit to Yugoslavia to meet with Prince Paul next week. All attendees unanimously approved Foreign Minister Gafencu's report on Romanian diplomacy and the negotiations conducted over the past several years.

[Reuters, Rome, 15th]

According to palace sources, King Carol will meet with Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul on a Romanian ship on the Danube River on Monday to discuss the general international situation.

Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih Visits U.S. State Department [Reuters, Washington, 15th]

Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih visited the State Department today. It is reported that he inquired about China's exclusion from the list of countries whose integrity President Roosevelt intended to protect. Mr. Hu received a favorable response, but the details remain undisclosed.

A Brief Commentary on Roosevelt's Ironic Tone

Amidst the escalating international crisis, U.S. President Roosevelt abruptly issued a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini on the 15th, proposing a minimum guarantee of non-aggression for ten or twenty-five years, followed by discussions on disarmament and trade routes. To the Chinese, this news is reminiscent of the story from the Chu-Han contention era, where the Chu Hegemon Xiang Yu requested a personal duel with Liu Bang to pacify the world. We find President Roosevelt's "boldness" quite admirable, but the reality is that even yielding territory was ridiculed as "battling wits." How much more so the likes of Hitler and Mussolini, who are far inferior to Liu Bang!

However, we must recognize that the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement in the United States has made significant progress recently. Meanwhile, certain stubborn reactionary elements, as well as the hired hands of financial capital and a handful of arms and raw material owners who collude with Hitler, are fiercely opposing the democratic peace front. Therefore, Roosevelt's "appeal" is, in fact, not just a mockery of Hitler and Mussolini, but also an ironic jab at Britain and France, as well as the reactionary and stubborn elements within his own country. Or perhaps, it can be hailed as "Roosevelt's humor!"

Nevertheless, the followers of Hitler and Mussolini are fundamentally executioners of human culture. Offering them musical entertainment, humor, or even genuine appeals for peace is unlikely to have any practical effect, except to further expose their sinister image. Even if this "peace appeal" is disguised as a bribe to alleviate Germany and Italy's economic difficulties, it will only embolden their future acts of recklessness, posing a greater threat to world peace. It is time to abandon all illusions of "peace through non-resistance!" The path of effectively sanctioning aggressors and promoting collective security urgently needs to be strengthened.

Italian Military Threatens Gibraltar, Mediterranean Tensions Escalate: Britain and Greece Adopt Defensive Measures, German and Italian Troops in Spain Remain Deployed [London, 15th]

British military authorities are deeply concerned about the growing threat to British interests at both ends of the Mediterranean, a threat apparently instigated by Italy. The increased military activity near Gibraltar has prompted British authorities to take defensive measures. The official announcement from Burgos postponing Franco's triumphant entry into Madrid has raised significant concerns among British authorities. The date of Franco's entry into Madrid marks the beginning of the withdrawal of Italian troops stationed in Spain. In other words, the postponement of Franco's entry also means that Italian troops are unwilling to withdraw during this critical period. According to the diplomatic correspondent of "The Daily Telegraph," the British government views the threat to British interests in Egypt with no less importance than that to Gibraltar. Senior members of the British General Staff have held numerous meetings at the White House to meticulously study recent troop movements and draft military plans to defend both locations as needed. Over the past week, British troops have been continuously deployed from Palestine to Egypt. The postponement of Franco's entry into Madrid is ostensibly due to the anniversary of Madrid's patron saint, which coincides with the original date, necessitating a change. The Italian side claims this is merely a coincidence. However, sources in Burgos state that Italian troops participating in the Spanish war must participate in the victory parade; "Spanish and Italian troops will not withdraw from Spanish territory until late May." As for the withdrawal date of German troops stationed in Spain, it has yet to be announced. It is claimed that "due to Spain's inconvenient transportation," their withdrawal will require considerable time. Spanish Nationalist Commander Lano will review troops in Seville on Sunday, with a total of 40,000 troops fully armed.

[London, 15th]

The military situation in the Mediterranean has further intensified. It is reported that Italian troops have again increased along the Egyptian-Libyan border. Under these alarming Italian deployments, Gibraltar has practically become a war zone. According to a Reuters report from Athens, activity is high in the Italian Dodecanese Islands. Italian troops, weaponry, and supplies have been heavily concentrated in Leros, Rhodes, and Kalymnos. In light of the tense international situation, the Greek government has taken all precautionary measures. A Greek troop contingent has been dispatched to garrison Chios. Additionally, troops have been transferred from Nafplio, Kalamata, and Corinth to the Albanian border. It is also rumored that Greek authorities have drafted a decree to mobilize twelve classes of reservists if necessary. Six torpedo boats have been dispatched to patrol Crete, and approximately forty merchant ships have been requisitioned by the government.

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 15th]

It has been reliably learned that several electrical teams near Gibraltar began moving westward this morning.

[Associated Press, Athens, 16th]

Local officials have announced that a squadron of British aircraft, approximately 20 to 30 planes, has arrived at Tatoi Air Base, located thirty miles from Athens. Greek aviation officials stated that the British aircraft are here to prepare for potential emergencies.

[Associated Press, Gibraltar, 16th]

British authorities have laid mines along the road from Spain to Gibraltar and at the entrance to Gibraltar to complete defensive blockades. Officials stated that this is a normal measure for extraordinary times. The Welsh Guards will arrive here from England on the 22nd of this month, and barracks have been prepared for their use.

Local News: World Situation Intensifies, Food and Fuel Prices Soar in Hong Kong; Countries Compete to Store Grain, Rice Shipments from Siam and Vietnam Decrease, Prices Increase; Firewood and Vegetables Prices Skyrocket Due to Merchant Manipulation, Poor Suffer

Hong Kong, being a small, isolated island, relies entirely on external sources for food and fuel. In recent years, due to the impact of war, not only has the supply been disrupted, but the increase in population has also led to increased consumption. Prices have reached levels unprecedented since Hong Kong's opening, and there are concerns about potential shortages. Since the Jiangmen conflict, the sole transportation route between Hong Kong and the mainland has been blocked, causing the prices of daily necessities such as vegetables, fresh fish, and firewood to soar. Recently, with the intensifying world situation, countries have significantly increased their grain stockpiles, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to monopolize, leading to price increases across the board. To understand the recent food situation, our reporter conducted investigations in various areas, the findings of which are recorded below.

Countries Stockpile Grain, Rice Prices Surge

Hong Kong's rice supply has traditionally relied on imports from Annam, Siam, and Rangoon. However, with the intensifying international situation, countries are paying close attention to grain stockpiling to prepare for potential emergencies. Consequently, they have been placing orders with Siam, resulting in fewer rice shipments to Hong Kong and a slight increase in rice prices compared to last week. According to investigations, top-grade rice is selling for HK$8.20 per picul, while lower-grade rice costs HK$6.20 to HK$6.30. Rice merchants report that the recent continuous rise in rice prices is primarily due to purchases from various countries, followed by merchants from various districts in Hong Kong purchasing rice to transport back to their hometowns, driving up prices. Based on current observations, rice prices in Hong Kong are likely to continue to rise.

Merchants Manipulate Firewood Prices, Making It as Expensive as Cinnamon

Regarding firewood, after the fall of Guangzhou, firewood from the Three Rivers (West River, East River, North River) could not be transported to Hong Kong, causing prices to skyrocket and a severe firewood shortage. Subsequently, the Hong Kong authorities negotiated with firewood merchants to find a solution. Recently, there have been rumors that Hong Kong firewood merchants are taking advantage of the fall of Jiangmen to raise prices. Investigations reveal that Hong Kong's firewood supply now relies on imports from Singapore, Sandakan, Guangzhou Bay, and Shantou, which have been continuous. However, due to the long sea routes from various locations, high freight costs, and labor charges, the cost is higher. This is further exacerbated by merchant manipulation and the impact of war, which is not a factual account. In the past two days, 40,000 to 50,000 piculs of firewood have been shipped from Sandakan and Singapore. However, retail prices at firewood stores are around 45 to 50 catties per dollar, causing hardship for the poor.

Vegetable Supply Uninterrupted

As for the vegetable supply, it traditionally comes from Jiangmen, Shiqi, and various locations in Hong Kong such as Aberdeen, Pok Fu Lam, Shau Kei Wan, Kowloon, and the New Territories. With the recent fall of Jiangmen and Xinhui, vegetable prices in Hong Kong have subsequently increased. However, according to vegetable merchants, the supply of fruits and vegetables from Jiangmen and Shiqi has not only remained uninterrupted but has even increased. Yesterday, 70 to 80 baskets of tomatoes, horse beans, scallions, and other items were transported from Bao'an, while cabbage and bok choy from Shiqi and Shantou were particularly abundant. Wholesale vegetable markets in Sai Wan are piled high with fruits and vegetables, creating an impression of plenty. However, merchants and hawkers are taking the opportunity to manipulate prices, causing significant increases in retail prices.

Fresh Fish Prices Remain Stable

As for fresh fish, it is generally divided into two types: (1) Freshwater fish, mostly from Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Jiujiang, and other places. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the supply from that area has long been cut off. Although Jiangmen and Jiujiang continue to provide some supply to Hong Kong, preventing a complete shortage, the quantity is limited and prices have nearly doubled compared to before. The recent events in Jiangmen have had a considerable impact, but the supply has not yet been cut off. However, the retail prices of large fish and mandarin fish have increased significantly in recent days, reaching HK$0.26 to HK$0.30 per catty. (2) Saltwater fish. Hong Kong is surrounded by the sea and has abundant fish resources throughout the year. Although there have been repeated incidents of X-ships robbing fishing boats in the waters near the Sino-British border in recent years, fishermen, driven by poverty and hunger, risk going to sea to fish in order to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the supply of saltwater fish in Hong Kong has been maintained, preventing a complete shortage. Recently, it is the peak season for production, so prices remain relatively low.

Wounded Soldiers from the Front Arrive in Hong Kong Today for Medical Treatment: Over 100 People Arrive from Shenzhen

Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, our soldiers at the front have inflicted heavy blows on the X, but our brave soldiers have also suffered many injuries. Yesterday morning, Hong Kong suddenly received an urgent message from the front stating that over a hundred wounded soldiers were waiting near Zhangmutou and Shenzhen, requesting urgent dispatch of vehicles for rescue. Various charitable organizations in Hong Kong immediately mobilized to greet them, arriving in Shenzhen at 12:00 noon. However, as they waited until 4:00 PM without any news, the ambulances returned to Hong Kong. According to Shenzhen military authorities, the wounded soldiers may arrive in Hong Kong today for medical treatment.

Heshan Chamber of Commerce Discusses Relief for Orphans in War Zone

With the X troops invading Heshan, the devastation is particularly severe. The Heshan Chamber of Commerce recently dispatched an investigation team consisting of Feng Baolin, Yi Yiwu, and Liu Yuanjiang to Heshan to assess the situation. Yesterday, Feng and others returned to Hong Kong. The Chamber held an important meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday to discuss ways to relieve the suffering of the orphans in the affected area, in addition to Feng's report on the disaster. Attendees included Chairman Hou Shounan, Feng Baolin, Liu Fuwen, Deng Yuzan, and over twenty others. The Chairman announced the opening of the meeting, followed by Feng Baolin's report on the investigation of the Heshan disaster. His report was similar to the county party headquarters' report on the X military's invasion of Heshan. Finally, two major resolutions were passed: (1) to donate 600 raincoats to the county's militia, and (2) to send the former director of the Heshan Orphanage to Heshan to bring all the orphans to Hong Kong and connect with the Wartime Children's Relief Association, planning to relocate them to Shaoguan until 5:00 PM when the meeting adjourned.

Zhang Kunyi Welcomed by Overseas Chinese in the United States: Patriotism of Overseas Chinese

Ms. Zhang Kunyi, a special correspondent for this newspaper and the adopted daughter of painting master Gao Qifeng, was warmly received upon her arrival in the United States with her works for the Golden Gate Exhibition to promote national art. Various organizations held meetings to welcome her. Among the organizations was the Longgang Liangyi General Association, named after the brotherhood of Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Zhao. The day after Ms. Zhang's arrival, which coincided with the birthday of Liu Bei, she was specially invited to participate in the celebrations, where she spoke about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's story, and several staff members were appointed to assist Ms. Zhang. They were responsible for resolving any issues related to national crises on her behalf. In addition, overseas Chinese throughout the city enthusiastically contributed whenever the government sent representatives to solicit donations. Counterfeit national goods were strictly scrutinized. The patriotism was no less than that of the people in China.

Overseas Vietnamese Scouting Service Corps Leaves Hong Kong Yesterday to Serve at the Front: Hong Kong Gentry Du Qizhang Held Farewell Ceremony

The Overseas Vietnamese Chinese Scouting Service Corps, a group of seventy-four people, recently returned to China and arrived in Hong Kong. The public gave them a warm welcome, as reported in previous issues. The Corps departed for the country yesterday on the SS Harris to serve the nation. Mr. Du Qizhang, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Yaocheung Middle School in Hong Kong, and Principal Chen Yuanzhao held a farewell ceremony in the school auditorium. Lin Luying, the Corps leader, and Zhang Lupeng, the deputy leader, led over seventy members to the meeting. Principal Chen delivered the opening remarks, followed by Mr. Du Qizhang's address, stating: "At this critical juncture for the survival of our nation and people, we must fulfill our duty to repay our country. You are stationed in Vietnam but are sacrificing everything to urgently return to your homeland. This act will not only inspire overseas Chinese in the South Seas, but the international community will also recognize our people as a great nation who put the country before their families. It will also make the X people realize that our country has unlimited manpower and resources, plunging them into a state of frustration where they cannot fight and cannot make peace. The Corps is rushing to the front to serve the country, and I wish you all the best in your efforts to serve the nation." Lin Luying, the Corps leader, expressed that the overseas Vietnamese have always admired Mr. Du Qizhang and his tireless efforts in the cause of national salvation, which they greatly admire. For example, when the Overseas Chinese Drivers Service Corps was in Hong Kong, they also received Mr. Du's strong support. This time, when the Corps of over seventy members arrived in Hong Kong, they were grateful for Mr. Du's efforts in borrowing the Yaocheung Middle School campus to provide accommodation for the entire Corps. They were also grateful for his assistance in contacting Ms. Liu Qingxuan, Chairwoman of the Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association, who allocated a large number of medicines. As they were about to leave, Mr. Du donated a large number of medicines. This would not only be remembered by the entire Corps but also benefit the wounded soldiers at the front. The Corps boarded the SS Harris yesterday to serve the country at the front.

Defend Chao-Shan, Consolidate South China! The New Situation in Chao-Shan

Mr. Xia Yan's Speech at the Chao-Shan Alumni Association by Qi Zhuo

At present, Chao-Shan is China's only seaport, and it is a new major transportation artery. Understanding and defending Chao-Shan is undoubtedly a pressing task in supporting the war of resistance. For the sake of national interests and hometown ties, overseas Chao-Shan natives are naturally more concerned. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Hong Kong Chao-Shan Alumni Association specially invited Mr. Xia Yan, a renowned writer and editor-in-chief of the Jiuwang Daily who recently arrived in Hong Kong via Chao-Shan, to give a speech on "The New Situation in Chao-Shan" at Jian Dao Guangzhong School. Needless to say, this was a meaningful discussion.

Seventy to eighty enthusiastic members of the Chao-Shan Alumni Association and guests filled a spacious classroom. The amiable and enthusiastic Mr. Xia began his report amidst warm applause, recounting his inspection of Chao-Shan from Shaoguan.

Chao-Shan is a part of the larger Guangdong province, so Mr. Xia began by discussing the new situation in Guangdong as a whole.

For a period of time after the fall of Guangzhou, morale and public sentiment were somewhat shaken, and a sense of frustration weighed on the minds of many short-sighted individuals. However, since the appointment of Generals Zhang Fakui, Li Hanun, and Yu Hanmou at the end of the year, and with their diligent efforts, the situation has indeed seen a significant turnaround for the better. In the military sphere, General Zhang Fakui has unified military commands and built upon past successes, making the prospect of counter-attacking Guangzhou optimistic. The allocation of military commanders and forces in the East, West, and North Rivers is also sufficient to strike the X people.

In the political sphere, Mr. Xia has had two long conversations with Chairman Li, and Chairman Li has indeed demonstrated the determination and perseverance to create a clean government. "Make Guangdong politics like Guangxi" is what Chairman Li has openly stated. Currently, they are focusing on military defense and political offense, training young students to develop political work in the army, and reorganizing and reorganizing guerrilla forces, all of which are actively underway.

Many highways have been destroyed, or partially destroyed, and will be completely destroyed if necessary. According to Mr. Xia's personal inspection, after the destruction of the highways, the X people's mechanized units will be unable to advance through the mountains and marshes. General Bai Chongxi said that the failure of our first phase of the war of resistance was due to insufficient highway destruction, which allowed the X people to advance rapidly. In the future, we must move from a "scorched earth resistance" to a "digging earth resistance." This joke contains a profound truth. Currently, the Guangdong authorities have detailed plans for "digging earth" to destroy the highways, making it very difficult for the X people to attack Shaoguan from Guangzhou or penetrate into Chao'an and Jieyang. Mr. Xia illustrated his experiences with chalk, which deeply interested the entire audience. However, as they listened further, worry and melancholy immediately occupied everyone's minds.

From Xingning to Chao'an, and from Chao'an to Shantou, it became increasingly lively and prosperous. Industrial goods and daily necessities, which were difficult to obtain at high prices in Guilin and Shaoguan, were all readily available. However, many, many of them were originally Japanese goods. The X people's ability to counterfeit brands is quite "advanced." The fact that Chao-Shan serves as a market for X goods is one reason why the X people do not easily blockade Chao-Shan, which is truly heartbreaking.

In Jieyang, political work and conscript training are being done well. In Chao'an and Shantou, people are indulging in entertainment, openly smoking, gambling, and prostitution... Everything is far removed from the war of resistance, simply a normal state of affairs. Moreover, because it is the only transportation hub, everything is becoming even more lively and prosperous. Under this thick atmosphere of peace, it goes without saying that a great crisis is lurking. Political awareness in Chao-Shan is severely lacking. The X-X Daily, which is expressly prohibited from import by the central government, is surprisingly circulating in Shantou, using "an example" today and some "statement" tomorrow.

There is no inspection of luggage entering and leaving. A foreigner passing through the area is not questioned. There are no restrictions on draftees or national goods leaving. It is simply a foreign concession, so what is there to talk about resistance—if this situation is not quickly reversed, the tragedies of Huizhou and Guangzhou will befall Chao-Shan. Fortunately, the authorities are paying attention, and the Chao-Mei Garrison Commander, a renowned anti-Japanese general, has firmly expressed his determination to defend Chao'an to the death, which is a powerful force. It is also hoped that the Chao-Shan natives in Hong Kong will create the power of public opinion and quickly overcome the weaknesses of Chao-Shan. Defending Chao-Shan is also consolidating South China.

A burst of warm applause concluded Mr. Yao's speech. Deeply admiring his insightful observations after more than ten days of inspection, overseas Chao-Shan natives, although far from their hometown, still knew some things about their hometown and eagerly asked Mr. Xia questions:

"The general authorities are suppressing the youth's national salvation movement," "political darkness," "rampant corruption," "the tyranny of a scoundrel named Du," "the lack of rigor in personnel appointments," "the abuses of the Baojia system and the conscription system," "the self-defense corps being nominal and ineffective," "the hardships of the people," "the resentment of the youth"... There were simply too many to list, and they spoke with pain! Mr. Xia said that he could report to the authorities in the name of the overseas Chinese, and that General Zhang Fakui and Chairman Li were very democratic and enlightened. Mr. Xia himself could also personally report when he returned to Shaoguan. At around 4:00 PM, Mr. Xia left, and the Chao-Shan Alumni Association continued to discuss how to carry out the urgent task of defending Chao-Shan and consolidating South China.

New Governor's Residence to Be Built in Magazine Gap, Construction to Begin This Autumn

The current Governor's Residence in Hong Kong has been completed for many years, and a portion of it has deteriorated. Last year, the Legislative Council approved the construction of a new residence in Magazine Gap. However, the project was stalled due to funding issues. It is now rumored that construction of the new Governor's Residence in Magazine Gap will begin within the year and that contractors will be invited to bid in the near future.

Police Oppose Double-Decker Buses, Residents' Association Requests Approval

Regarding the operation of double-decker buses, the Kowloon Residents Association recently resolved at its monthly meeting to petition the Hong Kong government, stating that the current Kowloon bus fleet is insufficient and requesting consideration for the immediate implementation of double-decker buses. It is now heard that the police are still opposing the adoption of these new vehicles, deeming them too heavy. The trees along Nathan Road will gradually be cut down, and before implementation, these trees must be heavily pruned; otherwise, the operation of these double-decker buses will be greatly inconvenienced. The roof of the current Star Ferry pier's parking lot also needs to be raised.

Youth Drama Association Welcomes Xia Yan, Xia Discusses Playwriting Issues

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Hong Kong Youth Drama Association held a symposium last night at 7:00 PM at Huanan Middle School to welcome Mr. Xia Yan, an advisor to the association. Over 120 young drama practitioners from Hong Kong attended, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Mr. Xia spoke extensively on "Playwriting Issues," and the content was very rich. Subsequently, members asked questions, and Mr. Xia answered them, creating a strong academic atmosphere.

Ship Ticket Prices to Singapore Rise Again, Reaching $240 for Male Passengers

Ship ticket prices to Singapore have recently risen again, with male passenger tickets soaring to between $220 and $240, breaking the previous record of $180 in November and December of last year. It has also been found that in the past two months, most of those going to Singapore to seek a living have been refugees fleeing from Hainan Island. The Hainan Overseas Chinese General Association has negotiated with Taikoo Steamship Company to provide 50 passenger spaces each month, 25 for male passengers and 25 for female passengers, at a price of $105 per ticket, in order to alleviate the burden on the refugees from Hainan Island and prevent exploitation by speculators.

Authorities to Recall Old Nickel Coins Starting Next Month: Large Batch of New Coins Recently Arrived from England

Since implementing the legal tender system, the authorities have issued approximately $1.6 million worth of old one-dime coins. After gradual recall, approximately $1.3 million has been collected, leaving slightly over $300,000 in circulation. It is believed that all coins can be recalled in a short period of time. It is now heard that the authorities will announce the implementation of the recall of old coins starting May 1st and declare them invalid within a certain period of time. The reason for extending the recall period is to facilitate the exchange for merchants. Many new coins have been shipped to Hong Kong and are readily available for exchange. In the latest batch of new coins shipped to Hong Kong, the image of the King of England is slightly larger than before. It is hoped that merchants will not become suspicious, create misunderstandings, or be overly picky when using them.

Banditry Rampant: Armed Robbery Case in Sai Ying Pun

Residential Building on Second Street Robbed by Three Thieves Last Night, Significant Losses Incurred, Cargo Boat Robbed by Gang of Pirates in the Waters of Tung Ku Wan

Banditry has been rampant recently, with robbery cases occurring on both land and sea almost daily. Last night at around 8:00 PM, an armed robbery occurred at a residential building on Second Street in Sai Ying Pun. Three thieves escaped after successfully looting the premises. The victim was identified as a woman named Liang Aisu, 31 years old, and married. Last night at around 8:00 PM, three men forced their way into the building. One of the thieves was armed with a handgun, while the other two were unarmed. They were all around 30 years old and wore black cloth shirts and pants. They appeared extremely fierce. After entering the building, they immediately revealed their weapons and threatened everyone, looting the premises for approximately 20 minutes before escaping with their loot. The victim reported the incident to the No. 7 Police Station, which dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate the scene and notified police stations in all districts to assist in the pursuit. A significant amount of silver and jewelry was stolen, but the exact amount could not be determined due to the chaos after the incident. Furthermore, on the 14th of this month, a cargo boat was robbed clean by 13 pirates in the waters of Tung Ku Wan. The victim, Huang Shou (28 years old), reported the incident in Hong Kong yesterday. He stated that his boat, numbered 750, departed from Tuen Mun in the New Territories on the 14th of this month. The journey was smooth until it sailed to the waters near Tung Ku Wan that night. The people on board were about to sleep when, at around 9:00 PM, a pirate boat carrying 13 pirates, all armed and extremely ferocious, forced its way onto the boat. The pirates first threatened everyone with guns, prohibiting them from making any noise, and confined them to one corner. They then tied them up one by one with hemp ropes before looting the boat, carrying all the contents onto the pirate boat and then fleeing with loud shouts. The stolen goods included field materials, noodles, kerosene, paint, etc. He requested that the case be filed and investigated. The police station on duty immediately notified all districts to pursue the pirates.

Training New Soldiers for the Press: A Record of the Entrance Examination for the Journalism Academy by Luo Xia

Hundreds of Excellent Young People Hurl Themselves into Its Embrace

To strengthen the journalism front and train a large number of new soldiers for the press, the Hong Kong Branch of the China Youth Journalists Association established the China Journalism Academy. To join the ranks of the journalism front and participate in this arduous struggle, hundreds of excellent young men and women hurled themselves into its embrace—the Journalism Academy. Yesterday, after the application deadline, the entrance examination was held. It was such a solemn and tense scene!

Before 1:00 PM, the Zhonghua Middle School on Jian Dao gradually became lively. One by one, the young people coming to take the exam looked up at the list of rooms, happily ran up to the third floor, and quietly sat down in the designated classroom. There was no talking inside; all that could be heard was the "thump-thump" of their hearts beating rapidly. Everyone's faces were interwoven with hope and excitement, like thousands of troops marching swiftly with gagged mouths.

"Ding-ding," the bell rang, and the test proctor entered. The test papers were gently placed in front of the group of young people, one by one. Everyone picked them up as if they were looking at lottery numbers. At the top of the test paper were the words "General Knowledge Test," and below were densely printed lines of faint characters, listing question after question. There were three questions related to newspapers, six questions related to domestic and international politics, six questions related to domestic and international military affairs, two questions related to diplomacy, two questions related to domestic and international geography, five questions related to socioeconomics, fourteen questions related to general knowledge, and finally, five questions requiring simple answers. These covered Chinese and foreign history, geography, politics, economics, and current domestic and international affairs, a total of forty-five questions, all of which were basic knowledge that those aspiring to engage in journalism should possess. Upon receiving these two sheets of densely printed general knowledge questions, everyone eagerly spread them out on their desks and answered them one by one, which generally took two and a half hours to complete.

After everyone took a deep breath, the second bell rang, and the second subject, Chinese language, began. The topics were: 1. The Journalism Industry and the War of Resistance; 2. My Opinions on the Hong Kong Press. The smiling proctor entered and announced that students could choose one of the two topics and were not expected to write on both. A wave of lighthearted laughter broke through the solemn atmosphere, followed by silence, then the sound of pens scratching across paper.

The entrance examination concluded at around 4:00 PM. According to those in charge of the Academy, the establishment of the China Journalism Academy was solely to train a group of hardworking journalism soldiers to participate in practical work. Not to mention that the mainland needed this large group of new soldiers, even the Hong Kong press was in urgent need of these young, hardworking individuals to replenish its ranks. Therefore, the selection of students would be strict and not indiscriminate.

It is said that the list of accepted students will be announced this Thursday and published in major newspapers in Hong Kong. Among the hundreds of young people participating in this entrance examination, only sixty will be admitted. Naturally, many will be unsuccessful and eliminated. However, let us patiently wait for the second term! After all, those who have the will will succeed!

However, our soldiers charged forward, one after another, achieving success in a short period, eliminating the X. Our army is currently advancing in victory. The continuation of the battle is recorded as follows:

### U.S. President Calls for Peace: Suggests to Hitler and Mussolini that They Guarantee No Further Aggression Against Independent Nations; Simultaneously Orders Fleet Back to the Pacific

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Sources here announced today that President Roosevelt has called for peace, addressing Hitler and Mussolini in separate telegrams. In these messages to the two dictators, Roosevelt inquired whether they were genuinely willing to provide guarantees against attacking the following independent nations by force. The telegrams stated in part: "Such guarantees should not only apply to the present but also to the future, to allow for the promotion of lasting peace. If we broaden our scope, I would explain to you what constitutes the 'future' in the world. A guarantee against aggression should be for a minimum of ten or twenty-five years. If such guarantees are agreed upon by your governments, I will immediately relay them to other governments, inquiring whether they agree to provide the same guarantee." Roosevelt then listed Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Iran, Holland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, and Portugal. Roosevelt stated that he would act as a friendly intermediary to convey peace guarantees, and if mutual guarantees of peace were provided, all nations could engage in negotiations, disarmament, and opening trade routes. The President emphatically stated the general fear of war amongst the world's nations, adding that the existence of such fear is absolutely relevant to the American people, and that any large-scale war, even if confined to another continent, would inevitably have serious impacts on the Americas and extend for generations. He concluded, "For the past several weeks, the world has been in a state of anxious tension, but fortunately, there has been no military action. Therefore, the world should at least have a moment's respite. I believe this is an excellent opportunity for me to convey my humble thoughts to you."

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The list of independent nations in President Roosevelt's telegram to the dictators did not include Danzig. In light of reports from Berlin that Hitler may seize Danzig next week, this is extremely significant. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Moscow, Kirk, has been ordered to Berlin to replace the late Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Gilbert. U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Wilson, is unlikely to return to his post until U.S.-German relations improve. Although President Roosevelt's telegram did not mention Czechoslovakia, Austria, Albania, and Abyssinia, which have already been annexed, this does not indicate diplomatic recognition of the conquest of these territories.

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] This morning, President Roosevelt convened a special meeting of diplomatic advisors. Those attending the White House meeting included Senator Thurman, Secretary of State Hull, and Undersecretary of State Welles. At the start of the meeting, the news published in Berlin regarding anti-German incidents in Polish Silesia and Hitler's possible action to forcibly annex Danzig caused temporary alarm.

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The Navy Department abruptly ordered the fleet to return to the Pacific without explanation. The authorities had originally scheduled a formal fleet review in the Atlantic for April 27th, and the fleet had prepared to visit New York for the World's Fair. The arrival of this order was unexpected. Diplomatic circles interpreted this move as evidence of intelligence received, with President Roosevelt sensing the possibility of simultaneous action by Rome, Berlin, Tokyo, and Moscow, hence the need for preventative measures. The fleet was redeployed to the Pacific to counter the threat from Japan.

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The U.S. fleet has been ordered to cancel participation in the New York World's Fair and the Norfolk naval exercises and, after refueling, to return to the Pacific. The U.S. government's order stated, "All ships shall immediately return to their original defense in the Pacific." With the exception of the newly formed Atlantic Fleet, all national fleets must immediately return to their defenses. The government offered no explanation for issuing this order, but it is generally speculated to be related to the tense situation in Europe. The order was issued within two hours of Roosevelt's declaration calling for peace. It is generally speculated that U.S. authorities believe it necessary to concentrate the fleet in the Pacific as a precaution. It is also noteworthy that British naval power is now concentrated off the coast of Europe to prepare for war. The U.S. government issued the order in a shorter time frame than has been seen in years. It is generally estimated that it will take approximately three days to refuel all ships and thirteen to fourteen days to return to their original defenses. With the exception of the original Atlantic Fleet, five cruisers, six submarines, and one aircraft carrier, which will remain in the eastern United States, approximately 120 warships must immediately return to the Pacific, including 56 warships participating in the World's Fair performance and "other missions." A small detachment of the European fleet is not affected by this order.

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The U.S. fleet was suddenly ordered to sail to the Pacific yesterday, reportedly due to intelligence received indicating that the international situation is about to take a sharp turn for the worse and that the Far East is also about to enter a vortex. According to another report, any new military action in Europe will inevitably involve the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines will also be affected. One diplomat stated that the movement of the U.S. fleet is related to Roosevelt's recent proposal to Hitler, aimed at preventing Japanese aggression, as Japan may expand its aggression while Europe is at war. However, this seems unlikely, as Japan must devote all its efforts to dealing with Chinese resistance in Manchuria and throughout China. At the same time, Japan's strength has been greatly depleted in China. Japan must be wary of the activities of the U.S. fleet, especially with the British deploying forces in Singapore, which will further deter Japan from acting rashly.

### All of England Enthusiastically Commends, France Accepts Without Conditions

[Reuters, London, 16th] U.S. President Roosevelt's appeal to dictators to guarantee peace has been enthusiastically commended throughout England.

Lloyd George called it "a great and timely appeal to reason." Attlee said it was "a most valuable preliminary step." President Roosevelt's telegram stated, "Your Excellency has repeatedly stated that Your Excellency and the people of your country have no intention of war. If this is indeed the case, then there is no need for war." The local newspapers have highly praised this passage of the telegram. The U.S. President pointed out in the telegram that the people's fear must be ended, stating, "Unfortunately, we must recognize new realities. In Europe, three nations, and one in Africa, have all lost their independence. In the Far East, another independent nation has had a vast territory occupied by a neighboring country. Reports we believe to be true indicate that further aggression is being contemplated against other independent nations. In short, the world is moving towards a path that could lead to great disaster, unless a more rational approach can be pursued to avoid war." This passage of the telegram has attracted much attention here. President Roosevelt added that Americans are not speaking out of selfishness, fear, or cowardice. "I am speaking out of strength and as a friend of humanity." He continued, "International problems can be resolved at the conference table. This is not a matter for the military. In the conference room, as in a courtroom, both sides must discuss with sincerity and trust, predicting that both sides will gain practical benefits." Then, President Roosevelt, in explaining America's offer of friendly mediation, asked, "Are you willing to guarantee not to use force against the following independent nations?"

[Reuters, London, 15th] Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax jointly issued a statement on behalf of the British government, warmly welcoming President Roosevelt's initiative, stating that the British government "fully agrees with the President's assessment of the international situation." The statement continued, "We believe that President Roosevelt's statesmanlike proposal can prevent the tragic situation in which all nations are living in anxiety." The statement concluded by stating that they must now await the responses from Germany and Italy but hoped that their replies "will begin the second step of the path mentioned by President Roosevelt."

[Reuters, London, 15th] Mr. Johnson, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy here, visited the British Foreign Office today to report to the British authorities on the contents of President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler and Mussolini. It is reported that the U.S. President did not consult with the British government beforehand. As of this morning, the British government has not had any hint of the President's intentions. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, who is spending the weekend at his country house, and Foreign Secretary Halifax, who is at his country residence in Yorkshire, have both been informed of the contents of the telegram.

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] French Premier Daladier has delivered a note to the U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, conveying that France gives unconditional and complete acceptance of the U.S. President's proposal.

It is believed here that the U.S. President's telegram is sufficient to change the situation of the nation. "Le Temps" stated, "Hitler has personally portrayed himself as being interested in maintaining peace. This is the time for Hitler to provide proof to his people and the world."

[Reuters, Ottawa, 15th] The call of President Roosevelt to the dictators for a ten-year guarantee of peace is considered "bold and outspoken" and is admired.

### Germany Decides to Reject U.S. Proposal, Italy Remains Silent

[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] According to reliable sources, Hitler has completely rejected President Roosevelt's proposal, refusing both the convening of a peace conference and the pledge of no further aggression.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] According to reliable sources, Hitler and Mussolini spoke by telephone to discuss President Roosevelt's request for a guarantee of peace and decided to reject the U.S. President's proposal. It is reported that Hitler will issue a formal rejection or no response at all. The German Propaganda Ministry has not yet been able to confirm that Mussolini has also rejected the U.S. President's proposal but said that it is very likely that Mussolini will reject Roosevelt's proposal.

[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop both arrived in Munich this afternoon.

(Hitler came from Berchtesgaden.) It is reported that the two are currently studying President Roosevelt's telegram. Officials have been busy translating the telegram from morning till night for Hitler to review. According to Reuters, the telegram has not caused excessive excitement. No conference will be held in Munich, and there will be no particularly eye-catching activities. There will be no announcement tonight. It is reported that Hitler will not return to Berlin until the day before Tuesday. Semi-official sources and the press have expressed absolute opposition to Roosevelt's telegram. One newspaper commented, "Roosevelt's telegram was misguided."

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 16th] As of last night, Italian officials remained silent on Roosevelt's telegram and made no criticisms. It is reported that the telegram was not sent through normal diplomatic channels but was a personal telegram from President Roosevelt to the Italian leader. The telegram has not yet been published in Italy. It is currently unknown when officials will formally criticize the matter. It is reported that Mussolini and General Goering discussed the telegram during their meeting last night at 7:00 PM.

[Reuters, Rome, 15th] It is generally speculated that Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Goering, who are currently meeting closely, will jointly and thoroughly study Roosevelt's message. The two then jointly attended a banquet with the King and Queen of Italy. Mussolini also held a twenty-minute meeting with visitors after the parliamentary session. As of now, only a small number of people have heard of the U.S. President's message, and officials claim to be unaware of it.

### Siam and Vietnam

If Siam were to embrace the Fascist bloc, it would naturally threaten British colonies in the Far East. However, French Vietnam is in a more dangerous position than British Burma. If Siam were to join the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it would first seek to recover Luang Prabang and Battambang. In addition, the French protectorates of Laos and Dong Pusai are also objects that Siam wants to seize. The people of Laos and Dong Pusai were conquered by Siam as early as the 16th century. After losing these places, a large part of Vietnamese territory would be lost. Added to this is an attack by Japan from Hainan Island, Vietnam would no longer be the French Vietnam.

Japan's invasion of southern China and occupation of Hainan Island have made France's Far Eastern colonies uneasy. Siam's military strength has been increasing day by day since the last war. It has long implemented a conscription system, and can mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops in wartime. In recent years, Siam has also established a navy, ordering warships and submarines from Germany and Japan. The air force is also of a considerable scale. In wartime, it goes without saying that Vietnam is the most dangerous old enemy in the back. Therefore, the relationship between Vietnam and Siam is the most worrying point in the French colonial security issues in the Far East.

Britain and France are dealing with Siam in the same way as they are dealing with the Spanish Franco government, using loans, trade and all kinds of benefits as bait, hoping to ease the conflict with Britain and France. As far as the relationship between the two countries and Siam is concerned, there has been considerable success in recent months. The commercial treaty between Vietnam and Siam was signed a few months ago, and has now been approved by the parliaments of both France and Siam. France sent a military delegation to Bangkok three months ago. In this big exercise near the Vietnamese army and Lang Son, Siam also sent two officers to observe the exercise. It seems that Siam and Vietnam are maintaining a good neighborly relationship on the surface, which is true, but we know that the aggressor countries will not stop plotting to cause trouble. Once a European war breaks out and France's military strength in the Far East is weakened, no one can guarantee what the situation in southern Asia will be like. In order to protect its interests in the Far East, what strength will France rely on? Isn't it already too obvious?
