### Improving Overseas Chinese Education Problems

The Chinese nation is at a critical juncture of survival or extinction. If ×× wins, the nation will achieve independent survival and freedom. If ×× fails, the country will perish, and all ethnic groups in China will inevitably become slaves forever. The lives of overseas Chinese will also be unimaginable! Therefore, today we must concentrate all our efforts and resources to serve ×× and seek ×× victory. Cultural and educational undertakings are, of course, no exception, and overseas Chinese cultural and educational undertakings are especially no exception. This is common sense and needs no further explanation. However, overseas Chinese cultural education in various places is mostly disconnected from the domestic education system due to special circumstances, especially in relation to the current ×× nation-building cause. The impact this has on the ×× nation-building cause is truly unbearable to contemplate! This is also common knowledge for every conscientious and far-sighted overseas Chinese educator, and it needs no further explanation. Our current problem is how to implement improvements in overseas Chinese education based on the special circumstances of various places, so that it can adapt to the needs of today's motherland in ×× nation-building and contribute to the overall liberation of the Chinese nation. We would like to contribute our views here for the reference of those who are promoting the improvement of overseas Chinese education.

First, we should clearly understand the educational policies that the motherland urgently needs to implement at present. The Kuomintang's ×× nation-building outline once revealed that the basic principles for improving education at the moment are: "Revise the education system and teaching materials, promote wartime courses, focus on the cultivation of national morality, improve scientific research, and expand its equipment. Train various specialized technical personnel and allocate them appropriately to meet ×× needs. Train young people to serve in war zones and rural areas. Train women to serve in social undertakings to increase ×× strength." The supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, also said in his instruction to the National Education Conference: "In the current era, whether it is an individual or a society, if it does not practice wartime life, it cannot survive and will be eliminated and reduced." At the same time, he remotely instructed the national education community, saying: "If we want to build our country into a modern country, we need tens of thousands of specialized scholars, hundreds of thousands or even millions of technicians and engineers in various departments, and even more millions of teachers and mass training cadres. These all need to be supplied by our education community." ×××××××××××× Third, after we understand the educational policies and the direction of educational improvement that the motherland urgently needs at present, we must consider the actual situation in various places and do everything we can to achieve the goals that the motherland expects of us. We must strive to ensure that overseas Chinese education can adapt to the current urgent needs of the motherland, and at the same time, focus on the following points in the education process: (1) Cultivate national consciousness, enhance the national self-esteem of overseas Chinese, and promote the emotions of supporting ×× and the confidence that ×× will surely win and the nation will surely be built. To realize this requirement, it is necessary to strengthen political education, study social sciences, and hold collective discussions on the political situation. Because only by enabling overseas Chinese youth and people from all walks of life ×××××× to have a deep understanding can their will be truly firm. (2) Enhance the concept of the nation and the country, so that every overseas Chinese recognizes the loveliness of the country and the greatness of the power of the entire nation. To realize this requirement, encourage the pursuit of democratic politics and the sentiment of overseas Chinese participation in politics; because only by making overseas Chinese closely related to the politics of the motherland can overseas Chinese automatically and actively serve the motherland, and the education community naturally bears a great responsibility for this. (3) In addition to school courses, or in conjunction with school courses, actively lead overseas Chinese compatriots to educate overseas Chinese compatriots and organize overseas Chinese compatriots. To realize this requirement, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate a large number of young cadres and lead them to do mobilization work for overseas Chinese compatriots, and at the same time, vigorously establish various tutoring schools, launch the New Writing Movement and general literacy movements, and use national salvation dramas, ×× songs, etc. to develop mass education.

Third, we must also know that when we are working hard to improve overseas Chinese education, we will inevitably encounter various external and internal obstacles. We must calmly recognize the source and reality of the obstacles, determine the methods and steps to deal with them, and carry out a tenacious struggle. At present, what we need to pay special attention to is, first, those who only know their personal interests and regard their personal interests as higher than the interests of the country and the nation, that is, those pessimistic and disappointed elements who advocate peace. Although they may not necessarily be traitors, they have in fact become tools of the Japanese ×; second, those who promote remarks such as "the royal way of paradise," "Greater East Asia," and "anti-communist, pro-Japanese peace," ××××××××××

Finally, people in our overseas Chinese education community are also often frustrated in life and have no way out in their thinking, and they are depressed, confused, pessimistic, and decadent. This is because they usually do not care about the national and international situation, and they think that they are not worth studying general political theories. Therefore, they feel at a loss about the ever-changing, complex situation. If their understanding is not clear, their will cannot be firm, their energy cannot be concentrated, and they cannot be vigorous, active, and promising. Coupled with personal suffering in life, they even take the road of national defeatism, and because of pessimism and disappointment, they embark on the black road of wavering, compromising, surrendering to seek peace, and harming the nation! Therefore, we must strengthen the unity of the educational community itself, sweep away the accumulated habits of decadence, cultivate vigorous vitality, and realize the spiritual mobilization of the overseas Chinese education community. On the one hand, we must take the lead in practice to fight against all obstacles and lead young people and overseas Chinese compatriots in general. On the other hand, we must intensify our own learning and self-cultivation in this practical work. The first is to enhance our revolutionary theory. The greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen lies in his lofty ideals and revolutionary theories. He advocated the saying that knowing is difficult and doing is easy. ×××××××××××××××× We should especially take him as our teacher and role model, ×××××, and enhance our practice and interest in improving education to serve ×× nation-building!

### The Chinese Student National Salvation Association Over the Past Year

— Zheng Dai

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) It has been more than a year since the Chinese Student National Salvation Association held its second national congress in Wuhan last March. Over the past year, under the leadership of the government and with the support of progressive people from all walks of life, whether on the front lines or in the rear, at home or abroad, they have been constantly and bravely fighting to complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation. Now, taking advantage of the 20th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, we will briefly describe the important work of the Student Association to people from all walks of life and students across the country.

I. Routine Work

Routine work refers to the three daily tasks of contact, publicity, and service!

1. Contact Work: In order to strengthen the connection between member organizations in various places, according to the resolution of the Congress, offices were set up in important neighboring cities, and representatives were often sent to various places to inspect and investigate, assist local arrangements, and solve problems.

During this year, new member organizations have been added from time to time, mainly including the All-Xinjiang Student Federation, the Chinese Student National Salvation Association of Manila, the United Federation of Overseas Chinese Students' Anti-Japanese Support Association of Malaya, and the Shanghai Student National Salvation Association, etc., more than ten organizations.

2. Propaganda Work: Publications are regularly published in China, and various practical propaganda outlines and work principles are issued to collect propaganda materials and distribute them to member organizations in various places. Responding to the government's call and participating in various temporary drafts, the main ones are the 19th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement last year, the Taierzhuang Victory Propaganda Week, the Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction Propaganda Week, the Wuhan Defense Propaganda Week, the 3rd Anniversary of the "January 28" Student Festival, and the recently held Second Phase of Anti-Japanese War Official Propaganda Second Week, National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, etc., all properly coordinated, and concrete measures were formulated to call on students to work together.

Internationally, in addition to sending representatives to live in Europe and the United States for publicity, we also regularly collect stories of the heroic struggles of young students in the War of Resistance and other actual propaganda materials in China. After being organized and translated, they are regularly supplied to foreign news agencies stationed in China or sent directly to anti-aggression people's organizations and cultural institutions in various countries. In addition, we also interviewed foreign writers and journalists who came to China for investigation, such as Agnes Smedley, and Snow, and provided them with a lot of real materials.

3. Service Work: It can be divided into three main parts: one is to organize battlefield service groups to go to the battlefield and the rear of the × people to do battlefield service work; one is to organize service groups to go to refugee camps to serve refugees; and the other is to work with the job referral work of the organization itself.

II. Temporary Work

2. Welcoming the World Student Association Delegation to China.

The heroic struggle of Chinese students in the national liberation struggle has aroused the concern and respect of progressive people all over the world. On August 25, 1937, the World Student Association Congress was held. The Chinese Student Association sent a representative, Chen Quantian, to attend and participate, and proposed to the Congress that the World Student Association organize a delegation to China for investigation. Before the representatives set off to China, we immediately began to prepare to receive them, and sent representatives to various places to assist the local student associations in arranging all reception work. Before and after in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Changsha, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an Kunming and other places, under the leadership of the government, the local youth student organizations jointly established a reception committee to design and implement all reception work. After the delegation came to China, they were warmly welcomed in various parts of the country and held expanded lectures and various symposiums to discuss some issues in the world student movement and the Chinese student movement. They also collected actual work reports from students in various places, as well as various propaganda materials. Recently, they wrote that they have compiled and translated the propaganda materials they brought back and shipped them to various countries for circulation and exhibition to expand the aid to China movement. In this reception work, on the one hand, we strengthened the world's deep understanding of our victory in the War of Resistance and the success of nation-building, and at the same time, we also demonstrated the great power of unity among colleagues across the country.

2. Attending the World Youth Peace Conference

At the first congress of the World Youth Peace Conference held in Geneva in 1936, the Student Association sent Comrade Lu Cui as a representative to attend. On August 15 last year, the second congress was held in New York. Comrade Lu Cui, the representative of the Student Association, and the representatives sent from China formed the Chinese delegation to attend together. The Chinese Student Association also directly sent a letter to the Presidium of the Congress from China to congratulate them.

3. Celebrating the First Plenary Session of the National参政Council

Before the opening of the National参政Council, the Student Association sent representatives to visit the参政members separately to provide them with many opinions and materials, and wrote to the National参政Council to make detailed opinions and suggestions on issues such as uniting students across the country, mobilizing youth across the country, and wartime education and relief for unemployed and out-of-school youth. In addition, students in Chaoshan, Sichuan and other places also wrote to the参政Council separately to make personal demands. This can enable the government authorities and progressive people from all walks of life to have a clearer understanding of the demands and attitudes of young students, make the connection between students and all parties closer, and be able to obtain more sympathy and guidance from the community.

4. The Work of Defending Wuhan

The Student Association directly responded to the government's call to defend Greater Wuhan. After Xu Zhou's withdrawal, he first initiated the establishment of the "Joint Office of Wuhan Organizations" in conjunction with various mass organizations in Wuhan. Under the command of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the defense work of the three towns of Wuhan was coordinated. There were detailed plans and arrangements on how to mobilize students to organize wartime work teams, how to evacuate the population, and how to organize consolation groups, and they all achieved considerable results. On the anniversary of "August 13," it also united with various organizations in Wuhan to convene a youth participation in the war conference to mobilize youth to participate in wartime work. During the urgent period of Wuhan's gathering, it united with all walks of life to organize a consolation group to go to the front lines on both sides of Dahua to offer condolences. At the same time, when various publications moved one after another, the Student Association specially published a special issue on wartime youth defending Wuhan for propaganda. At the same time, representatives were sent to Changsha, Guangzhou, Guilin, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an and other places to mobilize students to work together to defend Wuhan and strive for victory in the War of Resistance. At that time, the conscription of consolation items in various places, the organization of battlefield work teams, and the mobilization of Zhuang Ding all had obvious achievements.

5. The Transfer Work of the Standing Committee

In order to adapt to the needs of wartime and arrange future work, the Student Association, on the one hand, left most of its staff to work in Wuhan for a long time, and Wuhan fell and retreated to the border area of Henan and Hubei, serving as the link between the front and rear of Central China. On the one hand, representatives Zheng Dai and Li Geng were sent to inspect the provinces in Southwest China, passing through Changsha, Guilin, and Guangzhou to Guiyang and entering Chongqing. Representative Fu Xiang? was also sent to inspect the provinces in Northwest China, passing through Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Chengdu Yu. Along the way, Fang Jiandui reported on the work of the students, and actually asked for opinions on the work of the youth and students. They visited progressive people from all walks of life to ask for instructions, and visited various organizations and schools to solicit work opinions and discuss future directions, and collected work reports and actual materials. When the South China War broke out, the Student Association representative happened to be in Guangzhou and immediately assisted the local student organizations to organize wartime work teams to participate in frontline work. Standing Committee member Zhang Jianying also stayed to participate in the work of the Fourth War Zone Joint Committee for direct command. In addition, representative Fang Lianbai was sent to investigate and comfort the provinces in Southeast China. He took the road through Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces and turned to Sichuan by sea. The representatives of the various investigation teams arrived in Chongqing one after another. In November last year, they notified all parties that the Standing Committee of the Student Association officially moved to Chongqing to work.

6. The 3rd Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement

As soon as the Standing Committee moved, it actively prepared for the 3rd anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement. First, the Student Association sent representatives to participate in the joint symposium of youth organizations in Chongqing and invited various organizations to organize the "December 9th" 3rd Anniversary Commemorative Preparatory Committee. On the day of the 3rd anniversary of "December 9th," the Student Association issued a letter to students across the country, which was published in various newspapers and mailed to various places, jointly issued a commemorative declaration with various organizations, and jointly held an expanded commemorative meeting with various organizations. More than 2,000 students participated, and Mr. Chen Lifu, Zhang Shenfu, Zou Taofen, Cheng Ximeng and other gentlemen were invited to attend the meeting and give speeches. The grand occasion was unprecedented, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

7. The Youth Day Donation Movement

At the beginning of March, the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement initiated the Donation Movement Week and designated March 12 as Youth Donation Day. On March 7, the Sanminzhuyi Youth League invited various organizations to discuss the implementation, and the Student Association also participated as agreed and worked together. However, at that time, the schools in the city were either on winter vacation or were taking exams, and the work was difficult. However, because of the great significance, the Sanqing League took 3,500 donation receipts and immediately mobilized all the staff to go to various schools for contact work. Within three days, the receipts were taken and donations were made. All donation procedures were then handled clearly with the Three Youth League Remittance Preparatory Office.

8. The 20th Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement and the Great National Spiritual Mobilization Movement are underway.

The "May Fourth" Movement has great epoch-making significance in the history of Chinese culture, especially in implementing the national spiritual mobilization, leading all members to strive for victory in the War of Resistance, and building a successful country today, commemorating the "May Fourth" is of special significance. In order to promote the patriotic spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement and expand the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, the Student Association responded to the call of the Sanminzhuyi Youth League to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement and participated in various tasks. It has formulated a concrete plan and is gradually implementing it.

III. Future Work

The Student Association cooperates with the current specific environment, adheres to its consistent purpose, and unites students to engage in the work of resisting the war and building the nation under the leadership of the government. Continue to work hard.

1. Respond to the government's call, such as the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, in-depth righteousness, eliminating illiteracy, official propaganda for military service, comforting the families of soldiers on expeditions, war pile service, offering donations and charity sales, etc.

2. Strengthen international propaganda and carry out national diplomatic activities. Collect materials in a planned way and provide them to the people of various countries. When necessary, send representatives to various countries for propaganda.

3. Develop service work for the students themselves, and often carry out various undertakings or movements that are closely related to the students themselves.

IV. Conclusion

The Student Association is a student organization, and it hopes that the government authorities will guide and support it at any time. The Student Association is the students' own organization, and it is hoped that students in various places will often help and urge it. The Student Association is willing to fight for the completion of the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, under the leadership of the National Government, and under the command of the supreme leader.

### New Fourth Army Education Camp Transformed into War of Resistance Academy, Enrollment Begins Mid-Month

[Special Shanghai Dispatch] In order to implement the training of backbone talent, the New Fourth Army previously established a large-scale education camp at its Southern Anhui headquarters, specifically recruiting out-of-school youth from guerrilla areas, providing them with special military and political knowledge. Youth from various places flocked to enroll and receive training, reaching more than a thousand people. The term was three months, and after graduation, they were sent to various guerrilla areas to organize the people, train the people, and other work. The educational methods adopted the following four types: (1) Military education, such as field orders, guerrilla tactics, field service, shooting instructions, military geography, etc.; (2) Classroom education, such as the situation of the War of Resistance, training the people, international issues, the history of the Chinese revolution, etc.; (3) Opportunity education, educational opportunities were used to conduct education on the spot, such as various commemorative days, temporary problems among students, or conscious news at home and abroad, and opportunities were used to implement extracurricular education; (4) Self-education, which is to educate students to educate students, such as discussion meetings, life inspection meetings, and symposiums; now, the first group of trained youth is about to graduate, and it has been decided to expand the second group and transform it into a War of Resistance Academy. The internal organization and establishment will follow the methods of the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" and the "Shaanxi Public School" in the Northwest. It is expected that enrollment will begin in mid-May.

Regarding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region

"Supplement to the statement on yesterday's second edition that was omitted"

There is also no foundation for the emergence of warlords. On the contrary, this is only a revolutionary base. However, after the "September 18th" Incident, especially after the North China Incident in 1935, due to the increasing depth of the Japanese × aggression and the increasing severity of the national crisis, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Central Government jointly issued the famous "August 1st Declaration," calling on all parties and classes of the country to form a united front for resisting Japan and saving the nation to carry out the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war. On December 15 of the same year, it voluntarily announced a partial change in the Soviet policy to advance the realization of this call. This declaration and the partial change in the Soviet policy gained the response and support of the people across the country. During the Xi'an Incident in 1936, the Chinese Communist Party adhered to the principle of peaceful resolution. After the Xi'an Incident was resolved, in order to unite the whole country to resist Japan, the Soviet government officially announced the cancellation of the confrontational situation between the two political powers and changed the Soviet workers' and peasants' dictatorship to a general anti-Japanese democratic political system (which is the current border region political system). This kind of open, upright, benevolent, and just action and attitude for the sake of the nation and the country is of course in line with the basic principles of any revolutionary law. Not only that, but after the Lugouqiao Incident, the central representatives of the Chinese Communist Party also had full discussions with Chairman Chiang on the issue of sincere unity and common efforts to overcome national difficulties. At that time, Chairman Chiang expressed his agreement and support for changing the Soviet political power into the border region government and becoming a component of the National Government, and promised to allocate Yan'an and other counties to be directly under the jurisdiction of the border region government. Soon after, the Soviet government, in accordance with the joint decision of the then representative of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Chiang, officially changed its name and system on September 6 and returned to the National Government to become a component of it. In subsequent conversations between Chairman Chiang and the representative of the CPC Central Committee, it was also repeatedly acknowledged.

### Recent Developments in Chinese Film Education

[Chongqing Dispatch] Mr. Pan Chenghou, secretary of the Film Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, recently compiled a report on the work done in film education over the past few years and submitted it to the Ministry for review. The original report was quite lengthy. The following is an excerpt of the sections concerning educational facilities:

In recent years, China's social education initiatives have flourished, and the promotion of film education has gradually become widespread, extending from Mongolia in the north to Xinjiang in the west, and as far south as Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. This undertaking began with the establishment of the China Educational Film Association in 1932. By the autumn of 1936, the Ministry of Education had established the Film Education Committee to take charge of promoting it gradually. The Ministry also drafted a "Six-Year Plan for Film Education," stipulating that within six years, starting from 1936, it would complete the establishment of a film education outreach area in every county and city nationwide. The plan included establishing 80 areas in 1936, 180 areas in 1937, 400 areas in 1938, 450 areas in each of 1939 and 1940, and 460 areas in 1941. According to this plan, 81 film education outreach areas were established in various provinces and cities in 1936. Specifically, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces each established five areas; Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Shandong, Hebei, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces each established four areas; Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan provinces each established three areas; Ningxia, Guizhou, and Chahar provinces each established two areas; and Kangsu, Gansu, Qinghai, Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), Qingdao, and other provinces and cities each established one area. In 1936, the Ministry of Education fully subsidized the purchase of equipment for various provinces and cities, including Kangsu, Gansu, Guizhou, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Weihai. Eighteen projectors were purchased (Yunnan four, Suiyuan three, Kangsu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai each one, Weihai self-supplied, the rest each two). Nineteen generators were purchased (Weihai one, the rest the same number as the projectors). The total subsidy amounted to 15,992 yuan (Yunnan over 3,000 yuan, Suiyuan over 2,000 yuan, Gansu, Guizhou, Chahar, Ningxia each over 1,500 yuan, Kangsu and Qinghai each over 900 yuan, Weihai over 600 yuan).

In addition, the Ministry of Education provided half-price subsidies for the purchase of equipment for various provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Fujian, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), Qingdao, and other 20 provinces and cities. Sixty-two projectors and sixty-one generators were purchased (Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong each five, the rest three or four per province, one per city). The total subsidy amounted to 28,178 yuan (Jiangsu the most at 3,000 yuan, followed by Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guangdong over 2,000 yuan, most others over 1,500 yuan, each city over 450 yuan). The total of both full and half subsidies was 44,170.94 yuan.

In 1936, the Ministry of Education stipulated a plan for educational film preparation, dividing the "types of films to be produced" into seven categories: (1) Dramatic films related to national consciousness, revolutionary history, and the New Life Movement; (2) Teaching materials and methods for primary and secondary schools; (3) General science and knowledge films; (4) Special national education films; (5) Hygiene films (divided into children's, adult, and public categories); (6) Films on the unique aspects of new and old industries in China and related to daily life; (7) Rural life films. The "quantity allocation" for 1936 stipulated the production of 60 films, allocated as 20 for the first category, 15 each for the third category, and 5 each for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh categories.

In 1937, the Ministry of Education's plan for educational film preparation decided to produce and purchase 200 films, and formulated production goals and quota allocations: (A) "Production Goals": (1) Promote national consciousness; (2) Advocate the New Life Movement; (3) Instill national defense knowledge (including physical education, military training, and scientific knowledge); (4) Promote national economic construction; (5) Impart life knowledge; (6) Assist school education. (B) "Film Classification": (1) Teaching films (for schools), totaling 100 films: (a) Early childhood education and kindergarten students, 10 films; (b) Primary schools, 10 films; (c) Secondary schools, 40 films; (d) Teaching methods, 10 films; (2) Cultural films (for general use), totaling 100 films: (a) Language and cultural education, 5 films; (b) Political and civic education, 25 films; (c) Livelihood education, 25 films; (d) Health education, 25 films; (e) Family education, 5 films; (f) Art education, 10 films; (g) Educational implementation agencies and methods, 10 films; (3) The Ministry's existing educational films will be more actively utilized to mobilize the national masses and strengthen the forces of resistance. In addition to self-production, over ten types have been purchased, totaling 140 types, which can be divided into six major categories: promoting national consciousness, 38 types (related to the war of resistance, all included in this category); increasing life knowledge, 16 types; instilling scientific knowledge, 11 types; imparting production skills, 34 types; assisting school education, 16 types; others related to geography, scenery, and music, 25 types. Recently, when the Ministry of Education formulated the 1939 film education administrative plan, it stipulated that in addition to continuing to print anti-Japanese war films, it would entrust academic institutions with relatively complete equipment to produce educational films on the geography, history, customs, and recent construction of the southwestern and northwestern provinces, and would also produce biographies of historical figures, geography, civics, and modern Chinese celebrities from this year onward.

To train technical personnel for the implementation of the Six-Year Plan, the Ministry of Education stipulated that a training class would be opened each year from 1936, with the number of students increasing annually, stipulating 90 students in 1936, 160 students in 1937, 400 students in 1938, 450 students in each of 1939 and 1940, and 460 students in 1941. It is estimated that over 2,000 students can be trained in six years, which is sufficient for the annual establishment of new educational areas in various provinces. It is noted that in September 1936, the Ministry of Education opened the first training class for electro-optical education personnel in Beijing (divided into film education and broadcasting education groups). A total of 92 students were sent from 25 provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Gansu, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Beijing, Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), Qingdao, and Shanghai, to receive training. Most of the current electro-optical education officials in various provinces are graduates of this program. In July 1937, the Ministry of Education continued this class in Beijing, establishing a special electro-optical education group. There were 110 representatives from various provinces and cities. After the Ministry moved west, it continued the third training class in Chongqing in July 1938, with 66 students from various provinces and cities, of whom 37 belonged to the electro-optical education group. Although the number of students sent this year was less than before due to the war, the number sent from provinces such as Qinghai, Guizhou, Kangsu, Gansu, and Sichuan was particularly large. Therefore, the development of electro-optical education in these provinces will not be inferior to that of the southeastern provinces in the future.

### Chongqing Actively Reorganizing After Bombing / The Spirit of Resistance Is Even More Inspiring / Chairman Chiang Comforts People in Disaster Areas, They are Deeply Moved to Tears / [Enemy] Spreads False Propaganda, Broadcasting is Enough to Show Their Own Ugliness

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, September 9] Since [enemy] planes twice attacked Chongqing and bombed civilians on May 3rd and 4th, all party, government, and military agencies, under the instructions and guidance of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, have fully mobilized. No effort is spared in the relocation and accommodation of disaster victims, the rescue and treatment of the injured, the collection of the dead, and the restoration of traffic and the reorganization of the disaster area, all of which are being actively and effectively carried out. The reporter observes daily, deeply recognizing that the government and the people rely on each other in times of adversity, support each other in sickness, and care for each other in death and funerals, fully demonstrating the spirit of sincere unity, resistance to the enemy, and national construction. What is especially moving is that Chairman Chiang personally inspected various disaster areas on the 9th. The people in the disaster areas paid their respects and cheered all the way, some shouting to support the central government that rescues the country and the people, some shouting to love and support the leader who saves the country and the people, some shouting that the more cruel the Japanese bandits are, the stronger we will be, and some even shed tears of deep emotion. Chairman Chiang gave brief words of comfort to the victims along the way, and also earnestly exhorted the party, government, and military service teams to work hard. The reporter happened to pass by at the time. After Chairman Chiang left, the reporter asked the people in detail. They all expressed their gratitude to Chairman Chiang for his love for the people like children, and at the same time pointed their fingers angrily, saying that the [enemy]'s indiscriminate bombing can destroy our homes, but cannot destroy our spirit of resisting the enemy from top to bottom. We are determined to avenge this great revenge, etc. On the way back, the reporter met a certain important figure from the central government and told him about Chairman Chiang's inspection. The official laughed and said that the [enemy] is spreading rumors that Chairman Chiang has gone to Chengdu and that the central government will also leave Chongqing. You have personally seen Chairman Chiang among the people. The fact that the [enemy] is bombing civilians in Chongqing is enough to show that their plan of aggression has come to an end. To fabricate such rumors further shows that their fabrication skills are also exhausted. Chairman Chiang is in Chongqing, and the morale of the people is stable, as you have seen. The central government has no intention of moving, which I know very well. The [enemy]'s rumor-mongering skills are pitiful and ridiculous. They are still unwilling to understand themselves and broadcast freely, thinking that they are afraid of not deceiving enough people, but in fact, they are exposing their poverty and ugliness even more. Not only that, but the surroundings of the consulates and churches of various countries stationed in Chongqing are all civilians. This is well known to people from various countries in Chongqing, but the [enemy] is trying to fabricate excuses and shirk responsibility, saying that there are military facilities. This is known to all people from various countries, and it is not only what we despise. The reporter was delighted to have this trip, to personally admire Chairman Chiang's appearance, to deeply understand the spirit of unity from top to bottom, and to expose the [enemy]'s exhausted rumor-mongering skills, so he wrote it down.

### British Consulate in Chongqing Bombed / Britain Lodges Protest / Instructions Have Been Issued

[Reuters, London, September 9] Regarding the bombing of the British Consulate in Chongqing, the government has instructed Ambassador Craig to Japan to lodge a protest with the Japanese government.

### Martial Law Imposed by [Enemy] in Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, September 9] Guangzhou foreign reports: The Japanese suddenly imposed martial law at 6:00 a.m. this morning and lifted it at 9:00 a.m., but issued another order for martial law at 11:00 a.m. A foreigner from Shamian told reporters that last night, Shamian could hear dense rumbling artillery fire from the Huanshui Road area, and it was reported that the Chinese army was very active along the Guangdong-Macao Road north of Guangzhou.

### The Financial Policy of the Puppet Regime in North China is a Complete Failure / The Puppet Political Affairs Commission is at the End of its Rope / Begging for Mercy from Chinese and Foreign Financial Circles

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, August 8] Tianjin reports: The [enemy] puppet regime's disruption of our finance in North China, destruction of foreign exchange, and prohibition of the circulation of Chinese and foreign currencies have now been admitted to be a complete failure. The Puppet Political Affairs Commission recently issued an order that there will no longer be restrictions on carrying and storing "old legal tender," which refers to Chinese national currency, but it is not allowed to be used. This contradictory approach proves that the puppet group is absolutely unable to stop the people from storing legal tender. Without legal tender, the financial situation in the areas under their rule cannot be stable. The Tianjin traitor Liang Hongzhi convened a meeting of financial circles, ordering them not to raise the value of Chinese national currency. In other words, he will no longer allow the value of puppet currency to fall. At the same time, he convened a meeting of foreign banking circles, requesting them to maintain puppet currency, but the foreign banks argued that the best way is to change to Chinese national currency and allow it to circulate as usual. Since the fall of puppet currency, the value of the Japanese yen has also fallen because it is linked to puppet currency. However, the biggest reason for the depreciation of puppet currency is that the [enemy] is trying to buy Chinese national currency with puppet currency as much as possible to purchase foreign exchange.

### Japan Plans to Intensify the Advancement of the Southern Invasion Policy / The Taiwan Governor-General's Office is Expected to Expand / Ambitions for the Philippines and Vietnam

[Reuters, Tokyo, September 9] It is reported that since the Japanese army occupied Storm Island, the newly appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs, Koyama Kunizo, is now planning to link the Japanese territories north of the equator, such as Taiwan, the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Storm Islands, and appoint a governor-general to administer them, stationed in Taiwan, in order to promote Japan's "Southern Advance" policy. The "Asahi Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun" claim that the government will soon adopt the form of designation. The Minister of Colonial Affairs is currently discussing the management of the above-mentioned areas with relevant departments. It is heard that the main purpose of Koyama's new policy is to implement consistent administrative management in Taiwan, the South Sea Islands, and the Storm Islands. Some Japanese believe that uniting the Southern Islands into an administrative unit and the position of the Governor-General should be elevated and given greater powers. What is most noticeable to outsiders is the opinion of the "Mainichi Shimbun," which states that Japan will appoint a new Governor-General to administer the Japanese in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, French Annam, and Singapore. The newspaper's prediction shows Japan's "increased activities" in these areas.

In the past, the government has repeatedly allocated relief funds to help the people after the [enemy] occupation, and the government will continue to do so in the future. Speaking of the development of industry and commerce in the interior and foreign investment, Kong said that he welcomes it very much and said that this will benefit both China and foreign countries.

### Visiting Zhou Enlai on the 20th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement

— Yao Qianxiu

[Special Dispatch] Speaking of the "May Fourth Movement," it is easiest to think of Mr. Zhou Enlai. This is certainly because he was the leader of the "May Fourth" that year, but especially because of his spirit of fighting for the nation and the country, twenty years as one day since "May Fourth." He symbolizes the "Awakening" society he organized during the "May Fourth," and has a thorough awareness of life. From that time on, he carried the cross of liberating the nation, endured all the hardships, broke through thousands of dangerous environments, and finally continued to contribute his passion and great ambitions to the nation and the country in the war of resistance and nation-building.

It was the eve of the 20th anniversary of "May Fourth" when I suddenly heard that Mr. Zhou Enlai was passing through Guilin, so I made a special trip to commemorate "May Fourth" and visited him to ask him to write an article.

In an unadorned room, I met Mr. Zhou Enlai, dressed in a military uniform with a sword. He has a slender and moderate figure, a scholar's face, and a firm and wise air that overflows between his eyebrows. He looks about forty years old, but he looks very young. If you look closer, his fighting history is engraved on the corners of his eyes—there are very deep wrinkles. We shook hands and sat down, and then more guests came, so the reporter explained the purpose of his visit. "May Fourth is here again!" Mr. Zhou said with a slightly sigh, "But I really don't have time to write an article." Then he denied the request. "Hmm! The May Fourth Movement is already a full twenty years! It should be commemorated." Mr. Zhou recalled slightly, and said extremely slowly, as if he intended to make time to write. However, Mr. Zhou has many official duties, and the visitors are increasing and cannot stay in Guilin for long. It is obvious that there is no certainty of getting an article, so let's ask Mr. Zhou to talk about the "May Fourth" movement.

After the question was raised, Mr. Zhou talked about it a little, but he didn't have enough time to talk. This is a pity.

"The May Fourth Movement includes the national movement, the science and democracy movement, and the new literature movement." Mr. Zhou started from here with his evaluation and instructions on the "May Fourth Movement." "So it can be said that the May Fourth Movement was a thought revolution at that time, and it was also an enlightenment movement. From the occurrence and development of the movement, from Beijing in the north to Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangdong in the south, ... and from the cities to the villages, the impact was very great. Even the entire content of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People was gradually completed after May Fourth. However, the May Fourth Movement focused on destruction. Although it built in destruction, its destructiveness was more than its constructiveness, which was necessary at the time. For example, opposing Confucianism, 'overthrowing the Confucian shop with one hand,' did not critically accept China's cultural heritage, but denied everything. At that time, a new movement was launched, and it was inevitable to overcorrect, and it was bound to overcorrect. However, this cannot detract from its historical significance and value. However, China has made a lot of progress in the past 20 years. As far as the national movement is concerned, the opposition to Japanese imperialism at that time was only about not signing a humiliating treaty and preserving Qingdao and other places. Now it is a full-scale war of resistance. At that time, the democratic movement was only about young students rising up to fight against traitors and interfering in internal and foreign affairs. At most, it only affected progressive elements from all walks of life, who rose up to support it. Now the whole country is united and working together to shoulder the work of resisting the enemy and building the country, and is working hard to realize democracy. As for the new literature movement, at that time, it opposed classical Chinese in form and advocated vernacular Chinese, and opposed feudal consciousness and demanded freedom of thought in content. Now, not only has the new literature made a lot of gains and a solid foundation, but also the form of books, whether it is poetry, prose, or drama, is also being incorporated with new content and is being used commonly. In addition, the scientific spirit is being valued and used today, which is very natural. In short, everything is in continuous development. When we commemorate "May Fourth," we should inherit its positive and excellent traditions, promote the national liberation movement, the science and democracy movement, and promote its glorious history to benefit the war of resistance and national construction." Mr. Zhou gave a breath of speech. The visitors surrounding him did not seem to allow him to continue talking from their anxious expressions, but the reporter finally asked Mr. Zhou to criticize the youth community since the war of resistance. Mr. Zhou thought for a while and said, "Whether in the front or in the rear, the contribution of the youth is very great. This fact cannot be denied. However, some youths in some places often focus on two-character phrases, such as the Republic of China and the liberation of the Chinese nation, or a certain period and a certain stage, which originally have the same meaning. They often adhere to formalism, so disputes arise in meetings and symposiums, and even cause ideological problems, wasting time and delaying things, which is really not worth it." Speaking of this, I thought about it and said, "Young friends, there is one more thing, that is, they like to do things happily, regardless of its impact and consequences. As a result, they are unhappy. Sometimes they often cause a lot of trouble because of personal subjective happiness, which delays a lot of things. This must also be changed." The time and the situation in the room made it impossible for the reporter to ask further, so he had to say goodbye. We shook hands tightly again.

On the way back, I was pondering Mr. Zhou's remarks and instructions.

### The Mountain City Ablaze

— Gui Ru

— “May Third” and “May Fourth” in Chongqing —

[Chongqing Correspondence from the Minkuo Daily News Agency] The bloody "May Third" is a day that the Chinese nation will not easily forget. However, on this eleventh anniversary of the "May Third" incident, the Japanese deliberately added new scars to our old wounds. When people heard the air raid alarm, every face reflected anger, and every heart was filled with new and old hatreds.

Yesterday, the sky was unusually clear, and the vast expanse was cloudless. The Japanese planes seized this rare opportunity. A large number (36 planes) came to attack this mountain city—Chongqing. At about 1:20 PM, they invaded the city's airspace, blindly dropping hundreds of heavy bombs and incendiary bombs along the lower city's commercial and civilian areas. After setting fires, they quickly fled to the horizon. The mountain city was filled with thick smoke. Countless fires shot straight into the sky. This reporter rushed to the areas that suffered the most damage—Xinfeng Street, Duanpai Fang, Qu Si Street, Zuoying Street, Nanjimen, Dayangzi, and Shenxiankou. So many ancestral halls were turned to ashes, so many roads became fields of broken tiles, and thousands of compatriots lost their precious lives in an instant. The fire in my heart also ignited unexpectedly. I cursed the Japanese: The new and old blood debts of "May Third" will be repaid to you one day!

Today, "May Fourth," is the anniversary of the Chinese national renaissance. The Japanese did not easily let it go because of yesterday's brutality, but came even more cruelly. The air raids on Chongqing usually took place before noon, but today, the cunning Japanese took advantage of the full moon of the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar and dared to launch an attack on the city at 6:00 PM. The number of bombs they dropped exceeded twice that of yesterday. The incendiary bombs exerted their intense heat even more fiercely, igniting upon impact and instantly turning the city's bustling commercial areas and dense residential areas into towering flames and explosions like firecrackers. The fires burned for several nights without ceasing, and traffic was completely cut off. After the air raid alarm was lifted, this reporter hurriedly walked through the unaffected streets, seeing piles of meager furniture and scattered suitcases and bundles that the affected compatriots had rescued from the fire. Countless men, women, old, and young, bearing physical and mental wounds, were lying on top of them. I had no words of consolation. In fact, reality does not allow me to offer mere verbal consolation, because before my eyes, many places desperately needed a strong and energetic young man to lend a hand. I continued forward, heading towards the places where the flames soared. Passing through Zujie Street, Zheng You Street, Chaijia Alley, and Lianhua Pond, I saw the fire shining brightly, illuminating the area like daylight. People thronged together, some helping the injured, some carrying water, and some maintaining order. Generally speaking, the situation was barely satisfactory.

Running to Qixinggang, the mountainside burned like a red furnace, stretching for about half a li in all directions, with no fewer than hundreds of civilian residences among them. Tonight, the homeless people are staring blankly at the leaping fireballs, planning their whereabouts for tonight or tomorrow.

Before "May Third" and "May Fourth," Japanese planes had visited this mountain city, but people were, after all, creatures of habit. Because they had not seen any major fires, they even ignored the evacuation orders issued by the authorities for months. Now, many people deeply regret it. Their carelessness and stubbornness are indeed reprehensible, but their courage is truly moving. As this reporter saw, the people who suffered personal losses and ruined families all concentrated their resentment on the violent Japanese. He (or she), regardless of gender or age, in the midst of surviving a catastrophe, still enthusiastically defended the government's determination to resist until the end. "You bastard, ××××××!"—This is the common curse against the violent Japanese that this reporter could hear anytime, anywhere from the people of the mountains. (May 4th)

[Chongqing Express News from the Minkuo Daily News Agency, Morning of May 5th] At 5:00 PM on the 4th, 46 Japanese planes bombed Chongqing. After the first alarm was issued, our planes were seen hovering in the sky for defense. After four minutes, an emergency alarm suddenly sounded. More than 20 Japanese planes arrived first. After fierce aerial combat, they stealthily entered the city's airspace and frantically dropped 900 bombs, many of which were incendiary bombs, in the commercial center and cultural center areas such as Xinglong Street, Dou You Street, Cangping Street, Zijia Alley, Qixinggang, Guangu Street, Consular Alley, and Huixian Bridge. At one point, fires broke out in all streets, spreading and burning late into the night. Commerce and culture were reduced to ashes. Countless citizens were killed or injured, and the numbers were impossible to calculate. The Japanese planes fled immediately after dropping their bombs. At 3:00 AM on the 5th, another air raid alarm was issued. Civilians were awakened from their sleep and hurriedly fled with the old and young. However, no emergency alarm was issued. At 4:00 AM, the alarm was lifted, and citizens returned to their homes to sleep. The remnants of yesterday's burning fires have not yet been completely extinguished. Rescue, defense, and firefighting personnel throughout the city, as well as members of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, are actively rescuing the affected citizens. The city is quite desolate today. Citizens without fixed occupations are moving to nearby villages. The inhumanity of the Japanese planes bombing the city for two consecutive days has been fully exposed.

### The Pope Launches an Initiative to Convene a Five-Nation Conference; Britain Prepares to Support It; France, Poland, and Germany Have Yet to Indicate

[United Press London, 9th] House of Commons member and "News Chronicle" diplomatic correspondent Barrett declared today, according to credible sources, that the Pope has launched a proposal to convene a conference attended by Germany, Poland, Britain, France, and Italy. It is heard that the Chinese government has agreed to support it. The proposal was submitted to the British Foreign Office at the end of last week by the papal representative in London.

[Associated Press Paris, 9th] It has now been confirmed here that the Pope has invited Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to the Vatican for a meeting to discuss a resolution to the German-Polish dispute. It is also understood that the Italian Mediterranean disputes may be discussed at the same time. The countries are currently considering and discussing it.

[Associated Press Paris, 9th] It is reported that Britain and France have decided that if Poland agrees to the Pope's mediation invitation, Britain and France are also willing to accept it in principle, as Britain and France have already stated that they will allow Poland to freely handle the issues of Danzig and the Corridor. It is also understood that Hitler inquired about the Pope's true intentions and detailed plans for mediating the dispute from a Vatican representative in Berchtesgaden at the end of the week, but Hitler did not indicate whether he would accept it or not.

[Associated Press London, 9th] The "Yorkshire Evening Post" diplomatic correspondent declared that the reactions of various countries to the Pope's launching of a conference of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland do not seem to be completely satisfactory. Britain is enthusiastically supporting it, while Germany and Italy are unwilling to participate because they occupy a minority position of power. France is unwilling to discuss Tunisia, and Poland is unwilling to discuss the Danzig issue.

[Reuters London, 8th] Undersecretary Butler, in answering a question regarding the future status and administrative affairs of Danzig, said, "The British government advocates resolving international disputes through friendly negotiations, public arbitration, or other peaceful means, and is willing to participate at any time at the request of the parties concerned." Prime Minister Chamberlain also stayed in the House of Commons and said that the government greatly welcomed Burke's "clear and mixed" wording in his May 5th speech and is now carefully studying its content. As for the situation caused by the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, it is currently being carefully considered, and a note will be submitted to Germany soon. The German government did not notify the British government when it announced the abolition of the agreement.

[Associated Press London, 8th] The "Times" Berlin correspondent said that Mussolini's request for Poland to mediate the Danzig issue has been rejected by Poland. The newspaper's Rome correspondent said that Mussolini did indeed propose to Poland to mediate the German-Polish dispute. Despite these reports, it is still generally hoped that a peaceful resolution can be obtained. Anti-Polish propaganda has begun in Berlin. The "Daily Mail" Berlin correspondent said that the Nazis in Danzig will soon request Hitler to annex Danzig into Germany. Some even believe that the Nazis in Danzig may automatically declare annexation to Germany. If such a thing happens, Poland will inevitably send troops to Danzig to protect its rights. At that point, Hitler will certainly rise up and denounce Poland as an aggressor.

### German Foreign Minister to Submit New Demands to Poland; to Publish Statement in Italian Newspaper; Warns Democratic Countries

[Associated Press Rome, 9th] According to diplomatic sources, the first action after the establishment of the German-Italian military alliance is to deal with Poland in order to achieve an effective solution to the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. It is believed that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will submit new demands to Poland, asking Poland to reconsider its attitude on this issue. At the same time, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will also briefly persuade Poland to resolve the issue satisfactorily as soon as possible. The new German demands are approximately as follows: (1) Return Danzig; (2) Allow the construction of roads and highways in the Corridor; (3) Conclude a 25-year non-aggression pact; (4) Acknowledge

[Associated Press Berlin, 8th] The German government is extremely pleased with the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance and is now actively planning and employing strategies to break through Poland's resistance. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler has decided to apply a delaying tactic to wait for Poland's mobilization to be excessively costly and financially exhausted, so that it will be subdued without a fight. Secondly, Germany's policy is to promote "cumulative emotions" in various German-Polish issues. It is believed that Germany's current demand is for Poland to withdraw from the British and French guarantees and join the Anti-Comintern Pact.

[Central News Agency Rome, 8th] The "Messenger" recently reported that the German-Italian political and military alliance will be signed in early June.

[Associated Press Rome, 8th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued a statement in the Milanese newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," the mouthpiece of Mussolini, warning democratic countries that Mussolini and Hitler and their peoples are invincible and that both Germany and Italy desire peace. Discussing the German-Italian military alliance, he said, "I believe that Germany and Italy have given the democratic countries that are constantly afraid of aggression the best answer."

[Associated Press Berlin, 8th] The diplomatic correspondent of the Hamburg "Guide Record" published a commentary, apparently under official instructions, warning Britain and Poland that if necessary, Germany and Italy are prepared to resolve the German-Polish dispute in accordance with the provisions of the military alliance.

### British Ambassador Delivers Counter-Proposals; Soviet Union Said to Have Accepted; to Help Central and Southern Europe Resist Aggression; Four Nordic Foreign Ministers Meet in Sweden

[Haitong News Agency Moscow, 9th] Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov met with British Ambassador Seeds yesterday and accepted the British counter-proposals. Political circles say that the content of the British proposal is as follows: (1) The Soviet Union makes guarantees to its five directly adjacent countries, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania; (2) If a war occurs because the Soviet Union implements the guarantees, Britain agrees to provide assistance. The British and Soviet governments are currently maintaining silence, so this news has not yet been officially confirmed.

[Reuters London, 8th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that the fact that the British ambassador to the Soviet Union presented the British proposals to Molotov in person proves that the British government has obtained satisfactory assurances, namely that Litvinov's resignation will not affect the Soviet Union's foreign policy. At the same time, it also indicates that the Soviet Union also hopes that the British counter-proposal can become the basis for mutual understanding. While the British proposal also accepts the Soviet proposal to actually establish an alliance relationship, it believes that it will be able to assist the countries bordering Central Europe, Southern Europe, and the Soviet Union on a basis of mutual coordination in order to resist aggression. Discussions and exchanges of information will be conducted regarding this matter.

Debate in the House of Commons on Anglo-Soviet Relations

[Reuters London, 8th] In the House of Commons, Member of Parliament Henderson asked whether the government's policy is to strive for full cooperation with the Soviet Union to establish a system of resistance to any aggression based on mutual guarantees. The Prime Minister replied that the government's goal is to obtain the full cooperation of the Soviet Union for Britain's current policies. Then, Labour MP Fletcher asked whether the change of Foreign Minister in the Soviet Union would not affect the Soviet proposals. The Prime Minister replied that he could not provide a definite answer. The Prime Minister also replied to opposition leader Attlee that there has been no relaxation in obtaining collective security methods.

[Central News Agency London, 8th] Conservative MP Boothby asked in the House of Commons today whether Prime Minister Chamberlain also knows that the majority of the British people advocate concluding a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union. Britain has already guaranteed the safety of Poland and Romania, but the government has not yet taken any measures to supplement the guarantees, causing great anxiety among all sectors of the country. In view of this, the Prime Minister is willing to provide a guarantee explaining that he is determined to conclude a British, French, and Soviet pact as soon as possible. Chamberlain replied, "I do not know how the British public has this. I do not know on what basis Mr. Boothby's remarks are based."

[Reuters Stockholm, 9th] The foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark held a meeting here this morning to discuss Germany's non-aggression proposal. The purpose of the meeting is to request a method to declare the firm position of the Nordic countries, to strictly adhere to neutrality both in war and peace, and to express that there is no distrust of Germany's motives and intentions regarding the proposal.

### Fascist Supreme Council Discusses Italian Military Preparations

[Reuters Rome, 8th] It was recently announced that the Fascist Supreme Council held a meeting in the Palazzo Venezia today, chaired by Mussolini, to discuss "measures to keep the Italian army fully prepared at all times." Prince of Piedmont, General Badoglio, General Graziani, and Chief of Staff Pariani all attended.

### Yugoslavia Asks France to Represent its Interests in China

[Reuters Paris, 8th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Yugoslav Ambassador Poliic today. Poliic received orders from his government to ask the French government to protect his country's interests in China.

### British King's Life at Sea; Reuters Reporter Reports

[Reuters London, 8th] A special reporter from Reuters stationed on the "Queen of Australia" recently reported that the ship encountered fog this morning, so the speed was slightly reduced. In the afternoon, the fog cleared and the wind and waves were slightly worse, but the British King and Queen did not feel any unease. This morning, the King tried to draft a telegram and took a walk with the Queen. The King also swam in the ship's swimming pool in the afternoon.

### US to Build Air Force Bases on Several Islands in the Pacific; House Passes Appropriation Bill; Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Draft Legislation

[Reuters Washington, 8th] The US House of Representatives passed a naval appropriation bill of 773 million dollars today. Regarding the establishment of aircraft bases on Midway Island, Palmyra, and Johnston Islands in the Pacific, the House Appropriations Committee had rejected it last week, but finally passed an appropriation of 3 million dollars today to establish aircraft bases.

[Central News Agency Washington, 9th] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is currently on leave, and Senator Johnson is acting as Chairman of the Committee. According to Johnson, the Foreign Relations Committee has completed the collection of opinions for the Neutrality Act issue. It is scheduled to hold a meeting and draft the Neutrality Act in the short term. The bill should obtain the consent of more than half of the members of the committee.

[Reuters Washington, 8th] Nicaraguan President Somoza, who recently visited here, said to the US Senate today that the countries of South America are working together to ensure that the "American system" is not subject to foreign interference. He said, "I would like to inform you that we, the small countries, should follow the most powerful country and do our best, without fear of sacrifice, to engage in collective action so that the American system is not subject to foreign interference." Later, he made similar remarks in the House of Representatives and asked the US Congress to jointly build a canal through Nicaragua to connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

### British Conscription Bill Passes Second Reading in the House; Lloyd George Delivers Speech; Agrees to Unite with the Soviet Union Against Japan

[Reuters London, 8th] The Labour Party's amendment to the conscription bill was rejected in the House of Commons today by a vote of 145 to 387. Thus, the second reading of the bill was passed without objection.

[Reuters London, 8th] When the conscription bill was presented for second reading debate in the House of Commons today, Labour MP Payne asked whether the government's failure to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union would affect national security and whether the value of the conscription bill was not equivalent to reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union. Morrison, representing the Minister of Defense, replied that the formation of this new army would be able to fulfill its duties and maintain its past glory when Britain freely encountered danger. The proposal of this bill has swept away the doubts of others about the guarantees we have recently made. The people of the country, even the young people who are most affected, unanimously support this bill. It is even more unfounded to say that the trade union will be the first to be affected by this bill. Lloyd George rose to speak, saying that in terms of responsibility, he should support the government's proposal, but he believed that the number of people called up was not enough. Lloyd George also agreed to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, saying that the dispatch of troops by Germany and Italy could be doubled by the total of Britain, France, and Poland, and if the Soviet Union were to help, it would not be easy to implement the guarantees to Poland, Romania, and Greece. In the Far East, Japan is now eager to move and intends to monopolize it. During the European War, India sent one million troops to back Britain, and Vietnam sent 500,000 troops to support France. If we do not cooperate with the Soviet Union and have Japan as an enemy, how will we make up for this deficiency?

One Scene of the Debate

[Reuters London, 8th] During the debate on the military training bill in the House of Commons today, Labour MP Gordon MacDonald opposed the bill, his reason being that the bill was not approved by the whole country and was unnecessary. Conservative MP Kerr said that Lloyd George has raised a question that cannot be answered on the military training bill. Regardless of the Soviet Union, he believed that we would be able to fulfill our duties. He also suggested that the government take steps so that all people in the country would be obliged to serve in the event of war, and the national record system could be abolished. Cripps also opposed the bill, saying that if Prime Minister Chamberlain could immediately conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, he would be able to show the world a more powerful British attitude. Independent Labour Party MP McGovern said that the party would do its best to encourage young people to refuse to fight and oppose conscription. Conservative Ross opposed the separate treatment of Northern Ireland and other parts of the Empire. Opposition leader Attlee said that the government had not shown that the conscription bill was militarily necessary, nor could it clearly state that the number of people required could not be supplied by the voluntary service system. Secretary of War Hore-Belisha replied on behalf of the government that the government had received many telegrams from foreign countries, and these telegrams repeatedly stated that the conscription system could give them hope and assurance in pursuing public ideals.

### Spain Withdraws from the League of Nations; Announced in Burgos

[Reuters Burgos, 8th] It was announced here today that Spain has withdrawn from the League of Nations.

### Former French Premier Blum Arrives in Britain

[Reuters London, 9th] Former French Premier and Socialist leader Blum arrived at Croydon Airport today and will hold talks with opposition leader Attlee and other Labour leaders. It is heard that the talks will include conscription and the Soviet Union. Blum will also visit former British Foreign Secretary Eden.

### Commander-in-Chief of Lithuania Visits Poland

[Reuters Warsaw, 9th] Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis will arrive here today for a two-day stay. He will meet with Polish Army Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz, Foreign Minister Beck, and President Moscicki, and will inspect several corps.

[Reuters Kaunas, 9th] Officials here said that General Raštikis' visit to Poland could promote the cooperation between Lithuania and Poland in maintaining peace in Eastern Europe.

### Former British King Broadcasts; Calls for Peace; Mourns Previous Human Catastrophe; Hopes for International Understanding

[Reuters Verdun, 8th] Former British King, the Duke of Windsor, said in a broadcast to the United States today, "I have been silent for a long time, and the reason why I make an exception to say something is only because the situation is critical, and we may be plunged into the catastrophe of twenty-five years ago." He emphasized that he was speaking purely as a soldier of the last war. His most sincere prayer is that the madness of the previous cruel destruction will not happen again to human beings. Peace is very important and cannot be regarded as a political issue. Modern warfare is that victory is in the hands of evil forces, and the result will inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos, and both will feel sad. This is true in Britain and France, and it is also true in Germany. We can still work together for international understanding today, but the tense political situation is often an obstacle to mutual understanding. In private contacts, we strive to live in harmony with others, otherwise civilization cannot be produced. This is the case in private matters, and the same is true in international affairs. Do we want to let civilization be destroyed? I do not want to use words such as "encirclement" and "aggression." These words arouse our dangerous emotions. The actions of politicians who seek to restore international security and trust must be in the style of good citizens of the world, and not just good citizens of France, Italy, Germany, the United States, or Britain. The greatest success of a government in implementing its national policy is insignificant compared to the success of helping to save humanity from catastrophe. As for concrete suggestions, it is not my responsibility, but it is up to the officials who are in power, who have the right to lead the country towards mutual understanding. May God bless them to complete this difficult work as soon as possible, and not too late.

### International Current Affairs Discussion (Continued)

— Liao Chongsheng

In terms of raw materials, the country's most keenly felt shortages are iron and kerosene. As for kerosene, its peacetime consumption is approximately five million tons per year. Domestic supply, at best, is no more than two million tons, but wartime consumption, due to the full utilization of machinery, is estimated by experts to be at least three or four times that of peacetime, which is to say, annual consumption would be between fifteen and twenty million tons. This means that its domestic supply only covers about ten or fifteen percent of wartime consumption. As for the Romanian oil fields, if the country could monopolize them, it could certainly alleviate its predicament greatly. Indeed, Romania's highest recorded annual kerosene production reached 8.7 million tons (in 1936), which is approximately enough to supply half of its wartime consumption. However, if Soviet Russia can follow Britain in guaranteeing Romania's independence, whether Germany can completely control Romania as it wishes is a major question. Moreover, even if Romania supplies [them], will its supply be sufficient?

Regarding the supply of iron, because the Alsace-Lorraine provinces are heavily guarded by France, Germany is now even more deficient than in the time of Wilhelm II. Recently, the country's annual iron imports still amount to 20 million tons, mostly from France and Sweden. In recent years, in addition to actively developing its domestic reserves, it has placed great hope in Yugoslavia, because the country's reserves are abundant. However, the development and utilization of iron ore is a slow and complex process, requiring a long time, and not as easy as promoting international trade. According to recent statistics, the country's annual iron production is still less than one million tons. Therefore, once the source from Western Europe is cut off, unless after a considerable period of waiting, seeking a complete solution to its iron needs from the South is like trying to catch fish in a tree!

A Brief Comment

### Britain's Pro-Soviet Anti-Japanese Movement

According to yesterday evening's news, "The Soviet Union has not changed its diplomatic policy of guaranteeing Britain," and "Britain's counter-proposal to the Soviet Union can establish a basis for understanding," thus proving that "the door to Anglo-Soviet cooperation has not closed."

The Soviet Union's diplomatic policy has not changed due to the resignation of Litvinov. This is something we pointed out clearly long ago, and it need not wait for the Soviet Union to issue a guarantee; it is already universally understood. Certain people who fear not causing chaos, a few reporters willing to be exploited by Japanese [spies] and traitors, have been spreading rumors and criticizing the Soviet Union based on the resignation of Litvinov, even claiming that Soviet-German diplomatic relations will have new developments. The absurd theories of these people are certainly not worth refuting, but their spreading rumors or misleading the public to shake the trust of righteous people in the Soviet Union is something we should not ignore.

Now that the German-Italian military alliance has been formally established, and the collusion between Japan and Germany seems to have further developments, we should not overestimate the strength of this outwardly fierce but inwardly weak collusion, but it can also serve as a ruthless spur to Britain's past incomplete policy of uniting with the Soviet Union against aggression. Hitler and Mussolini are also trying to use the strength of this collusion to [unclear text], which is not only seen by those familiar with international current affairs but is also a cause for concern among the majority of the British public and those with misperceptions in its government. Therefore, from today's international news reports, we can see that Britain is united in promoting the pro-Soviet anti-Japanese movement. Labor MP Mr. Paine and Liberal leader Lloyd George strongly support this movement. Lloyd George also explicitly advocated that Britain and the Soviet Union establish an agreement. He said, "Germany and Italy can mobilize twice the total number of troops that Britain, France, and Poland can mobilize. Without the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Britain's guarantee to Poland, the Baltic states, and Greece will be impossible to fulfill." He also said that Japan is now attempting [something] in the Far East. During the last World War, Britain obtained one million troops from India, and France also mobilized 500,000 people from Annam. If there is no assistance from the Soviet Union, and with Japan as an enemy in the East, how can we truly fill these gaps?"

We firmly believe that only by Britain uniting with the Soviet Union against Japan and Germany and Italy can Britain be saved from the encirclement of fascist aggressors. Only by Britain leading the union with the Soviet Union against Japan and Germany and Italy can the entire world be saved from the poisonous flames of fascist aggressors. However, the British government has not yet actively adopted this policy, and the conspiratorial activities of fascist aggressors are even more rampant. Nowhere in the world will there be a piece of quiet land. Therefore, we must currently have a strong sense of hatred for those reckless people and commentators who stand in the way and shoot cold arrows at peacemakers, those elements willing to be exploited by Japanese, [Austrian?] and traitorous spies. We must also promote public opinion, mobilize righteous people around the world, and promote Anglo-Soviet cooperation and the anti-aggression front.

### The Women's War Relief Association Actively Carries Out Benefit Performances by Ladies and Celebrities; Four Nights of Performances at Taiping Theatre Starting June 1; Lead Roles in "Diao Chan" and "Dream of the Red Chamber" Have Been Decided

The national crisis is severe. The women's relief work has made rapid progress and is admired by people at home and abroad. The Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association is currently organizing a benefit performance by ladies and celebrities to raise funds for the country. The work is particularly active. The country has received enthusiastic participation from ladies and celebrities, and art experts are responsible for training. They have worked hard for four months. It is now scheduled to perform famous plays for four consecutive nights, starting on June 1st, at Taiping Theatre. One is "Diao Chan" and the other is "Dream of the Red Chamber."

Diao Chan

The play "Diao Chan" is a love affair that has been passed down in history. The selection of the lead roles in the play is extremely confidential. It is specially said that Mr. Ruan Weiyang, the son of a business celebrity, is versed in medical theory and uses his emotions realistically. Sometimes he glares angrily, sometimes he lowers his eyebrows to write, for his son Lu Bu and his beloved concubine Diao Chan. The roles of Lu Bu and Diao Chan are played by Mr. and Mrs. Sun, the younger brother and sister-in-law of Mrs. Yi Shijie, the chairman of the association. Mrs. Liu Pang Lian'ai plays the scene of Diao Chan worshiping the moon, revealing her full heart, including her great ambition to support the Han and eliminate the traitors, which is even more moving. It can also meet the purpose of the women's circle enthusiastically saving the country today, and can awaken the masses of girls on the same front to work together. Then, Mr. and Mrs. Liu co-starred in the scene of Lu Bu peeking at Diao Chan's dressing, which is the most exciting, because they are deeply in love and can take the opportunity to appear on stage to show their love in person. Looking at her scene of complaining in Fengyi Pavilion, her emotions are like grievances, like pleasures, like weeping, like suing, at this time the audience will be afraid to shed tears. The role of Wang Yun is played by Mr. Zhong Qiyuan. He arranges a wonderful plan, using the marriage of a weak woman to secretly betray, and finally makes Dong Zhuo be killed by Lu Bu, to eliminate traitors for the country. The role of Emperor Xian of Han is played by Mr. Li Juyang, manager of the European and American Electroplate Company. When he is held hostage by Dong, he expresses a kind of terrifying and desolate scene. In short, it is even more sad and indignant.

Dream of the Red Chamber

As for the play "Dream of the Red Chamber", it is originally a history of delicate emotions. The plot is tight. Please Mr. Luo Tangsheng to play Jia Baoyu. Mr. Luo has a deep research on music and is gentle and elegant. He is truly a handsome young man in a troubled world. The role of Lin Daiyu burying flowers is played by Miss Guan Bixia (i.e., the niece of Mr. Guan Qiuhan). She is good at music, has a light figure, and is proficient in illness. She is no different from a reborn Lin Daiyu. Miss Xin Mugen plays Xue Baochai catching butterflies. Miss Xin loves sports, is round and jade-like, and has beautiful eyebrows. She is competent and happy. Miss Jian Ming plays Shi Xiangyun. She sleeps with peonies. Her sister is the younger sister of Mr. Jian Yingfu, who is proficient in ancient music and often broadcasts it on the Silver Star Music Society. She is innocent, lively, delicate and charming. Playing the role of Xiangyun is the most appropriate. The role of Qingwen tearing a fan is played by Miss Li [blank] Lan. Miss Li is usually good at playing affectionate and pretty performances, which is very suitable for her status. Mr. Liu Ruiji, lawyer, plays Jia Zheng, Mrs. Rong Qirong plays Wang Madam, Miss Lu Xiulian plays Jia Yuanchun, Miss He Chali plays Jia Yingchun, Miss Wen Peixia plays Jia [blank] Chun, Miss Guan Yaozhi plays Jia Xichun, Miss Lu Yanhang plays Li Gongcai, Miss Liu Aiguo plays Xing Xiyan, Miss Luo Xiukai plays Wang Xifeng, Miss Luo [blank] Su plays Musk Moon, Miss Huan Huiqing plays Silly Sister, Principal Liu Hua plays Granny Liu, Mr. Su Zengyu plays Granny, Mr. Hua Can plays Jia Lan, Miss Mali Da plays Xue Yiyi, Miss Luo Yusu plays Lin Yu, Miss Xin Mulin plays Xue Baoqin, Miss Luo Qin Su plays Zijuan, Miss Liu Xingfang plays Xueyan, Miss Xiao Shaoqing plays Erye, Miss Guan Yaozhen plays Ping'er, and Miss Chen Yongfang plays Xiren, all have extremely wonderful performances. The above ladies and celebrities have been carefully selected by the association and are considered talented. The great famous play will appear before us. We earnestly hope that patriotic men and women will jump to buy tickets and be seated. Do not miss this good opportunity. Let us jointly promote the righteous act of relieving disasters and comforting refugees.

### Overseas Chinese Compatriots Solemnly Commemorated "May 9th" Yesterday; Schools Held National Oath; Cultural Enterprise Society Launched Kowloon's Various Associations; Regularly Hold Joint Oath of National Covenant

Yesterday was the May 9th Commemoration Day, a national shame commemoration of Japan forcing our country to accept the Twenty-One Demands.

### Watching a Shame-Seeking Film on National Shame Day

— Ximing

"War of Resistance Special" Is Unprecedentedly Grand; The Audience's Enthusiasm Is Unmatched by Other Films

A Special Report

The China Film Studio dispatched a large number of photographers to go deep into various battlefields. The purpose of taking the "War of Resistance Special" is entirely to introduce China, which is progressing in the War of Resistance, to compatriots at home and abroad, as well as to international friends who care about China. The government's establishment of the film studio and the direct supervision of the studio's products by the Political Department of the Military Commission certainly has great significance.

The "War of Resistance Special Collection No. 6" is currently being screened at the Central Theatre. In order to allow Hong Kong compatriots to universally watch the film, many measures have been specially formulated, such as (1) reducing seat prices, (2) increasing the number of screenings, with six consecutive screenings from 12:30 PM to 9:50 PM every day, (3) special preferential treatment for the academic community to visit, (4) the use of half-price tickets, etc. This method of "seeking universality" is also the reason why the government is willing to fund the production of films. It can record the entire history of the War of Resistance and exert its broad propaganda power.

According to a reporter's investigation, the results of the first day of the film's screening were six full houses, and although the seat prices were reduced, the income still reached more than 1,700 yuan. It can be seen that the audience is crowded, and it can be seen that Hong Kong compatriots are concerned about the motherland's war of resistance. Although viewers only spent very little money to watch this war of resistance film, this small amount of money accumulated can then be used to make many war of resistance films, so that we can constantly obtain "spiritual food."

The first day of the screening of "War of Resistance Special Collection No. 6" happened to be May 7th, and yesterday was May 9th. On this national shame day, watching this film of the War of Resistance is especially memorable. On this day, the Central Theatre specially obtained the consent of the China Film Studio to donate all the income from the daytime screenings to the government, so the audience was even more enthusiastic, and the results were better than expected. The funds have been handed over to the Bank of China today for remittance.

The general opinion of Hong Kong filmmakers and theatres is that "national defense films don't make money." In other words, the audience does not welcome them. However, the results of the screening of "Eight Hundred Heroes," "The Spirit of Loyalty," and "War of Resistance Special Collection" Numbers 1 to 5, all produced by the China Film Studio, in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia were very good. This can prove that "national defense films are welcomed by the audience, but they must be careful, solemn, and content-rich national defense films."

It is especially worth mentioning the emotions of the audience. When the audience saw countless scenes in the "War of Resistance Special," such as "Our Army Wins Great Victories," "Army and Civilians Cooperate," "Lone Army Raises the Flag," "[blank] People Are Captured," etc., the kind of irrepressible enthusiasm made the entire theatre applaud non-stop, and they were extremely excited. This situation is not found in "non-national defense films" and cannot be created by theatrical skills.

### A Salute to Cartoonists! A Victory and Success Symbolizing Art Exhibition

— Qi Zhuo

This is a letter from a cartoonist to a lost companion:

"Comrade ××:

It is with great sorrow that we read your cartoon work published in the traitor's newspaper. How much we regret the loss of a warrior who once fought for cartoons!

Comrade, it is simply unbelievable that you would leave our ranks, because you have a glorious history. In Shanghai, you worked with us against aggression. Comrade, how hard you worked then, but now, how saddened we are by your defection! You are still young, a time when you should be fighting for the survival of your country, but you have given up. You have given up your life, you have given up your relatives and friends, you seem to have forgotten the meaning of justice and conscience. Comrade, perhaps these things are not your own intention? I understand, because you are too lonely, and a dark atmosphere is surrounding you, preventing you from finding the light.

Comrade, you should tell us, put down your myopia, and frankly express your aspirations in life. You should think, you are a Chinese, a fighter with artistry. We are waiting for you to return to our ranks, as long as you can sober up.

Come back, dear comrade. We really don't want to lose you, but why are you willing to lose us? Tell us! Are you being deceived because of your livelihood? Or are you voluntarily abandoning your past history? We really want to understand.

Now, we are all quietly waiting for your reply, please do not underestimate the good intentions of the public! Finally, I wish you awakening.

Cartoon workers Ye Qianyu, Zhang Guangyu, Huang Ding, Huang Miaozi, Chen Yiqiao, Li Fanfu Zheng Jiazhen, Xiao Ding, Jian Xianqi, Lin Qin,

February 8, 5, 2,"

From the lines of this letter, we fully understand how our calligraphers are progressing and how loyal they are! The sincere style of persuading lost companions to turn back is also a model for us to emulate! Salute! Our calligraphers!

This time, the Hong Kong branch of the National Association of Cartoonists gathered more than fifty masterpieces of cartoonists from all over the country and held a calligraphy exhibition at the Central Theatre. We had already believed in the consciousness aspect before, and after actually visiting, we were amazed. Mr. Ndgor Now, the author of "Westward Cartoon Journey" Snow, said after visiting the pre-show on April 30: "...It depicts China's multifaceted struggle, and it proves that China's 'art front' is a strong backing for China's military front, and it is worthy of support." This is indeed the resonance of many people, without any exaggeration or strong irony.

In the struggle against the war, everything is growing and everything is progressing. Art works are not only no exception, but also serve as serious and lively members, and are very effective tools of emotional expression.

The reporter squeezed into the crowd of visitors and deeply sighed that each piece has its own unique features. "××××××××××××××××× depicts the ordinary people's ××× government." A good older sister pointed to a piece of "×××××××××" and explained it to her younger brother. The younger brother shouted innocently and jumped up, which is really an education that should be accepted.

"Men should be soldiers, women should cultivate, ×× production protects China." The background is after the bombing, and the characters are a brother and sister who stand up and move forward. "We only have one way—struggle" not only vividly reflects reality, but also writes the beauty of new women in art, returning to nature against artificiality. How beautiful and lovely!

"×××××××××××××××××!" The bait of peace "makes people feel miserable that even democratic countries have fallen for the trick of × people. Will this trick not be exposed to people all over the world one day?"

"Another Kind of People" has a very profound meaning. You have to think about it to understand. I wonder what this "kind of person" who drinks the blood of others leisurely and happily thinks after seeing it? "Equal to Murder" is also a piece that needs to be thought about.

"Sweat of the People" makes people shed a tear of pain, "××××" is actually like this, endure—endure, just like "glorious injury" Our tomorrow is not yesterday.

"Soldiers love the people, the people help the soldiers, ×××××××" is also a vivid depiction of reality, a miracle forged from the history of great China. It really makes people feel infinitely happy and inspired!

The contrast between the two calligraphy images of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei is particularly powerful. The former is a kind and heroic figure, the background is the national flag, the soldiers going to the front line, and the national flags of Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union, with the inscription "The Revelation of Victory", which is really the best. What about Wang Jingwei? ××××××××××××××××××, take a closer look at what words the author wrote? Tsk! It turned out to be "Just an example!"

There are still many works that I can't really say enough about. Art works that oppose isolating reality, such as "flowers, birds, insects, fish, landscapes, and ladies" are successful art works, and are a concrete reflection of the consciousness in the letter above. Its future is as bright as the war of resistance. These works have jumped from printing presses and painting books to large white cloths and village walls, from leisurely appreciation to the forefront of the national struggle. She has stepped through the front lines, the rear, the countryside, and the city. We will "wash and lift" her and send her on a "long journey." The reporter's rough and superficial report here only describes a small part of this exhibition. Today is the last day of the exhibition, let the visitors appreciate it themselves!

### Guangdong Relief Association Actively Relieves Refugees Throughout the Province Intensifies Relief Efforts in Two Aspects, Active and Passive Relief Expenses Total More Than 17 Million Yuan

(Shaoguan Correspondence) The Guangdong Branch of the Refugee Relief Committee of Guangdong Province of the Extraordinary Period, since it was reorganized into the Guangdong Relief Association on February 1 this year in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, reorganized the refugee relief associations in all counties and cities in the province, and adjusted the internal structure, with Chairman Li Hanhun concurrently serving as the Director of the Committee, and hired enthusiastic philanthropists and well-known people from all walks of life to serve as members, or nominal members and consultants, etc., and elected He Tong, Lu Huiniu, Chen Rutang, Wu Jufang, and Mai Chaoshu, five people as standing committee members. At the same time, the refugee area was reorganized into a relief zone, and the former Fourth Route Army Headquarters Rescue Cadre Training Class, the Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps, etc. were assigned to the Rescue General Team. Regarding the plan to relieve refugees, the Association has already carefully planned the overall steps and implemented them step by step, first paying attention to the passive palliative method, and then carrying out the active radical cure procedure. Its past work is as follows:

Passive Aspect

(1) Distributing Cotton Clothes and Medicines to Counties and Associations for Relief, People fled their homes and lost their clothes. During the severe winter season, it is inevitable to freeze and cold. The Association specially made 30,000 pieces of cotton clothes and distributed them to various counties, including Huizhou, Boluo, Zengcheng, Longmen, Nan'ao, Dongguan, Qingyuan, Huaxian, Conghua, Panyu, Wengyuan and other eleven counties, each with 2,000 pieces, Longchuan, Lianping, Shixing, Lechang, Fogang, Ruyuan, Yingde, Shixing and other eight counties with 1,000 pieces each, and overseas Chinese in Hong Kong donated 1,000 pieces and forwarded them to Lianxian, and overseas Chinese in Australia donated 2,000 pieces and forwarded them to Zhongshan. As for medical supplies, 100,000 yuan has now been allocated and personnel have been sent to Hong Kong to purchase them. (2) Issuing Relief Funds to County Associations to Handle Relief, since × bandits invaded southern China, various counties have suffered. The Association specially considered the severity of the disaster in various places and allocated relief funds. Another part was used to handle emergency relief, and another part was stored for essential needs, totaling more than 300,000 yuan in national currency (see today's newspaper for details). (3)

Sending Relief Teams

Going Deep into War Zones to Relieve Refugees, the Association sent rescue teams to go deep into the war zones to work, responsible for rescuing the elderly, weak, women and children on the battlefield, and allocating relief funds. One detachment has been sent to Qingyuan, and two detachments have been sent to Gaoyao and Lingao counties. (4) Registering Unemployed Machine Workers, in order to relieve the unemployed machine workers who have fled from Daozhou after its fall, the Association specially ordered the Provincial Machine Workers Union to register them separately, totaling 498 people in the first phase. In addition to providing temporary relief, it also sent a telegram to the Central Government requesting fundamental relief measures. (5) Allocating Funds to Relieve the Partners of the West River, after the outbreak of the West River War, a large number of refugee boats gathered, totaling more than 400 partners. In addition to the Association transferring relief funds for relief, the Third District Commissioner's Office also ordered the West River Shipping Cooperative to allocate 1,000 yuan of national currency per month from its profits for subsidies. (6) Planning to Relieve Poor and Weak Women, Children, Vagrants and Beggars in Shaoguan City. (7) Consulting with Various Banks to Find Ways to Facilitate Refugees' Storage of Gold Jewelry and Silver Coins, gold jewelry and silver coins carried by refugees from various counties when they fled in the war zones were often looted by thugs along the way, or detained by the team. The Association specially requested the Provincial Government to strictly order the teams in various counties to properly protect the refugees along the way, and also requested various banks to find ways to set up special personnel in the refugee shelters in various counties to store the gold jewelry and silver coins of the refugees, so that the refugees can withdraw them for use when they reach their destination. (8) Planning to Set Up Refugee Transit Stations and Shelters in Various Counties, The Association is concerned that refugees fleeing from the war zones along the way are in dire straits due to lack of care, and has decided to set up

Transit Refugees

Stations and shelters are located at suitable locations every 30 Chinese miles along the routes taken by refugees in various counties, and are responsible for setting up shelters by the relief associations in various counties and cities. (9) Holding a Flat Sale in the West River, the Association is now providing relief to the West River with food, and has specially prepared four measures and submitted them to the Provincial Government for approval. (1) It is proposed that the Association allocate 20,000 yuan of national currency and hand it over to the Third District Commissioner to work with Commander Deng to supervise the counties with food shortages and handle the flat sale. (2) It is specially ordered that various counties report the quantity of grain needed, the current rice price, and the measures for holding the flat sale for verification. (3) Resume the purchase of Guilin rice by Guihang Camp in order to provide assistance nearby. (4) Consult with the Food Administration of the Fourth War Zone to formulate a method for transporting grain and lecturing on rice cultivation in order to facilitate the process.

Active Aspect

(1) The Association recently sent special commissioners Zhan Weichao, Huang Deshen, and Chen Yixiu to various counties in the East, West, and North Rivers and Hong Kong and Macau to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the actual conditions of refugees and the exact number of refugee children, in order to provide relief separately, and to organize a refugee children's education group. (2) Sending personnel to plan the establishment of refugee children's relief schools in Hong Kong and Macau, the Association believes that Hong Kong and Macau are closely connected, there are many refugee children in the war zones, and there are many unemployed staff members, so it specially sent Provincial Government Counselor Tan Boyang to Hong Kong and Macau to plan the establishment of schools with the Central Committee members staying in Hong Kong and Macau and local celebrities. It is estimated that it can accommodate 10,000 refugee children and 300 staff members. (3) Setting up a Miscellaneous People Reclamation Farm, this is the only radical cure method. In addition to the Association previously setting up a

Refugee Reclamation

In addition to the farm, it is also planned to set up human-scale reclamation farms in places such as the Forestry Bureau of Suxian County, and the planning is now underway. (4) Providing Loans for Seeds, Farming Cattle, and Agricultural Tools, the Association is now consulting with the Construction, Forestry and Banking Provinces. Regarding the relief fund for refugees throughout the province, the Association has decided to divide it into two parts, passive and active, totaling 17,120,000 yuan, and has requested subsidies from the Central Government, so as to ensure that refugees in this province can be properly handled, it is said.

### Wuzhou Police Authorities Strictly Inspect Travelers Secretly Preventing Traitors from Entering the Country

(Wuzhou Express) In order to prevent traitors from entering the country and maintain law and order, the Police Bureau of Wuzhou has ordered its subordinates to strictly inspect travelers entering the country, and has announced this to the military and civilians, stating that recently, it has been found that among the military and government personnel coming and going in the city, some are wearing guns and ammunition but have no badges or symbols, or they are staying but not registering, or they dare to refuse the inspection. Such situations have an impact on law and order and should be curbed. In the future, no matter what department or official, when passing through various places on official business, carrying guns and ammunition, they must carry gun permits, and when staying in hotels, they should register in detail as required for investigation and maintenance of law and order.

### × Planes Attacked Northern Guangdong Again Yesterday All Agencies in Shao Commemorate "May 9th" with Tense Emotions

### Record of the Tragic Bombing of Chaoshan by × Planes

— Qing

(1) Be Alert!

Our Chaoshan is "naturally blessed." Looking at the broken rivers and mountains of Shenzhou, look, it is still perfectly intact...

The Japanese won't come. No, he doesn't want to destroy the only market for his goods... ×××× may not be very clever. No, it is panic, it is a blind collision. Why should he cripple such a restored and prosperous city himself... This is not a nursery rhyme, nor is it nonsense from illiterate people. Although it is not a politician's theory, it is generally popular. Street talk and gossip, drum, the tongue like reeds, are the general knowledge water, not too low middle and upper class, people, full of superstition, short-sighted people, now they have to get it.

(2) The Beginning of the Tragic Bombing

When something "loyal Holy King carriage" (that is, a kind of help, the edict, guessed what may be right or wrong big turmoil, is in these several major moments...

It just so happens that Tao Zhu, a Jewish merchant-like Mr., is deducting pearl grains "Hey, the converted smuggled goods from Shanghai - domestic products, the daily import amount has exceeded more than 8 million miles", triumphantly judged that the Japanese would not reduce his economic life opportunities himself...

Information came that the Japanese ×× were to destroy the essence of the three major ports in southeastern China - Junbo, Fuzhou, and Shantou, to carve and fry the ships in Ningfu, and had moved here, but perhaps at this time, "It's another ××× who fabricated the news, he wants to scare people into quickly hunting and opening the city," such a rumour is still popular in the intoxicating sweet dream...

(3) The Four Days of Slaughter

Wu Bridge, Guanghua Wharf, Liann Road, Huawu Bridge, Rongyao Bridge, Medley, countless magnificent buildings have become ruins, shacks and shacks have become piles of coke.

Its bullets rained down, not targeting any target, but the foreign drawnwork foreign firm that the Japanese came to, and we were responsible for maintaining the safety of the female workers was also completely destroyed. At the pier, in the slums, the scars were intertwined, and the bloodstains were mostly poor businesses with no resistance. Even the paralyzed Berneau public of the leprosy hospital could not escape the robbery.

Surveying the bombed area, the stench was overflowing, and the crying was deafening. When I arrived at the courtyard, I saw broken limbs and moans. This bloody debt of the desperate world, we will not remember to liquidate it.

Shantou:

More than 70 bullets fell, more than 50 people died, more than 120 people were injured, and more than 200 houses were destroyed.

Chaoan:

More than 20 were weak, more than 10 houses were destroyed, and more than 10 people were killed or injured.

Chaoyang:

Four bullets fell into the hospital, and more than 40 patients were killed or injured.

Chenghai:

The electric wheels were strafed, killing and wounding more than 30 people.

Now the market is still stagnant, and the businesses are still closed. The city of Shantou, where × people will not come to destroy his economic vitality, whether the government's measures to evacuate the population and transfer supplies are appropriate is now clear to the chest of the Dragon.

(4) The Divide Between Morality and Savagery

I feel that the backward Western civilization has a broad range of moral qualities. The following is the fact.

Just when the Fa ××× was frantically killing, Yanfeng Mountain was beautiful, and there were mountains of people and seas. They were all non-resistant bombers who had crossed the sea early in the morning and returned in the evening, but when the × people's iron crows were soaring, they did not let go. In the past four days, the masses who were strafed to death were also equally unresistant, but the moral countries "helped with their hands" when they saw danger.

On the evening of the 7th, boats were like shuttles, and refugees returned one after another. Suddenly, the sky was covered with haze, a storm suddenly arose, and heavy rain followed. The sea was in great disorder, and the disaster of the waves turning over the boats was staged after the man-made disaster. Seeing this, the "Sterling" British warship hurriedly sent boats to rescue the waves and rescued more than 30 people. After warmly inviting them to board the ship, the wind calmed down in the evening before sending them ashore. From here, we divide the differences between moral countries and savage nations.

(5) Not Sharing the Same Sky

Fellow Chaoshan compatriots, we should be alert now. We must break the myth, we must abandon safety, we must trust the government, obey the government, and stand up with a brave posture to meet the great era. The national crisis has not been eliminated and the family hatred has not been avenged. We will never swear to share the same sky with the Japanese ××.

General Hua Zhenzhong's knowledge, "Do not rely on × not to come, rely on me to prepare for it." We will always keep this in mind and prepare it.

Movies and Drama

### The Great Mobilization of the Isolated Island's Theatrical World: The Eurasia Art Company to Expand its Organization, Establishing an International Theatre and Chinese Song and Dance Troupe

[Shanghai Correspondence] The Eurasia Art Company, which recently performed the opera "Carmen" at the Grand Theatre, is planning a major reorganization. This plan includes not only continuing to perform French operas, but also building its own theater and organizing a Chinese opera troupe, as well as establishing a Chinese opera training class.

This plan will not only be a pioneer for the foundation of Chinese and Western operas, but will also be a powerful force in consolidating and expanding Shanghai's theatrical scene. Because their plan includes the frequent staging of spoken dramas at the International Theatre in the future. This will provide great convenience for those involved in spoken drama who lament the lack of a stage. Moreover, since the construction of the theatre is intended for both opera and spoken drama performances, the various facilities will naturally be much more complete than those currently borrowed from cinemas.

When these plans are implemented, the name of the Eurasia Art Company will also be changed. The new name has been decided upon as International Art Company. Although the various organizations under the International Art Company's name will maintain their independence to a considerable extent, they will all be prefixed with the word "International" in their names.

The plan is roughly as follows:

(1) Foreign Opera Troupe: This is the same troupe that recently performed "Carmen" at the Grand Theatre. They will soon travel to Saigon, Hanoi, and other places for performances. Their representative, LeBibot, has already set off to make arrangements. The troupe's plan is to first establish regularly performing bases in Saigon, Hanoi, and Shanghai. Then, they can take turns performing. In terms of internal organization, they want to strengthen it with the French as the center, and then supplement it with Chinese or other nationalities. In addition to Hanoi and Saigon, they will also venture to Java and Singapore for performances.

(2) International Theatre: This theatre is under active development. The location has been decided: it is in a quiet but central and easily accessible area within the French Concession's high-end theatre district. Currently, blueprints are being drafted, and it is expected to be completed this year. Public fundraising for the theatre's construction will commence soon. Because it is intended for opera and spoken drama performances, the backstage and stage equipment will surpass all existing theatres.

(3) Chinese Opera Troupe: This opera troupe is now largely organized, and the script is being written. The troupe's address, name, and the list of participants are currently being kept secret. They will be announced when the time is right.

Although the actors in the Chinese opera troupe will all be newcomers (to avoid conflicts with spoken drama personnel and dispersing manpower), they have decided to establish an opera training school to train new cadres. They will recruit young people interested in opera for training, to serve as a vital force for the future development of the opera movement. Having seen "The Poppy Flower," we believe that Chinese opera has unlimited prospects. Therefore, it is crucial to train the basic forces now to avoid a talent shortage in the future.

As the opera movement develops, the full implementation of the International Art Company's various plans will be its vanguard.

This is welcome news. I believe readers will be happy to hear this.

### Hollywood Movie Star Masterpieces

— Continued

Constance Bennett: "Topper" is considered her most glamorous and satirical work.

Margaret Sullavan: Some believe that Margaret Sullavan's performance in "So Red the Rose" is comparable to Norma Shearer's in "Marie Antoinette," which is considered an overestimation, but "The Shopworn Angel," co-starring with James Stewart, is considered Margaret Sullavan's representative work.

Olivia de Havilland: Olivia de Havilland in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" as Hermia does not reach the suitability of today's Olivia for colored films. However, she surpassed Loretta Young, and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" can also be called Olivia's representative work.

Joan Crawford: She has rarely acted in recent films. Her past films are generally average, but "Grand Hotel" can be called an outstanding masterpiece.

Claudette Colbert: Colbert's recent "Midnight" is worth mentioning.

Constance Bennett: Constance Bennett has been well-received by audiences after playing a flirtatious ghost. Her performance in "Topper" seems more vivid than in "Merrily We Live."

Priscilla Lane: This beautiful new star's "Four Daughters" is certainly her representative work, but she is also not weak in "Brother Rat." It is a pity that she has fewer acting opportunities.

Anna Sten: "Nana" can be considered Anna Sten's representative work, because "The Wedding Night," from the perspective of Chinese audiences, is not realistic enough as a Chinese rural woman.

Joan Blondell: Joan's "Miss Pacific Fleet" has been praised by audiences.

Kay Francis: Kay has been quite disappointing recently. However, "Confession" can be called Kay's representative recent work.

### Female Aviator Li Xiaqing Returns to the Screen, Accepts Paramount's Invitation, Co-starring with Dorothy Lamour

According to recent news from Hollywood, Paramount has signed a contract with the famous Chinese female aviator Miss Li Xiaqing, who will play a key role in Dorothy Lamour's new film Disputed Pasage.

The story behind this is very interesting. One day, Paramount executives saw Miss Li's beautiful image in the newspaper and thought she was very suitable for filming. They invited her to the studio for a "screen test." Miss Li thought there was little hope of success. Originally, she was not eager to be on screen, but Paramount gave her a contract.

Disputed Pasase will start filming soon. So, in addition to Huang Liushuang, there is another Chinese female star in Hollywood.

(Editor's note: Miss Li Xiaqing joined the Chinese film industry ten years ago under the name Li Danqie. At that time, she was as famous as Lin Chuchu and starred in films such as "Poet at the End of the World." Later, she joined the aviation industry and became a female hero, winning great glory for China. This invitation from Hollywood was unexpected.)

"Leona Renner," she said slowly, "This--this is strange." She seemed to have had an extraordinary experience. "I hardly dare to say it, but--your singing is excellent. I can tell whether the singing is good or bad. I have never been wrong. Would you like to learn with me?"

Leona Renner shouted, "My God! Two singers in one family?" He shook his head, "One is too much!"

Carver looked at him solemnly and said, "You should sing. You are the one who should succeed in singing. I can guarantee that within a year, you can sing in the most famous band."

Leona Renner said strangely, "But I am a house builder--"

"You are a natural singer," Carver said with certainty.

Of course, he studied singing. How could he give up this opportunity? If he really became a successful singer, Tao Si's position would no longer be in his

### Grass Court Tennis Singles Final: Clash of Chinese Talents, Held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club at 4:30 PM. If the He-Li Team Reproduces its Excellent Performance, the Xu Family Team May Not Easily Prevail.

(Special report from this newspaper) The highlight of today's open grass court tennis tournament is the doubles championship match, featuring the Xu brothers (Wei Pei and Run Pei) versus He Jialiu and Li Rurong.

The Xu brothers are currently the two players with the highest skill level in Hong Kong's tennis world. Therefore, they have already secured the top two spots in the singles competition. They are also the top contenders for the doubles championship.

This year's tournament has attracted more participants in both singles and doubles than in the past, which is a good sign. As the competition reaches its final stages, our Chinese talents have all emerged, eliminating all the Western players and creating an excellent situation of sweeping the top two spots in both singles and doubles, creating a page of unprecedented glory in history.

He and Li both performed admirably in their victory over the Lin Zhen brothers. He's strengths on that day were his ability to defend the baseline and cope with the Lin Zhen brothers' attacks. His technique of long shots with left and right angles, combined with his rich experience, was frequently displayed, showing that he has regained his former prowess. As for Li's performance, the most commendable aspect was his sharp and lively play at the net, which was enough to defeat the Lin Zhen brothers. His personal technique is certainly at its peak. Moreover, his cooperation with He is exceptionally smooth. Their positioning and retreat are well-coordinated, without any mutual mistakes. Therefore, their elimination of the Lin Zhen brothers to gain the finals qualification was not accidental, but a well-deserved reward for their outstanding skills.

Today they meet the Xu brothers. If their performance is as brilliant as it was when they fought the Lin Zhen brothers, then, although the Xu brothers come with the prestige of last year's championship, they may not easily prevail.

Before defeating the Lin Zhen brothers, He and Li may not have had any extravagant hopes. After eliminating the Lin Zhen brothers, their ambition to win the championship grew. Therefore, in today's match, one side wants to maintain the championship and uphold their reputation, while the other side wants to ascend the throne and claim the title. Moreover, with last week's performance, He and Li are even more confident. Although the skills of the Xu brothers are extraordinary, He and Li have already reached this championship stage and will certainly do their best to cope. If they win, it will be infinite glory. Even if they lose, they will still have the runner-up title in hand. Therefore, they will be satisfied with either the championship or the runner-up title. Conversely, the Xu brothers are in their golden age and want to preserve their reputation. Seeing the sudden rise of He and Li, they know it will not be easy. Meeting at a narrow pass, they inevitably have some anxiety about gains and losses. They will definitely attach more importance to the outcome of the match than He and Li, because they are afraid that even one mistake will not only undo their previous efforts, but also jeopardize their reputation of several years. Therefore, it can be predicted that the Xu brothers' desire to win will be even more urgent than that of He and Li in today's competition.

Judging by both sides' techniques, everyone knows that the Xu brothers are better, and they have cooperated for many years, with the benefit of tacit understanding. Moreover, Da Xu's superb technique of combining strength and flexibility can be fully utilized against any strong enemy, allowing him to control the opponent. Therefore, I believe that the tenacious strategy adopted by He and Li may be sufficient to deal with the Lin Zhen brothers, but not enough to deal with the Xu brothers. In terms of net smashes and baseline attacks, the Xu brothers are also superior. These are all important conditions for them to seize victory.

In short, this match will unfold into a very exciting scene, worth appreciating.

The match starts at 4:30 PM, still at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. Tickets are available for $1.00 and $1.50. (Commentary from the Cricket Club)

### The Cross-Port Football Team Returned to Hong Kong Yesterday: Li Huitang Discusses the Reasons for the Failure

(Special report from this newspaper) The Hong Kong football team that went to the Philippines returned to Hong Kong on the 7th aboard the Taiping wheel. They entered port at 10:00 AM yesterday. The ship docked at the Taikoo Wharf in Kowloon. Many officials from the General Association and reporters went to greet them.

According to team captain Li Huitang, the Philippine side was very hospitable on this trip, which will never be forgotten. As for the failure of our team in the first two games, each had its own reasons. In the first game, Liang Rongzhao was unable to participate due to an old foot injury, and Ni, who was ill, was used instead. As a result, the defensive strength of the forward line was reduced. Although Biludu was exhausted, the supply was not adequate. And after five minutes of the game, I took the ball and went up, just as I was about to shoot, I was stopped by several defenders, and my foot was injured, losing its original mobility, resulting in being attacked from both sides, and thus failing. In the second game, many of our teammates were not used to playing in heavy rain and at night. I did not play due to injury, so we also lost 1-3. The strength of the Philippine inter-port team is comparable to the one that came to Hong Kong to compete last time. In theory, their individual skills are not as good as ours on average. However, they had the advantage of favorable weather and terrain, and used a high-speed strategy, thus winning the victory. In the third game, our team moved Biludu to the right inside forward, and the formation was not complete, but we still won 4-1, which was due to the efforts of all the teammates, he said. (Hufeng)

### Yesterday's Basketball Game: Group A Guangda Defeats Police, Group B Journalists Break Long Losing Streak

In the public men's basketball game, in the first game last night in Group B, the Journalists played against Red Star. With the return of Ma Zhaohua, the Journalists were stronger. They took the lead with 40-13 in the first half. Red Star forfeited in the second half. The Journalists won, breaking their long losing streak in this competition. In the second game, in Group A, Guangda played against the Police. The two teams were close in strength, and the competition was fierce. Shortly after the start of the game, the Police were behind 4-14. When Baobaoxing arrived on the scene, the defense became stable. They first tied the score at 19-19. At the end of the first half, they even took the lead with 25-21. After the change of baskets, Guangda was still behind. Until ten minutes before the end of the game, they first reversed the defeat with 29-28 and 39-34. As a result, the Police lost with 40-47.

In yesterday's game, Zheng Yutang performed best for Guangda. His shots were skillful, and his rebounds were also good. Liang Xuanzhao and Liang Renqiang were especially able to supply the forwards, which was very good. The team's use of a roundabout passing to avoid the opponent's strong steals was the reason for their victory.

The Police were far less powerful because of the absence of Na and Xing. Although Gui Tingkai and Chen Jinkui made long shots, they were not reliable. Although Baobaoxing's offense and defense were not perfect, he made many contributions to the Police. The rest of the players were only strong and powerful, but their skills were not good, and each player often acted alone, especially when they were at the core, they were unwilling to pass the ball, so they were resisted by the opponent, which was the team's fatal weakness. The strategic miscalculation was undeniable. Relying on strength alone will not help in the end. In the last game, Group B Guangzhong defeated Dazhong with 32-24. The results of the other Group A game are as follows:

Guangda Shot Penalty Fouls Points

Chen Zhaoxiang 1 0 0 2

Liang Fu 2 0 0 4

### Popularizing School Sports: Universal Classes Should Be Added

— Zhuoyue

(3) The Remedial Course Supplements the Regular Course Hours. In the general environment of Hong Kong schools, the training methods, teaching materials, teaching courses, etc., can only be considered for the average student. It is impossible to take into account all aspects or a small number of students. From this point of view, although the effectiveness of universal and ordinary training can be achieved during regular class hours, if there are no other remedial measures, will there not be a part of the students who will never receive the benefits of physical education training, even if there are fewer opportunities than ordinary students? In other words, the weaker students will have no way to improve their health. We must not only think about these students. The only way is to add universal classes and give them the most appropriate training and special opportunities. This is the duty of physical educators.

Comrades, I believe that everyone is serving physical education and educating for the health of young people. We must be able to be loyal to physical education. Since we are loyal to physical education, we must be strict and careful in our mission to nurture the physical fitness of every young child. We cannot be casual. It is our wish that there are no pale-faced scholars and frail girls among the children under our responsibility. In other words, physical education training must be universal before we can be loyal to our duties. If we want to make physical education universal and achieve the benefits of universal physical education, we must not think from only one aspect, but we must think of methods from all aspects. Apart from other things, I think the most effective way is to add universal classes. Therefore, I am publishing all my humble opinions here for the comrades to correct me. (End of Part 3)

### Philippine Davis Cup Players Will Pass Through Hong Kong to the United States; May Arrive in Hong Kong Tomorrow; Unknown Whether They Will Perform

Philippine Davis Cup players San Jose and Ambrocio will pass through Hong Kong to the United States on the President Pierce wheel on Thursday of this week.

San Jose and Javier participated in the Saigon Tennis Championships. When they passed through Hong Kong last month, they played exhibition matches with the Xu brothers, Cai Yongshan, Situ Bi, and Giese at the Kowloon Cricket Club. If the audience is not forgetful, they may still remember that San Jose's tennis skills were lower than Javier's, and the audience did not appreciate him. Unexpectedly, San Jose suddenly won the Philippine championship last month and has now been selected as a Davis Cup singles player. It is said that one should be seen in a new light after three days apart.

Ambrocio, who is traveling with San Jose this time, is 17 years old and full of vigor. In the Philippines, he defeated Javier 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, and 6-1 to win the runner-up title. Later, in order to be cautious, the Philippine Davis Cup Selection Committee asked Gia to compete with Ambrocio again to explore the other side's true strength. As a result, Jia requested a postponement twice.

The selection committee considered that the President Pierce wheel was scheduled to depart soon and could not wait any longer, so it selected Xiang Bang as the Davis Cup player. The wheel is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at 6:00 PM tomorrow and will depart at 1:00 AM. If the Hong Kong Grass Court Tennis Association can make preparations early and invite them to show off their skills, it is possible. According to the Davis Cup schedule, these Philippine players will play against Australian or Mexican players.

### Counterattack in Literature and Art

— Zhu Li

The War of Resistance has entered a new stage. In the second phase of the war, we have decided to defend every city in the rear, launch a broader guerrilla war in the occupied areas, and coordinate with the regular armies on all fronts to implement a full-scale counterattack. Politically, we will actively eliminate corrupt elements who waver in their confidence in the War of Resistance, and crack down on all conspirators and so-called "cultural traitors." Thus, the second phase of the War of Resistance is active, preparing to implement a counterattack in military and political strategy.

Since literature and art are considered a type of weapon, and are recognized as having propaganda value, and in fact, literature and art can be integrated into any kind of battle, then literature and art reflecting this sacred national liberation war should leave a realistic record of this great era from both the front and the sides, and of course should also be integrated into the counterattack battle. This is naturally the responsibility of a literary worker, or at least should be something a literary worker pays attention to. We must increase the strength of the War of Resistance within all possible scopes!

We can also get an enlightenment from the literary practice of ×, and we are not willing to strengthen our literary battle power. Our × people have not given up their strategy of treating literature and art as a battle object. Although the transportation of "Mr. Hua Wei's" corpse to Japan is laughable and shameful, we cannot continue to ignore it. We urgently need the mobilization and organization of literary workers to form a strong opposing front, and immediately counterattack, in coordination with the military and political strategies of the counterattack.

The enemy's writers have already been mobilized under the military's swords, receiving support from the military and also accepting the military's "suggestions." Batches of them are sent to the battlefields of China. It is only natural that a "pen corps" arriving with tanks, airplanes, and invading troops will produce a large amount of "lying literature" (the topic of lying and literature is quite complex, but here the so-called lying literature obviously refers to something else).

But the invading pen that follows the invading army cannot distort tyranny into peace, or distort hegemony into justice. A tail hidden under the shirt will eventually fall off one day.

Our war for justice has gained valuable international sympathy and support, and the literature and art that are integrated into the battle for justice will also gain the same sympathy and support. This is an absolute advantage. We should maintain this advantage, and as the War of Resistance enters a more active phase, in coordination with the counterattack, counterattack the "pen corps" that came for aggression.

Until those invading troops, and the pen corps that follows behind, are defeated and roll away.

### Between Father and Son

— Qian Changnian

(1)

Lu Youde unexpectedly became old. Although others said that he was still very strong, he himself was unwilling to wander outside anymore. All the guarantees he had previously made for others were announced and resigned, and even the honorary position of director to which he was invited by some charitable and relief societies was firmly rejected.

"In this era...it's always better to have one less thing to worry about!" he often said.

Indeed, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Lu Youde had completely changed. He only planned to sit comfortably at home and live the life of an "old master" for the rest of his life, and of course! This idea was not wrong. He had plenty of houses, servants, and money, so naturally he lacked nothing and no longer needed anything else.

Lu Youde had a wife. She had once been praised by a true iron-willed fortune teller, who said that not a single eyebrow hair was missing, so she would definitely have "limitless blessings" in the future. No wonder her body was simply as fat as an old sow, how could someone without blessings deserve it?

This was a long time ago. Now? Lu Youde's son was already seventeen years old!

(2)

Lu Yaocong was completely unlike his father, at least not as afraid of things as Lu Youde was.

While Lu Youde was closing his doors tightly and living a leisurely life at home, his son was elected as the director of the fundraising group of the student national salvation association. Lu Youde never dreamed that his son would be so "brave." When Yaocong smiled and handed a book of donation pledges to his father, Lu Youde, after reading it, suddenly changed his tone to a stern one and said:

"Damao! Are you crazy?"

"No! Father, this is the duty of every citizen: give money if you have money! Give strength if you have strength! I hope Father will donate more."

"Damao! You are really getting more confused as you grow older. The current situation is like this...who knows when it will be settled...everyone should save some money, how can there be extra money to donate? What, Damao, you are even persuading the fundraising director, that's terrible, the lives of the whole family will be lost because of you. Hmph! Your name is on this donation list, if something happens I can't bear the responsibility...Actually, you are too senseless, the family has food, clothing, everything you need, why can't you be content but go and do that dangerous and useless thing?..."

"Dad, have you said enough? Listen to me—"

"Nonsense! You still want to argue with me?"

"Dad! It's fine if you don't donate, why talk so much? If people as rich as you are unwilling to give money, China will soon...

"Beast! Shut your mouth!"

"Humph! You don't love the country yourself, but you don't allow others to love the country, isn't that senseless? Stop dreaming! The days of enjoying happiness can't last a lifetime. Don't think that just because you have money you can..."

"Beast! You're actually scolding me? Get out of here with me!" Youde was so angry that his face turned from red to purple.

After this quarrel, the father and son did not exchange a single word even when they met. Yaocong seemed calm on the surface, but in reality he worked even harder than before in secret. Youde? He scolded and kicked the table and chairs at home all day long, but no one paid attention to him.

One day, Youde finally calmed down his anger. He called his son to his room affectionately.

"Damao! You're so old, don't you know how to be filial? Why do you have to go against your father? You have to know that I'm only trying to teach you well. Think about it, what father in the world doesn't love his children. I hope you don't make Dad sad..."

"Dad! I understand your situation and what you're saying. It's true, from the perspective of the family, what you said is not entirely wrong. But, from the perspective of the whole country, you shouldn't use your selfishness to force your son to stay at home." Yaocong's eyes were filled with a sacred light when he spoke.

(4)

The son disappeared at the same time as the one hundred yuan hidden in the quilt. And, both of them are gone forever.

Because of this incident, Youde lost his temper again for several days. He cursed at Mrs. Lu:

"It's all your fault, you old woman, for giving birth to such a good son!"

After hearing her husband's scolding, Mrs. Lu began to have great doubts about the phrase "limitless blessings" that she had firmly believed in for more than ten years.

### A Child's View

— Wenge

In response to the doom of "wandering around," a telegram for the implementation of spiritual mobilization of the people was sent. This is as meaningful as the sound of gongs in the quiet night awakening people in a dream. Especially in Hong Kong, this southern isolated island, it should be seriously noted. Originally, thinking about spiritual mobilization is only the minimum standard of patriotism. Logically, every Chinese should have already automatically fulfilled it without waiting for someone to mention it. But the fact that people only pay attention to it after Chairman Chiang's telegram is a shameful thing for our people!

Now, the implementation of this spiritual mobilization is being actively promoted, and most of the people have a considerable understanding of this mobilization. However—it cannot be denied that in practice, it still only focuses on literate intellectuals; as for the masses with relatively low levels of knowledge or even illiterates, at least I dare say that there has not been much impact. Although they will not all do crazy treasonous acts because spiritual mobilization does not affect them, it cannot be said that there are absolutely no skeptics about the belief in victory. Therefore, in order to extinguish the poison of this kind of blind skepticism, we must not only focus on propaganda for the so-called upper-class intellectuals, but also go a step further and penetrate into the propaganda among the so-called lower-class uneducated masses, so that people all over the country, regardless of upper and lower classes, can understand the fundamental meaning of spiritual mobilization and immediately take action. To achieve this, we cannot only have superficial written propaganda, but should also try to use other better methods. Because written propaganda is aimed at intellectuals. The illiterate masses, apart from seeing a few square characters, will of course know nothing.

Writing this, some people may say, "Spiritual mobilization has only been mentioned recently, why be so impatient?" But I think that this mobilization should have been implemented at the beginning of the War of Resistance, but it has been delayed until now. Although it cannot be said to be moved, it cannot be said to be too early, and of course it cannot continue to be done slowly and leisurely. Therefore, a two-pronged approach is an inevitable fact. Moreover, now that the Wang faction and other traitors are using clever counterintelligence to deceive the people, we must not sit idly by and watch them run rampant in broad daylight, and only use spiritual mobilization to meet them head-on. I think this is what should be done no matter what.

In short: Regarding spiritual mobilization, people with considerable knowledge can implement it immediately without hesitation. If there are still people who only harden their heads and do it after someone promotes it, then this person seems too useless. Therefore, I think that the most correct target for mobilization propaganda should be the people whose knowledge is below the standard.

Finally, I sincerely hope that every gentleman who understands the meaning of spiritual mobilization will find a way to take some of their spare time to promote everything about this issue to our masses whose knowledge is below the standard. Especially those of us who are living on this isolated island, the "happy" islanders, who seem to be unaffected by any fear at present, should undoubtedly do something for this matter.

Work hard, work hard to promote our spirit of fighting for freedom.

I am a child, and a child's views will make people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Fortunately, adults and gentlemen probably won't care about anything, so I hereby apologize.

### Mountain City (Continued)

— Qian Fei

"The weather has changed this year too, in this kind of weather, it will start to snow," the old man hunched over his cold waist.

Inside the city, practical things were laid out in stalls on the streets. Without any markings, they were naturally completely authentic local products: green porcelain bowls that were very cute, small flower vases, salt-bottom white-patterned cloth, yellow rice like a small bowl, as well as bamboo baskets, straw-woven mats, and wheat-straw mats. Everything that farmers had worked hard to produce was displayed.

People were calling, horses were neighing, and livestock were stealing a moment of leisure, freely chewing on green grass. Those who didn't have grass to eat stood quietly in a corner.

A thin pig, tied to a pole, was led by a butcher, making a terrible cry. The old owner sent it off with affectionate eyes. The pig was sold, and what was exchanged was just a few banknotes. He patted the horse's back with a melancholic look, warming it with warm breaths. The horse obediently leaned against its master's side.

The small restaurants and snacks on the side of the street were extremely lively, with stoves burning red and food steaming.

Five cents for mutton, another dime for yellow wine, to ward off the cold. A bowl of rice noodles, a bowl of local noodles, and then the shop owner was too busy. Or buy a piece of steel-plate tofu or pig's blood, and you can have a full meal.

"The provincial capital was bombed yesterday." No news could make them pay more attention than this. A crowd of people surrounded the radio.

"Three enemy planes were shot down!" A young man shouted happily.

They walked away very satisfied. The war was still far away for them.

The gray sky was a little gloomy. The mountain city gradually quieted down, and the farmers dragged their horses back to the countryside. The cold wind was blowing over their shivering bodies in the pine forest outside the city and on the sparkling lake. The haggard crowds staggered and disappeared into the small paths along the fields. (The End)

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

Then, they couldn't help but lift her up like they were welcoming Yuwen, swinging her in the air: forcing her to laugh, not a hearty laugh, forcing her to shout, not a natural shout, and not allowing her to breathe freely. All her movements were not her own. They swung her almost dizzy before they stopped. She was tired and couldn't stand up. She lay on the bed, initially embracing the love of her comrades, which was more intimate than family affection. This was her first warm dream on the road of life.

"...You are all my elder brothers, maybe there are my younger brothers, how should I call you?...I can't leave you, no!....If I don't have you by my side, who else will there be?...I can't leave you, no, no, I want to be with you in life and death, forever together!...Yuwen, why are you so foolish?...So foolish, really foolish, you are the first foolish person in the world!...Why did you still use a gun?...So foolish!...It would have been better if you had secretly written a letter, telling me clearly...Ah! Didn't I come immediately?...Look, you were even wounded by a knife...wounded by a knife!...Don't blame me, it's all because you're foolish!...No, you're all foolish! Foolish!...No, I'm also foolish, why did I stab you with a knife?...I'm foolish!..."

—She was excited and distraught in that dream. At this time, she was lying down, with her eyes closed, her hands crossed on her chest, not moving at all. There was still a satisfied smile on her face, like a smile in a photograph, never changing, and never fading.

They followed her dazed state and lifted her into the air again, continuing to swing her. They wanted to continue pouring all their enthusiasm for her in the continued swinging until nothing was left.

She was swung so hard that she lost her senses and forgot her shape, letting her body rise high and fall low, appearing and disappearing, swinging back and forth, letting them play with her in whatever way they wanted. In that play, high and holy, she did not need to have unnecessary worries; she had already forgotten the gender of people—the unfree separation. She didn't want to refuse, and it seemed that only in this way could she feel the unprecedented happiness. Now, she knew what true happiness, precious happiness, was. Even if someone were happy for a lifetime, it would be difficult to match this moment of her happiness—if it could last forever, she thought, the world would hardly have any happier people.

However, when she woke up, she still looked as if she hadn't slept all night. The reason for not sleeping well was not because she was disturbed by the emotions of last night; sometimes, people are so happy that they can't sleep.

The lights in the room, the flowers in the vase, and everything else were happy, all guarding her eyes, and especially clear. So, she closed her eyes, and the sound of the outside air lulled her to sleep.

She fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning. (Sixty-one)
