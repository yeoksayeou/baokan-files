### New Steps in Japan's Invasion of China

Recently, Japan's various internal and external policies have indeed been quite chaotic and contradictory. For example, on the one hand, the growing anti-long-term war sentiments among various domestic strata are compelling the Japanese government to adopt a policy of appeasement. On the other hand, it is more actively launching military offensives against China, expanding the war. In diplomatic terms, on the one hand, it is launching movements to exclude countries that aid China, such as the United States and France, especially the anti-British movement. On the other hand, it is trying every possible means to threaten and entice countries such as Britain and the United States to act as mediators in order to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is kowtowing to the Soviet Union to establish a new Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement while simultaneously initiating hostilities against the Soviet Union on the Soviet-Manchukuo border. This further demonstrates the chaos of Japan's diplomatic policy toward the Soviet Union and exposes the discord within Japan and the conflict of opinions on Soviet diplomacy. However, amidst these contradictions and oppositions, there is a clear new trend. According to our observations, Japanese strategists are indeed aware of their fatigue and eagerly hope to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible. Even the warmongering military has this anxious attitude.

The method previously used by Japanese strategists to end the Sino-Japanese War was to use all their strength to subdue our anti-Japanese government. However, after twenty months of protracted and foolish actions, our anti-Japanese government has not only not been conquered, but has instead become stronger and stronger. Although the Japanese side has consistently declared its non-recognition of our anti-Japanese government as the central government, the support of various countries around the world for our anti-Japanese government has become more resolute and active, especially the support from Britain recently. Japan's first plan to end the war has been completely shattered. Japan's second step to end the Sino-Japanese War was to use heavy money and favorable conditions to buy over traitors and create internal chaos and civil war in China in order to achieve the effect of "using Chinese to control Chinese." However, Wu Peifu was not deceived by Japan's conspiracy, and Wang Jingwei was discredited by all Chinese people for being fooled and completely lost his basis for activities. After Zeng Zhongming's death, he may simply go all the way, but his collapsed situation has been determined, and Japan's political offensive can also be said to have completely failed.

The only possible method for Japan at present is to actively promote military actions to invade China, complete its so-called "Itagaki Armistice Line," and on the other hand, threaten and entice third countries to come forward to mediate. The foreign news reported by the Chongqing Central News Agency a few days ago claimed that the Japanese government has also decided on several political conspiracies against us and ordered its military leaders in China to earnestly implement them. There are two key points among them: (1) Do everything possible to blockade the interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China, and try to force and entice Britain, the United States, and France to serve as mediators. (2) Vigorously propagate anti-communism and anti-Sovietism as a smokescreen to deceive the world and deceive our country. These messages are indeed quite reliable. The military actions are coordinated. After the Japanese army occupied Nanchang, it is more actively advancing westward. It is faintly heard that they are妄想 to occupy Changsha before April 15th. According to a certain rumor, the Japanese army recently added one division in central China, × division in North China, and × division in South China. Its military actions against China are indeed quite aggressive. Its purpose is to穿成打通 the Yuehan Railway, connecting the "Itagaki Armistice Line" from Xi'an in the north, through Changsha, to Beihai in the south, in order to prepare for a temporary end to the Sino-Japanese War and make its long-term construction dreams (?).

But on the other hand, there must be a strong third country to come forward to mediate. Therefore, although it launched anti-British and anti-British movements due to Britain's massive support for the Chinese anti-Japanese war with the resilient legal currency, it has always held ardent expectations for Britain, hoping that Britain can still come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. Although the anti-British movement has expanded from Japan to the occupied areas of China, it still contains thick expectations. Since Japan must please Britain, and even France and the United States, it naturally wants to show its ugly face as an anti-socialist country. Thus, on the one hand, it lightly initiates hostilities on the Soviet-Manchukuo border, and on the other hand, it expands the anti-communist and anti-Soviet smokescreen. This is all a consistent style of Japan.

We believe that this new step by the Japanese aggressors is still a pipe dream. The "Itagaki Armistice Line" cannot be easily realized as hoped. Even if several divisions are added to the army, it is still ineffective, because our army's various lines have been fully prepared and are about to begin a counter-offensive. The Japanese army is already finding it difficult to defend against our army's counter-offensive. The 全綫 的進展 is even more of a dream. On the one hand, the British ambassadors to Japan and China, and the French ambassador to China, have gathered in Shanghai, but the issues discussed will undoubtedly be nothing more than how to safeguard their interests in China and how to deal with the plans of the aggressors in the Far East. All our people expect this way, and we observe this way. The development of the matter should not be beyond our expectations! Japan's 急燥的 "狼奔豕突" will only deepen his泥足.

### The Crisis of Capitalist Countries: Unemployed Workers

— Written by Boragov, Translated by Wu Kejian

For more than a year, the capitalist world has been in a new economic crisis. The working class of capitalist countries has not yet recovered from the severe pain of the world economic crisis that began in 1929 and is once again shouldering all the burdens of the economic crisis: increasing numbers of unemployed workers, wage cuts, hunger, and poverty.

The most important feature of the new economic crisis is that it erupted under the conditions of the Second Imperialist War, which has already begun for the division of the world. A large portion of the human population has already been drawn into this war.

The process of impoverishing the working class by the crisis and war has become more acute. As a result of the crisis and war, the bankruptcy of small-scale industrialists and merchants in Japan and Germany has reached a particularly large scale. Naturally, this will cause a huge development of hidden unemployment, the scope of which is unlimited.

During the First Imperialist War, Lenin wrote: "This is how economic life is 'regulated' in capitalist countries, that is, military servitude is imposed on the workers (including part of the peasants), while paradise is created for bankers and capitalists. Their regulation consists in 'leading' the workers into starvation, while guaranteeing (secretly and in a reactionary bureaucratic manner) higher profits for bankers and capitalists than before the war." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 22, Page 167) The correctness of Lenin's assessment is clearly visible at present. In recent years, capitalist countries, especially Germany, Japan, and Italy, have been "regulating economic life" in this way.

When the new economic crisis began in the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, there was already a large number of unemployed workers. For example, in the United States, in the summer of 1927, according to the minimum estimate, there were eight million unemployed workers. In Britain, there were 1.5 million. Even during the months when the economic situation was better in these countries after the crisis began in 1929, this was still the case. This is already a minimum limit, and the number of unemployed workers below this limit has not been reached.

In the first year of the recent economic crisis, the increase in unemployed workers was much faster than in the first year of the 1929 economic panic. For example, in the United States in the past year, the number of unemployed workers increased by three million. At the present time, the total number of unemployed workers, according to the statistics of the American Labor Alliance, is 11 million.

Regarding the scope of unemployed workers in capitalist countries, we can calculate according to the following statistics from the monthly chronicle reports of the League of Nations: In the country, one in every five workers and staff members is unemployed. (A year ago, it was one unemployed worker in ten people.) In Britain, it is one unemployed worker in every seven workers. In Belgium, one in every four workers is fully or partially unemployed. In Ireland, one in every four workers is unemployed. In Canada, one in every eight workers is unemployed. The situation of unemployed workers in the United States has only reduced the number of workers in the mining industry by two million since the beginning of the crisis, which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in workers. This means that one in every four people who had a job a year ago has now been pushed out onto the street. Those workers who remain in the enterprise only work a few days a week. This illustrates the fact that since the beginning of the crisis, wages have been reduced by 36 percent, while the number of workers has also been reduced by 25 percent.

In heavy industry, unemployment is even more serious. In important industrial centers such as steel, coal, and automobiles, more than one-third of the workers are unemployed.

The situation of the British working class is not much better. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Labor in the past eight years, one in every six insured workers and staff members is unemployed. Before the new crisis began, there had been some reduction in unemployed workers, but when the new crisis began at the end of 1937, it increased again. In 1938, the number of unemployed workers increased by 400,000 compared to 1917. At present, the number of unemployed workers has reached two million again. For example, in the cotton textile industry, one in every three workers is unemployed. In the shipbuilding industry, one in every four workers is unemployed. In coal mines, one in every five workers is unemployed. In the construction industry, one in every workers is unemployed. These situations are occurring in the most important sectors of Britain.

Undoubtedly, the increase in armaments has slowed down the development of unemployment in many industrial sectors, especially in the machinery manufacturing and shipbuilding sectors. However, the increase in demand for goods in these sectors cannot compensate for the sharp reduction in commercial orders. The number of unemployed workers in these sectors has increased. For example, even in the shipbuilding industry, which has completed a large number of military orders, 50 percent of the shipyards have stopped work.

The above situation is even greater in the cotton textile industry and the 　. After a few years of temporary improvement, the industry is once again facing a period of extremely serious crisis. In the past year alone, 120,000 weavers have lost their jobs. The government and capitalists are trying to improve its situation by destroying the "surplus" equipment in the cotton industry. In the past two years alone, more than four million spindles—the equipment of forty large factories—have been eliminated. However, the situation has not improved as a result.

In the past year, the number of unemployed workers in France has also increased. According to official statistics in November 1938, the number of registered unemployed workers was 401,000, compared to 362,000 in November 1937. The number of partially unemployed workers increased from 7.5 percent in September 1937 to 18.3 percent in September 1938.

In recent months, the number of unemployed workers in Japan has increased sharply. The increase in unemployed workers is not only due to the bankruptcy of small-scale industrialists and merchants and peasants, but also due to the unemployment of industrial workers. In many sectors of industry, production has been reduced due to the lack of raw materials. Recently, not only have thousands of enterprises been closed, but there have also been many large factories and workshops. According to the statistics of Japanese bourgeois newspapers, there are currently 1.8 million unemployed workers in Japan. In addition, there are three million people who only work a few days a week.

German fascist newspapers like to disseminate information about the 細滅 of the number of unemployed workers already registered at the labor exchange. However, the newspapers are silent about the fact that the labor exchange has now become an agency for mobilizing the unemployed to do compulsory work, and tens of thousands of unemployed workers are being dispatched by the labor exchange in a compulsory manner to do military construction and strategic road construction. In reality, there are millions of unemployed workers in Germany.

At present, in the capitalist world, crisis and war are giving the working class and laboring masses new and more serious 　. In the Soviet Union, the socialist system is further consolidating the happiness of the laboring masses, developing year after year. In the socialist country, the phenomenon of unemployed workers has been eliminated forever.

In the second Stalinist Five-Year Plan, the number of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union increased by 17.6 percent. The average annual wage increased by 113.5 percent. And the wage fund increased by 150 percent.

The third Five-Year Plan has already indicated a new increase in the number of workers and staff members by 17 percent, an increase in wages by 25 percent, and a wage fund of 65 percent. The consumption of the laboring masses should increase by more than half.

In capitalist countries, things are getting worse, poverty, hunger, and unemployment. In socialist countries, the happiness, culture, and affluent life of the laboring masses are constantly developing. (Translated from Pravda) Lin Jiayue Xia Jiechang Zheng Zhihuan

Hong Kong students were previously generally regarded as

### The Current Tasks of Hong Kong Youth and Students

— Lin Jiayue Xia Jiechang Zheng Zhihuan

【公子哥兒】(Young Masters), 【皇家子弟】(Royal Children), or even 【白面書生】(Pale-faced Scholars). However, since the outbreak of the war, due to the awakening of Hong Kong students, their continuous service to the country, and their diligent hard work, they have gradually become "Youth Warriors."

This period of 　 transformation is certainly due to the brutal aggression of × imperialism and the influence of the new Chinese history. However, the waves of the Chinese student movement, which have stirred up the surging Hong Kong student movement, are also undeniable.

Precisely because of the anti-Japanese people's war and the rapid development of the Chinese youth movement, Hong Kong students have demonstrated a strong and great force during the anti-Japanese war: such as the establishment of the All-Hong Kong Student Relief Association, the enthusiastic fundraising of all Hong Kong students, and the enthusiastic participation of all Hong Kong students in national service and military service. Other things such as sending representatives to the Chinese Student Federation and the World Youth Conference, obtaining the appointment of anti-alliance with the world youth's sponsorship, all show that the local student movement, although on the other hand, the more cautious students have not been mobilized, the 　　 work is still not closely carried out, the lack of self-education, and the neglect of the struggle for the interests of the students themselves all show that the work of the Hong Kong students has not been fully developed. However, we believe that this shortcoming is not enough to affect the forward movement of the entire student movement. On the contrary, it encourages Hong Kong students to go further and seize freedom, equality, and happiness for the motherland! Therefore, in addition to paying special attention to and focusing on the support of South China students and overseas youth, we also express our warm hope to the students in Hong Kong to earnestly implement the following tasks, and to make the Chinese people's liberation movement, with the support and strong support of Chinese youth students, flourish and glorify! First, consolidate the student relief and support association. The student relief and support association, a stronghold of Hong Kong students, is a unique institution for all Hong Kong students. Its constituent parts are more than 300 schools of all sizes in Hong Kong. In the past and present, it has constantly written a new history of the Hong Kong student movement. As far as the Chinese and South China student movements are concerned, it has also played a very great role. Due to the grand scale of the student association, the strict organization, and the superior work, the Hong Kong students should actively consolidate and enrich this historically significant fortress—the relief association. As for how to build and enrich it, I will especially provide it here: (1) All Hong Kong students must understand the work of the student relief 　 and the work of the student relief association, and participate in the work of the student relief association. (2) To take responsibility for propagandizing to teachers and students how to support the relief and enrich the student relief, and to closely promote and implement all the work launched by the student relief association. (3) Help the district committee, section committee, and work within the school. Second, intensify relief work. The invasion of the × people and the殘我 of the × people have caused the children of China to流　失所 and have no home to return to. The misery cannot be described even in a thousand words. Therefore, relief work should be intensified. Although Hong Kong students have made great efforts in the past relief work, such as food rationing campaigns, shopping campaigns, and fundraising campaigns, the numbers are still very small. (The student relief association has raised more than one year, but it still 　 exceeds 　 the injured yuan.) 　 Looking around, the 　鴻遍野 is touching. Therefore, in the future, I hope that the students in Hong Kong will donate enthusiastically, and I especially hope that the students in Hong Kong will offer advice to their parents and friends in various ways, so that they will strive to provide relief and donate generously under the principle of doing what they can with money and effort. Third, strengthen international propaganda. Hong Kong is a hub for international people and an important hub for the motherland's external propaganda. In the past, Hong Kong students did not neglect their work on international propaganda. For example, in the proposals passed by the first and second sessions of the 　 Relief Association, strengthening international 　 propaganda work occupied a major position. Unfortunately, the implementation was not effective and failed to have a great impact. In the future, strengthen ties with youth organizations around the world and the International Anti-Aggression Movement Association. Use the exchange and exhibition of texts, pictures, and films to actively mobilize and promote it, so that international propaganda is strengthened. For individuals, due to the good English proficiency of Hong Kong students, 　 conduct individual 　 preparatory work at any time and any place to ensure that international people strengthen their support. Fourth, 切　 Implement anti-traitor work. The deeper and more persistent the Anti-Japanese War, the more rampant the activities of general wavering compromise elements will be. Therefore, it is urgent to execute the anti-traitor work and strike at the activities of traitors. Fifth, fight for the interests of the student community itself. In the past, the general youth student movement lacked attention to fighting for and improving the youth and student themselves and their upbringing. This is a serious shortcoming. In the future, in addition to the real connection between the people's liberation movement and the student liberation movement, we should actively implement the struggle for the interests of the student community itself. However, the struggle for the interests of students requires the unity and solidity of the student community. Therefore, how to unite all the students in Hong Kong, such as strengthening the unified cooperation and front of the students, has become a prerequisite. For the sake of "student interests" and "youth liberation," I hope that the students in Hong Kong will unite and strive together to strengthen self-education. Self-education work in the Anti-Japanese War is an urgent need now, because only by understanding the anti-Japanese situation of the motherland, the international situation, and the objective environment and subjective forces, as well as other guiding issues such as protracted war and the national united front, can we increase knowledge and enrich literacy. Therefore, strengthening self-education has become the main task at present. We students ourselves, for the sake of our own future and our own knowledge, it is urgently needed to strengthen theoretical cultivation and arm ourselves! Seventh, carry out work within the core. In most schools in Hong Kong, except for the larger ones, the establishment of student associations has not yet been established. Even in the established ones, the expansion of the work and the mobilization of students have not been specific, so that the main activities of some students are not connected with the war of resistance. From now on, in order to strengthen the work of saving the country by students, teachers, and students, join hands to go deep into the schools and carry out all the work in the schools, so that the life of every student is connected with the war of resistance! Eighth, connect teachers from various schools. Uniting youths of all classes is an urgent need. In the past, there was a very deep 　　 between teachers and students in general schools, and the connection with the youth body and the youth of various classes was also not as good. This has a great impact on the development and exertion of the work. We should let everyone—teachers, youths, and students—join hands under the standpoint of "Anti-Japanese first" and "National supremacy" to jointly promote all death-defying work. Ninth, unite overseas youths. Hong Kong students are the outposts of overseas youths in our country. Due to the importance of Hong Kong, Hong Kong students occupy a leading role in the position of overseas youth students. However, the work of youths and students in Hong Kong lacks links and unites the work of overseas youths, forming "isolation of work." This is a serious weakness. In order to unite overseas youths and unify overseas youth movements, earnestly implementing links and uniting overseas youths cannot be ignored. Tenth, mobilize students to return to China to serve. Hong Kong youth and students' return to China to serve was once surging and reached a peak. From the war of resistance to the present, no less than a thousand Hong Kong youths have devoted themselves to the motherland's embrace. However, the territory of the motherland is 　 big, and a thousand soldiers are still not enough. For the sake of the sacred war of resistance, we need to mobilize a large number of students to return to China to serve and strive for the final victory of the Chinese people!

### Spring Arrives in Jiangnan: Inspecting the Eastern Battlefield, Holding Important Meetings, Morale Soars on the Borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui

[Report from Our Correspondent, Hait Special Dispatch] As orioles sing and vegetation thrives, spring has arrived in Jiangnan. Since the fall of Nanchang, the situation on the Jiangnan battlefield has become increasingly critical. The authorities have long been prepared, and Mr. Zhou Enlai has personally visited the eastern front to inspect various locations and direct defense efforts. From eastern and western Zhejiang to the borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui, military deployments have been largely completed, morale is high, and indignation is fervent. Meanwhile, agricultural and industrial activities continue as before, with a sense of prosperity. This news will surely excite fellow countrymen in the south. Details are as follows:

Zhou Enlai Inspects Eastern Zhejiang

Zhou Enlai, Minister of the Political Department of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission, was ordered to inspect the joyful battlefield and, due to the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, advanced his inspection of various locations in eastern Zhejiang. He held military conferences with Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the the 3rd War Zone, and Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in a certain location in Zhejiang. He instructed on coastal and river defenses in eastern Zhejiang. It is reported that the defense of the Qiantang River area will be the responsibility of Huang Shaoxiong's troops, while the area along the Fuchun River will be the responsibility of Ge Jianxu, Commander-in-Chief of the 3rd Group Army, by order of Gu Zhutong. All arrangements have been completed and martial law has been implemented. Japanese troops who attempted to cross the Fuchun River and land were severely attacked by the garrison. The landing Japanese troops retreated to places like Zhao Jiaqiao. A certain defense unit belonging to the 3rd Group Army has arrived at its designated destination and is launching a general offensive against the Japanese troops. According to travelers from Zhao Jia Village in Fuyang County, which is across the Fuchun River, the area is a war zone and heavily guarded. All residents must have certificates and wear identification badges. The Japanese troops who attempted to cross the Fuchun River were only about seven li away from Zhao Jia Village.

Hundreds of Motorboats Head South from Shanghai

A foreign ship captain who arrived in Shanghai on the evening of March 24 reported seeing hundreds of Japanese motorboats speeding south from Wusong towards Hangzhou Bay. It is believed that the main force of the Japanese army intends to land along the Zhejiang coast. The type of motorboats used is the same as those used by the Japanese naval landing forces. According to people from Ningbo, Japanese warships fiercely bombarded the Zhenhai Fortress again on Thursday morning. The defending troops returned fire. The Japanese troops did not attempt to land. It is reported that among the Japanese warships constantly bombarding the area was an inspection vessel. It is also reported that a Japanese warship was spotted in the western waters of Xiangshan Port, seemingly passing through. It is said that the number of Japanese warships in the waters off eastern Zhejiang has increased to more than ten. Recently, the coast of eastern Zhejiang has suffered repeated harassment from the Japanese, causing the shipping traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang to be on the verge of being cut off. According to sources in the shipping industry, our military defenses in eastern Zhejiang are extremely solid. At the same time, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places have significant importance for the adjustment of materials with Shanghai, which is closely related to the economic life of the people. Therefore, efforts must be made to maintain Shanghai-Zhejiang traffic as much as possible. However, all ships departing from Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places will strictly prohibit young men from boarding. Women and the elderly, after obtaining export permits from the county government, can purchase tickets and board the ships.

Important Meeting on Tianmu Mountain

Since Japanese naval harassment along the Zhejiang coast aimed to coordinate with the Japanese army's advance into western Zhejiang, our military authorities immediately held an important meeting on Tianmu Mountain to redistribute defense responsibilities. Five divisions were deployed to prevent the Japanese army from advancing south. On the Qiantang River front, the 3rd Group Army commanded by Ge Jianxu has concentrated a large force, determined not to allow the enemy to cross the river and to launch a counter-offensive. Around the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway, the 62nd Division and the Independent 45th Brigade are very active. According to reliable sources, the Japanese troops entrenched in the Xinshi area have recently been cleared out by the Xie Regiment of the 62nd Division. The Japanese army's lifeline in the rear, the Shanghai-Suzhou Road, is controlled by Zhu Xi's Jiangnan Advance Army. This unit is largely composed of soldiers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and possesses strong strength. Last autumn, they once recovered Nanzing and Huzhou, alarming the Japanese troops. They were subsequently ordered to the rear for intensified training and reorganized into an elite force. Since January this year, they have wantonly harassed Taizhou, Zhenhai, Dinghai, and other places along the eastern Zhejiang coast, and have been patrolling and looting fishing boats and searching foreign ships. According to news from foreign ships arriving in Shanghai from Wenzhou and Ningbo, Japanese warships are no longer seen along the eastern Zhejiang coast. The waters of Zhenhai Port in Ningbo, Fenghua Port, Xiangshan Port, and Zhoushan Port are all calm. However, the garrison troops are maintaining strict defenses, and vigilance has not been relaxed.

Residents in Zhenhai Voluntarily Relocate

In Zhenhai, the situation has been relatively peaceful since the cessation of naval battles, but many residents have voluntarily relocated. It is reported that the entire city has fewer than 800 households, and only about half of the shops are open. The Party, government, and military circles in Zhenhai convened a meeting on March 26 at the Zhenhai Police Bureau to discuss the defense of Greater Zhenhai. Among the proposals was a plan to lock down Dazha River (i.e., the mouth of the Yong River), but it was not approved due to its impact on travelers and cargo transportation. The previous rumors in Shanghai about Zhenhai closing the harbor gate can thus be proven to be false. The old "Taiping" vessel, which is prepared to block the Zhenhai harbor gate in case of emergency, is still berthed at the China Merchants Wharf east of Zhenhai and has not been moved. After the Shanghai-Dinghai shipping route was suspended, shipping between Ningbo and Dinghai continued as usual, facilitating the transportation of goods and passengers. Therefore, passengers and goods traveling from Shanghai to Dinghai still have to go through Ningbo. Although authorities have banned shipping vessels from stopping at the coast of Shipu, in order to facilitate passenger and freight transportation, Lida is permitted to sail once a week on Saturdays. All other shipping vessels are strictly prohibited from stopping. The Shanghai-Taizhou routes will not be served for the time being. In seconds, Deputy Commander Wang Hesong will first lead a capable detachment and take the opportunity to advance on the Suzhou-Jiaxing road, while Commander-in-Chief Zhu Xi, after the Tianmu Mountain meeting, has consulted Chairman of Zhejiang Province Huang Shaoxiong for instructions and will soon lead his troops to cooperate with the regular army to launch widespread guerrilla warfare and complete the task of threatening and containing the enemy. The situation in western Zhejiang will soon become tense again.

Japanese Troops on the Jiangxi Border Attempt to Invade Zhejiang

Reports from Xinhua indicate that the Japanese troops attacking Nanchang are showing signs of advancing into western Zhejiang. The military and political authorities of the Chinese army, Liu Jianxu, Huang Shaoxiong, Zhou Enlai, and others, have gone to various locations to meticulously deploy defenses. No fewer than 200,000 Chinese troops are concentrated on the Zhejiang coast, ready to fight. If the Japanese army invades, they will pay a heavy price. Our reporter learned from foreign shipping circles in the city yesterday that Japanese planes have been flying over various locations in Zhejiang and Jiangxi in recent days for reconnaissance. On the morning of the 26th, Ningbo issued air raid alerts twice. The first time, the sound of aircraft was heard, but they did not enter the airspace and the alert was lifted. The second time, three Japanese planes were spotted circling over Yuyao and dropped bombs on Linshanwei, causing no losses. The third time was at 8 p.m., when Ningbo implemented a blackout, and Zhenhai also did the same until 9:50 p.m. Two Japanese planes flew to the coast of Shangyu on the afternoon of the 26th for reconnaissance and dropped bombs over Li, destroying several civilian houses and killing two civilians. They then flew to Songling and wreaked havoc, causing no damage. At 2 p.m. on the 28th, a Japanese plane flew over Baiguan in Shangyu and dropped three bombs, destroying seven houses. It then flew to Songxia Town and dropped a bomb, hitting the Linhe Medical Team, killing and injuring three people.

### Evening Talks on the Hunan-Guangxi Road (Part 2): Friends of China in China (Part 3)

— Ye Juesun

This resolute response was not merely verbal agreement, but was indeed put into action. We see that every Chinese political party is mobilizing the masses and organizing the masses under the same slogan, in order to coordinate with the Central Government and the military authorities.

The resolute attitude of the Chinese people towards the Wang Jingwei incident has surprised foreign observers in China. When Wang Jingwei suddenly fled Chongqing and ran to Hong Kong, it was the Gregorian New Year. That night, many foreigners in the Chongqing International Club whispered about this matter, thinking that China might split again and create an irreparable situation, to the point that the Central Government and the Kuomintang itself would experience great turmoil. When Wang Jingwei sent a telegram to the Chairman of the Commission requesting acceptance of the Konoe peace terms, many foreign political observers thought that Chiang's discord would be the final decision in the path that the Chinese people truly wanted to take. A few days later, the Central Government and the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang issued a strict disposition regarding Wang Jingwei's betrayal, which gave the foreign press a great shock.

The fact that Wang Jingwei was expelled from the party and all his powers were removed not only expressed the attitude of the Chinese Kuomintang towards the War of Resistance, but also manifested the unanimous demands of the national public opinion. Therefore, Wang Jingwei's expulsion from the party was not only a resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, but was also the decision in the hearts of the people throughout the country. This phenomenon signifies the unity of the nation and the high expression of national spirit. This great spirit can not only deal a fatal blow to the external enemy, Japanese imperialism, but also deter all vacillating traitors from ever raising their heads.

Finally, we came to Guilin, where we stayed for two weeks. In this short time, we deeply understood that not only soldiers, political parties, and the government were concentrating all their efforts on the War of Resistance, but all the people were demanding resistance and doing their best to support it. I saw with my own eyes the Japanese bombing this small county brutally. On average, one in five houses was destroyed. Even the place where I lived suffered two bombings. In these two bombing experiences, I saw all the citizens, young and old, quickly and fearlessly entering the air-raid shelters upon hearing the alarm. Standing in Guilin's solid and natural air-raid shelters, I also saw many students and professors using books to explain to the citizens the necessary knowledge and techniques related to military affairs, air defense, national salvation, etc. Therefore, during air-raid alerts, there were absolutely no civilians on the streets except for armed medical personnel patrolling. However, less than ten minutes after the all-clear signal, the streets returned to their normal state. Once, after the all-clear signal, I went with the director of Guilin's Public Security Bureau and several friends from the provincial government to inspect the situation at the bombed train station. Japanese planes dropped a total of twelve bombs next to the station, but the result was that neither the tracks nor the trains at the station suffered any damage. We arrived at the station fifteen minutes after the all-clear signal, and all the places damaged by the bombs had already been repaired by the workers. This kind of shock work spirit really made me feel excited, sighed, and admired!

Li Meng spoke very enthusiastically, gesturing as if he were lecturing in front of a large audience, and a slight sweat appeared on his forehead. Mrs. Li handed him a handkerchief and said, "It's a pity that your long and wonderful lecture only has two listeners. Well, let me conclude it for you! The Japanese are trying to shake the will of the people in the rear to resist the war with crazy bombing, but I believe that the more fiercely the Japanese planes bomb, the more it will increase the Chinese people's hatred and strengthen their determination to resist to the end!" I nodded in agreement with her conclusion. It was already eleven o'clock, and the outside of the window was a dark background, with a few sparse stars shining in the sky. Everyone was not sleepy, and went to sleep in the mutual "good night" voices.

### Simultaneous Offensives on All Fronts: We Smash the Japanese Invasion Plan, Japanese Attempts to Seize Changsha in Hunan and Jiangxi are Thwarted, Guangdong Japanese Troops Are Surrounded and Unable to Advance

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Chongqing, May 5] To smash the Japanese invasion plan, our forces have launched simultaneous offensives on all fronts in the south. Counter-offensives are progressing smoothly in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong. Japanese attempts to invade Changsha via separate routes from Jiangxi and Hunan have been thwarted. Small groups of Japanese troops harassing southern Guangdong have been attacked from both the north and west. In the past three days, they have suffered 2,000 casualties and lost their ability to operate. Our large army is secretly deployed along the coast of Guangdong and Guangxi. The Japanese plot to contain and divert our attention has failed.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, May 9] A certain Chinese newspaper claims that the Chinese army has recovered Jiangmen, and the northern route has advanced to eleven kilometers north of Guangzhou. It believes that the situation in Guangdong has new developments. The Japanese army is currently planning to attack Xinjie. According to another report from the front lines, the Chinese army is currently attacking Sanshui, and Chinese aircraft are also extremely active. Japanese army positions have been almost completely destroyed. As for the Dingzhou front, the situation has not changed. Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to cross the Jinjiang River to attack Shanggao, but have not yet succeeded. Japanese troops in Tongcheng are attacking the Hunan border and have encountered Chinese forces in the mountainous area, where fierce fighting is currently taking place.

Fierce Fighting Continues in Southern Guangdong

[Reuters, Macau, May 5] Various reports that the Chinese army has completely recovered Jiangmen appear to be exaggerated. Fierce fighting is currently ongoing there. The sound of artillery and bombing can be heard clearly in Shiqi. Japanese aircraft are using Sanzao Island as a base for operations to invade the hinterland of Hangzhou and are extremely active. Their sound can also be heard in Macau. The previously reported Guilin army that arrived was only a small unit. The main force of reinforcements is still on its way, traveling day and night. The Japanese forces used are mostly puppet troops, so they surrender their weapons to the Chinese army whenever they encounter them.

[Central News Agency, Shiqi, May 9] This morning, as the light was beautiful, a Japanese warship suddenly appeared on the Chonggezu River surface at the junction of Zhongshan and Shunde, firing dozens of shots at Dasazhang Township in the third district. At the same time, it used motorboats to carry about 30 Japanese soldiers, trying to land. The team defending that place immediately started shooting, and sent telegrams along the line to coordinate the preparation. Deputy Commander Yuan Ruiting rushed from a certain place to Dazhai after hearing the news, personally directing and supervising the battle. The two sides fought fiercely for about an hour. The Japanese finally failed and fled back to the ship in a mess, heading towards Ronggui. Now, the coastal area of ​​the third district has been reinforced and is very solid.

[Zhaoqing News] After our army occupied Xinjie on the 6th, a part of the Japanese army, about 2,000 people, sneaked to the vicinity of Zaomu from Shengang and Taipingchang. They were repelled that day. A part of hundreds of people was surrounded by us and almost wiped out. Our army captured seven or eight light and heavy machine guns, more than ten horses, and many other military supplies. On the 7th, another thousand Japanese soldiers came to counterattack. Our army was prepared and failed. They were attacked by our army and fled. Several Japanese soldiers were captured in this battle and are being interrogated. A part of our left wing assault troops captured Fuhe on the 7th and killed more than 200 Japanese soldiers, cutting off the bottom line between Shiqiaoshi and Benpingchang. We also launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops in Jiqiao, Zhucun, Wentouling, and Pingfengling, killing many. The Japanese army also continuously reinforced and used more than a dozen airplanes to assist in the battle. There is fierce fighting now.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, May 9] The Japanese troops on the northwest of Conghua were heavily damaged after many attacks and retreated to Taipingchang on the 8th. There are only alert troops in Shengang now. Our army is attacking Nanhuaizhong.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, May 9] According to military news, our army bypassed Haikou to cross the river and launched a pincer attack on Jiujiang on the 7th. The Japanese army suffered a sudden attack and fled to the direction of Fotang Temple. Our army immediately captured Jiujiang.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan Daily] Our army won the counterattack on the day. The plainclothes teams lurking in the occupied area were extremely active. On the evening of the 7th, there were big fires in Guangzhou and Foshan, burning until dawn. Gunshots rang out, and the Japanese army was extremely panicked. The situation was extremely chaotic.

Junshan in Northern Hunan Recovered

[Central News Agency, Changde, May 9] The front-line telegram said that Japanese reinforcements were being sent to Yueyang from the Qingdao naval forces. The number of navy troops is about 2 leagues. It seems they are planning to attack. Our division recaptured Youshan at 4 pm on the 7th. The east, west, and south gates of Yueyang City are controlled by our army. Many Japanese troops are now under the Catholic Church and Yueyang Tower, and dare not come out easily.

[Central News Agency, Miluo, May 9] Junshan in Dongting Lake fell into the hands of the Japanese troops months after Yuezhou last winter. For several months, Japanese warships were seen in the Dongting Lake. Recently, our Hubei guerrillas took advantage of the allied forces attacking Yuezhou, bravely attacked that place under extremely difficult circumstances, and finally captured Junshan at 8 am on the 8th. There was a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops stationed there. The Japanese troops did not expect our surprise attack and were in a mess. More than 100 Japanese troops were killed by us, and the remaining Japanese troops fled to Yuezhou. The residents saw the Qing Dynasty day again and competed to offer items to comfort our army.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, May 9] The Japanese troops in Xinyang are extremely terrified after being constantly attacked by our army. They have closed the four city gates and are using the corners of the city to dig traffic trenches to facilitate the retreat. A certain unit of our army has approached the suburbs of Xinyang and is constantly in contact.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, May 9] More than 100 Japanese troops in Jiangjunning south of Nanchang were bombarded and defeated by our army with concentrated artillery fire. Many Japanese troops were killed.

### Shantou, an Important Port of Import and Export in South China, is on Alert, City is Prospering and Gradually Returning to Its Former Appearance, Transportation and Hotels are Particularly Developed

[Special Correspondent Report] Today, no one can deny the importance of Shantou, especially when the Guangdong war has progressed to its current stage. In South China, and even the whole of China, Shantou can be regarded as the only place that can directly interact with the outside world. All the supplies needed in Gan, Yue and Min are currently concentrated in Shantou. Therefore, it can be said that Shantou's position today is a combination of Guangzhou, Xiamen and many other ports that can absorb external assistance. Its importance can be imagined.

In recent days, news of tension in Shantou has been published in various newspapers. It is likely that the Japanese troops will not let go of this only port of import and export. Shantou is an area along the coast, and although defense is more difficult, the military, government, and people have the determination to defend their soil. Moreover, there are mines all over the Shantou port. It is not easy for the Japanese to invade. The reporter came to Shantou from Hong Kong this time, and I had heard the tense news in Shantou in advance. I imagined the situation in Shantou to be quite terrifying, but everything I saw after arriving in Shantou was beyond my imagination. There was no sign of tension in the city, but a sense of calmness was evident everywhere. I thought, could the tense news be just rumors? But it is not. A colleague told me that the Shantou Municipal Government has ordered the citizens to implement forced evacuation starting from April 4. All women and children are included in the evacuation. Also, there are indeed many Japanese warships watching Shantou. It is not a rumor. However, the people of Shantou are used to tension. When the tension comes, it is still the same and there is no different feeling.

The original population of Shantou was more than 200,000. At one time, due to the Japanese planes’ crazy bombing, the wind was frightening. It was reduced to 30,000. Recently, it has gradually returned to its former glory. The population has increased to more than 140,000. All the shops have mostly reopened. The number of merchants doing business in the market is probably more than 90 percent. At night, the lights are bright, and the neon advertising signs are shining on the buildings. Although it is not a scene of prosperity, it can be seen that the prosperity of Shantou has not been affected by the tense atmosphere. Before hearing the sound of gunfire, he always maintained his original song.

My impression of Shantou is that it is a bit like Guangzhou. The city streets are tidy and the buildings are simple. There is nothing injured. Today, Guangzhou is unfortunately lost, and Shantou's position has become more important. We cannot ignore this anymore. On the roads of Shantou, trenches have been built at every strategic point. These are defensive fortifications prepared for street fighting. If the war breaks out in Shantou, every building will become a bunker, demanding a large price from the Japanese. Every building has to report, and it will no longer be as easy to take as Guangzhou.

The mood of the war of resistance filled the entire Shantou. I saw comic strips in the pavilions of Zhongshan Park, denouncing Wang Ni, who advocated peace. I saw many slogans of resistance on the streets. Every pupil who wore revolutionary-colored uniforms seemed to be a small soldier. They are training, preparing to fight for the country's freedom. Also, that group of neat steps of the strong men's team, strides, singing high, this is the expression of public military force, and also the firm expression of war resistance consciousness. I asked many people living in Shantou, if something happens to Shantou, what will you do? I got the same answer, only war, what else? Because if there is a war in Shantou, there is no room for retreat at all. Therefore, if you want to survive, you can only fight.

Shantou has now become an important hub of transportation. At the same time, the government of Guangdong Province and many important agencies are located in Qujiang. Therefore, Shantou and Qujiang have a very close relationship. From Shantou to Chaoan and from Chaoan to Qujiang, passenger and freight are very crowded. The passenger tickets on the Chao-Shao Highway have been sold out a month in advance. It is not easy to catch a ride, because of this relationship, the tourism industry in Shantou and Chaoan is particularly developed, and every hotel is full of waiting passengers.

The reporter suddenly wanted to go to Chaoan. During the few days I stayed in Shantou, no matter how tense the atmosphere was, Shantou still shouldered his responsibilities and maintained his original state. He is deeply imprinted in my mind. (Jun Ren, April 4, in Shantou)

### General Fu Zuoyi Stationed in Western Sui, Suiyuan Suddenly Becomes Active, Troops Currently Stationed Are Being Reorganized, Political Reform Inspires the People

[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, May 7] (Delayed) Since the Suiyuan Provincial Government moved to a certain place at the beginning of last month, the Suiyuan, a defense line, has shown a lively phenomenon. It is reported that Chairman Fu Zuoyi not only reorganized and refreshed the existing self-defense army, guerrillas, and various troops in western Sui, but also made active progress in politics. First of all, he thoroughly improved the people's livelihood, postponing the land tax and surtax from the 21st to the 26th year, exempting more than ten kinds of taxes, such as business license tax and animal transaction tax. He also called on the people to expand spring ploughing to ensure food production during the war. Secondly, he had detailed plans for organizing the people, training the people, and arming the people, in order to coordinate politics and military affairs, and to unify the people's strength and military strength. At the same time, he also issued a message to the people of western Sui and the whole province, encouraging the people to help the army and jointly fight against the war, the masses to unite and perform their duties, serving the country and the people, not to buy Japanese goods, not to take Japanese goods, not to be Japanese spies, not to serve in the Japanese army, and not to plant opium. At present, Suiyuan has become a tax-free area. The upsurge of expanding spring ploughing and the people's war of resistance has surged in the borderland. The general public is particularly kind to Chairman Fu Zuoyi, who has returned from the war, and is inspired.

Our ambushing forces in Shengdi Gully let them pass, and when they were within range of our main forces, we concentrated our firepower and launched a fierce attack. × retreated in panic, and our high-ground ambushing troops fired upon them again. × had no way to advance or retreat, and their corpses littered the road. Only five or six soldiers abandoned their weapons and fled northeast. The × reinforcements arrived and were met with a fierce attack from our army, suffering heavy casualties. The remaining troops fled east. At the time, the × reinforcements from Dawu continued to increase, and the × artillery from Baji and Dawu also fired upon our side. As we had achieved our mission of annihilating ×, we did not pursue. In this battle, we killed and wounded over a hundred ×, including one middle-ranking officer. We seized over twenty machine guns and a large quantity of other military supplies.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 9th] In recent days, there has been fierce fighting near Fushan. × has suffered six to seven hundred casualties, and the remaining × no longer have the ability to continue fighting. Our army is dividing up to force Yan Shan. There was a small engagement with × near Hei Guan. A small contingent of troops near the main gate ×, on the 3rd, were near Linfen. There were no changes in Xiangling ×, but they are conscripting laborers to repair roads towards Fencheng. Our army is constantly attacking them, making the project extremely difficult to carry out.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 9th] On the evening of the 2nd, a certain detachment of our army destroyed about two li of the railway west of Shouyang, dismantling all the rails and throwing them into deep ravines. Another unit, in conjunction with over three hundred civilians, destroyed over ten li of the railway between Yangquan and Pinfing, recovering over five hundred yards of electrical wire.

They are still engaged in combat.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 9th] A few days ago, over four hundred × infantry and cavalry, with multiple cannons attached, set out from Pushang Liyi Song (under the jurisdiction of Jingle) along two routes to invade areas such as Shangxia Bianjing Xiama Town. A portion of our army guarded the mountain peaks, while another portion circled around to attack the rear of the × army. × was heavily surrounded and dared not engage in close combat, immediately fleeing in panic. On the 6th, × again divided into three routes to invade areas before and after Fotang Mountain and Ziji. Our army launched a fierce attack on × from the highlands northeast of Shancun. After several hours of fierce fighting, they still did not succeed. In the two battles, over a hundred × were killed.

### Yulin on the National Defense Line:

— Loyalty and Courage

[Yulin Correspondence] In the rough Northwest, on the plateau, Yulin occupies a strategically important position on the national defense line. It follows the majestic Great Wall and resides in the desert hinterland. The climate is harsh, and the land is mostly barren, known as a remote area.

Looking back at history, it is an important town on one of the nine border defenses. Yulin was established as Shang Commandery during the Qin Dynasty and was conquered by the Xiongnu during the Han Dynasty. Throughout the Wei, Jin, and Northern Dynasties, it lived under the iron heel of foreign tribes. It was not until the Sui and Tang Dynasties that the name Sheng Prefecture appeared. From the late Tang to the late Yuan Dynasties, it belonged to Western Xia. During the Ming Dynasty, people wanted to recover the Hetao region and stationed troops here, building offices and fortifications, which led to an increase in population and the establishment of cultural institutions.

During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, the Hui people and the "Nien rebels" twice fled north to northern Shaanxi, and all counties suffered from the chaos and destruction. Only Yulin, with the joint efforts of the military and civilians, defended itself effectively and was not breached, allowing the people to remain safe.

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Li Zicheng rebelled against Yulin, attacking the city gates. All the women and children of the city engaged in street fighting with bricks and stones, repelling him.

Since the Republic of China, bandit leaders such as Lu Zhan Kui and Chuan Shan Jia have repeatedly attacked the city. The people's temporary armed forces, wielding large swords and axes, went out of the city to meet the bandits. Some made heroic sacrifices, but the bandits were ultimately defeated.

Over the centuries, Yulin has experienced many disasters, but it has sufficient strength to overcome difficulties. This bloody history further proves that the people of Yulin, under the leadership of wise leaders, are capable of fulfilling their arduous tasks in national defense.

The fires of the Lugouqiao Incident awakened the broad masses of the nation and also awakened Yulin.

During the early stages of the sacred war of resistance, the enemy captured Suiyuan and Baotou, and Taiyuan, causing the war in Suiyuan and Mongolia to suddenly become tense. Yulin is closely connected to the front line, bordering Inner Mongolia to the north, connected to Shenfu to the east, controlling Suiyan to the south, and connecting to Ningxia to the west. When the fierce battle on the northern battlefield unfolds, it will immediately become the front line. Its strategic importance in military affairs is something we cannot ignore.

General Deng ×× has been stationed in Yulin, helping to resolve the most serious disputes in Inner Mongolia, strengthening the determination of the various banners of Inner Mongolia to resist the war, and commanding the local garrison ×× Division, Gao ×× Department, to operate in the areas of Fugou Baode Dongsheng, repeatedly building great achievements, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy's attempt to invade the Northwest. This deserves our敏 and 揚.

Enemy aircraft have been bombing northern Shaanxi wantonly in order to shake people's hearts. The defensive areas of Fugou and Dongsheng have been repeatedly attacked by air. The Dongsheng 入 army once used rifles to shoot down two enemy aircraft, showing their brave and sacrificial fighting spirit.

The military and civilians of Yulin are able to cooperate closely. It is often heard that the army helps the people, and the general public is able to actively participate in patriotic work, generously donating money. For example, the blacksmith Liu Zhanchui destroyed his home to relieve the nation's difficulties, and primary school students saved money to donate.

Recently, they have also responded to the 　　movement. All industries in the city have been mobilized. There are also those who have voluntarily awarded military horses, purchased guns and ammunition, and prepared supplies. Organizations and training for cavalry strike teams, volunteer commando teams, young pioneers, and standing reserve teams are sound and effective. Women and children are also being organized and trained.

These strong soldiers are all prepared to show their skills on the northwestern battlefield, annihilate the enemy, crush the enemy's 　　in the West, and complete our great task of defending the Northwest. (Minge News Agency)

### Impressions of Yan'an

— Written by Associated Press Reporter Martin, Translated by Yang

Yan'an is only a few miles away from the front line, but this city and the surrounding area are peaceful and uneventful, no different from before the Japanese invaded Shanxi. The two provinces of Shaanxi and Jin are bordered by the Yellow River, which still serves as a barrier that the Japanese cannot easily cross.

If the new recruits and regular troops who are training here day and night were moved elsewhere, or if the large-scale mass gatherings were no longer held, and the trucks transporting military supplies were removed, then a person who happened to travel here would surely believe that this place is a clean land that has not been ravaged by war. But looking back at the town that has been scarred by bombings, the previous feeling would immediately disappear.

Here, farmers, merchants, and workers are all happy to be ruled by the Communists. The land in this special zone has been distributed to the people, the landlords have been eliminated, the farmers' debts have been forgiven, and taxes can be deferred. All of this has brought unexpected prosperity to this barren and impoverished region, and the people are satisfied.

Chinese merchants, especially those who run transportation and hotels, say that the war has brought unexpected prosperity. A straightforward and satisfied car merchant, who has four or five carriages, once told me that his business is three times better than last year, and the carriage rental prices are increasing day by day, allowing him to gain great profits and double the number of his carriages. A hotel owner who heard our conversation also said that his business had increased as well. Hotel owners along the highway from Xi'an to northeastern Shaanxi Province also said that business is booming.

The cost of living here has increased, but according to the Chinese people, the increase is not as significant as in other places. The price of food has increased by 50% to 100% last year, while in various parts of western China, it has increased by three to four times. This place has been under Communist rule for many years, and the local 常偿 is able to be self-sufficient in economics. With only a small amount of external trade, the residents have not felt the pain of war.

This place is mainly an agricultural area, and farmers can produce what they need. There is a lot of cotton grown near the south of the special zone, and there are many sheep in the northern pastures, which can produce wool. Although there are many handicraft factories producing cloth, most of the textile is homemade. There is not much wood, almost only used to build rock caves and mud houses. The main fuel is charcoal, and homemade candles and vegetable oil are used for lighting.

In order to facilitate transactions, the special zone government has issued banknotes to replace various national and provincial currencies, and even copper coins are replaced with banknotes. These banknotes have no cash reserves other than the credit of the special zone government, but everyone in the special zone can use them at face value. There is not much demand for national currency, and the currency of the special zone is not accepted outside the special zone.

The prices of luxury goods are not expensive because Japanese goods sneak in from various places in 翼察熱習. Cigarettes are the most expensive, as they must be imported from the south. The Communists often propagate to the farmers that the cigarettes shipped from outside are all 下了　by the Japanese. Therefore, the most popular "×××" brand has actually been rejected, and replaced by cheaper and inferiorly packaged brands, and even these brands of cigarettes are two or three times more expensive than outside.

The Chinese residents told the city that there are still many barter transactions here, but they are mostly exchanges of products between farmers, rather than purchases and sales between farmers and merchants.

The most prominent feature of the special zone is that there are no thieves, and the people do not look shabby. Beggars have disappeared, and begging behavior is not tolerated in the special zone. All the beggars have fled to the south, or have been employed by the special zone government. Most of the thieves have turned over a new leaf and surrendered to the Eighth Route Army. The people of the special zone used to fight against the Central Army, and in the past two months, they have also fought against the Japanese, so everyone has received some military training. There are no stories of robbery here, but in the nearby south, near Xi'an, it is commonplace.

The special zone government has done its best to alleviate the suffering of the peasants and other residents. As a result, the people love it very much. This feeling of protecting the government cannot be found elsewhere in China. In some other places, the farmers are either afraid of the government or hate the government because of the strong levy of taxes.

If a Chenmin here has a bad harvest one year, the government will help him, and his son will be sent to school and supported by the government. The special zone government also has贈　处. The farmers here love and trust the soldiers 　, which is unprecedented in Chinese history. They call the army "our army" rather than "those armies." The soldiers are trained on how to对　the farmers. They pay the price for what they buy and often associate with the residents.

I once visited an exhibition in Yan'an, which was specifically 　　for the farmers by the special zone government, similar to the American "Village 　 Exhibition." There were exhibitions of the best breeds of livestock and horses, and judged their merits, and all kinds of seeds, fruits, and vegetables were displayed. And there were people 經　on the scene to explain 　 planting, irrigation, and new farming methods. Also displays the 　 of textile and leather. Products, and describes the method of manufacture. All this is the government, 　 for the farmers, daily attendance, the farmers who watched were in the thousands, the special zone exhibition simply put a week off.

Politically speaking, this special zone is also the most progressive place in the whole of China. Not only do the people have their elected representatives in the special zone meetings, but also the county councils or village committees are operated by them through popular elections. Ten thousand people in the special zone say "our government" instead of "that government". There are no rickshaw pullers and porters in the district, and there are very few舌force who carry luggage. The peasants are very respectful of government officials. Even Mao Zedong, the "Chinese Lenin," will not 　 avoid them, and the peasants are always willing to run errands. All government officials wear the same plain blue cotton uniforms, eat no better than the peasants, and live no better than a middle-class merchant. All of these facts are the reasons why people love and cut off the special zone government.

Japan has often declared that this invasion of China is a bloody battle to 　 remove the threat of communism in the Far East. The Communists, however, have been able to take advantage of the Japanese lies to宣　 to the peasants. 記　 once went to a small village forty miles outside of Yan'an to attend a tea party, and the reporter was able to inquire about each farmer. The leader of the tea 　 Association was a farmer with a full face of the wind 　, and 有　　:

一　Japanese, enough to see the government that the Communist Party has done for us, they will not want to fight us anymore. We are very safe, because the Communist Party has helped us. The Japanese rulers 　　like our leaders are so good, the Japanese will be much better, but 　 them do not want to 　 decide communism, they want China, one

Japanese propaganda is what the West calls "self-made and self-developed" propaganda. (April 1)

### After the Italian Army Occupies Aijing, a New Government is Formed; 30,000 Italian Troops are Flown into Albania; Some Approach the Southern National Border

[Associated Press, Aijing, 9th] Italian troops have completely occupied Tirana, the capital of Albania. Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here on his private plane to organize a new government completely controlled by Italy. From now on, the new government's foreign and defense policies must be obeyed by Rome. All former ministers will be excluded, and the Albanian King will not be allowed to return to the country "to avoid disrupting order." Mussolini is also scheduled to arrive here by plane today or tomorrow. The number of Italian troops landed in Albania is about 30,000, some of whom were transported by plane. This is a new era in the history of large-scale aerial military transport. Many Albanian people witnessed large three-engine aircraft landing, and the troops quickly gathered. Many were equipped with machine guns. Italian residents posted slogans everywhere, denouncing the Albanian King and warmly praising the Italian King. Officials announced that the Italian army had occupied Basen, the last stronghold of Albanian resistance. After arriving here by plane in the afternoon, Italian Army Commander Alfredo immediately established his headquarters. When the Italian Foreign Minister flew to, the German Ambassador attended the welcome. They rode in cars and toured the major streets. Italian flags were flying everywhere in the city.

### After Albania is Forcibly Occupied, the European Situation Suddenly Changes; British Authorities Hold Cabinet Meetings; Military Officials Express Willingness to Fight

[Reuters, London, 9th] The "Anqi Thames Times" foreign affairs correspondent declared that London now believes that Italy's forceful occupation of Albania has caused the European situation to change suddenly. The most serious consequence is that it 令意國令譽 has been greatly affected. The question is whether the British government will 音布 　止 this 　 agreement on the grounds that Italy has broken the Anglo-Italian恊. It is rather勉強 for Britain to take this step. The more urgent fact now is how to maintain the independence of Greece and Turkey. The two countries, Greece and Turkey, have felt extremely great disturbance due to Italy's forceful occupation of Albania and the concentration of Italian troops on Rhodes and other islands of the Dodecanese. The correspondent also stated that the responsible authorities in London believe that if Greece is attacked, Britain will provide assistance. The final decision on this point may be made at a future 　内　conference.

[Associated Press, London, 9th] In view of the fact that the totalitarian country has a further attempt to invade the Balkans and may affect the British communication line with India and other territories, the British cabinet held a meeting yesterday afternoon, urged by the four ministers of the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Defense. A total of eleven people participated. It is heard that the four ministers of the British Navy, Army, Air Force, and Defense all advocate that Britain should immediately issue a public statement expressing that Britain is determined to fight for the sake of maintaining the independence of Greece and Turkey. This move must wait for Chamberlain to return and convene a Lingti cabinet meeting before a decision can be made. In view of the serious situation in Europe, Mr. Zhang has decided to suspend his vacation and 　 return to London early this morning. He is scheduled to consult with his cabinet colleagues on everything today. Today is Easter Sunday, and it is rare for the British cabinet to hold a meeting on this day.

The British Labour Party will ask for a convocation of Parliament after the Cabinet discusses the occupation of Albania by Italian troops and the movement of German troops.

### British Cabinet Discussion: Dealing with the European Situation

[Reuters, London, 8th] Cabinet ministers convened at 10 Downing Street this morning to discuss the situation arising from Italy's invasion of Albania. Prime Minister Chamberlain was absent, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon acting as chairman. Foreign Secretary Halifax and the various defense ministers were in attendance. Halifax first reported on all developments within Albania over the past 24 hours. During the discussions, opposition leader Attlee personally went to Downing Street, requesting the reconvening of the House of Commons to discuss the Albanian invasion. The Liberal opposition also telegraphed Chamberlain, making the same request.

[Haitong Press, London, 8th] Following the conclusion of the British cabinet meeting, a public statement was issued, roughly stating, "While some information has been received, the complete truth of the situation remains unclear. The government remains in the dark and uninformed on numerous issues." Ministers will temporarily remain in or near the capital, but the date of the next cabinet meeting has not yet been decided. Chamberlain will decide whether to convene Parliament, but the Prime Minister has not yet considered the opposition's requests.

[Haitong Press, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Albanian Ambassador to Britain last night. Also present were the French Ambassador and the leader of the British opposition, Attlee. The purpose of the Foreign Secretary's discussion with Attlee was the immediate reconvening of Parliament.

### Britain to Guarantee Greece's Security

[Reuters, London, 9th] Diplomatic correspondents for Sunday newspapers claim that the cabinet must decide on Sunday whether to guarantee Greece against unwarranted aggression. One report claims that if Britain guarantees Greece, it may occupy Corfu as a demonstration of Greece's "trust" in Britain.

[Haitong Press, London, 9th] According to reliable sources, the British government intends to announce a guarantee of Greek independence and sovereignty within days. The Greek Ambassador to Britain notified the British government of Greece's desire for this guarantee at the initial stage of the Albanian crisis. According to well-informed British sources, Chamberlain's sudden end to his vacation and return to London was the result of Saturday's meetings. It is said that the Foreign Secretary and Defense Minister both believed that since Italy had invaded Albania, Britain needed to guarantee Greece and request Chamberlain's immediate return to London. The cabinet will meet tomorrow, and a guarantee of Greek security may be announced after the meeting, while Parliament will convene on Tuesday. According to well-informed sources, the rumours circulating that the British Navy had occupied the Greek island of Corfu are unfounded, and the British government never had such a plan. Initially, there were concerns that the Italian Navy might take such action, but the government believes that a British guarantee of Greece would be sufficient to prevent such an Italian move.

### America Expresses Indignation, Condemns Italy's Actions, Considers an Arms Embargo

[Central News Agency, Hot Springs, 9th] Hull's statement condemning Italy has been endorsed by President Roosevelt. Hull has also stated that the US government is considering implementing an arms embargo against Italy in accordance with the provisions of neutrality laws. However, official discussions are still ongoing.

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] US Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today condemning Italy's armed occupation of Albania.

### Roosevelt and Hull Unanimously Condemn Italy's Brutality

[Associated Press, Washington, Today] President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull strongly condemned Italy's invasion of Albania, stating that it threatened world peace. The content of the American condemnation of Italy's invasion of Albania is roughly as follows: "The armed occupation of Albania undoubtedly threatens world peace. We would be short-sighted if we did not pay attention to this new development. Any action that threatens world peace will impact and run counter to the will of mankind, as all governments want to lead their people into a peaceful and happy environment and away from the evils of war. The unfortunate and unavoidable negative impact of this event is self-evident, but if such unfortunate events continue to occur, human confidence will be shattered, economic stability will be affected, and the happiness of all nations will be struck."

When asked if the US considered Italy's invasion of Albania a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Hull avoided giving a direct answer. However, Hull's attitude and the implications of his words implied this.

In responding to inquiries from various parties, Hull placed particular emphasis on the phrase "use of force to invade" in the statement condemning Italy.

### Soviet Union's Attitude: Fleet Sails to the Mediterranean, Righteously Condemning Italy

[Haitong Press, Paris, 9th] A French news agency reported this morning that four Soviet torpedo boats passed through the Bosphorus Strait last night and entered the Mediterranean. Their destination and purpose are unknown.

[London, 9th] A report from Istanbul states that four Soviet destroyers sailed through the Bosphorus Strait yesterday afternoon and entered the Mediterranean.

Meanwhile, news from Paris reports that four Soviet destroyers have sailed through the Dardanelles Strait and entered the Eastern Mediterranean. This action is said to have been permitted by the Turkish authorities because three Italian fleets have recently arrived near the Italian Dodecanese Islands near Turkey.

Soviet Commentary

[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The Soviet government newspaper, Izvestia, published an article criticizing Italy's invasion of Albania, stating, "Leaders of the Rome-Berlin Axis are alarmed by the active British diplomacy that specifically lobbied Yugoslavia to prevent its participation in international guarantees. The Albanian incident shows that if attempts to prevent aggression are limited to a specific area, aggressive warfare will break out elsewhere. Establishing genuine collective security based on the principle of the indivisibility of peace is the only way to deter aggressors. Otherwise, all other actions are merely window dressing and insufficient to establish security between nations."

### East Prussia/Poland Border: Heavy German Troop Movements; Rumors of an Attack on Poland Within the Week; Beck Returns Home via Berlin

[Associated Press, Berlin, 9th] According to reliable sources, there is "small-scale" German military activity in East Prussia. The strength of the garrison on the Polish border is also being increased. It is generally believed that a large military force would be needed for Germany to invade Poland, but there is no evidence of a large concentration of German troops at this time.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Military officials here believe that Germany will soon invade Danzig and the Polish Corridor. They believe that the invasion may begin before April 15, so the crisis of a European war is imminent. They believe that German forces will invade Danzig and Poland as a matter of time. Germany is also very likely to occupy part or all of Silesia at the same time because Poland may resist the invasion of Danzig and the Corridor.

(Associated Press, Berlin, 8th) Beck returned to Warsaw via Berlin. His train was delayed by one hour and twenty minutes. No German dignitaries were at the station to welcome him. The conflict in Slovakia has ended.

### Hungarian Troops Enter Slovakia; Conflict Comes to an End

### US Authorities Prepare to Change Economic Policy; Rumors Roosevelt is Considering Various Measures to Address the Threat Posed to the US by Aggressors

[Central News Agency, Hot Springs, 8th] According to sources close to the President, the United States, in view of the endless aggression of certain countries, is increasingly feeling the need to change its economic policy; otherwise, the US will gradually lose its commerce and navigation rights throughout the world. To cope with the current situation, Roosevelt is currently considering the following measures: (1) Implementing a large-scale increase in taxes on imported goods to achieve American self-sufficiency; (2) Reducing the American standard of living to compete with totalitarian states; (3) Subsidizing US exports.

[Central News Agency, Hot Springs, USA, 8th] A key figure, who can generally represent the views of the White House, made a speech regarding the situation caused by the Albanian crisis. He stated, roughly, that the second phase of military aggression in Europe is affecting American security. Moreover, the aggressor nations are forcing the invaded nations to accept bartering, which is worsening world trade. The United States will also feel the effects. President Roosevelt, recognizing this, may choose one of the following three options:

(1) Build a "Great Wall" around the United States in terms of commerce and achieve economic self-sufficiency.

(2) Lower the domestic standard of living, reduce wages, and increase working hours to compete with countries that are promoting bartering, so that they can compete in the world commercial market.

(3) Subsidize the nation's export industry in a systematic way. In short, this stage of the international situation may impact the industrial, agricultural, and labor sectors of the United States. The government should clearly inform the nation so that everyone is aware.

### The Crisis of Hong Kong's Weaving Industry

Hong Kong's weaving industry has been developing rapidly in recent years, with its products mainly sold to British territories and raw materials mostly imported from China. However, it is currently facing two major crises. First, in terms of sales, because the UK is implementing revised preferential tariff rules and tariffs on cotton and rayon products, the amount of Hong Kong cotton cloth exported to the UK has greatly decreased this year. Second, there is the issue of raw materials. Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese factories have been using Bombay cotton yarn. However, recently, this industry has been booming, and the supply of Bombay cotton yarn cannot meet the demand, leading to rising prices. After Shanghai fell, the source of domestically produced cotton yarn was cut off, so the amount of imported domestic cotton yarn has increased sharply again.

The first problem affects not only weaving operators, but also the loss of jobs for dozens of workers. In fact, since the outbreak of the war, the need for uniforms for our soldiers and medicinal cotton cloth has increased sharply, and will certainly continue to increase in the future. If this industry can do its best, plan for the future of the motherland and its people, it seems that it should immediately consider developing the domestic weaving industry and then producing for the current needs of the motherland. But this will involve the issue of raw materials. In fact, the southwestern provinces of our country have many places suitable for growing cotton, and the recent international situation is increasingly favorable to us. China, Britain and France are cooperating closely, and it would be extremely convenient to set up yarn spinning factories in the southwest. Although the above sounds as if it cannot be helped immediately, it is indeed a fundamental plan. We hope that patriotic manufacturers will think deeply, and that all of you who will be attending the production meeting will have a plan.

In addition, Hong Kong has no shortage of specialized weaving talent, and there are many displaced people in the war zone. At a time when the country is in dire need of people, the relevant government agencies should have appropriate measures to enable them to serve the country. This type of talent should also be encouraged to fight for the country and find ways to return to the country and contribute.

### Various Small European Countries (Greece, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia) are Prepared to Deal with Extraordinary Events

[Central News Agency, Athens, 9th] The Greek government is closely monitoring developments in Albania. The Greek Navy is ready to deal with any extraordinary events. However, there are no signs of troop concentrations, and the authorities have not mobilized." (Reuters, London, 8th) Following Italy's armed annexation of Albania, Switzerland, Greece, and Yugoslavia followed the Netherlands in ordering partial mobilization. Switzerland and Greece's mobilization is larger, while Yugoslavia is taking a more cautious approach, calling up some technical specialists. The Netherlands does not consider the international situation caused by Italy's annexation of Albania to be too serious but is focusing on strengthening its coastal and border defenses. Some reservists have received orders to be ready to be called up.

[Reuters, The Hague, 8th] Since Italy's invasion of Albania, the Dutch government has recognized that the international situation is not very peaceful. They are now seeking to protect the coast and border areas. A small number of reservists have received readiness orders.

[Reuters, Rome, 9th] The Italian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, representing Mussolini, expressed satisfaction with Yugoslavia's attitude towards the Italo-Albanian conflict.

### Hong Kong Authorities Intensify Air Defense Training; Blackout Drill to be Held Again at the End of the Month; Will Make Full Use of Designated Air Raid Shelters in Each District; Assign Responsible Persons to Train and Instruct People on Evacuation Routes

The British government has intensified military preparations for its overseas territories in recent years. The increase in Hong Kong's annual military expenditure, the increase in the number of volunteers, the strengthening of defense fortifications, and the expansion of the air force all prove that the Hong Kong authorities have made sufficient preparations for wartime. Furthermore, due to Hong Kong's dense population and closely packed buildings, which would be easy targets for air raids, resulting in astonishing losses of life and property, the authorities established the Air Defense Committee years ago, appointing Mr. Spear as the commissioner responsible for planning various air defense matters. The progress of the work has gradually improved. The Air Defense Committee believes that in order for air defense work to be effective, it must have the cooperation of the community. Therefore, in recent years, it has been doing its best to impart air defense knowledge and establish air defense training classes to train air defense instructors. Blackout drills have been held several times, but the results have not been deemed satisfactory because the general public does not have a correct understanding of the importance of thorough cooperation with the air defense authorities. The alarm broadcast machines have proven to be insufficient in distribution after several blackout drills. Six new machines have been purchased from the UK and placed in central locations. The air defense authorities have decided to hold another blackout drill at the end of this month. The nature of this blackout drill, whether it will be an emergency or a gradual one, has not yet been decided. In the central district of Hong Kong, alarm broadcast machines have been installed on the roofs of the Gloucester Building and the Sheung Wan Market. In addition to the alarms broadcast by the alarm machines, alarm messages will also be rebroadcast by the broadcasting station. The air defense authorities express their hope that the community will cooperate so that this blackout drill can achieve satisfactory results as a reference. As for the commercial sector's views on blackout drills, they believe that the previous drills were held too early, affecting business and causing losses in revenue. They hope that the authorities will understand the difficulties of businesses and decide to start the drill after 9:00 PM, so as not to cause losses to business, and if the timing is chosen appropriately, there may be good results. According to an investigation by reporters, the locations of air raid shelters in various districts have been selected. This blackout drill should make full use of the designated air raid shelters. The responsible personnel should direct pedestrians on the road to evacuate according to the indicated locations, so that residents can have orderly training in avoiding bombs, so as not to be at a loss when something happens, which will be of great help to the air defense command personnel.

### Rampant Pirates: British Territory "Black Point" Waters - Six Pirates Rob Cargo Boat, Seizing Over 300 Cans of Kerosene, Along with Piece Goods, Salted Fish, Batteries, etc.

Recently, piracy and banditry have been rampant, causing trouble for travelers without any signs of abating. Yesterday, another cargo boat was robbed by six pirates in the waters near Black Point in British territory. The losses were quite significant. According to the boat owner, who only returned to port yesterday to report the incident to the Ping Shan Police Station in the New Territories, his boat, numbered T-136H, was hired by a client on the 8th of this month. At 2 PM that afternoon, fully loaded with goods, it set sail from Castle Peak, Tuen Mun towards Wan Keng Sha. Unexpectedly, when sailing back to the Black Point waters in British territory, a small boat suddenly approached head-on. The boat had about six pirates, all armed with guns of various lengths. As the pirate boat approached, four pirates swarmed onto Zheng's boat. The pirates first threatened everyone, then tied up the five people on board one by one with thin ropes, pushing them into the hold. Then they began searching and looting separately for about two hours. Later, a large boat approached head-on, and the victims initially thought it was a rescue, but it turned out to be another group of pirates. The pirates transferred all the items from the boat to the large cargo boat and sailed away towards the Chinese territory. The looted items included 387 cans of kerosene, 23 bolts of piece goods, 25 catties of salted fish, and six dozen batteries, among other things. After receiving the report, the police station filed the case, temporarily detaining Zheng and others for investigation.

### Firewood Merchants Seize Opportunity to Manipulate Prices, Firewood Prices Suddenly Soar Again; Firewood from Guangzhouwan and Other Sources Continues to Arrive in Hong Kong; Jiangmen War Has Little Impact

The firewood shortage in Hong Kong has been gradually resolved in the past month due to the continuous arrival of firewood from various places. Recently, more than ten ships travel between Haikou and Guangzhouwan, each bringing large quantities of firewood. At the same time, seven or eight ships sailing between Chaozhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other ports also bring firewood, with almost every ship carrying it. Firewood also arrives continuously from Singapore. Moreover, before the war in Jiangmen, Macao supplied no less than a thousand piculs of firewood daily. Unexpectedly, firewood prices have suddenly risen again in recent days. According to reporters' investigations, this is due to firewood merchants seizing the opportunity presented by the Jiangmen war to manipulate prices. Yesterday morning, a certain ship from Guangzhouwan brought a large quantity of firewood, mooring at the coast. The retail price was 74 catties per dollar.

### Bombay Cotton Yarn Prices Soar, Hong Kong Cotton Textile Costs Greatly Affected; British Territories Sales Retreat, Spring Orders Decrease by Two-Thirds; Small Manufacturers Seek Other Markets, Many Turn to Purchasing Foreign Yarn

The cotton fabric weaving industry in Hong Kong has flourished like bamboo shoots after rain, and its sales market is mainly in British territories. In the past, due to the absence of war between China and Japan and the unchanged British preferential tariffs, manufacturers often used foreign cotton yarn to reduce costs. At that time, the British preferential tariff regulations stipulated that any product, regardless of its origin, that added British territory raw materials or labor value of 25% of the original value could enjoy preferential tariffs. However, since July 1937, after the British revised the preferential tariff regulations and implemented cotton and rayon textile tariffs, it was stipulated that only cotton products whose raw materials and labor were entirely from British territory could enjoy British preferential tariff benefits.

To prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage, strict measures were taken to prevent the mixing of other countries' raw materials to impersonate British territory products. It was stipulated that the cotton yarn used must be clearly verified by government-approved auditors to prove that it was indeed British yarn before the Hong Kong import and export department could issue preferential tariff certificates. Therefore, in order to enjoy this preferential tariff benefit, manufacturers have switched to using British raw materials. For fabrics not destined for sale in British territories, which do not have the right to enjoy preferential tariffs, many still use Shanghai cotton yarn and foreign cotton yarn. As a result, there was a temporary situation of demand exceeding supply in British India, and prices also rose sharply, significantly impacting fabric costs. According to cotton fabric manufacturers, the quantity of Hong Kong cotton fabric exported to British territories last year has greatly decreased compared to the past. Traditionally, a large number of spring orders are placed in the spring season, but this year's orders are only between 20% and 30% compared to the same period last year. Among them, a few larger manufacturers have retail departments in Hong Kong. Recently, patriotic people are known to promote domestic goods, so although exports have sharply decreased, retail sales can still support them. As for other smaller manufacturers, due to decreased demand in British territories, they have had to seek other markets. However, other markets, not being British territories, do not have the protection of preferential tariff regulations. If they use more expensive cotton yarn, their costs will increase accordingly, and higher prices will inevitably discourage orders. Therefore, they have had to turn to using cheaper yarn. However, since the fall of Shanghai, our country's yarn supply has been cut off, and the only cotton yarn cheaper than Bombay yarn is foreign cotton yarn. Judging from recent import statistics from the export department, the quantity of foreign yarn arriving in Hong Kong has recently increased.

### Italian Ship "Roma" Sailing to Hong Kong and Macao Today; Only Carrying Cargo, Temporarily Not Carrying Passengers; May Change to Sailing Between "Guangdong" and Macao in the Future

Due to the disrupted route between Guangzhou and Hong Kong due to the war in South China, shipping between Hong Kong and Macao has become increasingly developed. Recently, the Italian merchant ship "Roma" has joined as the only Italian ship sailing to South China ports. It is scheduled to sail to Macao this afternoon for its first voyage. The ship has a capacity of 146 tons and a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour. It was completed in Shanghai five years ago and later sailed on the Xiamen-Zhangzhou route. After Xiamen fell, it changed to sailing between Hong Kong and Shantou. After a typhoon in September of the year before last, the ship's owner, Fanesdor, sold it in Hong Kong. After the change of ownership, the current owner is Miltalen. The ship has a Chinese crew of 15, including the captain and mechanical engineer. Its passenger capacity is set at 300, but passenger passports have not yet been obtained. Currently, it can only carry cargo. In the short term, the ship may sail between Guangdong and Macao. This can be implemented once negotiations are completed with the Macao authorities and Chinese military authorities.

A Speech Enthusiastically Endorsed by the Entire Audience

General Lin Shu is a brave active-duty soldier. He was already a strong soldier when the 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he fought in the Fifth War Zone, facing death and danger in the hail of bullets, and his achievements were particularly outstanding. Later, he was injured in battle and returned to Guangxi for treatment. After recovering slightly, he was appointed as the commander of the First Regiment of the Guangxi Student Army, responsible for training the student army. Recently, he was ordered by the authorities to accompany the China National Salvation Drama Troupe to foreign countries to comfort overseas Chinese. When he arrived in Hong Kong, he was warmly welcomed by various groups here, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, at a welcome meeting by patriotic overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, his rebuttal of Wang Jingwei's "Give an Example," was particularly pertinent and insightful. The entire audience, tightly packed, applauded enthusiastically, praising him as the soul of the new China, speaking for the descendants of the Chinese nation who are unwilling to be slaves of a fallen country. After the meeting, many friends urged the reporter to publish General Lin's speech in order to deepen the understanding of those with "nearsightedness" and not be misled by the sinister schemes of foreign and traitorous elements. Here, the reporter is pleased to report Mr. Lin's speech to our beloved overseas Chinese as follows. First, Mr. Lin said:

Today, I originally wanted to talk to you about military matters. However, because I have seen Wang Jingwei's several essays published in the Japanese newspaper these days, I cannot suppress the agitation in the emotions of a soldier. Therefore, I will first talk about Wang's "Give an Example," raising a few points to question it, to see how ridiculous Wang's proposition is.

First, in that article, Wang Jingwei begins by lamenting the death of Zeng Zhongming, saying that Zeng died for national affairs. When he was dying, he still said that with Mr. Wang taking care of national affairs and his wife taking care of family matters, he had nothing to worry about. It seems that Zeng still cared about national affairs even when he was dying. But I ask: Did Zeng's death really die for national affairs? Since the Anti-Japanese War, hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers, in order to complete the task of defending the country, have fought bravely under any difficult circumstances and made heroic sacrifices. Millions of compatriots have suffered from the trampling and destruction of the Japanese, displaced and died. Has Wang not seen these spirits and deeds of regarding death as home and enduring pain to sacrifice? And Zeng Zhongming, who has received the cultivation of the country, did not think of doing his best to repay the central government at this time of national hardship, but fled to live abroad. [redacted - slanderous statements about Wang Jingwei and Zeng Zhongming]... Yet Wang shamelessly said that he died for national affairs. Then I ask, what are the sacrifices of these thousands of soldiers and civilians for? And what did they die for? Therefore, Wang's words should be changed to "Zeng Zhongming died for the affairs of the Japanese!" Zeng Zhongming's words should be, "I serve the Japanese!" to conform to the facts.

A burst of laughter hating the Japanese broke through the solemn atmosphere. Afterwards, everyone quietly listened to Mr. Lin saying:

Second, Wang said: Since I published the Yan telegram, the people of the country have focused on peace, and it is my proposition. In fact, the proposal for peace was decided after a joint discussion by the highest organs. So he cited the record of the Supreme National Defense Conference held at the Central Bank in Hankou on December 6, 1937, as an example. But upon closer inspection, the chairman of the meeting was Wang Jingwei, and the secretary was precisely Zeng Zhongming. This document, prepared by them single-handedly, is now being released by them, and there are many suspicious points in it. And if Wang Jingwei's example is true, then it is nothing more than Wang's own confession of deceiving comrades and surrendering to the Japanese while he was chairman and Zeng was taking notes. The article also mentions that when Chairman Chiang met with German Ambassador Trautmann, he said: "In the midst of such an urgent war, it is impossible to mediate and negotiate. I hope Germany will notify Japan to stop the war first." This is the Chairman's conversation with a third-country envoy, and it clearly shows the Chairman's determination to firmly resist the Japanese until they withdraw from Chinese territory and not allow peace negotiations. With such a firm statement, how can Wang say that "peace" is a jointly discussed and decided proposition? Where did this come from? This is Wang's self-contradiction, slapping himself in the face. And when Trautmann went to Nanjing to see the Chairman, Wang said that he had first reported to the Chairman through him. If "peace" is to be discussed jointly by the highest organs, why did Wang need to be so impatient? And why is Wang always involved in matters of peace? What is this blood relationship?

Wang also said that he could not publish the Yan telegram if he did not leave Chongqing, which is even more absurd. Is there any reason why one cannot express a proposition decided after joint discussion by the highest organs in one's own country? And Wang said that "there are thousands of evidences for peace." According to him, the central government has many people who advocate peace. If there are so many comrades, they can discuss it jointly in the country. Why did he have to flee abroad to spout nonsense? And when Zeng Zhongming was dying, he only entrusted the responsibility of advocating peace to Wang Jingwei alone? Why does Wang Jingwei himself say: "There are those who agree with me on national affairs," but not mention that there is anyone else in the central government? - Mr. Lin became more and more indignant as he spoke, and the listeners were more and more moved.

Third, Wang agreed with Konoe's statement, believing that it could serve as the basis for negotiations. Now let's examine the content of Konoe's statement! What Konoe said can be roughly divided into four points: (1) No territorial demands on China and respect for Chinese sovereignty; (2) Combination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, economic cooperation; (3) Joint anti-communism, stationing troops in Inner Mongolia; (4) Allowing Japanese troops to be stationed and live freely in inland China. Are these not the conditions for the fall of the country? Since there are no territorial demands, why mention the combination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo? Are the four northeastern provinces not Chinese territory? Did Wang Jingwei actually agree to this? Since Chinese sovereignty is respected, why can troops be stationed in the interior? Does this not constitute a destruction of the unification of China's administrative sovereignty? Did Wang Jingwei actually acknowledge this? Since troops are stationed in Inner Mongolia, why did Wang Jingwei's Yan telegram say that it would not affect Sino-Soviet relations? Is this treating the Chinese people as three-foot children? These contradictions that even Konoe himself cannot explain, Wang Jingwei insists on covering up, is this not evidence of collusion with the Japanese? - A second round of warm applause.

Fourth, Wang put forward two reasons for advocating peace: (1) When Trautmann was mediating, Nanjing had not yet fallen. Now, after Nanjing, even important cities such as Xuzhou, Jinan, Kaifeng, Anqing, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Wuhan have been lost. The situation has deteriorated a hundredfold. Why was peace possible then, but not now? (2) When Trautmann was mediating, the terms proposed by the Japanese were even more harsh than Konoe's statement. Why could it be used as a basis for negotiations then, but not now? This is another fallacy. Regardless of whether the Trautmann mediation case is true or not, let's assume it is; even if we take a step back and say it is true, it should be understood that it was a matter of years ago. Since the time is different, we have already made leaps and bounds in strategy and tactics, reaching the stage where we can defeat and eliminate the Japanese. This is the first change. Although we have lost many important cities, the overall strategy does not lie in the contention of points and lines, but in the occupation of area. Now, in the occupied areas, in addition to being able to control some transportation lines, the rest of the place, China's regime, still exists, and the government's laws are still communicated. Moreover, in addition to the strong regular army stopping the Japanese from advancing on the front, there are also a large number of field armies and vast guerrillas active behind them. This is the application of the overall strategy, which is also the guarantee of military victory. Wang Jingwei, as a senior national official, does he not understand the country's strategy and tactics, and can he not see any signs of brilliance? He deliberately spreads these absurd defeatist arguments, in fact, to eliminate the will of the people to resist the war and help the Japanese in their attack on us! - The listeners expressed infinite regret for Wang Jingwei's incomplete "cleverness!"

Mr. Lin continued: Japan has always had two policies. In addition to the continental policy that everyone already knows, its maritime policy is based on the United States and Britain as imaginary enemies. It has also laid out three lines of defense at sea. If the second and third lines of defense cannot be defended one day, it is prepared to retreat to the third line of defense. Where is the third line of defense? It is in our four northeastern provinces. Therefore, whether it is the continental policy or the maritime policy, the four northeastern provinces are Japan's lifeline. Wang Jingwei is a senior official with heavy responsibility. How could he not know the Japanese military plan, but still agree to Konoe's statement, considering the puppet Manchukuo as a legitimate organization and recognizing its existence? Is this planning for the Japanese? Or is it so confused that he is unaware of human affairs?

Fifth, from this, we know that there is a problem with Wang's personality. [redacted - accusatory questions about Wang Jingwei's character] How could he have the heart to say these words? We know that during the Anti-Japanese War, how many strong men who enlisted in the war had parents who died or were ill at home and wanted to go back to see them, but had no time; how many women serving in the war zone had children who died or were ill at home and wanted to go back to see them, but had no time; many officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines missed their elderly parents and wanted to write a letter to comfort them, but had no time. Why did this happen? In order to strive for the survival of the country, in order to strive for the liberation of the nation, this is such a moving thing - now Wang actually says in "Give an Example" that as long as my proposition is adopted, personal matters are not a problem: what does this mean! Of course, if the proposition of peace is adopted, he must be invited to come out. At that time, Wang can take the stage to become a high official. But what if the central government does not adopt his proposition? Then he continues to say that if the situation continues to be deadlocked, even if I leave the country, I will come back, to where, Nanjing, Beiping, Guangzhou, that is where he is going, his personal problems are solved in that way.

What is particularly infuriating is that [redacted - condemnatory statement regarding Wang Jingwei's attitude towards soldiers] This is an insult to the entire Chinese military. I believe that Wang would not dare to say this to the Chinese soldiers, and the people of China will definitely be enraged to sanction it." [redacted - further condemnation of Wang Jingwei]

I am very angry today, and I have expressed my feelings directly. I hope everyone will pay attention to this issue and expose the true face behind this conspiracy.

- A warm and prolonged applause ended the generous presentation of the soul of a soldier of the new China, and everyone stepped forward to shake hands with Mr. Lin to pay tribute.

### Police Detectives Maintain Public Order - Mass Arrests of Thugs in Kowloon Peninsula - Special Attention to Triad and Other Lower-Level Figures - Over Twenty People Arrested in Recent Days, Under Strict Investigation

Recently, incidents of robbery and looting have occurred frequently in various parts of the Kowloon Peninsula, greatly affecting the protection of the lives and property of ordinary residents. The authorities have decided to take various effective steps and strictly order police detectives in each district to carry out the suppression of thugs. After receiving the order, police detectives in each district immediately began investigating opium dens, gambling houses, and lower-level places such as buildings and boats, hoping to arrest those who are hiding among them and committing evil deeds, and to deport them from the country if necessary. Special attention is paid to the so-called "Triad" and other lower-level figures, because [they] have always been the main perpetrators in robbery and kidnapping cases, colluding with each other to commit various illegal activities. In the purification of undesirable elements, the Triad figures cannot be ignored in the slightest. It is estimated that in recent days, police detectives in the Kowloon Peninsula have begun a major roundup of Triad figures. A certain Feng, a well-known leader, was arrested in Yau Ma Tei yesterday and detained for strict investigation. Two or thirty other unemployed vagrants belonging to this category have been arrested before and after, all of whom are detained for investigation. Those who do not have any evidence to prove that they are law-abiding residents will be deported from the country by the police in accordance with emergency ordinances. In recent years, new buildings have been added in Kowloon City, the population has suddenly become dense, and the activities of Triad figures in the area have become increasingly rampant. The secret societies of the major Triads have almost all moved to Kowloon City. The police detectives have also been ordered to pay special attention.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I was deeply surprised to read the article "Hong Kong Government's Wenchang Association Prepares to Perform 'Phoenix City' to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief" in the Hong Kong news section of the Qing Bao on the fourth of this month. The association's disaster relief is already being handled by the Charity Department. The drama group's drama practice is a pastime for colleagues in their spare time and has not been used to raise funds through performances. I am deeply afraid that this will confuse the audience, so I have sent this letter to sell, hoping that you will correct it. Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Lu Guoxiong, Director of Hong Kong Government Reporters' Association

Respectfully,

This Newspaper's Special Feature

### Let Us Enthusiastically Join Hands in Work

— Huo Xi

Drama Workers' Congress Sees United Welcome from Hong Kong and Kowloon Drama Troupes to the China Salvation Drama Troupe

The China Salvation Drama Troupe is like a spark—a spring breeze—the wind of the times—blowing it to any place, and that place immediately bursts into flames. It is also like a new seedling, sown in any place, and that place immediately sprouts and grows with new life. These young partners are indeed lovely and admirable, and the times that nurtured their growth are also great enough to be celebrated. The China Salvation Drama Troupe, carrying a strong scent of gunpowder, came from the front lines to comfort overseas compatriots, and their arrival in Hong Kong was warmly welcomed by various local groups, which was deeply moving. Although this newspaper has already published several special articles reporting on it, the wave of welcome continues to rise, and each welcome meeting has its own wonderful highlights. Therefore, we report, continue to report, and report again. We believe that this is also a meaningful, necessary, and important matter that should be strengthened. Because Hong Kong's "spring" is too suffocating, and breaking the suffocating atmosphere is a life-saving request!

Yesterday, patriotic overseas compatriots in Hong Kong held two grand welcome meetings. At 9:30 a.m., the Amateur Fraternity Society held a welcome at their society. The fourth floor, although not small, was tightly packed with a large group of young working people who were overseas but had their hearts in the country. Many people were forced to climb onto nearby tables and stools to watch, just so they wouldn't miss this opportunity to absorb spiritual nourishment and strengthen their understanding.

The most enthusiastic and moving was the joint welcome meeting initiated by the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association and various youth drama troupes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It was held at 7 p.m. last night in the grand auditorium of South China Middle School in Kowloon. Attendees included representatives from the Red and White Drama Troupe, Lu Feng Drama Society, Iron Current Drama Troupe, New Voice Drama Society, Whirlwind Drama Society, Tough Door Drama Troupe, China Drama Society, Youth Troupe, Vanguard Children's Drama Troupe, Fourth Women's Federation Training Class, Youth Amusement Society, Learning Virtue and Aspiration Society, Red and Blue Drama Troupe, Ding Chou Drama Troupe, Ant Children's Drama Troupe, Angry Wave Drama Troupe, Guang Da Drama Society, Self-Improvement Sports Society, and other drama troupes, totaling more than 200 people, all of whom are workers dedicated to the drama movement. This was truly an unprecedented and most meaningful gathering of drama workers.

All members of the China Salvation Drama Troupe attended. Upon their arrival, more than 200 drama workers stood up and warmly applauded their welcome. After taking their seats, Mr. Wei Baishui first delivered a welcome speech, followed by Mr. Lu Fu, who gave a brief introduction to the troupe's past work, kicking off the prelude to friendship and discussion.

Amid a burst of enthusiastic applause, the head of the troupe, Mr. Jin Shan, stood up and reported in detail on their experiences and valuable lessons learned in the salvation drama movement over the past year. "The future of China's emerging drama, and its brilliant future, is entirely entrusted to the thousands upon thousands of young people who are struggling hard on the front lines and in the war zones." As he spoke, it was as if he was digging out his heart and speaking his innermost thoughts. He was too excited, and everyone was deeply moved by him.

Next, he put forward several of the most valuable suggestions and hopes to the drama comrades in Hong Kong… (1) Have a high degree of enthusiasm, (2) Have a correct political understanding, (3) Life should be serious and popular, (4) The content of the drama should be relevant to reality, (5) Drama workers should unite greatly.

Ms. Wang Ying, the deputy head of the troupe, reported on the troupe's service experience. The most impressive thing was: "Some people say that we are educating soldiers and awakening the masses, and that our contribution is great. In fact, it is the soldiers and the masses who awaken us and educate us. We see the positive side of China, thoroughly recognize the greatness of China, and the unlimited hope for the future. We realize that the life of a movie star and the life of a university student are not something that can be followed, and must be abandoned. Therefore, we work and learn, not only do we not think it is hard, but we deeply celebrate this happiness, this is true progress. This kind of progress cannot be obtained in university or studying abroad."

Mr. Lin Fu reported on many current situations of the War of Resistance that are not usually heard, which made our belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance even more determined. Next, the old educator Fang Yuyan and the troupe's young soldier Fan Zheng both gave moving speeches, which was truly a practice of all-out resistance, with no distinction between men, women, old, and young. The unity of Mandarin, Cantonese, and various local dialects in one hall was also a symbol of no distinction between north, south, east, and west. Finally, everyone freely expressed their opinions on the salvation drama movement, sparking a lively discussion, with talking and laughing, as well as tea and snacks, tense but also lively and harmonious. It was not until around 11 p.m. that everyone reluctantly said goodbye, agreeing to meet again in their work. (Note: Due to the time of publication, the discussion on the salvation drama movement could not be recorded in detail. Please refer to the next issue of this newspaper's film and drama weekly.)

### After the Launch of the Guangdong General Counter-Offensive, the Southern Route Follows the Northern Route in a Major Expansion; Our Army Achieves a Great Victory at Jiangcun, with the Vanguard Gradually Approaching the Suburbs; Intensified Defenses Along the Liuhua Bridge Area in the Northwest Suburbs; Thousands of People in Northern Huaxian Are Caught in a Fierce Struggle

[Northern Guangdong Express News] Since our Guangdong Provincial Army launched a full-scale general counter-offensive on the 6th, it has adopted a lightning-fast approach, with all routes launching a full-scale attack on the enemy, achieving a huge victory unseen in the past half year. The progress of the northern route is particularly astonishing. Since successively recovering important strongholds such as Xinzhi and Shijiao, it continued to advance south on the 7th and 8th, directly approaching Guangzhou along the railway and highway. In order to preserve Guangdong, the enemy intends to transfer remnants from various lines to reinforce northern Guangdong in an attempt to make a final stand. Now, our various armies are advancing simultaneously, and the overall situation in Guangdong is showing signs of wavering, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The following is a record of the military situation on the northern route in the past two days.

Our Army Overruns Jiangcun and Heads Straight for Guangzhou

On the southern section of the Ao Route, the front lines of our army, after recovering Xin'jie on the 6th, had their vanguard unit rush into Jiangcun on the evening of the 6th, killing many enemies. Later, as the enemy's fresh troops rushed to the scene, they retreated and held the high ground north of Jiangcun. On the morning of the 7th, our army continued to arrive at the Guo'tang and Shilong areas from Xin'jie, and launched a fierce attack on Jiangcun with dense fire. More than a thousand enemies who had gathered in Jiangcun stubbornly resisted with fortifications. Jiangcun is an important stronghold on the outskirts of Guangzhou, and is a place that our army and the enemy must fight for. Therefore, both armies fought with all their strength, and the battle was extremely fierce. Our army repeatedly charged, and the enemy could not hold out and retreated into the market town to defend it. The stalemate lasted until dusk, with 200-300 enemies killed. Our vanguard has crossed Gaotang in Jiangcun and is heading towards Dalang, Xiaocun and other places. The enemy army retreated south along the railway, abandoning a large amount of military equipment and supplies. Our army pursued closely, and the vanguard was only a dozen miles away from Guangzhou on the 8th.

The Enemy Assembles Heavy Troops to Defend Shijing

Due to the rapid turn of events on the northern route, the Guangzhou enemy military authorities were panicked and sent urgent telegrams to various routes for assistance. Since the 6th, the enemy from Sanshui, Foshan, Jiujiang, Daliang, and Shilong have been transporting troops to Guangzhou in a hurry, which is rarely seen. After Xin'jie and Jiangcun fell into our hands one after another, the outer defense line of Guangzhou has been breached. The enemy is now preparing for internal line operations, intensifying the deployment of defenses in the Xicun, Guanghua Highway, and Liuhua Bridge area in the northwest suburbs of the city, and reinforcing heavy troops in the Shijing area, attempting to fight a decisive battle with our army here. On the 6th and 7th, about a thousand enemy soldiers were transferred from Guangzhou to Shijing, as well as heavy artillery and tanks. A large number of enemy grain and ammunition stored in Shijing were transported back to Guangzhou along the Guangdong-Han Railway. It seems that their intention is to abandon Shijing and retreat to the suburbs of the city if necessary. According to front-line intelligence, the enemy in Guangzhou has been reinforcing defenses in the suburbs in recent days, and has designated the areas near the suburbs as martial law zones, implementing emergency preparedness. From the 6th, within ten days, civilians are generally not allowed to enter or leave the Guanghua Highway area outside the northwest suburbs, otherwise they will be treated as leaking military secrets, designated as guerrillas, and killed without mercy.

Enemy General Killed in Action in the Battle of Shiqian

In addition, the enemy from Conghua gathered at Shengang and Taipingchang in order to contain our army's counter-offensive, and sent troops to raid the rear of our army in Huaxian on the 6th and 7th. On the 6th, the enemy from Shengang sent more than a thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery to cross the Yangcun River and assemble troops at Wangmu, advancing towards Shiqian City. They were intercepted by a certain unit of our 12th Army Group in the Maluo Mountain area on the border of Conghua, west of Shiqian, and launched a battle. Further investigation revealed that the battle lasted until dusk, and as a result, more than a hundred enemy officers and soldiers were killed, dozens of enemy soldiers were captured, and countless weapons were seized. The enemy commander of the battle, Major Zuo Mohe (battalion commander), was also killed on the front line. The remaining enemy has collapsed and retreated in a panic. The enemy force that attacked Jiulianfen was completely wiped out by our army on the afternoon of the 6th.

Enemy Army in Huaxian Makes a Last-Ditch Stand

The enemy in Huaxian, due to the loss of Xin'jie, Shijiao, and Yangcun to our army, has lost its footing and is being surrounded and annihilated by our army. After our Huaxian Kongshi captured Shijiao Market, the main force of the enemy army from Shengang and Taipingchang in Conghua lost contact with Xiangshan Huaxian. Our army cut off the southern section of the Guangdong-Han Railway, and the enemy's rear is under great threat. However, there are still three to four thousand enemies stationed in the northern part of Huaxian, under our encirclement and control. Therefore, in the past two days, the enemy has been forced to make a last-ditch stand, constantly attacking our army in an attempt to break through our encirclement line. On the 6th, the remnants of the enemy who fled from Shidongwei in Huaxian to Huangdong joined forces with more than a thousand enemies at Longkouzhuang on the 7th and launched a fierce attack on our army. A part of the enemy force, numbering more than five hundred, fled to Hengkeng in the north of Huaxian City, and another part of more than three hundred advanced to Chuangang in the west of the city. Our army met them head-on and launched a fierce tug-of-war. At night, our army bravely attacked the enemy, and the enemy's morale wavered, and they began to retreat along the original route to the south, suffering heavy casualties, abandoning many corpses on the Guanghua Highway. The enemy who fled to Xin'an and the east of the railway still occupied strongholds such as Nanbei of Xin'an, and reinforced more than a thousand troops in Caodong, Lao Huangmaokeng, and Luchuan Pit to build fortifications in an attempt to defend to the death. Our army is currently sweeping through the area.

### Our Army's Counter-Offensive Intensifies; Chaos in Guangzhou; Our Planes Attack Baiyun Airport; Traitors Killed, Feeling Uneasy

[Shamian Express News] Recently, our Guangdong Anti-Japanese War military has launched a large-scale counter-offensive, and victories have been reported successively in the east, west, and north of the Three Rivers. Guangzhou enemy chief Ando believes that our army's counter-offensive is unstoppable and should store up more difficulties. Recently, the enemy's troop movements have been very busy, and the order in Guangzhou city has become increasingly chaotic. The latest information from various aspects is summarized as follows.

Our Army's Counter-Offensive; Enemy Soldiers Anxious

Since our army began its counter-offensive, enemy chief Ando has been extremely anxious, and has been transferring enemy troops from various units to reinforce various lines. Recently, even the enemy soldiers in the city have been transferred, and only about two thousand are left to protect Guangzhou. He sent an urgent telegram to Taiwan for assistance, which is enough to prove the emptiness of the enemy in Guangdong.

Two Enemy Planes Shot Down by Our Forces

Our brave air force appears in the city's airspace twice a day, bombing the Tianhe and Baiyun airports, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy air force. Yesterday morning, the 5th, nine of our planes raided Guangzhou, and two enemy planes hastily took off to fight, but were surrounded by our planes and the pilots were wounded. They flew towards Yuanpu in dismay. As a result, our planes destroyed the Baiyun Airport machine depot, and scattered a large number of anti-aggression leaflets in the airspace of Guangdong, mobilizing the people.

Guangzhou Residents Flee Their Homes

The order in the city is extremely chaotic, and robberies occur several times a day. Most of the shops have closed their doors and suspended business, and on the people's side, due to our army's attack approaching Guangzhou, they are fleeing to Lizhi, Mazha, Hecun and other villages. The city is now very deserted, and it is expected that the city will be placed under strict martial law soon. Gambling dens and opium dens are mostly closed at night. Guangzhou has once again entered a state of war.

Assassination Groups Target Traitors

Our underground assassination groups in the city have become active, and have launched surprise attacks on enemy camps in Guangzhou from time to time, achieving considerable results, so that the enemy soldiers cannot sleep peacefully. Recently, an assassination group has been formed to deal specifically with shameless traitors, so traitors such as Lu Chunrong are extremely frightened, hiding in Meihuacun and Dongshan, and do not dare to go out. It is reported that the assassination group was organized by General Ye Ting and is extremely strict.

### Fierce Battle at Luofu Mountain; Enemy Attacks Lianhe Again, Repelled

(Dongjiang Express News) Our Eastern Route Army's counter-offensive military affairs, after the Chief General Qi Wei formulated its overall plan and actively deployed it, has made several contacts with the enemy's outposts in Zengcheng. The enemy again attempted to invade on the 7th of this month. The following is a report of the situation.

Fierce Battle Occurs at Luofu

At about 8 p.m. on the 7th, more than 700 enemy soldiers from Zengcheng attacked our Luofu Mountain in three routes, and 18 enemy planes provided cover, dropping more than 30 bombs. Our Liu Regiment of the XXX cooperated with the guerrilla teams and engaged the enemy, resulting in a fierce battle. The enemy was at a disadvantage in night battles and began to flee back to Zengcheng in a panic, suffering heavy casualties. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue, seizing a large number of military supplies.

Enemy Troops Invade Lianhe Again

At the same time in the morning, the enemy sent more than a hundred people with two small artillery guns, using enemy planes for cover, and invaded Lianhe from both Lizhizhuang and Botang, in an attempt to probe the strength of our various points. Our Wei Regiment of the XXX, stationed in Lianhe, Fuhe, Changning and other areas in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, and the various units of Yang Linjun under the 1st Guerrilla Detachment, joined forces to attack the enemy. The enemy was suddenly attacked by our army and retreated along the original route. In this battle, more than 20 enemies were killed.

Enemy Planes Harass Huibo

At five o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, an enemy plane flew low along the Bo-Zeng Highway to reconnoiter, circling over Boluo City, and dropped two bombs, one landing in Zijing Lane in the city, destroying two civilian houses, and the other landing in Baisui Fang, fortunately without casualties. Over Longmen, 14 enemy planes were found, flying along the Guang-Zeng Road and circling around Luofu Mountain for several weeks, before flying to Boluo and Huiyang for reconnaissance. In addition, two other enemy planes reconnoitered at the Xinzhutang Station along the Zengchuan Road, and then flew to Hukeng Township, dropping a bomb, injuring an old farmer and several livestock.

### Enemy Ambushed on Taiping Road; Recovery of Wancheng and Shilong Confirmed; Enemy Casualties Exceed 400, Retreating to Shitan to Defend

[Shenzhen Express News] The police station here confirmed the news of the recovery of Wancheng and Shilong. On the morning before yesterday, our Ou Regiment of Wu Qiwai's department and the 8th Security Regiment, in coordination with Luo Fengxiang's department, bombarded the enemy from step by step towards Shilong Wancheng, and the fierce battle lasted until 1 p.m. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties, and our army bravely charged. On the Shilong side, the enemy's formation wavered, and retreated to Shitan and Wancheng. Our Ou Department entered Shilong at 2 p.m. Wancheng felt that Shilong was lost and its flank was threatened, and under the fierce attack of our army, retreated towards Taiping at 1:15 p.m. Our teams were prepared early and waited for the retreat, launching a pincer attack. More than a hundred enemy soldiers were killed, and four machine guns and more than ten rifles were captured. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 400 casualties, and we also had heroic sacrifices. Yesterday, our army sent personnel to clear the streets and sent teams to sweep the enemy army in the suburbs of Wancheng, while implementing a security towards the enemy in Taiping. The enemy in Shiwu has crossed the river and retreated to Shitan to defend it, and has blown up the Shitan Bridge to prevent our advance.

### The False Chairman of Yanbu is Captured; Escorted to the Guerrilla Headquarters for Interrogation

[Nanhai Express News] Yanbu is located near the Lujian border in the ninth district of Nanhai County. It is the transportation center of the Guangdong-Foshan Road, with a prosperous population. Since the enemy invasion, a false maintenance committee has been established there, with a certain Huang and a certain Zhong serving as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, acting arbitrarily and causing great resentment among the villagers. At 5 a.m. on the 5th of this month, 300 guerrillas lurking in Lujian rushed into the market town, killing 13 false policemen on the spot and capturing several others. From the mouths of the false policemen, they learned that the false maintenance committee chairmen Zhong and Huang were hiding in the Fourth Security Division on Zhulin Street, and immediately sent teams to search and arrest them, capturing them, tying them up in front of the association's door for public display, and raising our Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth national flag, which fluttered in the wind for more than 30 hours. At 6 p.m. on the 6th, the enemy army stationed there heard the news and sent 300-400 enemy soldiers to reinforce. Our guerrillas fought with them for about an hour before calmly withdrawing. The two traitors Zhong and Huang and the 13 false policemen have been escorted to the First District Guerrilla Column Headquarters for interrogation.

### The Active Daughters of Gaoming

— Huang Peng

Holding Gaoming on the important military artery of the Xijiang River, the Gaoming Highway, makes it a crucial barrier for consolidating the upper reaches of the Xijiang River. If Gaoming were to fall, the enemy's "rapid units" would undoubtedly launch an even faster attack on Zhaoqing. In this area, in addition to deploying strong forces, we also have advantageous terrain, because clusters of mountains stretch through the upper reaches of Gaoming, posing a significant obstacle to mechanized troops. However, there is a kind of immeasurable potential that is enough to shock people, and that is the popular revolutionary fervor that the heroic youth of Gaoming have, for generations, nurtured among the vast peasantry. As the war of resistance broke out, this fervor in Gaoming did not wait for enemy soldiers to intrude and reap the consequences on their land. If anyone wants to praise the Guangdong spirit, the people of Gaoming can do so without the slightest shame. You know, batch after batch of hot-blooded young farmers from Gaoming County volunteered to go to the front lines, with the number already exceeding 260. This magnificent and heroic spirit proclaims the success of the work of the people's movement comrades, because in the ranks of the people's movement in Gaoming County, before September 18th, it was not just a single-sex male combination. In fact, the women's activities sometimes achieve outstanding results.

At that time, the Women's Anti-Japanese Comrades Association was the most critical activity of the daughters of Gaoming. In Gaoming County, with a population of less than 100,000, they had already recruited more than 20,000 members. Following the division of regions, three district comrades associations were established under the county comrades association. Among them, the three district comrades associations were the most active and had the most prominent working effects. There is a touching story: when they held a general meeting of members, one of the most characteristic staff members specialized in managing the members' hats. When rural women go to prosperous markets, wearing hats woven from bamboo strips is indispensable. Hats numbered 2, 3, etc., were neatly stacked in a spacious room, and disputes over priority never broke out at the moment of taking the hats.

No matter what kind of salvation work it is, they never fall behind, such as raising comfort goods, expanding production, military service, sanitation, buying bonds... they send cadres to cooperate, and the male members of the Youth Anti-Japanese Association spare no effort to run to various villages to launch surprise attacks, perform dramas, give speeches, put up slogans, and write wall newspapers, injecting all their strength into new tasks. In the solemn work, they cannot see the coyness of rural women, although it is inevitable that a small number of old women discriminate against them.

On the other hand, they never abandon their own issues. In the declining women's groups, there are desolate thorns waiting for women to discover and uproot themselves. They want to eliminate women's illiteracy and deepen anti-Japanese knowledge, so they widely establish women's literacy classes and women's rescue classes to expand women's education. Under the jurisdiction of the Women's Anti-Japanese Association, there are organized first aid teams, intelligence teams, transportation teams, guerrilla teams, and traitor-clearing teams. Judging from general imagination, these various wartime technical teams are of course nothing more than capturing various beautiful names, but with their working enthusiasm, the instructors of each team are very happy to accept their voluntary teaching positions.

Comforting the families of soldiers, bidding farewell to volunteers, organizing comfort teams to comfort those on the front lines, they work hard to do it. In the collection of comfort goods, the "Youth Anti-Japanese Association" cannot compare with them. Every launch, they are deeply excited and compete with the "Youth Anti-Japanese Association."

Miss Ruan Liuhong, the executive director, told me that in the areas that have fallen into enemy hands, the lives and chastity of our sisters are... Hearing this is really heartbreaking. I want to analyze two main reasons for this: first... second, the sisters are too weak. Chinese women have been bound for thousands of years, and the power of resistance has gradually been eroded over this long period. Upon hearing the sound of... and the fear between genders makes them lose themselves. They tremble, faint, and willingly give the enemy... the opportunity to manipulate them. I see clearly, recently, the enemy's attempt to attack the upper reaches of the Xijiang River is even more urgent. In our work, we must improve women's understanding of the enemy, strengthen women's skills in killing the enemy, and stimulate their national hatred. Everyone believes that in the occupied areas... if a trained woman quietly resolves the enemy, it is nothing surprising.

### Movies and Drama: A Plot as Vast as the Sky

— A dispatch from Chongqing by Tongye

The Air Force Movie Produced by the Central Photography Studio

Regarding "Air Force Movies," Shanghai Lianhua Company previously produced a film called "Iron Crow." Readers are surely aware of its success. Now, the Central Photography Studio is releasing "A Sky of Ten Thousand Miles," which can be said to be a great aviation film. Not only is the plot intricate and mysterious, but the scenes are also intense and exciting. Watching it is sure to make your blood boil. Unfortunately, we people of Hong Kong can only yearn for it for the time being, as it cannot be shown here until the final victory. I will now introduce the plot to the readers, which may provide some spiritual comfort!

(Editor)

On September 18th, the Japanese bandits seized our four northeastern provinces, turning thirty million compatriots into slaves. Over five million square miles of land were trampled by enemy hooves. Vast wealth, huge amounts of military supplies, along with two hundred and sixty airplanes, all fell into enemy hands. The Northeast Aviation School was also destroyed.

Gao Fei, a mechanical engineer from the Northeast Aviation Corps, followed the masses into the interior. During the journey, they were chased and strafed by enemy planes, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. A young woman, Bai Shanfeng, rushed to support her injured father, leaving her younger sister, Xiao Yun, behind. In this perilous situation, Gao Fei hid and narrowly escaped death. Gao watched the enemy plane, his heart burning with rage.

Gao had a relative in Jinan, so he enrolled in the affiliated middle school of Qilu University. After class, he would always engage in physical exercise. One day, in the sports field, he chatted with his classmates Yue Yiqin and Zhao Wanjia. Yue was lying on the grass, gazing at three or five airplanes circling in the sky, as if lost in thought. Gao asked him about it. Yue smiled and showed him the advertisement he had clipped from the newspaper for the Central Aviation School's recruitment of flight students. Gao and Zhao also showed their own clippings of the same advertisement. With a shared determination, the three of them decided to leave Qilu and pursue aviation studies.

Since the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, our country has strived to build up its air force. Young people from all over the country have come in droves. Gao, Yue, and Zhao passed the preliminary physical and academic tests and joined the Air Force Enlistment Camp, receiving one year of army training before being promoted to flight students. At the commencement ceremony, they respectfully listened to the instructions, received the Air Force regulations and creeds, and sang the aviation school's anthem. It was majestic and soared to the clouds.

Gao, Yue, and Zhao, along with other flight students, received instruction from Squadron Leader Gao Zhihang. They were divided into groups to learn basic flight skills. Their first time in the clouds was like ascending to heaven.

Shi Qi, a mechanical officer, was loyal to his service. He once jokingly told Gao that mechanical engineers are like bird keepers, washing them, brushing them, coaxing them, and comforting them to make them fly, sing, and soar. Except, these are iron birds.

Thousands upon thousands of passionate young men were fostered and trained by the nation, like thousands of iron locust trees forged into steel in a furnace. Gao, Yue, Zhao, and other flight students took the future responsibilities of the nation upon their shoulders. Under the strict discipline of ironclad training, they woke up early, formed ranks, practiced flying, exercised, and rested. Day by day, they bravely moved forward. After one year, two years, three years, Zhao, Yue, and Gao all graduated and became squadron members, some serving as instructors to train future air force flight students.

Amidst the arduous and intense training, there was also appropriate recreation. One bright day, four military trucks drove out of the aviation school gate, carrying flight students and teachers on a trip to Hangzhou. Gao Di, Dayong, had a friendly relationship with Qing'er, a young woman who owned a fruit shop outside the school. As usual, the aviation school students bought a large amount of fruit from Qing'er's shop. On this day, Gao Fei, Wanli, Shi Qi, and Gu Changkong, four close friends, were all there. Shi, Zhao, and Yue deliberately made things difficult for Gao and Gu, buying all the fruit in Qing'er's basket to share with their fellow students and teachers in the truck. Amidst laughter and war songs, they quickly arrived in Hangzhou. The air force cadets dispersed or formed groups to sightsee, visit friends, climb mountains, ride horses, or race boats. The scenic spots between Six Harmonies Pagoda and Three Temples of Tianzhu were enlivened and enhanced by the presence of the air force cadets.

Gao, Zhao, Gu, and Shi toured the Su Causeway together and were struck by the beauty of a young woman, Bai Shanfeng, whom they saw as a celestial being. They wanted to strike up a conversation with her, as none of the four were married. Unfortunately, they did not know who she was. Later, they entered the newly opened Fengyun Cafe and learned that the woman was the cafe owner's daughter, Bai Shanfeng.

Soon after, a group of elementary and middle school students entered the cafe to raise funds for airplane donations. First, they sang patriotic songs, "Tomorrow of Victory," saying that those who can contribute strength should contribute strength, and those who can contribute money should contribute money. The leader of the singing was Bai Shanfeng's younger sister, Bai Xiaoling. After singing, they went to each table to solicit donations. The air force cadets generously donated, and other guests also contributed. However, one guest, facing his girlfriend, resented the students' singing for interrupting his conversation.

In the afternoon, Gao, Zhao, and others accompanied the Bai sisters on a boat trip to the mountains, singing and enjoying themselves. They saw Yan Haiwen and Ms. Liu walking together, enjoying the scenery. The group jokingly asked Bai if she had a lover. Bai replied that she had two: one was the wind from Changbai Mountain, and the other was the young Chinese air force. Bai then smiled and sang, wishing herself to be forever the wind, awakening the sweet dreams of infatuated men and resentful women, and shattering the cowardly hearts of rebellious officials and traitors. Every day, she would brush against the soaring iron wings and kiss the tanned faces of the air force cadets. When invaders came to devour us, the storm would rise, stirring up a huge wave of resistance, and carrying the righteous army, willing to fight for the survival of the nation and for the freedom and equality of the world.

At six o'clock in the afternoon, as usual, the aviation personnel returned to school by truck. The Bai sisters waved goodbye from the hillside, their singing echoing the songs of the cadets in the truck.

The July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, and war clouds loomed over the Far East. The northern war was going badly. The air force personnel, after reading the newspaper, were filled with boiling blood, wishing they could immediately set out to fight the enemy.

On Sunday morning, Feng, Yan, Zhao, and Shi, four riders, visited Bai Shanfeng and saw that the cafe was half-closed, with tables and chairs being moved, preparing to close down. When asked why, Bai replied that she was going to abandon the cafe life. The group understood. Bai told them that she did not want to leave the four of them in the future, so she was leaving today. Bai had secretly signed up for a battlefield nursing training class at a hospital. On August 13th, the Shanghai battle broke out, and the full-scale war of resistance began. The air force mobilization order was issued, and all the air force cadets cheered. In a tragic and passionate atmosphere, each member made a will, showing their determination to sacrifice their lives for the country. On August 14th, enemy planes came to bomb Hangzhou, and Gao Zhihang and Yue Yiqin led their planes into aerial combat, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On July 17th, Yan Haiwen sacrificed himself for righteousness in Shanghai. On August 19th, Shen Chonghui heroically crashed his plane into an enemy warship in Longkou. Our Wu Yong bombing unit also established special achievements. The victory of the Chinese Air Force gave the world a thunderbolt from a clear sky. (To be continued)

### MGM's Representative in Shanghai Discusses Shanghai Audiences (Continued from Yesterday)

does not have as many moving actions. After we finished filming, we worried that this film would not be as popular in China as it was in the United States. However, when it was released,

Chinese audiences flocked to it.

"The reason why this film is so popular is that Chinese movie audiences admire Norma Shearer. At least that's one of the reasons. The reason why Chinese people like Norma Shearer is that her slim and beautiful appearance is perfectly in line with the Chinese ideal of beauty," he said.

He also mentioned that among MGM's female stars, besides Norma Shearer, the most popular with Chinese audiences is Jeanette MacDonald, and among male stars, Clark Gable is the most popular. Since 1931, MGM has rented out about forty to fifty films in Shanghai each year. The situation is similar in Hong Kong and Tianjin.

American films are distributed all over the world. In countries where English is not spoken, subtitles are used. In some countries where listening to English is prohibited, the dialogue is dubbed in the local language. This can be very complicated, especially with songs.

Experienced comedies, historical stories, and what are generally called "family films" are the three types of films that MGM considers to be the focus of its production in 1938. As for whether great operas will be introduced to the screen in the future, the spokesperson said that Hollywood producers are still hesitant because the only purpose of film companies is to make money. It is uncertain whether such films will be popular with American audiences, let alone others. In short, the money spent on film releases still has to come from the audience's pockets.

### Xu He Cup Second Round Match: South China Faces Army Today; To Be Held at the Naval Stadium at 4 PM; South China's Defense Is Incomplete, But the Frontline Is Strong and Victory Is Expected

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Half of this year's six major football championships have already fallen into the hands of our Chinese team. Our Chinese team has also reached the final stage of competing for the remaining three titles. However, whether they can sweep all the championships depends on the efforts of all the players. Judging from the recent situation, with the strength of our Chinese team, no foreign team can seize its advantage. If they are not satisfied with having already won three titles and know how to encourage themselves, then sweeping the championships is indeed possible. May all the members of our Chinese team strive for this and complete this glorious creation. This is what we deeply hope for.

Today is the date for the second round of the Xu He Cup match, to be held at the Naval Stadium at 4 PM. This competition adopts a single round-robin system and a 90-minute format. The scoring method is the same as in the league. It is also necessary to mention the origin of the competition. Before this competition was held, some charitable organizations, believing that football could raise funds, invited South China to send a team to play in charity matches. South China, considering it a good cause, always agreed. However, as the number of requests increased day by day, even charitable organizations from Guangzhou and Macau requested South China to treat everyone equally and provide assistance. At this point, South China was overwhelmed and found it difficult to refuse. After much consideration, they obtained the consent of Mr. Luo Xuhe, who donated a silver cup to be used as a prize. Therefore, this charitable competition was created in the 1934-35 season.

At that time, South China initiated the competition and obtained the agreement of the Army and Navy Sports Associations to cooperate, thus making the event a reality. It was announced that they would co-organize the competition. Thus, this triangular competition became a form of charitable endeavor. Due to the limited number of participating teams, only three, the competition adopted a single round-robin system and a 90-minute format. Each team played twice, and the team with the highest score won the championship. The matches were held at a neutral venue.

The first match of that year was held in October last year. At that time, the Navy had abundant talent and great strength, so they defeated the Army with a score of 3-1. In previous years, the Army had always maintained a winning record against the Navy, but this year was different, which shows that in football, the strong cannot rely on their strength for long.

The Navy has a high chance of winning the championship after winning the first match, but it still depends on whether they can defeat South China in the third match, which is equivalent to the final. That match will be held on the 25th of this month.

In today's match, South China's defense has been altered due to Mai Shaohan's slight illness and Liu Qingcai's absence, similar to the recent special Silver Shield final between South China and the Police, with only Xie Jinhong replacing the left center-back.

Some people believe that South China's defense is incomplete and that it is worrying to face the Army's frontline. However, judging from Li Guowei's performance in the recent Silver Shield final, it was very satisfactory. Guo Yingqi also performed well, and as his steps become more familiar, his performance will naturally improve.

The Army's frontline does not select the three outstanding players from Middlesex but uses players from the second team, which makes observers quite puzzled. Could it be that the person in charge of selection has a unique vision and can distinguish talent beyond the obvious? However, I have seen that Liddes' skills are excellent. As for how Shu Shu and Mei Shi perform, it is not very clear. Now that they have suddenly risen to prominence, they should not be inferior players. However, this match is a matter of life and death for the Army. If they win, they still have a chance of winning the championship. If they lose, their chances are over. However, the personnel selection does not seem to be a match for South China.

Based on my observation, South China's frontline is sharp and unstoppable and has the potential to win by four goals or more. However, the defense is slightly incomplete, so it is difficult to guarantee that they will not lose. However, I dare to say that South China will ultimately be the winner.

### Public Basketball Tournament: South China Defeats Chung Sing; Tonight, Eastern Faces South China

In the public men's basketball tournament, Chung Sing faced South China yesterday. The former is a first-class team in the local basketball scene, while the latter is a leader in school basketball. Their players are like newborn calves and are truly rising stars. Regarding the strength of both sides, most people believed that Chung Sing had a better chance of winning. Unexpectedly, South China won with a score of 64-59. During the game, Chung Sing was ahead only at the beginning with a score of 6-5, but then they were at a disadvantage the whole time. Therefore, South China's victory was not accidental. Their shooting was unexpectedly effective, which was also a lucky star for South China. Although their coordination may not be flawless, the individual skills of the players are truly superb. Each of them has agile skills, and their positions are flexible during the game. Their turning is quick, and their shooting, whether backhand or one-handed, can succeed even when surrounded by the opponent. The marvel is truly breathtaking. Huang Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen were indispensable to South China's victory. Li Junsheng also made great contributions in the first half, laying the foundation for victory. All the members of Chung Sing did their best, and their defeat was due to bad luck, not their fault. Chen Ruzheng and Guo Zhihong are the soul of the team. In yesterday's game, Chen and Guo were closely guarded by Chung Sing's Zhong Ling and Chen Zan, and they often felt like they were facing enemies on all sides. Secondly, although their shooting postures were wonderful, they rarely scored. In the first half, Su Bohui and Li Baifen failed to prevent Li Junsheng's sneak attacks, which prevented them from gaining the ball in the second half and achieving victory. They should be blamed for this. Shen Ruiqing tried his best to fight back in difficult situations and often saved Chung Sing from decline. His contribution was truly significant. It is a pity that the coach, Chen Ruzheng, and Guo Zhihong, were trapped in desperate situations every time they attacked, so their individual scores were insufficient to turn the tide. After the start of the game, South China's Li Junsheng made a side shot from the edge of the court, opening the scoring. Chung Sing's Chen, Zheng, and Shen Ruiqing then scored one after another. Afterwards, both sides scored, making the score 6-5, with Chung Sing in the lead. Then, South China's Li Junsheng scored twice, tying the score at 9-9. As South China's Zhong, Li, and Chen launched repeated attacks, Chung Sing's Su and Li defended poorly and were overtaken by South China with scores of 17-11 and 23-16. Until the end of the first half, Chung Sing was still behind 25-32. When the sides changed, Chung Sing's Chen Ruzheng and Shen Ruiqing successively scored, catching up head-on. Unexpectedly, South China's Huang Zuode showed his strength, using his agile posture to move back and forth under the enemy's basket, leaving Chung Sing's defenders helpless. They were again behind 50-56. Until Shen Ruiqing's sharp edge was revealed, he closely followed South China with 55-58. But in the last few minutes, South China's Huang Zuode and Chen Zanyin successively made attacks. Until the end of the game, South China won with a score of 64-59. The scores of each player are as follows:

### Reporter's Sports Committee Schedules Trip to Lantau Island; Members and Friends Welcome to Participate on the 14th of This Month

Aside from Tai Mo Shan (3,010 feet), which is a famous mountain, Phoenix Ridge, the highest peak of Lantau Island, at 3,065 feet above sea level, is actually the second highest. The Zen forests and monasteries all over the mountain, the ancient fortresses of Tung Chung (now Wah Ying College), and the market town of Tai O are all unique. Moreover, because it is far from Hong Kong Island and takes time to travel to and from, there are not many tourists on ordinary days. This makes those who visit it feel as if they are in another world, like an inner pure land. As for those who climb to the highest peak, if they encounter clear weather, they can see Hong Kong Island to the east, Macau to the west, Cheung Chau Island to the south, and Guishan Island to the north. Moreover, appreciating the vast waves of the Lingdingyang Sea is even more inspiring and evokes infinite feelings. The Sports Committee of the Hong Kong Reporters Association, in order to strengthen the bonds between members and promote "national defense-style travel," has scheduled the second trip to Lantau Island and Phoenix Ridge as its destination. Although reporters may still be tired from working late into the night and have not had enough sleep, occasionally shortening a few hours of rest time and going to nature, although the spirit may be slightly damaged and the muscles may be tired, the joy and interest gained will surely make up for it. Members and their friends are welcome to participate. The arrangements are as follows:

(1) The second trip of the Sports Committee of the Hong Kong Reporters Association will be on February 14 (Friday) to Lantau Island.

(2) Gather at the Cheung Chau Pier at 4:00 AM and depart on the Min Yao Ferry at 4:30 AM. Take the same ferry back to Hong Kong in the afternoon at 6:00 PM and arrive at 9:00 PM to dismiss the team.

(3) In order to facilitate those who cannot travel far and to suit everyone's needs, the route is divided into two: (A) First climb Tung Chung, visit Wah Ying College, pass the South China Monastery, climb Ditangzai, pass various hermitages, and take the road to Ngong Ping, pass Luk Wu, and descend to Tai O. (B) Temporarily separate from the previous team at the hermitage of Farlin and others, and take the path behind the hermitage to climb Phoenix Peak, descend to Ngong Ping, Luk Wu, and meet the previous team at Tai O.

(4) Phoenix Peak is also known as Guantoushan, and there is a Luohan Pagoda and a One-Tree Rock on it. Ngong Ping has the Lotus Platform Stone and the Stone Drum. There is a Stone Ox at the foot of the mountain, and the Tai O seaside has the General Stone and other famous scenic spots and strange relics. The three major Zen forests of Ditangzai, Ngong Ping, and Luk Wu are especially worth visiting and browsing.

(5) The ferry fares and tea are at your own expense. The Association will provide lunch. If you want to eat vegetarian food at the Zen temple or have a big fish meal, you can do so at your own discretion. The items to bring should be light, but please bring enough medication.

(6) Registration starts today and closes on the evening of the 12th. There is no fee, but you must participate as agreed. Participants should notify by phone: 1. Huang Fenming, editorial department of Overseas Chinese Daily (evenings); 2. Li Zhiming, editorial department of Xunhuan Daily (daytime). The quota is limited to 30 people, and registration will close when the quota is full.

(7) In order to facilitate and adapt to the time and route, there may be some temporary changes, but everything will be done to suit the majority.

### Over Two Hundred Refugee Children Travel to Victoria Peak; Sir Robert Ho Tung Provides Refreshments

Over two hundred refugee children from the Children's Welfare Home traveled to Victoria Peak yesterday morning in the beautiful spring sunshine. They were led by Reverend He Ailing, the director of the Home. Hong Kong gentleman Sir Robert Ho Tung gave them a warm reception and provided them with a rich variety of Chinese and Western food and tea. He also encouraged them to study diligently, be cautious, and strive to serve the country. The children listened and smiled, and the gardens of Sir Robert Ho Tung's mansion were filled with laughter. At 5:30 PM, the two hundred refugee children thanked him for his hospitality and returned. According to He Shenzhang, they hoped that people from all walks of life who care for refugee children would also invite the children more often, for which they would be very grateful.

### A Bloodless, Foolish Sporting Method?

— —Wang Xuezheng—

(2) (Continued from Part 2)

When doing leg exercises or exercises involving the body, arms, and legs simultaneously, the carbon dioxide content in the blood increases the fastest. The oxygen intake and carbon dioxide exhalation of the lungs can increase by seven or eight times more than usual. The speed of blood circulation can also be seven or eight times faster than usual. However, when performing "Two-arm Press," "Two-arm Curl," "Lateral Raises," or even "Back Lift," the changes in the heart and lungs rarely reach this level. Furthermore, during exercise, the body is also undergoing a selective process. The parts that work more receive more blood supply. During exercise, the blood vessels in the muscles expand, allowing a large amount of blood to flow into them. We only need to look at the difference in size and strength between the leg muscles and the arms, shoulders, and chest to know that the blood flow to the legs during leg exercises must be greater than the blood flow to the arms, shoulders, and chest during exercises involving those parts. Therefore, the impact on the circulatory system is also greater.

According to statistics from American universities, track and field athletes have the highest incidence of heart disease or heart weakness among athletes. In 1910, George Woods, the world champion in the quarter-mile race, also died suddenly from heart disease. This is indeed a direct result of overexertion. In 1900, Tom Storey, a Yale University rower, fell ill after a race due to overexertion. As a result, he died of lung disease at the age of 35. Because of temporary overexertion, his body suffered significant damage, gradually weakened, and could not resist disease. But is this kind of exercise really a bloodless, foolish sporting method? To be fair, it is not the foolishness of those who advocate running and rowing or the sports themselves, but the foolishness of George Woods and Tom Storey themselves or their coaches.

A classmate of mine was once the captain of the tennis team at a Shanghai university's affiliated middle school. After graduating from middle school, he transferred to one of the most famous national universities in the country and was selected as the second singles player. This classmate loved tennis and had excellent skills. Because he wanted to pursue further studies, he practiced tirelessly every day. However, in less than a year, he also died of a sudden illness. Should tennis also be blamed?

Not long ago, a boxer and a football player in Hong Kong also died from injuries sustained during competitions. Should this also be called deadly sports?

I also have a classmate who is proficient in football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and other ball sports. He also often practiced track and field. He seemed very strong, but he had a bad habit of masturbation, and it was very serious. After several years, he also died of tuberculosis in less than two weeks.

For example, football is very popular in Hong Kong, but I know at least one person who strongly opposes football. And aren't there people who criticize basketball, tennis, track and field, and other sports? We must never blindly follow the pointless opinions of one or a few people.

Since Mr. Chengbo said, "People with heart or lung disease should not engage in strenuous exercise," and also said that his younger brother's lungs were weak, then it is certain that people with weak lungs should not engage in strenuous exercise. However, appropriate exercise can help people with weak lungs regain their health. What is considered appropriate exercise depends on the sport itself, as well as the individual's strength and needs. What a strong person considers easy exercise, a weak person may not be able to handle. It should be noted that even gentle exercises or even walking are sometimes not suitable for people who are very weak or seriously ill. Incorrect methods of calisthenics, such as excessive time, incorrect breathing, or excessive exercise, can also have significant drawbacks. Although tennis is considered a moderate sport that is very suitable for middle-aged or elderly people, we have seen some tennis players collapse and lie on the ground after strenuous matches.

In short, strenuous exercise is exercise that requires 65% to 80% of one's full strength, while light exercise requires 40% to 50% of one's full strength. Although every movement we make is exercise, it is not the most effective exercise and cannot develop the body to its strongest point. It may not even be enough to maintain health. Healthy people who exercise at 65% to 80% of their full strength for half an hour or an hour every day cannot be said to be overexerting themselves. Just look at the laborers and our frontline soldiers, as well as the young people who are being trained. The energy they expend every day is definitely above 65% of their full strength. Will they all die of acute pneumonia? Only people who are inherently unhealthy cannot handle appropriate strenuous exercise. However, appropriate light exercise can often help unhealthy people regain their health. The so-called strenuous exercise does not only refer to the weight of equipment. The most important thing is the way of exercising. Therefore, in dumbbell exercises, as long as the weight of the equipment is lightened, the number of repetitions is reduced, or the duration of continuous exercise is shortened, there are many simple exercises that are suitable for weak people. If you exert all your strength every time you exercise, it is not the exercise that is deadly or foolish, but our own foolishness, or even suicide.

Mr. Chengbo advised his younger brother, "It is better to practice deep breathing and calisthenics properly, and first strengthen your internal organs. Don't just focus on external appearance." He also quoted the words of many famous Chinese and foreign physical educators to advise him. In fact, if done properly, dumbbell and chest expander exercises are beneficial to both the inside and outside of the body. Although the effects of various exercises may have some differences, the main effect is consistent: to develop muscles and strengthen internal organs and strength, that is, to promote breathing, circulation, digestion, metabolism, and other functions. As a result, the functions of other organs are also greatly improved. Therefore, in reality, various localized exercises can also improve the health of the entire body. Moreover, to strengthen the internal organs, it is necessary to develop the voluntary muscles. The muscles of the heart and stomach are all involuntary muscles. To develop these involuntary muscles, on the one hand, it is necessary to promote breathing and circulation. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop the voluntary muscles that are close to these involuntary muscles.

Mr. Chengbo also mobilized his younger brother to pay attention to deep breathing exercises. It should be known that deep breathing exercises, if not done properly, can also have drawbacks. Although this exercise seems very simple, very few people have a deep understanding of it. For example, the method of abdominal contraction, muscle relaxation, deep breathing should not be excessive or too forced, and should be done between or after exercises, etc. are all neglected by the general public. If the method of deep breathing is wrong, the damage to the body is no less than that of dumbbell exercises. Although we have not heard of anyone who died of acute pneumonia in the short term due to improper deep breathing, many effective and appropriate exercises are often mistakenly criticized as foolish or harmful methods because of this.

Mr. Chengbo quoted the words of many famous Chinese and foreign physical educators to advise his younger brother. I believe that these famous Chinese and foreign physical educators would never regard dumbbell exercises and chest expander exercises as bloodless, foolish sporting methods!

If one only engages in exercise while neglecting other extremely important elements of health, the result will not only be useless but also harmful, even if the exercise is done properly. However, the general public does not have this understanding and completely attributes the harm caused by this to exercise.

Mr. Chengbo also said, "The 'hard work' method of Europeans and Americans has been criticized by many thoughtful people." But I wonder if Mr. Chengbo knows that dumbbell, chest expander, and weightlifting exercises have also been supported by many famous physical educators, doctors, and proponents of natural therapies. The reasons I mentioned above are the main reasons for their support. I would also like to know Mr. Chengbo's so-called "thoughtful people's" reasons for criticizing the "hard work" method of Europeans and Americans.

Finally, Mr. Chengbo's reason for "crying out loudly in grief after the death of his younger brother, hoping that the enthusiastic physical educators and doctors in society will unanimously condemn this harmful and foolish method" is based on the fact that his younger brother, who practiced this "bloodless, foolish sporting method" that he condemned, died of acute pneumonia within a short period of twelve days. I wonder if there are any other reasons. April 7, Year 28.

### China's Tea Exports Greatly Reduced After the War Compared to Before

Tea is a famous product of China, sold to various countries for about 40 to 50 million yuan annually. Its quality is good, and its product is excellent, far superior to those of European, American, British, and Japanese countries. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, with the successive fall of important Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, exports have been greatly reduced compared to before. According to an investigation, in January 1938, the quantity of Chinese tea transported to foreign countries was still 17,631 dan, worth approximately 1,401,874 yuan in national currency. The amount transported to Hong Kong was 12,032 dan, worth 978,794 yuan in national currency. The amount transported to Morocco was 215 dan, worth 195,077 yuan in national currency. The amount transported to the Soviet Union was 297 dan, worth 26,633 yuan in national currency. However, as of February of this year, the total export volume has decreased to 7,689 dan, worth 651,682 yuan in national currency. Among them, black tea accounted for 216 dan, worth 147,131 yuan in national currency; other black tea accounted for 584 dan, worth 30,591 yuan; Xiaojian green tea accounted for 651 dan, worth 64,788 yuan; Xichun green tea accounted for 568 dan, worth 40,923 yuan; Liangqian green tea accounted for 1,667 dan, worth 152,550 yuan; other green tea accounted for 2,432 dan, worth 264,124 yuan; Wudao Ming tea accounted for 195 dan, worth 65,972 yuan; Mao tea accounted for 384 dan, worth 17,985 yuan. The largest amount of exports was transported to Hong Kong, accounting for 2,763 dan, worth 204,144 yuan. The second largest was Morocco, accounting for 1,506 dan, worth 144,170 yuan. The third largest was the Soviet Union, accounting for 372 dan, worth 30,023 yuan.

### The Path of Intellectuals

— Yu Saif

Initially, when an intellectual begins to doubt himself, he will embark on a very dark path—that is possible.

Doubting oneself also includes the tendency not to be able to keep up with the evolution of the objective environment. Therefore, there is no strong force to support oneself; one does not seek and discover that strong force, and one becomes shaken.

Gorky, regarding the intellectuals before the revolution, said that they "can think so humbly": "They can live brightly between the ideology and the workers, or think of themselves as occupying the position of a harness between the coachman and the horse, or even occupying the position of a saddle in the middle of the rider's horse's back."

Then he said: "First of all, our intellectuals—are a labor force. They fear the muscles of the working masses from head to toe. This is not only because they have a chemical relationship of blood, but also because they closely and actively participate in the unified labor process."

The above is what Gorky said in a letter to the workers after Gorky met with representatives of the workers in Yaroslavl on September 20, 1933.

Currently, the contributions of Chinese intellectuals in the war are generally significant. Almost every intellectual has done their best. Whether on the front lines, behind enemy lines, or in the rear, they have always dedicated themselves to their country.

Now, let me record a conversation I had with salvation-seeking intellectuals in a remote small town one night.

"Now, because the school is approaching the exam date, all work has stopped..."

"So, what is your work like usually?" I asked.

"We organized reading groups...During charity sales, we mobilized students to participate, and we actually sold a lot..."

"How do the reading groups operate?"

"We study current affairs issues and try to publish some wall newspapers. We always want to enable all students to participate in the reading groups... But we don't want our reading group members to be just salvation experts. We want to become salvation workers!"

When the conversation ended, it was already very late. We talked a lot enthusiastically, but there was no conclusion.

That night, I just thought:

"They are living in 'struggle'!" Naturally, we want our intellectuals to be a labor force! Separating knowledge from action, or separating practice from theory, is unacceptable.

Do not forget life! Intellectuals must pay attention to the objects of their work at all times. Moreover, they must train themselves into unwavering and fearless warriors.

A warrior does not necessarily hold a gun. A pen, plus a correct worldview, is also a tool with the effectiveness of a bayonet when charging!

We need to further emphasize the struggle consciousness of intellectuals.

Looking at the general phenomenon, although our intellectuals are undertaking the mission of the times arduously; in order to ensure the accelerated completion of the mission, in order to ensure the perfect completion of the mission, our intellectuals should constantly struggle against reactionary forces!

On the one hand: Compromisers, pessimists, negative, timid, begging for surrender to the enemy everywhere, and spreading all kinds of terrifying and desperate atmosphere.

On the one hand, the enthusiasm of the masses, the indomitable spirit, the caring desires, and the heroic advance.

However, our intellectuals must not only give the former a fatal and merciless blow, but also learn from the latter, and at the same time, advance bravely with the masses. From them, our intellectuals will gain "firmness."

How do plants absorb nourishment from the soil? Why do plants need the sun? How should our intellectuals avoid becoming anemic?

Advance! Choose our path! Study how to advance on our path!

China is in such a great era, our intellectuals should transform from the position of "horse" and "saddle" to a newer position:

We will have that day, just as our poet indicates the ode to the future of the war of resistance, we will fight on and win the final victory.

### Outside the Window

— Li Dan

Wandering outside the window, I am full of envy for the window. Imagine looking out from the window at the distant mountains and rivers, with a white sail floating quietly across the sea. What an intoxicating picture for the person inside the window!

However, in this corner of life's barrier, the window has proven to be something that is not meant for me, although I once pursued it passionately.

Some people think that the window is the eye of the house. A house without a window is like a blind person. And I live a blind life all year round. Although God did not give me a pair of eyes less when he created me, in this dark corner, it does not have the function of X-rays to see the world outside the partitions.

When fate sent me to this place, I saw dense layers of buildings from the seaside, with tempting windows shining above. I secretly rejoiced, thinking that I could live in this world with many windows. But after a year of experience, I realized that in this world with many windows, there are still many people like me who are excluded from the windows and live a blind life.

I have tried several times to find a window, but the fact tells me that in this world of windows, society is divided into two classes in a distorted way: one with windows and one without windows. Those with windows live inside the windows, and those without windows are excluded outside the windows. The window is the gap that divides the two classes, and there is no mixing allowed. Therefore, I had to return to the wall cage outside the window, and from then on, I no longer dared to have any illusions.

Once I went to visit a friend in the windowed class. To my surprise, the inside of the window was as dark as my wall cage, because all the windows were covered with cloth strips. I asked him why? He gave two reasons: the first was because he wanted to avoid the dust on the street and the strong sunlight, so he would rather have the room a little darker; the second was because he was afraid that people outside would see things he didn't want them to see, so he covered it with curtains, preferring not to be able to look out. Only then did I realize that the window is not something that is permanently worshipped, and there are enviable points in this dark wall cage: although noise cannot be completely avoided, sunlight has never been able to penetrate even an inch; although I seem to be lacking eyes, I will not be made someone else's eyes, and I don't even glance at myself and have nothing I don't want people to see.

The window began to waver in my ideal from then on.

Recently in Guilin, I saw many schools built in caves. Groups of children carried their bedding and schoolbags to the caves to attend classes every day. Under the continuous bombing of enemy planes, they were able to work harder and strive harder. Of course, those dark caves do not have windows, but they get knowledge and grow up healthy under the stone walls. Of course, they live in a corner of life's barrier not far from the window, but from outside the window, they recognize life's Dharma. The story of Bodhidharma realizing the profound meaning after facing the wall for nine years, although not entirely credible, does not hint that there is also a great existence in the dark corner. Light does not rely on external sources, but depends on self-emission.

From then on, I no longer coveted a window. I still live in the wall cage outside the window. Although the four walls have no windows, the window is open in my heart.

When I stroll on the street, from outside the window, I have not noticed whether there are things inside the window that people do not want to see, but the hanging window curtain has already told me what mission I am carrying.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

"Comrade, I still have to bear the same kind of work to compensate for my failure this time. But, the responsibility for this failure..."

She was impatient with the long wait, and her cleverness again prompted her to do the second experiment:

"Are you letting me go? Or are you taking my corpse with you? You have to decide quickly, immediately, immediately!"

She never takes risks, only risky experiments, because she is weak. However, she did not think that this experiment inspired a kind of wisdom in him:

"Yes, I will take your corpse with me. I will bury your corpse in an uninhabited place nearby. I can walk back casually, and then still ask your family for money. Besides me and my comrades, only your corpse will know that your family redeemed it, right?"

So, he decided to complete his responsibility and work with her blood: although, she was innocent.

He thought of responsibility, work, he was happy, happy with success. But, he saw her, he was sad, perhaps even sadder than failure. (32)

### Song of Jiangmen

— Lin Ling

Jiangmen,

I have gazed at you in the moonlight of spring,

Looking down at the long river that nurtures your soul,

Listening quietly to the peaceful hymn of the waves;

I drank a toast to you,

Wishing you a bright future!

But, this spring,

Jiangmen,

I heard you calling in the darkness:

"My masters,

Come quickly and save me,

Cut off the evil hand of the invaders!"

You aroused the fires of resistance;

You watched countless warriors lie down to defend you,

And watched the blood of the enemy defile the pure land,

But you no longer rely on a humble and submissive peace,

But began to sing of war,

To sing of the peace that will be rebuilt in war.

### At Maojintai (Continued)

— Dun Sheng

——Two of the Frontline Grass Sketches

"Brothers," he finally comforted us, "Let's do it! It's not difficult to drive out these crazy beasts. The days of struggle are long. Don't be arrogant about small victories, and don't be discouraged by major setbacks. There will always be a day when we can destroy these beasts and achieve the final victory for our nation."

The millet was washed, and the pot began to hum and whistle.

The wind outside the window made the branches rustle, and the sun was setting dimly...

Red-tasseled spears were stuck in the ground, and sentry posts were set up at the entrance and in the village outskirts. The entire Maojintai was so desolate that there was not a sound of dogs barking or chickens crowing, only the howling wind blowing down from the wild mountain tops, whoosh—whoosh.

The hillside bulged with a round mound. This mountain depression was composed of several such mounds, and the silent houses were threatened by the howling wind, lying prostrate at the foot of the hills.

The branches of the trees swayed back and forth in the wind——————

In the distant plains, there were many shadowy villages, and the small river shimmered like a white ribbon, wrinkled by the wind. The wilderness was gloomy, and a patch of trees or a field of locust grass looked like shadowy spots.

The people in the nearby villages had all fled, according to the farmer (let's call him a farmer for now), and had moved into Dinghu Mountain to live.

"Why are the mountain people also fleeing?"

"The mountains here are small. There are mountains in the mountains that are dozens of times larger than these."

Putu, putu... The rice in the pot began to boil. He hurriedly lifted the round mat that covered the pot's mouth, and a burst of steam rushed up, and the thin rice porridge in the pot bubbled.

The farmer stirred the pot with a long-handled coconut shell spoon, and a warm aroma of rice rushed into our nostrils.

"Eat, brothers. The porridge is hot."

However, there were not enough bowls to distribute, so everyone used their own coconut shells to hold the porridge, and broke sorghum stalks to make chopsticks. In this way, we finished a large pot of porridge, and everyone's faces revealed a rosy color, as if they had become healthier.

That night, our team camped in this small mountain village, opened the doors of the uninhabited houses, and went inside to sleep. The brothers on guard in the village outskirts and on the hillside looked out at the dark earth mounds and village shadows in the hillside plains.

The rocks on the hillside were smoothed by the rain, and the stars in the sky trembled in the wind.

Maojintai was in a dry mountain depression. The clear stream in the gully flowed day and night, and the spring water shooting down from the cracks in the stone walls splashed against the rocks below. The old locust trees leaned over the gully bank, sighing in the wind.

The alert brothers, not to mention their clothes, shoes, and leggings, held their guns in their arms or pressed them under their bodies, ready to strike at any moment if anything unusual happened.

The night grew deeper, and the houses, walls, trees, and hills were as dark as fortresses. The wind gradually stopped sweeping, and there was not a single wisp of cloud in the sky, revealing thousands upon thousands of stars. In the silent night, a voice suddenly rang out: "Password!"

This shout startled the night's tranquility.

A burst of knocking on the door shook the cold, silent night, followed by several shouts: "Open the door, comrades, it's me..."

The voice was very familiar. It was the farmer who had cooked porridge for us during the day.

The door was opened, and the farmer walked in, followed by a group of people with red-tasseled spears, wooden sticks, and long knives.

"We are all comrades," the farmer said, pointing to the group of people. "They have just come out of the deep mountains. Some are farmers who till the land, some are boatmen who pole boats – all prepared to sabotage the enemy's work —"

"Oh—"

We gave them a solemn salute, and everyone became comrades-in-arms in the shadows.

These filthy people with tangled hair all carried heroic appearances, swaying in the darkness.

A young comrade with a red-tasseled spear, shaking his red-tasseled spear, sang in a low voice:

We!

Young warriors,

Trampled all over Dinghu Mountain,

Walked through the thorny swamps, jungles,

For the motherland,

And also for our:

Villages,

Fields.

... (The End)
