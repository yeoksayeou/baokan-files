### Do Not Attempt to Save Japan with Economics ×

A righteous cause makes one bold. It's not merely about justifying the name, but also about the inability to compromise on the distinction between right and wrong. Who is the leader of the aggressors? The responsibility lies with them. China fights for survival and to safeguard the independence and freedom of its nation. This will undoubtedly be recognized by the world and future generations. But what does Japan fight for?

At the beginning of the war, Japan claimed that the three northeastern provinces of China, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, were vital to their lifeline, and therefore they fought to protect their life. To regard the people, territory, and rich resources of a neighboring country as one's own lifeline and attempt to seize them by force is obviously unjustifiable. In the middle of the war, Japan claimed that China was being communized and that they were fighting to suppress communism. China established itself on the Three Principles of the People, which even the Communist Party professes to follow, demonstrating the falsity of the communization claim. Moreover, what does a neighbor's ideology have to do with them? Japan also claimed that East Asia needed a new order and that they were fighting to establish that new order. What is this new order? It means those who obey me live, and those who resist me die, using an iron fist to enslave other races and prevent them from ever rising again. Establishing a new order is nothing more than establishing a master-servant relationship; there is no other meaning. Japan also claimed that they were staking their national fortune on a single throw, and therefore fighting to place China's sovereignty under their control (as stated by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on May 24th). The logic of their words and principles is no different from saying, "I'm risking everything, so I'm going to commit murder." All these claims are disjointed and completely unfounded. It is no wonder that even after years of war, members of the Japanese Diet still questioned their government, asking, "What is Japan fighting for?"

However, the essence of China's resistance is extremely clear. Therefore, if one wants China to stop fighting, one only needs to restore China's sovereignty, land, and administrative integrity. Because Japan's cause is unjustified, the only way to resolve the war is through war itself. In other words, either they win to the point where they no longer need to fight, or they are defeated to the point where they cannot fight anymore. If one seeks a way to resolve the war outside of war, the world has long abandoned such thoughts. However, a recent Reuters dispatch from London reported that Sir Basham, a British expert, made a grand pronouncement, the gist of which was:

"Within Japan, there are differing views on the government's current policies. Businessmen do not approve of the war against China and believe that peace is the best path for trade. The current situation in the Far East is a direct result of global economic policies. As countries implement protectionist tariffs, Japan, with a population of 100 million and an annual increase of one million, has extremely limited domestic resources. Although the entire territory has been cultivated, it is still a poor country. Businessmen and non-military people have told me that they are prepared to resolve the China issue and are willing to live in harmony with China. However, they do not know how to achieve this goal without losing face. In short, Japan must withdraw from China, but to achieve this, the world should plan for Japan's future, enabling it to sell its goods, feed its population, and maintain a reasonable standard of living. From a military perspective, Japan's finances are strained and cannot allow the current situation to continue. From this perspective, Japan will adopt a reasonable attitude in the near future."

Sir Basham is a famous British economist who, after traveling to Japan, returned to England and recently delivered the above speech at a gathering on international affairs. The dispatch likely only conveyed a fraction of his insightful arguments. While the arguments of cause and effect are insightful and based on truth, which those concerned with Japan's wartime internal affairs will be happy to hear, there are also a few points in the excerpt that do not form a cause-and-effect relationship. This must be due to the brevity of the dispatch, and it is unlikely that a renowned scholar would contradict himself. After hearing this from afar, we cannot help but say: Sir Basham claims that Japan is a poor country and that the current situation in the Far East is a result of the world's current economic policies, suggesting that this is the reason for Japan's invasion of China. He also suggests that the world should plan for Japan's economic future, seemingly implying that this is the way to end Japan's invasion of China. If Sir Basham is correct, then the answer to the question of why Japan is fighting, which both Japanese and non-Japanese people have been asking, lies here. But is that really the case?

Sir Basham is a renowned economist. The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. Therefore, an economist's view of all phenomena is from an economic perspective. We do not consider Sir Basham's view to be biased. Human civilization has evolved over thousands of years to the present day, encompassing international and social issues. While solutions to problems are sought through religion, general culture, science, and even war, attributing everything to economics is something we are willing to acknowledge. Perhaps Sir Basham's statement is not fundamentally wrong. The pity is that Japan does not act accordingly. To put it another way, Japan cannot escape this principle in reality. The pity is that the Japanese do not realize this themselves. In today's international competition, regardless of political measures, military planning, or actions, if one takes economics as the guiding principle, then politics and military affairs are merely tools. Japan is not like that. They are still drunkenly focused on realizing their military ideals and fulfilling their political aspirations. They regard economics as merely a tool. Therefore, from the initial invasion of China to the present day, the various explanations and expressions of their authorities have never suggested that their desires lie in economics. They fundamentally criticize their acts of military aggression and violate the ironclad rules of economics. We cannot elaborate on this in this short article, but at least the fact that China has historically provided Japan with opportunities to develop its economy and alleviate its poverty in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, yet they have never fully utilized them, can serve as counter-evidence that Japan's consciousness and desires do not lie in economics. That is to say, the cause of the invasion of China after the September 18th Incident and the disasters in the Far East over the past few years does not lie in economics.

The fault in the Far East lies with Japan, the responsibility lies with Japan, but Japan's consciousness and desires do not lie in economics. Therefore, Sir Basham's suggestion to plan for Japan's economy is not enough to prompt Japan to change its course. This can be asserted with certainty. Therefore, in today's situation, China has no choice but to resist, and all friendly nations must also recognize that the only way to resolve the war is through war itself. There is no need to harbor any other hope. If there is hope for a resolution outside of war, it must wait for Japan to fully awaken and abandon its political aspirations and military ideals. Otherwise, providing them with an economic lifeline will only strengthen their political ambitions and military expansion.

### On Guerrilla Warfare in Flat Terrain

— Zhou Shiti

I. Flat terrain is level, and there are many roads. Enemy assaults are easier than in mountainous areas. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly study the enemy's situation, judge the enemy's situation, and understand the enemy's actions and intentions in a timely manner.

II. Increase vigilance and be careful to keep all secrets of our army. All movements of the troops must be rapid and light, so that they can move and fight at any time.

III. Strengthen reconnaissance and guard (reconnaissance and guard have been detailed above). Pay special attention to reconnaissance and guard at night and before dawn. Scouts should be sent out around the enemy to ensure that every move of the enemy is known in a timely manner. Strengthen communication and liaison in all aspects so that the situation can be transmitted quickly.

IV. The best way to prevent enemy attacks is to actively engage, especially by frequently using small units to attack and harass the enemy. This will not only put the enemy in a passive position, exhausting them to deal with us, but also create difficulties, panic, weaknesses, and mistakes for the enemy, which will benefit us in eliminating the enemy.

V. Pre-know the handling of the enemy's attack on us (this relies on reconnaissance work).

A. Even if our troops are superior to the enemy in strength, they can also leave the enemy's targeted area. Use a small unit to contain the enemy on the front and disrupt their deployment. The main force shifts to the enemy's side or rear to attack them, or ambush them midway.

B. Retreat completely, occupying the target that the enemy intends to attack. A small number of plainclothes scouts secretly and continuously conduct reconnaissance near the enemy. The main force ambushes the road that the enemy must take when retreating, but pay attention to secret intentions. It is best for our army to retreat completely in a false direction, and then move to the ambush location, or retreat with light and heavy luggage in another direction. The combat troops detour secretly to the ambush location to confuse and deceive the enemy. This type of action requires accurate judgment of the enemy's situation. For example, when the enemy attacked Hongkou Town in Wutai on November 3, we estimated that the enemy was more likely to retreat back to Wutai, but they would definitely rest during the day and may act at night. If they did not retreat on the night of the 3rd, they would retreat before dawn on the 4th, so we decided to ambush near Huashikou (where the terrain is better). As a result, at about 9:00 PM on the 5th, our army was just at Huashikou, conducting reconnaissance of the terrain and deploying for the attack, when the enemy was caught off guard and we won a great victory.

C. If the enemy is superior, we should avoid the enemy's attack and quickly shift positions, but still conduct guerrilla warfare to confuse and harass the enemy, making it difficult for the enemy to find the direction of our shift and continue to attack. At the same time, there should be plainclothes scouts secretly conducting continuous reconnaissance near the enemy to understand the enemy's actions in a timely manner.

VI. Handling the situation when the enemy attacks us without prior knowledge and the enemy is already approaching our guard troops (this situation only occurs without reconnaissance):

A. The guard troops must do their best to put up a strong resistance, regardless of the losses, to buy time for the main force to complete combat preparations or other arrangements, so that the enemy cannot approach the main force.

B. If the enemy is superior, the main force must quickly retreat to a favorable direction, with an organized force to cover the retreat, avoiding chaos and preventing the enemy from continuing to pursue. At this time, if there are enemy troops nearby, neighboring units should send troops to harass the enemy on the side or rear, so that our troops under enemy attack can safely shift positions.

C. If our troops are superior and the enemy has penetrated deep into our area, under favorable conditions, we can also use a force to control the enemy on the front, and the main force can attack the enemy from the side or rear, or secretly move to the side of the road that the enemy must take when retreating and annihilate them when they retreat.

VII. Handling the situation when suddenly attacked by the enemy (this situation only occurs when reconnaissance and guard are not paid attention to):

(1) When suddenly attacked by the enemy, we are in a disadvantageous position and should quickly move to disengage from the enemy, or take the opportunity to counterattack and defeat them. If we have been surrounded by multiple layers of the enemy, we should retreat quickly and systematically.

(2) If the main force has broken through, but a part of it is surrounded by the enemy and cannot break through, then the troops that have broken through should, depending on the situation, try to rescue nearby friendly neighbors as much as possible, and the friendly neighbors must do their best to help. At this time, it can be estimated that the enemy's troops are often chaotic during combat, and they are proud of their victory and will inevitably neglect their guard, which is conducive to our sudden counterattack and victory. Therefore, a decision can be made quickly according to the situation at that time.

(3) When surrounded by the enemy, it is important to avoid escaping separately and running away in disorder. It is important to know that under any danger, being resolute, brave, calm, and organized in attacking the weak points of the enemy can lead to escaping from danger. If defensive measures are taken, the danger will gradually increase, and there is a risk of being annihilated by the enemy (it is only possible to hold out if it is estimated that our army can quickly reinforce and there is really no way to break through; this is an exception). On August 3rd of last year, two companies of our ×× guerrilla team were in Erchongzigou. At dawn, the enemy secretly approached and annihilated their sentry, and continued to surround and attack the main force. The guerrilla team did not concentrate their main force to attack the enemy in order to escape, but held on to the village, resisting bravely and stubbornly, resulting in the martyrdom of all of them.

(VIII) How to deal with the enemy's siege?

A. The guerrilla base areas within the enemy's occupied areas and the guerrilla teams operating on the enemy's flanks and rear are a thorn in the enemy's side. The enemy often adopts a group attack method against these base areas. Enemy sieges are more convenient in flat terrain than in mountainous areas. Therefore, scattered teams operating in flat terrain should always pay attention to the enemy's sieges.

B. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the enemy has carried out countless sieges against guerrilla base areas in North China, such as the large-scale three-pronged siege of northwestern Shanxi in February and March of last year, the large-scale siege of southeastern Shanxi in April, and several sieges of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, especially the five-pronged siege by 50,000 troops in September, October, and November of last year; the areas of the ×th Detachment in Huainingzuo, You, etc. in the four-pronged siege in January; the ×th Detachment ×th Regiment Factory Hanying area under three (each time three to five prongs) national attacks by our ×th Detachment from August to November; the five-pronged siege of the Mokanshan ×th Detachment in September; and the three-pronged siege of the □th Detachment in Miaoergou Dayushu south of Suiyuan in October, and the five-pronged siege of the □th Detachment in Yugoukouzi, Hongzhao area northeast of Guihua in November. These sieges took a great deal of effort from the enemy, but they were all crushed and defeated by us, causing them heavy losses. Keeping these areas in our hands to this day shows that we have the methods and strength to smash the enemy's sieges, and we believe that we can continue to smash the enemy's sieges in the future.

C. Most of the lessons we have learned come from the enemy's sieges of mountainous areas, but the terrain conditions of mountainous areas and flat terrain are different, which affects the tactics for dealing with enemy sieges. For example, in March of last year, we finally smashed the enemy's siege of northwestern Shanxi by waiting in ambush with the main force of the □□ Brigade □□ Brigade on both sides between Ningwu Yangfangkou for five or six days, trying to force the retreat of the Ningwu ×, and then attacking them in coordination while also being able to attack the Shuoxian reinforcements. As a result, after three fierce battles, we succeeded. But if it were flat terrain, it would not be possible. For example, in October, more than 2,000 enemy troops in Hunyuan, Daying, and Guangling divided into three routes to besiege the Darenzhuang area. Our □□ guerrilla unit, consisting of hundreds of people, used the area of Darenzhuang Mountain, which was 60 to 70 li wide and 40 to 50 li long, to play circles with the enemy for three days. The enemy suffered more than 100 casualties, while we suffered no losses. But this would not be possible in flat terrain. Therefore, dealing with enemy sieges in flat terrain is somewhat different from dealing with them in mountainous areas. The following are some questions about dealing with enemy sieges in flat terrain:

[1] The enemy has many means of transportation, which can be fully used in flat terrain [such as a bullock cart road, it can barely drive a car]. The enemy's mobilization and concentration are faster. Therefore, we have very thorough and reliable reconnaissance to understand the enemy's siege intentions in a timely manner and be prepared.

[2] Guerrilla teams and guerrilla groups frequently operate actively near the enemy, which can help to understand the enemy's actions and intentions in a timely manner, and sometimes can also disrupt the enemy's siege deployments or plans.

### Maintaining Balance of International Payments: Ministry of Finance Implements Import Controls, Expected to Save Over 200 Million Yuan in Foreign Exchange Annually; Rewards Export Settlements by Granting Exchange Rate Differentials

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement regarding the significance of the announced "Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Times": Maintaining the balance of international payments is a key element of any country's economic policy, and during wartime, trade tends to become adverse. It is especially important for the government to adopt various methods to maintain the balance, so as not to affect the national economy and hinder the progress of the war. China's trade surplus is substantial, but most of the defense supplies needed during wartime, as well as industrial and transportation equipment, still rely on imports. If the adverse trend in the balance of international payments is not reversed, it will inevitably affect the foreign purchasing market and hinder the economy.

To address this, the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade" was drafted in September 1937, establishing three adjustment committees for agriculture, industry, mining, and trade, and allocating funds to handle military insurance. This is indeed an essential wartime economic policy. At the same time, a management import plan to prohibit current quota licenses was drafted and submitted for approval. However, for various reasons, the management import plan was not approved for implementation. Later, in March of last year, when foreign trade management was implemented, a management import plan was proposed again, selecting several types of luxury goods and semi-luxury goods to be banned or restricted from import. For goods necessary for the War of Resistance, national construction, and daily use, the government banks were allowed to sell foreign exchange at the legal price. However, due to external concerns, this was not implemented.

Over the past year, the × puppets have taken advantage of our tax revenues and plundered our material gains to illegally exchange large sums of legal currency for foreign exchange in Macau, causing an unprecedented surge in the foreign exchange market. Since the establishment of the stabilization fund and the entry of British banks into the stabilization effort, which was originally intended as a gesture of British support and a way to facilitate international trade, the stabilization effort has been threatened and faced difficulties. During the War of Resistance, the people should practice frugality, reduce unnecessary consumption, and increase their purchasing power for necessities, in line with the principle of "military first, victory first." After careful discussion, it was unanimously agreed that prohibiting the import of some goods is a necessary wartime measure, which will surely be understood by people at home and abroad. All goods that are not essential for the War of Resistance, national construction, and daily life, or those that are partially needed but can be replaced by domestic products, or those that are mostly manufactured by × countries and are easily counterfeited and sold under false pretenses when imported, should be prohibited from import.

Therefore, import prohibition measures were drafted in accordance with the above standards, selecting prohibited items. These include foreign liquor, foreign cigarettes, seafood, silk goods, cosmetics, ornaments, toys, musical instruments, some sugar products, meat, fruits, vegetables, as well as woolen goods, cotton goods, timber, paper, bamboo and wooden rattan products, earthen stoneware products, and liquid fuels for which substitutes can be found, totaling 234 tariff code numbers, all of which are subject to prohibition. The Ministry has already telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs to instruct all customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports from the date of receipt of the order.

In summary, after prohibiting the import of the above items, based on the import volume of the 1931 census, it is estimated that over 230 million yuan can be saved, equivalent to approximately US$68 million or £13 million. This huge amount of foreign exchange expenditure can then be diverted to purchase essential materials for the War of Resistance and national construction. This is merely a change in the use of foreign exchange for our country, and it is merely a change in the goods imported by various countries. In substance, the statistics of trade with China will not be greatly reduced, and full understanding from friendly countries can be obtained.

Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods

(1) In accordance with the 18 groups and 234 tariff code numbers of goods recorded by customs and listed in the attached table, the Ministry of Finance orders the Inspector General of Customs to instruct all customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports.

(2) The above-mentioned prohibited import goods shall not be reported for transit transport after the prohibition order is promulgated.

(3) For prohibited import goods, if they are to adjust the market price in the rear, supply special purposes, or have other legitimate reasons, and are approved by government agencies, the Ministry of Finance may review and issue a special purchase and transportation permit based on international needs. The regulations for issuing permits will be formulated separately.

(4) The provisions of these measures shall also apply to prohibited import goods that are sent by parcel post from overseas or transferred from domestic ports for transit. A detailed table of the names and code numbers of prohibited import goods will be published separately in newspapers.

Significance of Receiving Exchange Rate Difference

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement on the significance of the announced "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference for Export Goods": The significance and measures for prohibiting non-essential import goods have already been announced separately. At the same time, the Ministry has always regarded the issue of promoting export trade as extremely important. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade" was drafted, trade adjustment agencies were organized, and various adjustment measures were promulgated. In June of last year, measures to maintain production and promote exports were promulgated, in addition to using methods such as tax exemptions, guaranteed military tax, convenient transportation, and financial accommodation to assist merchants in operating export trade. Government trade agencies will also purchase from a distance to increase exports and boost production. However, recently, due to transportation difficulties and increased transportation of domestic products, the export volume has decreased. Under these circumstances, merchants are burdened with increased costs and insufficient capital, and they inevitably harbor doubts about operating exports. Foreign trading companies that have been operating exports in the country are also in an unusual trading situation or are even halting operations. All of this is hindering exports, which is contrary to the Ministry's original intention of maintaining the national economy. Due to the recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, in order to assist the stabilization effort and alleviate its difficulties, the Ministry has drafted "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference for Export Goods." Except for tung oil, tea leaves, pig bristles, and mineral products, which are related to barter trade and stockpiling, the remaining export goods must sell foreign exchange at the legal price to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. The Bank of China or the Bank of Communications will provide the equivalent legal price and the difference between the bank's selling price. In this way, most export goods can be freely transported and sold. The substantial exchange rate difference, after paying the fees, can still yield a surplus. All the difficulties of merchants are resolved by the government. The government's foreign exchange can still be concentrated on maintaining the legal currency and stabilizing the financial system. It can also promote exports and increase production, which is beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Measures for Receiving Exchange Rate Difference

(1) All export goods shall settle foreign exchange. Except for tung oil, tea leaves, pig bristles, and mineral products, which are related to barter trade and stockpiling and should be purchased and sold by government trade agencies at preferential prices on an ad hoc basis, taking into account production and sales conditions and international market prices, all other goods, whether transported and sold by government trade agencies or traded independently by commercial firms, must sell the foreign exchange earned at the legal price to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. The legal currency to be paid for the selling price shall be agreed upon by the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications with the person settling the foreign exchange and paid in legal currency at the designated increase.

(2) For the export goods that have settled foreign exchange at the legal price in the previous paragraph, after the actual settlement of the foreign exchange amount, a settlement certificate may be obtained and the legal price may be collected from the settling bank. The settling bank may collect the handling fee that the bank should obtain from the person settling the foreign exchange, but it shall not exceed 3%.

(3) The exchange fee in the previous paragraph shall be paid in legal currency at the inland location approved by the settlement bank with the consent of the person settling the foreign exchange.

### Tianjin × Arrogance Is Extremely High, Another British Resident Humiliated, Concession Advises British Residents Not to Leave the Concession Area, British Warship Arrives in Tianjin to Investigate Towboat Detained

[Reuters, Tianjin, 2nd] There have been no reports of foreigners being forcibly stripped and searched in recent days. This is largely due to the authorities' announcement advising British residents not to leave the sealed-off concession unless absolutely necessary. However, another incident occurred today. A young British man named Anderson, born in Tianjin and employed by the "Peking and Tientsin Times," went from the British Concession to the former German Concession this afternoon to visit his widowed mother, whom he had not seen for a long time. When he passed the barrier on Wilson Street, he showed his pass, which was passed on by a puppet police officer to a Japanese military policeman. The Japanese military policeman asked Anderson if he was British, and after receiving an affirmative answer, he handed the pass to a Japanese officer. The officer ordered Anderson to take off his hat, saying, "It is impolite not to take off your hat when talking." Anderson immediately complied. The officer then asked if Anderson could speak Chinese, and Anderson replied, "Yes," and was forced to remove his glasses and strip off his clothes for inspection. The Japanese officer then said, "Do you think you are British and don't need to be afraid?" He then struck Anderson in the face twice with the pass. He then threw the pass into the pile of clothes and allowed Anderson to put on his clothes and pass through the barrier. Later, when Anderson returned to the concession, he was not stopped at another barrier.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] According to foreign news from Tianjin, two towboats belonging to the British trading companies, Butterfield & Swire and Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Works, were detained by the Japanese side at Xinhe a few days ago. A British warship is scheduled to arrive here today to investigate everything.

### Domestically Produced Vegetable Oil Refined into Machine Oil: New Contribution from Tsinghua University Research Institute

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 1st] In view of China's huge demand for machine oil, the Tsinghua University Research Institute has recently been engaged in research and experimentation on refining machine oil from various domestically produced vegetable oils. The results show that the machine oil refined from flaxseed oil produced in Yunnan is the best. It is in no way inferior to imported machine oil, but the price is half as cheap. It was handed over to the Southwest Transportation Company by the Institute, and the results were very good.

### Air Raid on Li Huang; Enemy Planes Spied on Jiangxi Twice

[Central News Agency, Li Huang, 1st] On the 30th, at 8:20 AM, eleven enemy planes, and at 1:00 PM, six enemy planes, successively swooped down on Li Huang, dropping seventy or eighty bombs. Dozens of civilian houses inside and outside the city were destroyed, and dozens of people were killed or injured, creating a very tragic situation. Liu Zhenru, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Executive Committee, in addition to dispatching all working comrades of the Provincial Executive Committee and students of the cadre training class to conduct propaganda in different directions, also consulted with the Central Relief Committee and specially dispatched Dharma Master Changhong to allocate an emergency aid of 2,000 yuan. At the same time, he ordered the Li Huang County Party Department to cooperate with the County Government to investigate the households affected by the disaster, compile a register and submit a report, so that the Provincial Party Department can preside over the distribution.

[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 1st] Four enemy planes spied on Jiangxi in two separate waves today. The first wave, consisting of two planes, intruded from the border at 8:00 AM, spying on the border areas such as Suichuan, Huiyuan, and Ningdu. They then turned towards Nanfeng and fled. The second wave, consisting of two planes, took off from northern Jiangxi at 1:00 PM, circled over Shanggao for about ten minutes, and then left.

### Hebei Guerrilla Force; Appears and Disappears Like Ghosts; Attacks Trains and Seizes Enemy Armaments; Enemy Ammunition Explodes in Shijiazhuang

[Reuters, Beijing, 2nd] Guerrilla forces on both sides in the Beijing area have been extremely active this week, achieving remarkable feats. According to military sources, two trains were recently destroyed. One was 25 [distance unit missing] from Beijing, and the other was in Jixian, northern Henan, where the Japanese army had newly built a railway [number of] people to Kaifeng. This week, along the Xiaohan Railway, Dingxian was in contact [with the enemy]. The Japanese army and Chinese guerrillas, totaling 25,000 men, engaged in fierce battles. Reliable news from Shijiazhuang states that many wounded Japanese soldiers are being transported there, mostly from Shanxi. Guerrilla forces in central and western Shanxi are extremely active, frequently attacking the Japanese army.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 2nd] According to reliable sources, Chinese guerrilla forces have recently repeatedly attacked Japanese-occupied areas in Tianjin, seizing large quantities of armaments and bullets. Residents in the concessions can hear gunfire.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 1st] On the 13th of last month at noon, bombs used on enemy planes, along with other vehicles, were transported by train to Shijiazhuang. When they were being unloaded at the Zhengtailu Vehicle Factory, the ammunition depot caught fire that night and exploded with a loud noise, completely engulfed in flames. More than forty enemy soldiers in the factory were killed and more than ten were injured.

### Changsha Newspaper Friends; First National Monthly Meeting

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 1st] More than 300 newspaper friends from Changsha held their first National Monthly Meeting this morning. At the same time, they initiated a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, requesting that July 1st be designated as "Newspaper Friends' Day." Today, all newspapers in Changsha are sold at a price five percent below the original price when wholesaled to newspaper vendors, as a small gesture to promote Newspaper Friends' Day.

### Two Japanese Merchants in Shanghai; Sell Tin Ingots; Result in Arrest

When they attempted to transport 280 tin ingots to Nanshi for sale for the third time, they were discovered by Japanese military police, who arrested the two on charges of transporting prohibited goods and treason, and severely punished them.

### The Fall of Shantou City (4)

— Lin Gao

Six

The night gradually deepened. The enemy planes, enemy boats, and enemy artillery all ceased their activities, and weariness replaced terror, creeping into people's minds and bodies.

"Oh no! Shantou is on fire!"

In the northern center of the city, a wisp of white smoke rose, with a burning red flame below it. Then, a second and a third fire started, all connected together. Half the sky was dyed red, and sparks flew up like "setting off fireworks." The faint sound of explosions could be heard.

The searchlights on the enemy warships turned on. A strong beam of light, like a long tongue spat out by a venomous snake, greedily gnawed at the houses, stacks, and docks on the shore. Shantou, about to fall into the clutches of the devil, turned into scorched earth. How disheartened and anxious were the Chinese watching this beautiful place lost. The searchlight constantly shifted back and forth between the towering buildings.

On the 22nd, the sky was slightly lighter. An enemy boat docked by the breakwater. Two dark green [animal] carrying a flag like blood droplets splattered on the sun, climbed onto the breakwater and used a bamboo pole to erect the flag on a wooden boat inside the pond. They immediately slipped back into the boat, paused for a moment, but seeing that everything was still calm, they climbed back onto the breakwater, waving flag signals like monkeys.

Then another enemy boat docked at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf. Ten enemy soldiers divided into three groups, walking lightly, slightly stooped. They slowly walked from the China Merchants Bureau pier, turned a corner, and entered a small alley leading north to the China Merchants Road. Suddenly, as if they had touched electricity, they all retreated and leaned against the wall. After a long time, they continued to move forward step by step.

Enemy troops in formation landed at the Yuanheng Wharf, the China Merchants Wharf, and in front of the Customs House. In the distance, there was a burst of sporadic gunfire, but then everything was quiet. The enemy flag, with blood droplets splattered, also flew on the flagpole of the Chao-Hai Customs. Enemy flags were hung in many places along the coast, on the docks, and on the high buildings behind the foreign stacks. Turning around, the emblems of the robbers were also spread all over Jiaoshi Mountain.

The beautiful city of Shantou thus fell into enemy hands, allowing the enemy to trample and ravage it.

A large, wide-bellied boat loaded with soybean cakes was docked in front of the Customs House, likely unable to move out of the harbor when the enemy warships entered. The enemy troops recruited many vagrants, and an officer held a flag and stood next to them, allowing them to carry the cakes. The entire boat, with nearly 2,000 soybean cakes worth six to seven thousand yuan, was looted in less than ten minutes. More than 100 compatriots and foreigners on the Guang Sheng Wheel all witnessed this fact of the enemy troops directing vagrants to loot.

Around 11 o'clock, a friend and his family boarded a motorboat used by foreigners. He said that on the night of the 21st, when there were no enemy planes, he wanted to escape Shantou City to avoid falling into enemy hands, but the streets were guarded by troops and they could not pass, so they escaped to the homes of foreigners. This morning, enemy troops were stationed at key traffic points in the city, searching pedestrians and robbing them of their belongings, and directing vagrants to loot property. They had borrowed a motorboat from foreigners and sailed directly from Qilu Beach, so they were able to reach the ship safely.

The clock on the Chao-Hai Customs House pointed to noon at twelve o'clock. The Guang Sheng Wheel set sail, passing by dozens of enemy warships with a mix of worry and anger. The enemy warships were unloading horses and armaments onto boats. An hour after the ship had sailed, the enemy ships were no longer visible, and there were no creek boats with sails scattered as usual. It was just a lonely expanse. There were no more searches. My heart was filled with anger, shame, and nostalgia.

Around four o'clock, the ship passed the boundary of Huilai County. Looking at the brown and yellow interspersed mountain peaks, I knew that the enemy must not have reached there yet. Friends, they must be at the foot of those mountain peaks, preparing for guerrilla warfare. Shantou City is within the range of the enemy navy and has no obstacles to defend, so its fall was expected long ago. Materials are scarce, and the elderly, weak, women, and children have mostly been evacuated. The enemy can occupy Shantou City, but they absolutely cannot occupy all the counties under Chaozhou. In places with undulating peaks and mountains, the enemy's armaments are ineffective. That will be the enemy's graveyard. The enemy's manpower and resources are exhausted. Occupying Shantou City will not only not gain him anything, but will accelerate his demise!

At 7:00 AM on the 23rd, the Guang Sheng Wheel arrived in Hong Kong. After some twists and turns, all the righteous people on the ship were finally able to disembark at noon. The airplanes resounding in the Hong Kong sky were no longer the robbers spreading the seeds of murder, but most of those enjoying the revelry were our compatriots. (The End)

### Ambush and Annihilation of Enemy Troops in the Suburbs of Changzhou; Traffic Between Yu, Wuxi, and Changzhou Severed; Successful Surprise Attack on Hushu, Suzhou

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] According to sources from foreigners in Shanghai, the guerrillas along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway have been increasingly active in recent months. Long-distance buses in Changzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other counties have been suspended for two months. Two weeks ago, a fierce battle took place in the suburbs of Changzhou. Three thousand enemy troops were surrounded by us, and we launched a fierce attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. After completing the annihilation mission, our troops retreated. It is also reported that a fierce battle took place in Hushu, Suzhou. Our troops bombed the wooden houses where the enemy troops were stationed at night, killing 25 enemy troops, with only two wounded escaping. After our troops burned the wooden houses, they demolished several miles of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, so the railway has been closed for several days.

### Fierce Battles in Guerrilla Areas; Intense Contact in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] The enemy is now trying to pacify the rear and their attacks on the occupied areas are still fierce, especially in China. Contact is constant in southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and southern Hebei. Our regular army and guerrillas are closely coordinated, and a planned guerrilla warfare is being launched, which will yield great results in the short term. The enemy is busy mobilizing on the Jinpu, Pinghan, and Longhai lines, seemingly for troop rotation.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guilin, 1st] Our troops in southern Guangdong are approaching Taipingchang, Luotan, and the surrounding areas. About 3,000 enemy troops are under our control. The enemy has increased troops by about 3,000 to Shilong and Shitan, with unclear intentions.

Stabilization in the Chaozhou-Jieyang Area; Our Troops Victorious in Attacking Dahao

[Central News Agency, Xingning, 30th] Our troops launched a surprise attack on Dahao on the night of the 29th. The enemy was caught off guard and more than 30 enemy troops were killed by us, and they retreated towards the east.

[Rapid News from Continental News Agency, Xingning] The battle situation in the Chaoan area in recent days. The enemy army seems to have entered a state of suspension, only sending a part of the cavalry to threaten the eastern section of the Chao-Jie Highway, in order to contain us. On the 1st and 2nd, contact was continuous along both banks of the Han River within Jieyang, and the battle situation was chaotic.

[Continental News Agency, Huiyang Dispatch] Tian'an Xuanwu Temple and Longyan Mountain in Lufeng County have always been the lairs of long-haired bandits, who secretly set up organizations and plotted to stir up trouble. After repeated suppressions by military police, they have slightly restrained themselves. However, they have recently become rampant again, engaging in activities everywhere. In order to fundamentally eliminate bandits and avoid affecting the rear of the War of Resistance, Zou Wangzhen, the commander of the Lufeng County Security Regiment and the commander of the reserve brigade, and Dui Ruzhou, the magistrate of Lufeng County and the commander of the Self-Defense Regiment, have cooperated in dispatching teams and ordered township heads and Baojia chiefs to carry out suppression and appeasement simultaneously, and issued an announcement allowing self-renewal. It is reported that more than 100 party members in Xuanwu Temple have voluntarily shaved their heads and carried weapons to surrender, willing to serve the country.

[Rapid News from Continental News Agency, Xijiang] The battle in Jiangmen and Xinhui has shifted from relaxation to tension in recent days. Our troops, in coordination with the Fifth Guerrilla Detachment, fiercely besieged Jiangmen and Xinhui. Yesterday, after recapturing Daxiaomeishan, we advanced towards Xinhui City. One day, our vanguard troops had already stormed into Xinhui City, and the enemy troops were fleeing in succession and planned to continue to resist stubbornly. Military authorities here reported that the enemy troops in Xinhui had been completely evacuated to reinforce Chaozhou and Shantou. The current defense force is weak. The enemy troops in Jiangmen, under the constant pressure of our troops, have fallen into a state of encirclement on all sides, and the situation is shaking. There is a possibility of a complete general retreat.

[Central News Agency, Xuwen, 1st] More than 400 enemy troops in Maicheng County, Hainan Island, invaded Shishandao Hall and other places under the county. They were ambushed by our guerrillas in separate routes and fought fiercely throughout the day. The enemy was defeated and retreated to Bailian. In this battle, we killed the enemy chieftain, Tian Chengichiro, and more than 20 other enemy soldiers.

Recovery of Pianguan, Northern Shanxi; Enemy Invasion of Western Shanxi Suffers Losses and Retreats

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 1st] On the night of the 28th, the main force of our troops launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Pianguan. After a fierce battle all night, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and fled in panic. We then recovered Pianguan at 4:00 AM on the 29th and are now taking advantage of the situation to pursue the enemy.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] Military report: On the 29th, more than 2,000 enemy troops from Hongdong, Qiaocheng, and Fenxi invaded westwards.

We once attacked Fenshuling village and launched a fierce attack on the enemy with hand grenades. More than 30 enemy troops were killed or wounded. After a fierce battle for several hours, we safely withdrew after the mission was accomplished.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 1st] In the Xiaan Yun area, the enemy situation has not changed recently. We are still actively attacking and sabotaging along railways and highways.

### Germany Intensifies Military Preparations in Danzig; Britain and France Determined to Fulfill Obligations to Poland; Italy Intends to Take This Opportunity to Make Demands on France

[Reuters, Danzig, 1st] Whether Hitler will visit Danzig at the end of July to accept the title of Honorary Citizen of Danzig, conferred by the citizens of Danzig on his birthday, has not yet been confirmed as of today. However, all preparations are being intensified. The local National Socialist Party's newspaper today discussed the relationship between the interests of Britain and France and Danzig, strongly arguing that Danzig must be returned to Germany. As for when the appropriate time will be, Hitler will declare it himself. Poland's current difficulty lies in whether to take action before the situation develops further, or to wait until the National Socialist Party's preparations are all completed before launching its move. Although the National Socialist Party denies taking any military action, news contrary to the denial is constantly leaking out. The National Socialist Party's dockyard has been closed for two nights, and even the night watchmen are not allowed to stay in the dockyard. It is said that after the armaments arrive there, they are transferred elsewhere by car. It has become a public fact that troops from East Prussia are driving through the city of Danzig in cars. The hotel directly opposite the central railway station has been used for offices for officials. A notice was issued at the beginning of this week to requisition horses, followed by all automobiles. All automobile owners have received notices ordering them to prepare everything in order to respond to the emergency. The Albin Road, which leads directly to East Prussia, is extremely important militarily. It has now been locked down and private vehicles are not allowed to pass through. Road repairs are being intensified, and all materials have been stockpiled so that a pontoon bridge can be built across the Vistula River at Lesbitter within an hour. At the same time, the unconfirmed but un-denied rumor of the devaluation of the Polish currency has caused great fluctuations in local business. Both sides are now trying to avoid any provocative acts. The National Socialist Party has no intention of launching a large-scale attack. Poland seems to be taking a monitoring stance. Today, all British newspapers were confiscated. It is explained that this is to keep local residents from being aware of the external situation. However, people of all levels are gradually feeling that Germany's military actions in Danzig will inevitably lead to direct action by Britain and France.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck met this afternoon with Chatajski, the Polish commissioner to Danzig, who had returned from Danzig, to hear a report on the German Nazi Party's military preparations in Danzig. It is expected that the two may have discussed the form of a memorandum to be sent to the Danzig Senate, asking the Senate to explain the reasons for the military preparations in the demilitarized zone of Danzig. Well-informed sources do not believe that these military preparations dare be a prelude to a sudden move, given the warning issued by British Foreign Secretary Halifax. It is generally believed that the Nazi Party is now adopting a strategy of small attacks, each individual action making it impossible to regard it as an infringement of Poland's independence, but the aim is to squeeze Poland out of this free city without firing a shot, so as to achieve its wish. However, the Polish government has repeatedly declared that Poland cannot tolerate any infringement of its rights in Danzig, and British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech has had the effect of strengthening Poland's attitude.

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] The political magazine "International Relations" wrote, "If Britain and France attempt to maintain the status quo in Danzig, a large-scale European war is almost unavoidable." In an unsigned commentary, believed to be instructed by others, a warning was issued to Britain and France that the military strength of the Axis powers would automatically act to prevent the democratic countries from interfering in the Danzig issue. At the same time, Italy will take this opportunity to satisfy its territorial and financial demands on France. The article also warned Turkey, advising it to stay out of Balkan affairs.

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British ambassador to Poland, Kenfylde, has returned to London by plane and will immediately meet with the Foreign Secretary. Today, after visiting the Foreign Office, Kenfylde had lunch at the Polish Embassy in Britain. News from Paris said that the French ambassador to Poland is currently in Paris and met with the Foreign Minister yesterday. Paris sources said that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has stated that Britain will fulfill its obligations to Poland and that Britain and France's attitude towards Danzig has not changed.

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British ambassador to Poland visited the Foreign Office again this morning and met with Foreign Secretary Halifax. After leaving the Foreign Office, he went to the Polish Embassy and had lunch with the Polish ambassador. In the next few days, the diplomatic representatives of Britain stationed in major capitals will gather in London. The British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, is also among them.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 2nd] The British ambassador to Paris, Phelps, visited French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday afternoon. According to political sources, the French Foreign Minister will take advantage of the British ambassador's visit to communicate in detail the decisions made at the French ministerial meeting on Saturday.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Bonnet invited German Ambassador Weizsäcker to the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon to discuss the current situation. According to well-informed circles, the French Foreign Minister communicated the French cabinet's decision on the Danzig issue and the French ambassador's report from Warsaw on the Polish government's desire to deal with the reorganization of the Free City of Danzig.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd] Local newspapers reported news from Paris stating that French Foreign Minister Bonnet reiterated the French government's views on Danzig to the Polish ambassador again on Saturday, and stated that if the Polish government implements the maintenance of Danzig's sovereignty, it must obtain the full assistance of Britain and France. The Polish ambassador declared that if there is an attempt to annex Danzig to Germany, the Polish government will respond with force.

[London, 1st] Foreign News: If the rumors circulating in London at this time are believed to be true, Germany will have surprising new moves occur within this month or August. This may be the one that determines victory or defeat. It is expected that Germany, when it has reached its highest peak of its military power and effectiveness, will act immediately, and military experts believe that Germany can reach this highest peak this summer. In addition, there is another matter that is sufficient to make people angry, and a new crisis is imminent, that is, the tripartite military talks between the land, sea, and air forces of Germany and Italy have now been completed, and some observers also pointed out that the reorganization of the German and Italian armies according to the Axis plan will soon be completed. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler is currently planning to take action in Slovakia and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, because after the Nazi Party seized Slovakia, it can exert more effective pressure on other countries in the Danube River basin, and can use the excuse of "recovering lost territories" to prevent Hungary from interfering when Germany takes military action against Poland. However, some military experts believe that Germany's preparations for war on the borders of East Prussia and Slovakia cannot be completed in less than a few months. From this point of view, Germany's actual military actions against Poland will not begin until next spring. It is known that Germany currently lacks workers and materials to build defensive battles, which greatly reduces Germany's chances of victory, because Poland has thus gained sufficient time to build its defense lines.

### Britain Decides to Resist Aggression; Sinclair Advocates Government Reorganization; Belkin Speech to Defend Small Countries

[Reuters, London, 1st] Sir Sinclair, leader of the [party name missing] Party, stated today that anyone who seeks to force Britain or countries that have accepted British guarantees to fight will find that there are no defeatists in our country, that our armaments are sharp and that our sources are inexhaustible, and that the initiator will encounter our strong resistance and cannot hope that we will willingly submit to the violence of aggression. Sinclair said that the Munich Agreement only made peace more difficult, so cooperation with the Soviet Union is urgently needed. Sinclair concluded by advocating government reorganization and inviting Churchill and Eden to take key positions in the cabinet.

[Reuters, London, 1st] Supply Minister Belkin said in a speech at a government banquet today, "A very small number of people, out of the world's 2 billion people, want to monopolize the entire civilized world in 1939, but the whole world has refused to accept this attitude. The entire British nation and empire have united with the United States to form a vast group of public opinion, and many small countries are united with Britain and the United States. These small countries all hope not to be interfered with by the outside world. We have reorganized our armaments, not only to protect ourselves (anyone who tries to attack Britain will sign their death sentence), but also because small countries find that gentle words still fail to prevent being destroyed and annexed." When [he] discussed the peace group being called [policy name missing] policy, [he] said, "I would like to make clear to every man and woman in Germany that Britain is Germany's man, but no insane country can recognize that the empire is a mature orchard that can be picked at will. We have the world's most powerful navy, and the air force has developed beyond imagination, and we have a rigorously trained and mechanized army, all equipped with the latest weapons. What we are most pleased with is the outstanding spirit of the people, not afraid of threats, determined to pursue peace, but this also has a certain limit."

[Reuters, London, 1st] Sir Cripps said in a speech today, "We will never tolerate being ruled by others, or losing our freedom, and being subject to others. If anyone attempts to do so, we are prepared to rise up and defend, and will collect all resources and unite with allied countries to fight to the end. Today, no one doubts that the war crisis will erupt within three months. No matter how terrible the future situation is, most of the people of our country are prepared to fight for what they love and are willing to sacrifice."

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] The responsible authorities, agencies, and newspapers in Britain, under the leadership of the government, have successively warned Germany not to recklessly invade other countries. The speeches of the authorities and the editorials of the newspapers all stated that Britain has reorganized its armaments and is determined to fight decisively when necessary, and that the whole country should unite to deal with the situation with a firm attitude. All this is to make the German side understand Britain's determination to fight, so that Europe may not be caused a major war because of the Danzig issue. According to unconfirmed news, the government intends to expand the range of conscription ages. It is also said that the British fleet is prepared to move out at any time, and as for the expansion of the British air force, those who have seen it should also marvel at it as a miracle. The air force is scheduled to hold exercises on the 8th of this month, and the scale of it will create an unprecedented record in history.

### Serious International Situation: France Prepares Large Sums for Military Expansion; General Gamelin Cancels Trip to North Africa

[Reuters, London, 1st] Today, French Premier Daladier reported to the cabinet meeting that the international situation "remains extremely serious." A Polish government spokesperson stated that Poland has begun to take countermeasures to address the Nazi Party's agitation towards Danzig. Poland is "closely monitoring" the recent developments in Danzig and will deal with the Nazi Party's actions with appropriate measures. Although the Nazi Party has engaged in various provocative actions in Danzig recently, Poland has no intention of causing conflict. However, in view of the fact that German stormtroopers are secretly infiltrating Danzig, Poland is also sending young people to disrupt the situation. Today, Polish people began to move into Danzig. It is widely rumored in London and Paris that the Nazi Party will launch an attack this weekend, but this has not been officially confirmed. A diplomatic correspondent for the London "Times" commented on this matter, and his opinion can be regarded as semi-official. The newspaper stated that Germany's actions are a deliberate attempt to trap Poland in the position of aggressor. Various newspapers stated that Britain and Poland believe that any military action, whether it occurs inside or outside the free city, constitutes an act of war. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the British Foreign Secretary is staying in London for the weekend to monitor all developments.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] The cabinet held a state council meeting this morning to discuss the current situation in Europe. Premier Daladier first presented a report, stating that the situation in Europe is indeed very serious. Immediately afterwards, it was decided to take various measures to strengthen the country's power, so as to dispel any doubts about France's strong determination. The most important measures include two items: (1) In addition to the national defense bonds issued in April of this year for 15,000,000,000 francs, an additional 4,400,000,000 francs will be raised to accelerate the expansion of military equipment. (2) The terms of the wartime national organization of France will be expanded.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] General Gamelin, the Chief of the General Staff of National Defense, originally planned to visit Corsica Island in the Mediterranean Sea to inspect defense, but this has now been cancelled. It is believed by some that this is due to the renewed tension in the European situation.

[Haitong Press, Paris, 2nd] French Premier Daladier, Interior Minister Sarraut, Justice Minister Marchandeau, and Paris Prefect Langeron held a meeting at the Ministry of War yesterday. According to informed sources, the main issue of this meeting was the handling of foreigners residing in France during wartime.

### Anglo-Franco-Soviet Negotiations Proceeding Smoothly: Soviet Union Considers New Anglo-French Proposals; Hopeful for Successful Conclusion

[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] The British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union and the British government special envoy Strang jointly visited the Soviet Foreign Minister and Deputy Minister today for a two-hour meeting. Afterwards, Strang stated that the Soviet government is currently considering the final proposal of the Anglo-French agreement and that another meeting will be held soon. This morning, French Foreign Minister Bonnet presented the original text of the Anglo-French proposals recently submitted to the Soviet Union for review at the Paris State Council meeting. According to official sources, Bonnet reported to the State Council that the negotiations are progressing very smoothly. Bonnet visited the Soviet Ambassador to France this morning. Premier Daladier reported to the State Council on the steps taken to clarify French objectives and also reported on the laws regarding national defense preparations.

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] French diplomatic figures are extremely optimistic about the future of the Moscow negotiations and firmly believe that the Anglo-Franco-Soviet talks have reached a stage where they can be concluded quickly and successfully.

[London, 1st] Foreign news: A well-known political correspondent stated that a gentlemanly war is currently taking place within the British Chamberlain cabinet. The two sides are Foreign Secretary Halifax on one side and Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon and Interior Minister Hoare on the other. Simon and Hoare are strongly opposed to the Anglo-Soviet agreement, while Halifax is the main proponent of this agreement. It is said that the frustration caused by the guarantee of Poland's sea issues has made Halifax's side feel quite satisfied, but Halifax remains extremely vigilant and has no doubts.

### US Senate Discusses Currency Act; Senators Employ Delaying Tactics

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The compromise plan passed by the joint conference of the House and Senate on the currency issue (deciding to restore the government's power to purchase silver from abroad and change the gold content of the US dollar) was submitted to the Senate for discussion on the afternoon of the 30th. Senator Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland, first adopted delaying tactics, delivering a long speech explaining his reasons for opposing it. Then, Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, also opposed submitting the compromise plan to a vote using the same tactics. His speech was incessant until midnight, when the current currency expired, before he finished speaking. Therefore, the government authorities will inevitably have to submit a new bill to the House and Senate to remedy the situation. Observers have issued arguments on the results of last night's Senate discussion, saying that after this year, the president will have no power to adjust the gold content of the US dollar, and the $200 million stabilization fund has no legal basis. The government's purchase of silver from abroad has no fixed price and should be based on the world market price. Only the 1934 Silver Purchase Act is still valid, and the Ministry of Finance can still purchase silver as needed.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] The joint conference of the House and Senate passed a compromise plan last night, stipulating that (1) President Roosevelt still has the power to change the gold content of the US dollar and purchase foreign silver; (2) the Exchange Stabilization Fund can continue to be maintained (the total amount of the fund is $200 million); (3) the domestic silver purchase price is set at 70 cents per ounce. The House of Representatives passed the bill today by a vote of 229 to 160 and immediately transferred it to the Senate for discussion. However, opposition senators in the Senate still sought to obstruct it, intending to use delaying tactics to prevent the compromise plan from being submitted to a vote before midnight today. Republican Senators Townsend, Vandenberg, Taft, and Democratic Senators Adams and O'Mahoney all intended to deliver lengthy speeches at the meeting to consume time. Senator Hall, an opponent of the bill, told a Havas reporter that he would speak for at least two or three hours. According to their strategy, even if successful, the government can still continue to purchase silver from abroad because the House of Representatives has already passed it.

### British Labour Congress Issues Declaration Appealing to Germans for Peace; Britain Determined Not to Yield to Threats of Force; Only Peaceful Cooperation Can Build Happiness

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British National Labour Congress, representing trade unions and the Labour Party, has drafted a declaration appealing to the German people and urging labor personnel around the world to insist that all disputes must be resolved by reason rather than war. The declaration begins, "Why kill each other?" and then questions who is responsible for the current situation. It then appeals to the German people, saying, "Some of you may say that Germany has been surrounded by its enemies and that they are trying to destroy your country and make it impossible for the German people's economic life to continue. Therefore, European peace is threatened. This statement is a blatant lie, and your propaganda minister knows it. It is true that many countries in Europe have united with each other to seek self-defense. The British Labour Party has promoted this policy to the government, not to harm Germany, but to prevent the success of aggression and thereby preserve world peace. All the events that led to the tragic annexation of Czechoslovakia have convinced us that your government's aim is nothing more than to dominate all of Europe and enslave humanity. Now, similar war preparations are underway. Your government is currently engaging in false propaganda and disruptive agitation in an attempt to strike at Poland. You should understand the facts, because if this situation continues, the result will be war... From our point of view, butter is better than cannons. What we cannot tolerate is that our freedom, peace, and security cannot be threatened by the selfishness of dictators. We must not continue to appease dictators by yielding to threats of force. Only peaceful cooperation can build a world of happiness, security, and development. We not only have no intention of surrounding your country and then destroying it; on the contrary, we sincerely welcome you to join this circle."

[Reuters, London, 1st] Reuters has learned that the British Labour Congress's message to the German people will be broadcast by a secret radio station, and it is said that it will be relayed by all German underground organizations (it is rumored that Germany has such organizations). The Labour Congress has done everything possible to ensure that the message can reach at least some German workers, and it hopes that the workers who receive the message can spread it by word of mouth.

### India Agrees to Send Representatives to Washington to Attend Cotton Export Conference

[Reuters, Simla, 2nd] The Indian government has said it has accepted an invitation to send representatives to Washington to attend a conference of cotton exporting countries to discuss the possibility of establishing a world cotton agreement.

### Italian Military Aircraft Collide During Exercise

(Haitong Press, Rome, 2nd) Two Italian military aircraft suddenly collided yesterday while practicing in the sky near Viterbo. Both planes crashed and were completely destroyed, killing all five people on board.

### Actively Increasing Aircraft Production: Minister of Aviation Delivers Speech; Weekly Expenditure of Two Million Pounds

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] Minister of Aviation Wood delivered a speech in Leamington yesterday, providing a very detailed account of the large-scale expansion of the British Air Force. He said that although the figures for the increase in British aircraft are military secrets and cannot be disclosed, he can tell everyone that the government's expenditure on manufacturing aircraft is 2 million pounds per week. From this figure, it is not difficult to know how Britain is increasing the number of aircraft. The government has formulated a plan to rapidly increase the production of aircraft in large quantities. This will have a very large impact in wartime.

### Rumor of Mutual Assistance Agreement Between Egypt and Turkey; Italy Feels Uneasy

[Central News Agency, Rome, August 30th] Regarding the rumor that Egypt and Turkey are about to sign a mutual assistance agreement, the Telegrafo newspaper (Foreign Minister Ciano's mouthpiece) recently commented on it, clearly indicating that if this agreement is established, Italy will have to increase its troops in its North African territory of Libya in response. In addition, the Fascist Party feels uneasy about Turkey joining the Anglo-French guarantee front. This sentiment is expressed by the Telegrafo, which states that after the outbreak of war, Turkey will inevitably send troops to Egypt to help defend the security of the Suez Canal. This borders Italian territory and Egypt, and will be a very serious threat. Therefore, if the Turkish-Egyptian mutual assistance agreement is declared under the auspices of Britain and France, the Italian government will sooner or later send an important note to the British ambassador, informing him that the Anglo-Italian agreement of April-June 1938 had a provision for the exchange of military intelligence between the two countries and urging him to pay attention to it.

### German Army and Air Force Suddenly Parade and Perform; Residents of Berlin Alarmed

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 2nd] Yesterday, motorized units of the army suddenly paraded on the main roads here, and aircraft performed aerial displays, causing great alarm among the residents of the city.

### Japan Registers Private Gold; Foreign Residents Also Subject to This Restriction

[Haitong Press, Tokyo, 1st] Japan is currently conducting a registration of privately owned cash. The registration began today. The purpose of this move is to ascertain the total amount of gold remaining in private hands, so that it can be sold to the government. Foreigners in Japan are also required to register their gold, but they are not forced to hand it over to the Japanese government.

### German and Italian Fleets; Germany Launches Another New Ship

[Reuters, London, 1st] In addition to the Soviet fleet conducting exercises in the Black Sea and near Vladivostok, the German and Italian navies are also conducting exercises on foreign seas. Several German destroyers will conduct exercises off the Norwegian coast for three weeks. Four Italian ships, including a 23,000-ton battleship and eight 10,000-ton cruisers, are scheduled to visit the port of Tangier in northwestern Africa on Sunday.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Germany's fifth 10,000-ton cruiser built after the war was launched today in the port of Bremen. It was initially expected that Hitler would attend the launch ceremony, but he remained in his retreat in Obersalzberg. Therefore, this launch ceremony became "non-political." The ceremony was presided over by German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder.

[Haitong Press, Bremen, 2nd] Yesterday, Germany's newest 10,000-ton heavy cruiser, the "Lützow," was launched at the Weser Shipyard here. German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder personally attended the ceremony. The naming ceremony was presided over by Mrs. Olders, the wife of the captain of the Lützow, a German ship that was sunk by its own crew during the European War. Commander-in-Chief Raeder also presided over the opening ceremony of the Hitler Bridge over the Weser River on the same day.

Commentary

### ×××× Britain

The Tianjin Incident, Tokyo Negotiations, the Danzig Question... From the Far East to Northern Europe, the demands of the aggressors are all closing in on ××××!

The Tianjin Incident concerns the survival of Britain's entire Far Eastern interests. At the Tokyo negotiations, to be held on the 6th of this month, Britain will certainly not accept any topic in which Japan involves its "New Order" in East Asia. Even less can it consider Tokyo as a Munich. It can only attempt to seek a compromise in the so-called local and partial issues. However, such a compromise will only increase Japan's arrogance and make future troubles even more serious.

As for the Danzig Question, Hitler is determined to get it, and Mussolini is now also coming out to extort. On the one hand, this is the "taking advantage of danger and plunder" by the European aggressors, and on the other hand, it is also supporting Japan's extortion and robbery in the East. Regarding the Danzig Question, Foreign Secretary Halifax has already made a "resistance," but Britain and France's own power to guarantee Poland is highly doubtful without the assistance of the Soviet Union. Then, the result of this "toughness" will not be much better than the result of his "concessions" in the Far East.

Where is Britain, under siege, going?

The path to survival is clear. The British people have seen it clearly, and the British government has not failed to have its own opinions. That is to establish a road of opposing aggressive red lines. In the Far East, it must actively support China, which has the same interests and has been resisting strategically for two years. In Europe, it must quickly abandon the "wishful thinking" of the already shrinking "transforming Hitler's path" and accelerate the completion of the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement.

Today's news reports that British diplomacy will have new activities and that ambassadors stationed abroad will be summoned to a meeting. We expect this to be a manifestation of taking the road to survival!

Spring and Autumn

### The German Emperor's Mistake: One Misstep, Eternal Regret

Mr. Adolf Hitler, long time no see. Lately, you seem to be a little on edge, wanting to stir things up. Good, anyway, Britain has the navy, France has the air force, the Soviet Union has the army, the United States has the money; and we Chinese have a Great Wall of 450 million flesh and blood. Whatever you want to play, we will have to accompany you.

However, we are a land of propriety and righteousness, so we must first be polite before resorting to arms. Let us remind you: do you still remember the humiliation of the 1918 defeat? Although you blame the Jews for this failure—regardless of whether you say there were too many British and Jewish officers or too few German Jewish officers—General Ludendorff blamed it on the German people not being resilient enough—naturally, he had nothing to do with people starving—; your backstage boss, Mr. Losson, attributed this failure to Germany not having enough money—of course, the marks in his own pocket are another matter—. But what we see is also a reason for the failure: that was the mistake made by your Great Emperor, Wilhelm II. One misstep led to such eternal regret. Let me tell you, believe it or not.

Friend, please turn to your domestic history textbooks. Back in 1904, King Leopold II of Belgium came to Berlin to pay his respects; your Emperor Wilhelm invited him to review the troops.

"I am really not interested in these; I think money is the key to everything." The Belgian king said during the military review. Leopold II was then one of the richest people in the world. The Congo Free State, four times the size of France and eighty-four times the size of Belgium itself, was his private property, from which he could earn 3,300,000 francs annually.

This is what harmed your Emperor Wilhelm. On the evening before Leopold was about to bid farewell, Wilhelm II told him that in the near future, a Franco-German war would be unavoidable. At that time, if Belgium could not remain neutral and instead fight with Germany, Germany would be willing to give Luxembourg and Limburg to Leopold as trinkets.

Money is the key to everything! After returning to Brussels, Leopold II actually started training troops, preparing to take over Luxembourg and Limburg.

Unfortunately, heaven did not grant him many years. On December 17, 1909, Leopold II passed away; he had trained 42,800 soldiers, but he never saw the two fertile lands.

At 7:00 PM on August 2, 1914, a German ultimatum was sent to Belgium, requesting permission for German troops to pass freely through Belgian territory to France. Wilhelm II thought that the current Belgian King Albert was Leopold II's nephew, born in Saxon-Coburg, Germany; Queen Elizabeth was from Bavaria, Germany; with such kinship and friendship, letting them pass should not be a problem. So, he sent a telegram to King Albert in his personal capacity, asking for mutual cooperation.

This telegram arrived at the Louvain Palace on the morning of August 4. Wilhelm II never expected that King Albert would be furious, considering this telegram a great insult to him. Immediately, he ordered his 42,800 troops to go to the border and automatically blow up all the roads and bridges.

Queen Elizabeth, a true German, looked at the telegram from Wilhelm II and the German ultimatum again and again, reading it without missing a single word. Then, on the back of the telegram, she wrote a reply in fluent German: "Cannot comply with your request." Similarly, a telegram had already been sent to Paris. Five hours later, four German divisions had begun to rush into the Belgian border.

However, Belgium had already had troops and had made preparations, and under extremely difficult circumstances, it held out for two weeks, allowing France to take all necessary measures. Wilhelm II's dream of reaching Paris in three days never came true, and the dream of conquering the world became a bubble!

Mr. Hitler, this should be a lesson for you!

Okay, Mr. Adolf Hitler, we'll see you again in Tannenberg! Because, I'm afraid that's where your grave will be!

### One Person Per Day

George Bernard Shaw

This self-proclaimed king of humor, Bernard Shaw, when he had not yet made his fortune, worked in a small newspaper office in London, writing drama reviews to make a living.

The old Shaw was indeed quite picky, so many of the performers at the time were not on good terms with him.

Once in a hotel, he criticized a famous actor and got into an argument. The famous actor was a master of playing heroes, and immediately struck a pose and threw a card at the old Shaw before walking away with his head held high.

This meant that he was asking the old Shaw to set a time and place for a duel. Although the old Shaw was not old at the time, he was so skinny that he was all bones. How could he be the opponent of that great hero? But he had no choice but to take the card.

In the evening, he added a line to the card: "Please allow the bearer to enter." So, he watched a free show, and after watching it, he ran backstage and said to the famous actor: "Thank you for your card. I watched a free show, and I will definitely write you a good review tomorrow."

### Aphorisms

There are three kinds of animals in the world that seem to be coming but are actually going, and seem to be leaving but are coming again: diplomats, women, and crabs. —John Hann

A suspicion that lasts for a long time and remains unresolved will become an immortal truth.

— H.L. Mencken

I would rather live in a country with newspapers and no laws than in a country with laws and no newspapers. — Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States

Fools are afraid of committing crimes, we are only afraid of being poor. — George Bernard Shaw

One can only deceive the majority of people for a short time, or deceive a minority of people for a long time, but one can never deceive all of the people all of the time.

— Abraham Lincoln

So That's How It Is

### Weather Station

This is still a capitalist world, where money is naturally all-powerful. The news colleagues in Shanghai are falling into money's traps, one after another. Those so-called advancing yellow-haired and blue-eyed "friends of China" still cannot escape the temptation of money. What about Hong Kong? Has anyone sold their conscience and soul for a few dollars?

Europe seems to be very tense again, but July 1st passed peacefully. We are very surprised that old Hitler has calculated this weekend. But, do you think he's stupid? He'll fight with someone? That would be strange.

However, we have to say, Hong Kong is also preparing gas masks. I wonder if it's preparing to defend against poison gas from the East? Or from which side? However, there are many more things that Hong Kong needs to defend against!

### Lin Xi Zhao's Most Effective Curse

In 1849, a revolution occurred in Hungary with the goal of overthrowing the Habsburg royal family. As a result, the revolution failed, and the leaders of the rebels were killed by the government. The Hungarian Prime Minister Batthyány was also innocently killed.

When the Prime Minister's mother heard the news of her beloved son's wrongful death, she was filled with grief and anger and could not help but break out cursing the emperor. She said, "May he and his descendants never die a good death!" This sentence turned out to be very effective and is historically known as "the curse of the Habsburg royal family."

After the Hungarian Emperor was cursed in this way, his son committed suicide, his wife was assassinated, one brother was executed, another brother was murdered by an enemy, one sister-in-law was burned to death, another sister-in-law went mad, his niece died in a fire, his nephew died in an accident, another nephew drowned, and another nephew was assassinated in Sarajevo, sparking World War I. The emperor himself also died during World War I, and the empire collapsed.

### Statistics

The people of the two great capitals, England and America, clearly think differently. If you don't believe it, look:

New Yorkers think:

(1) Can a showgirl make a good wife?

(2) Is red hair a symbol of gentleness?

(3) Can a woman be in love with two men?

(4) Is obesity a sign of genius?

Londoners think:

(1) Can a showgirl marriage have good results?

(2) What does red hair symbolize?

(3) Can a man be in love with two women?

(4) Is genius a sign of obesity?

### Sea Adventures 22

— By Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi

Previous Summary: In the autumn of 1914, Jack, a radio operator for the Hawkes Shipping Company, and Bill, a mechanic, took a trip to Europe on the German ship "Käperonchi". Because England and Germany declared war, British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship frantically fled. With great difficulty, it escaped the jaws of the tiger and returned to the American waters of the White Sea. Jack and Bill went back to New York to see Mr. Hawkes. Hawkes then told them to take the "Saint Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson...

At dinnertime, Mullen, the original radio operator on the "Saint Mark," arrived, and Jack went off duty. That night, he was free, so he spent his time reading a newly published radio textbook.

However, the day's labor had exhausted him, and he fell asleep in a chair behind a gas cylinder on the upper deck. Although, in this season, the weather was quite cool, and the few first-class passengers were all in the smoking room or the lounge.

Jack didn't know how long he had been asleep, but he woke up because someone was talking on the other side of the cylinder, disturbing him. One of the voices drilled into his ears, and he remembered that it was Professor Johnson.

"If it weren't for that little beast in the radio room," Johnson said, "the news would have reached Von Stohlen long ago."

"So you couldn't inform him about the British cruiser?" another person asked.

"No. I will. I'm going to see what that night operator is like. He might not be so suspicious and unreasonable, unless that little fellow from the daytime has already told him."

"Are you saying, Professor, that you knew him before?" the person asked.

"Yes, on the 'Käperonchi'. I was - I was trying to oversee the distribution of lifeboats because the British cruiser was chasing behind us, and everyone on board was extremely panicked. At that time, this little scoundrel actually beat me like a beast."

"Why didn't you report him to the captain?"

"But, you think that - that - that wouldn't seem very good."

"Got you, Professor Lavicky - now I know who you are, Mr. Johnson," Jack thought to himself. "No wonder, I thought, I recognized you, despite your disguise."

"What are you planning to do now?" Mr. Johnson's (or rather, Professor Lavicky's) companion asked.

"I need to see. Smith and Jones, do you understand radio?"

"I'm okay at it, what's your plan—?"

"Never mind that for now. It's a bit cold. Let's go back to the cabin. I want to talk to you a lot tomorrow."

Sports

### Fierce Tennis Match Under the Scorching Sun: Da Xu Wins Over Wang Wenzheng; Mixed Doubles Full of Laughter; Wang Withdraws from Doubles Due to Foot Injury

(Special Report from Our Newspaper) Yesterday afternoon, after watching baseball, I went from Jia Shan to the Chinese Recreation Club and saw the lawn in front of the clubhouse already arranged as a battlefield.

As the bell rang three times, the usual guests who loved to do good deeds arrived together, including the movie star Li Zhuozhuo. She watched both baseball and tennis, showing that she was very interested in sports.

At this time, the sun was like fire, scorching the skin painfully. The charity match organizers, considering the weather was too hot, postponed the start of the match by thirty minutes.

Under the gaze of three or four hundred spectators, the fierce battle between Wang Wenzheng and Xu Weipei unfolded. In the first set, the two players were closely matched, battling intensely for twenty-eight games, lasting over an hour, before a winner was determined. Wang took the lead with an 8-6 victory. The score was as follows:

Wang 1 6 1 4 5 3 3 2 4 4 0 4 5 4…8

Xu 4 4 4 1 3 5 5 4 2 1 4 2 3 0…6

This set, due to the "deuce" situation, saw constant shifts in momentum, making the situation extremely tense and full of highlights. Wang used a bold approach, frequently making long cross-court shots from the baseline, which was his strength. His force was indeed fierce. However, although Wang won this set, he was already suffering, having exerted all his strength, greatly depleting his energy. Therefore, he couldn't maintain it. Moreover, competing under the scorching sun, having already engaged in an excessive and intense struggle, was particularly inappropriate. Thus, Wang eventually failed.

Xu's performance featured both soft and hard shots, and he often scored points with well-placed drop shots. He also had a firm grip on net interception. Wang lost out in this aspect, sticking only to the baseline. Thus, Xu either didn't go to the net, or if he did, he was sure to score. Also, Wang hit more out-of-bounds shots in this set. Under these circumstances, his eventual victory was entirely due to his forceful attacks, making it difficult for Xu to defend against his baseline shots. However, winning with force is not as good as controlling with intelligence. Wang had already exerted too much force in this set, and eventually felt a lack of stamina. Therefore, he collapsed in the second set and ran out of techniques. Xu's victory was very easy. The score was as follows:

Xu 4 4 5 1 4 4 4…6

Wang 1 2 3 4 1 1 0…1

This set became a one-sided performance, with only Xu active, executing drop shots at will, as if water flowed into a prepared channel. On the other hand, Wang already showed signs of fatigue. Every time he faced Xu's drop shots, although he wanted to chase after them, he felt his strength was failing him, resulting in a resounding defeat of 1-6.

After completing the two sets, the two players took a short break, changed their sweat-soaked clothes, and then started the final battle. However, Wang's hard-hitting style ultimately couldn't match Xu's intelligence and versatility. Thus, in the third set, although Wang had once taken a 3-1 lead, Xu calmly responded, and after leveling the score, the situation immediately turned around, eventually securing the final victory. The third set score was as follows:

Xu 6 1 5 2 4 4 6 0 5…6

Wang 4 4 7 4 2 0 4 0 3…3

The general criticism after the match was that the scorching weather sufficiently affected the nerves and movements of both players. Therefore, heroes cannot be judged by temporary successes or failures. I agree with this statement. As for the skill aspect, Xu showed many tricks, seizing every opportunity to display his various strengths, such as net play, drop shots, waist-height shots, and backhand slices. These were all his signature moves, so he was able to use various techniques to win.

Wang's only special skill was his flat backhand shot, which had good angles and powerful force. However, apart from using it to control Xu, he was at a disadvantage in every other aspect, so he was often in a passive position. If he wanted to take the initiative, he had to use all his strength, which was not easy to achieve. However, dealing with Xu cannot be effective by merely using force. Therefore, the initiative Wang gained through force was only in the first set, and he was at a disadvantage afterwards.

The second match was a mixed doubles match between Ling Daoyang who was absent, and the veteran Liu Fucheng partnered with Mrs. Zhao Xiaozhao, facing Diao Zuoqian and Ms. Yang Weibin, putting on many humorous moments, making the spectators laugh non-stop, forgetting the hardship of the scorching sun. As a result, the Liu Zhao team won with two scores of 6-4.

The third match was also doubles, originally with Wang Wenzheng partnering with Kobayashi Chin, facing the Xu brothers. However, Wang was very tired from playing in the singles match, and his foot cramped afterwards, preventing him from appearing again. Therefore, Situ Bi partnered with Xu Weipei, facing Xu Runpei and Kobayashi Chin, making it quite a spectacle, full of fun. The result was as follows:

Xu Runpei Kobayashi Chin Win Xu Weipei Situ Bi 6-4 7-5

Amitabha, another good deed is completed. Tickets and raffle tickets totaled $292, not including advance sales. One of the raffle prizes was won by Li Huitang's colleague, Liang Zao Ru, who won a Dunlop racket (the "Court Tyrant").

### Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Austin, Riggs, and Cooke All Win Yesterday, Entering the Semifinals Together

American star Riggs defeated Sheares, a representative of the British Taiwan Cup, 7-5, 6-8, 6-4, 6-3. Cooke (USA) defeated Oliss (England) 6-1, 6-1, 6-4.

Note: Austin, Riggs, and Cooke are all seeded players. Having won yesterday, they have entered the fifth round, and the finals will begin soon.

### Public Baseball League: South China Team Fails at the Last Hurdle; Youbei Wins 9-8

In the Hong Kong Open Baseball League, the Youbei team and the South China team faced off for the first time yesterday morning at 10:30. Youbei, considering South China's mediocre record, didn't take it seriously. Unexpectedly, South China displayed great power, restraining Youbei during the first inning's defense. Therefore, Youbei only scored one point when Sousa scored, ending the inning. When it was South China's turn to counterattack, Deji, Leonard, and Pete all made mistakes in a row, allowing Wu Zhenbang, Zheng Kangyong, Chen Yutian, and He Xiancheng to run back to home base, scoring a total of four points. Huang Yaozong's triple was the most meritorious. In the next two innings, Youbei was frustrated. The fourth inning didn't improve, scoring only one point. When it was South China's turn to counterattack, Youbei changed its formation, with Xia Gaoli taking the center fielder position and Leonard as the pitcher. South China didn't take it seriously and continued to work hard. Tang Rongguang hit the ball and safely reached first base, showing great promise. Unfortunately, Wu Zhenbang, who followed him, didn't hit hard but used a bunt, trapping himself and being tagged out by Xia Gaoli, who threw the ball to Leonard. The audience said that Wu made a needless sacrifice. Then Zheng Kangyong hit a fly ball, and Pete missed it, allowing Zheng to reach first base. But at this time, Tang Rongguang had already stolen home base, scoring one point. Chen Yutian, seeing the opponent's confusion, tried to steal second base but was tagged out by the pitcher and third baseman. Finally, He Xiancheng hit the ball not far, and was tagged out, ending the attack. In the fifth inning, Youbei scored four points with Sousa, Pete, Leonard, and Xia Gaoli. During South China's counterattack, Huang Yaozong's high ball was caught. Situ Bi got a hit, and Chen Zhendong took advantage of Omar's mistake to get to first base, sending Situ Bi to second base, creating a good "bases loaded" situation. At this time, pitcher Leonard was overwhelmed, throwing four balls, allowing Kangyong to reach second base and Situ Bi to return to home base, scoring one point. Until Chen Yutian hit a high ball, which Ali caught, Youbei's encirclement was relieved. In the sixth inning, Youbei scored two more points with Omar and Sousa, reversing the score to 9-8. In the seventh inning, neither team scored, and Youbei declared victory.

Overall, South China was still winning 8-7 until the fifth inning, making Youbei feel difficult to cope with. South China's performance in this battle can be described as heroic. Unfortunately, South China lacked experience and could attack but not defend, leading to defeat. Catcher He Xiancheng intercepted stealing players and threw the ball too often, creating opportunities for the opponent to advance. Pitcher Zheng Kangyong was skilled at handling the bat and very active in attack, but in defense, he often didn't know the situation and missed a double play opportunity. These factors were the main reasons for South China's defeat. However, Youbei's talent was indeed superior to South China's. South China was able to fight so hard, creating this tense situation, which was truly remarkable. Here are the scores of both teams:

Youbei 1 1 1 0 4 2 0 9

### On "Tactics" in the Literary World

— Tu Lao

Recently, a certain bookstore published a book specializing in the skills of lawyers. I only saw the advertisement in the newspaper, which said that the book "compiles the great achievements of lawyers' tactics and is sufficient to assist literary writers."

This seems a bit strange, so I couldn't help but think about it.

Speaking of lawyers, in past societies they were indeed a class that lived by "tactics." Their tactics were not only used in lawsuits, that is, using texts to frame and slander, but also in practical planning. They could bribe officials, collude with gangsters, fabricate evidence, spread rumors, and do other even more terrible things.

However, since the advertisement says it is "sufficient to assist literary writers," the book naturally only talks about "tactics" in terms of writing. There have been special books on this aspect before, but they generally do not reveal the "key" to tactics. This is still the old problem of the Chinese, everything must be "secret" to be suitable. However, generally speaking, the key is nothing more than two extremes: first, giving people nicknames, and second, talking about "motives" when things happen.

A nickname is what is called a "derisive name." The method is: before writing out the crimes of the person being accused, first give the name a nickname, such as "Giant-Eyed Tyrant" or "Big-Headed Overlord," meaning that officials, upon seeing the name, would immediately determine that he is not a good person. "Motive" is a modern term, and the previous term was called "intent." The method is: if the person being accused has two well-known good deeds, say that his intention was to seek fame or profit. In short, the advantages are also disadvantages, or even worse than the bad things that are easy to see. This trick is often used when counter-accusations are made.

But now the question is, what use are these "tactics" to "literary writers"?—In fact, in my opinion, the person who compiled the book really wasted his thoughts. Some of our literary writers have already learned these "tactics."

If you don't believe it, you might as well check the old and new accounts in the literary world. "Nickname studies" have been popular for a period of time, and "intentional studies" have been popular all along, and have not declined until now. And the most common thing is that when one is criticized to the point of being at a dead end, one suddenly becomes an X-ray, saying that one can see the "motives" of the critic. This is exactly the trick of counter-accusation.

However, judging from experience, this kind of lawyer's writing style really cannot "help" "literary writers." Although "nickname studies" have been popular, they have disappeared without a trace. The reason is: since you have hung up the sign of "literary writer," you always have to take care of a bit of "literary" face, and you are unwilling to give the other party nicknames like "Giant-Eyed Tyrant" or "Big-Headed Overlord," and in fact the other party is also a literary writer, and it is impossible to be so bad as to become a "tyrant" or "overlord," so the nicknames given can only be limited to "individualist" or "pessimist." But this is really too broad, and the recipient has not felt any attack, and the listener feels very ordinary, so writing it out is the end, and no effect is obtained at all. "Intentional studies" have been maintained for a relatively long time, but in the end, attention is still paid to the text. Because since you are a writer, the main thing is of course the text, and everyone only looks at whether the critic's criticism of your text is correct. How the intention is is ultimately difficult to grasp, and there is really no need to care about such a trivial matter. Moreover, this remark will also make oneself lose face, and let others suspect that your gender is different from the critic's, and that you once asked the critic for something and did not achieve your goal, so you came to "retaliate" - this is called deceiving yourself.

Therefore, no matter how brilliant the lawyer's writing style is, literary writers really cannot benefit from it.

As for the actual "tactics" outside of writing, some of our literary writers are very limited. The reason is very simple: the literary world is not a yamen after all. After all the messing around, it will always be exposed in the end.

By rejecting lawyer-style "tactics," literary writers may have some hope.

### Pilgrimage to Zhabei, Shanghai

— Bo Ming

Zhabei, located within the sight of the foreign concessions in Shanghai, once densely populated by millions, but now strewn with scorched wood and dilapidated walls, fell on October 27th, a few days before our troops abandoned the Shanghai area two years ago. Counting on my fingers, the Japanese side has occupied the area for nineteen months. Logically speaking, they could have implemented their ambitious and widely publicized plans for improved municipal administration and economic development.

A few days ago, I returned to Zhabei and lingered for several hours. The scene that came into view was even more depressing than what I had seen on my last visit to Zhabei on a gloomy winter day two years ago. At that time, the part of the public concession occupied by the Japanese army and Zhabei were almost indistinguishable from each other, because both areas were desolate and permeated with the breath of death; now, however, the noisy bustle of the public concession and the deathly silence of Zhabei have become a sharp contrast.

In the nineteen months since the fall of Zhabei, the Japanese side has not begun to change its scarred face. The shell craters of the time still dotted the rubble-strewn streets, and the walls riddled with machine gun fire still stood by the roadside, teetering. The Chinese army's fortress still existed, but the sandbags were slightly damaged, and looking through the half-closed doors of the shops, one could see straight to the street.

The factory of the Commercial Press, worth millions of dollars, had one wall leaning out toward the neighboring trench. The factory was surrounded by barbed wire, and the tank trap in front had been filled in so that military trucks could occasionally pass by. Baoshan Road, which was prosperous and crowded with pedestrians two years ago, reminded people of a ghost market. However, the roadsides of the ghost market do not have bomb craters.

The North Railway Station, which was destroyed twice by the Japanese invaders in five years, has been rebuilt, but the eyes of foreigners cannot see its mystery, because now it is surrounded by high cement walls, electrified fences, and barbed wire obstacles. Facing the public concession, there is also a brand new cement underground fortress, which is used to prevent unexpected events. Only one entrance is left for entering and leaving the North Station. Japanese military police with stern faces stood there, carefully watching the Chinese people who were boarding the train in a panic.

I thought back to the previous October, when I looked at the North Station from a broken house on the concession side of the boundary road, only seeing Japanese planes lazily circling in the sky over Zhabei, dropping huge bombs. Below were Chinese soldiers wearing conical straw hats, perhaps reinforcements from Guangxi, because they were so close that I could see the features on each of their faces; every time a plane dropped a bomb, they would lie flat on the ground. In an instant, there was a loud bang, deafening, and pieces of wood and dust flew up. After the bombs exploded, these soldiers immediately continued their duties calmly, as if nothing had happened.

### The Road of Sinners

— Yan Qi

When this lamp goes out, there is another lamp,

If this road doesn't work, just stay,

I don't believe there is anyone in the world who doesn't drink sweet wine,

Broken carriage, broken spear, broken bow, are also the sound of horns.

Yesterday, today, tomorrow, going out and coming in until sunset,

The blue arrow points the way, embarking on a new journey again.

The past fate is always a book of repentance,

Hymns, blessings, sacred flowers, a few city towers.

### The Creative Direction of Chinese Literature

— Rujie

Today, the most important and fundamental issue standing in the way of the creation of Chinese literature is not the lowering of literary standards to suit the masses, nor is it raising the level of the masses' literary taste. Rather, it is the question of the overall creative direction of Chinese literature. If we propose "lowering" literary standards to suit the masses in isolation, then the problem is obviously simplified and reduced to a triviality. The most important central task of our literary movement today is, of course, to massively absorb the masses and win over the masses. However, absorbing the masses and winning over the masses cannot be achieved solely by "lowering" literary standards. Standing before the work of absorbing the masses and winning over the masses is precisely the question of the overall creative direction of Chinese literature. "Lowering" literary standards obviously cannot be considered the entirety of this work, but only one aspect of it. Although the work of this aspect cannot be said to be unimportant, it would undoubtedly be a mistake to overshadow the whole with this one aspect alone.

At the same time, if we propose raising the level of the masses in isolation, it is undoubtedly also a trivial matter. We know that the issue of raising the cultural level of the masses is not solely a literary issue, nor can it be achieved solely by work in the field of literature. This issue of "raising" is an issue of the entire social and cultural movement, a task of the entire cultural movement. Although the literary movement, as one aspect of the entire cultural movement, should also do its best in this work, it is quite clear that the work of raising the level of the masses is not its own unique task. Although literature inherently possesses common characteristics of the general cultural movement, the embodiment of these characteristics in literature must pass through its own special essence. The work of raising the level of the masses is also like this; its embodiment in literature must first pass through the characteristics of literature. That is to say, it must first become an organic aspect of the direction of literary creation in order to be concretized through the characteristics of literature. Therefore, it would undoubtedly be a mistake if this issue is not raised from the perspective of understanding the overall creative direction of Chinese literature.

Today, the work of Chinese literature to win over the masses and absorb the masses is not a matter of "lowering standards" or "raising standards," but a matter of the new creation of the entire Chinese literature. We need some new literary styles, some new literary archetypes, some new literary techniques. In short, today we need a new and complete literary system, a new and concrete literary method. This new system and method is not simply about popularization and massification, but also contains a wide range of aspects. For example, Sinicization and realization, such as the absorption of literary traditions and the refinement of historical habits, are all things it contains. The confluence of these complex and vast aspects constitutes the overall new creative direction of today's Chinese literature. This new creative direction, due to its broad scope and the richness and superiority of its content, is sufficient to have the greatest power to absorb the broad masses and win over the broad masses. Because this creative direction requires critical absorption of all the characteristics of Chinese history, as well as active condensation of the entire essence of mass life, it can most thoroughly adapt to the masses, penetrate the masses, and be loved and understood by the masses, thereby completing its purpose of winning over the masses and absorbing the masses.

Our demand for a new creative direction in literature today is not only for today, but also for the future. Not only to exert the combat power of literature today to lead the masses and induce the masses' realistic struggle, to build our literature's task of struggle in the great national revolutionary war; but also to lay the foundation for our literature of tomorrow in the process of today's literary battle. We must, on the basis of the new direction of literary creation, specifically grasp the characteristics of our national history, extract the essence of our national revolution, critique the life of our nation, learn the struggle of our masses, and absorb the entire historical heritage of our literature, in order to build our literature of tomorrow and give our literature of tomorrow a prerequisite for its brilliant development. Therefore, today we not only demand the popularization of literature, but also a new creative direction in literature, to carry out a full-scale critique and integration from the accumulation of mass life, from the inner meaning of national history, from all the positive factors of Chinese language art, to establish a literary creative direction that can organically participate in the battle today and brilliantly develop and expand tomorrow.

The establishment of a new literary creative direction is an organic strengthening and effective improvement of Chinese literature. This is the inevitable path for Chinese literature to move towards a completely new and bright world, towards the brilliant and splendid throne of international literature. Here, it not only means the massification of Chinese literature, nor does it only mean the improvement of Chinese literary standards, but it is the unity of this massification and improvement. On the one hand, it is massified by its own Chinese characteristics and mass nature. On the other hand, it is also elevated in standards by the new creation of various literary institutions based on realistic foundations. Therefore, on the one hand, it is massified, it is "lowered," but at the same time, it is also for tomorrow, upward-looking, and "elevated."

The establishment of a new creative direction for Chinese literature should be one of our important tasks today. We must carry out this work, just as we must carry out the battle.

### I Must Awaken

— Junbo

I am lonely, I live in a lonely dream every day. I am accustomed to using the pen of thought to depict a beautiful picture.

Dreams are my familiar companions, I have never been frustrated in a dream. When I feel melancholy, or a little depressed, then I will lock my breath in the deep valley of sweet dreams, and quietly wait for that gentle hand to wipe away the autumn on my heart.

Dreams are lonely; I have had many lonely dreams. Sometimes I feel tired after pain, then I might as well drink a glass of lonely wine. Watching the eaves drips, listening to the subtle wind sweeping over the maple tips in the courtyard, I begin to imagine many golden stories, and then fall into a lonely dream. I see my companions with the laughter of the past; maybe I can still touch the warmth I lost. No curses, no resentment; holding tightly the dream of memory, there is lonely joy in the dream.

Towards the vast horizon, calling out to the past years. My heart is heavy. Inadvertently waving my hand, borrowing the wings of the wild geese, I grope towards the road in my dream again. "There are no years in dreams," I laugh lonely again. The laugh is lonely, who accompanies it? Besides the water drips on the eaves, the subtle wind in the courtyard.

Then, I cried in pain. The heart that had been violated by dreams suddenly turned cold. Rubbing my eyes, I said: "Dreams are empty, isn't that just a vain illusion?"

Reaching out to embrace the vast world, I don't want to dream anymore, the melancholy after the dream will torture me. Quickly rush to the beacon of this reality, muster a strong spirit, and bathe in the wind and rain of the era.

Really, I want to wake up, and never pursue that golden lie again!

### Plunged Towards the Motherland

— Jin Yi

— Still a story of a girl —

They stopped by a ditch. Some people walked further, but most people stopped at the distance they had walked.

The South was warm, the crops in the fields grew luxuriantly, and the fragrance of the earth rippled in the air. However, on everyone's face, there was a layer of fearful expression.

But everything was still calm, there was no sign of planes, and no sound of engines. The train didn't come, so they had to sit on the side of the field and wait.

"This is just an alarm, what's there to be afraid of!"

Jingwen opened the fruit basket, took out an orange and peeled it, saying as if she didn't care at all.

Qingzhi ignored her and just looked at an old woman crouching on the ground, trembling. Her hair was already white, and she was crouching there, as if waiting for the ground to crack open, allowing her to hide inside.

The young man walked over and helped her up from the ground, and said many things to her that she didn't understand. The old woman looked up at him as if listening to him, and sat on the ground. Her face was frighteningly wrinkled, and tears gathered on her many-wrinkled cheeks.

"Please don't laugh at her," the young man said to her as he walked over again: "She is from XX Market. Two days ago, her entire family was bombed, and only she escaped with her old life. She is going to the provincial capital to find her son." (The End)

### The Hong Kong Government Plans to Order 100,000 Gas Masks from Britain, to be Sold to the Public at $2.50 Each, to be Kept in Government Custody and Distributed for Use in Case of Emergency. The Storage Location May Borrow School Storerooms

Mr. Spikins, the Air Defense Officer, announced yesterday that all air defense work in Hong Kong, such as the digging of shelters, fire extinguishers, the purchase of fire-fighting tools and rescue medicines, etc., are being actively promoted. The method of using gas masks is also being drafted by the Air Defense Equipment Office, and will be announced and implemented during the day. According to the opinion of the Office, it is believed that Hong Kong residents should purchase a mask each for use in case of emergency. In order to encourage residents to purchase and to take self-defense measures, the Office will issue slogans for wide publicity. However, since the population of Hong Kong has increased greatly, it is difficult to estimate the actual total population of Hong Kong, and it is also difficult to estimate the number of masks required. Therefore, the Hong Kong Government will first order 100,000 masks from Britain and ship them to Hong Kong. The cost and freight of each mask will be approximately HK$2.50. In the future, they will be sold at the price they were purchased at, in order to achieve universality. If the supply is insufficient at that time, more orders will be placed. Regarding the storage problem of the masks, the Office believes that it is appropriate for the government to keep them in custody at ordinary times, and distribute them for use in case of emergency. The storage location should be spread throughout the districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the best is to borrow the storerooms of various schools, and there must be cold storage equipment so that they will not be affected by the hot weather and can be stored for a long time.

### Instructions from the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Explaining and Amending the Chamber of Commerce Law, Overseas Organizations Can Adopt Flexible Methods, Dual Nationality is Also Not a Problem

The local chamber of commerce received instructions yesterday from Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, explaining the main points of the National Government's implementation of the revised Chamber of Commerce Law, stating that overseas Chinese chambers of commerce are often not initiated and organized by trade associations, and even if there are trade associations, they are often independent of the chambers of commerce. According to Article 7 of the revised Chamber of Commerce Law, "If there are no trade associations or the number of trade associations is less than three, companies without trade associations may jointly initiate, and every ten companies shall be regarded as one association, but this limit shall not apply when overseas Chinese merchants establish chambers of commerce." It can be seen that overseas Chinese chambers of commerce have room for flexibility and do not necessarily have to have trade associations. (1) Organizations such as the current United Grand Stores are not illegal in organizing chambers of commerce. (2) Regarding the establishment of articles of association, attention must be paid to the laws and regulations of the local government. Since overseas Chinese chambers of commerce must register with the local government, the articles of association can be drafted with reference to the local regulations, and it is also possible to follow the revised Chamber of Commerce Law of our country and file with the home government, so that both parties can be taken care of. (3) Regarding the issue of dual nationality, overseas Chinese who grow up overseas often obtain local nationality, which is the result of the principle of territoriality. However, our country's Nationality Law adopts the principle of consanguinity. Since the people mentioned are of our country's bloodline, they are naturally citizens of our country and can enjoy the right to vote in our country's chambers of commerce. According to Article 11 of the Nationality Law, "Those who have acquired foreign nationality may renounce the nationality of the Republic of China with the permission of the Ministry of Interior." Furthermore, Article 6 of the Implementing Rules of the Nationality Law stipulates, "Those who acquire or lose the nationality of the Republic of China in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 5 and Article 11 of the Nationality Law shall designate one type of news publication in the interior to announce the fact that the applicant has acquired or lost nationality." Overseas Chinese should not claim to have lost nationality, and if they have not obtained the permission of the Ministry of Interior, then they have dual nationality and should still be regarded as citizens of China and do not need to withdraw from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, etc.

### More Than a Dozen Machinists Recruited to Go to the Northwest, to Serve on the Northwest Highway Route

During the war, our country's rear transportation was actively expanded. In the past two years, the government authorities have actively developed the resources of the western and northern provinces, organized local construction, and developed transportation plans. At present, the highway networks of Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other provinces have gradually been completed. There is a great demand for machinists and other personnel on various transportation lines. The authorities have recruited from both domestic and overseas sources. Thousands of overseas Chinese machinists from various parts of Southeast Asia have responded to the call to return to the country to serve, and most of them have been assigned to work in Yunnan Province. As for the Northwest Highway, the transportation line is extremely long, from Chengdu, Sichuan Province, directly to the Soviet border. There is also a great need for mechanical personnel on the entire line. Recently, personnel were sent to Hong Kong to recruit. The salary for each person is 60 yuan in national currency per month. The contract is temporarily set for one year. If both parties agree after the expiration, the contract can be renewed. Three months' salary will be paid in advance for the first term. The recruitment procedures are extremely simple. Those who pass the examination will be recruited. Since the outbreak of the war in South China, many mechanics and engineers have fled to Hong Kong; many have no stable employment after arriving in Hong Kong. They are happy to respond to the call to return to the country to serve. Currently, more than a dozen people have already set out for the Northwest to take office. It is said that there will be a second batch continuing to return to the country in the future.

### Another Hero Leaves the Ma Tau Chung Concentration Camp

A hero in the Ma Tau Chung concentration camp, because of his keen determination to fight the enemy, was constantly thinking of ways to leave the camp and rejoin the front line. In the past, more than a dozen people have left. At three o'clock yesterday morning, because the guards were fast asleep, another hero named Xie Shaoji sneaked out of the camp. The hero was 31 years old, from Hunan. The guards searched but could not find any trace.

### Printing Industry Labor-Management Agreement Begins to be Implemented, Yesterday was Sunday and All Printing Houses Were Closed

The labor-management dispute in the printing industry, which had been going on for more than a month, has been resolved satisfactorily through the mediation of the Labor Department and Ye Lanquan. Yesterday was the first day of the printing industry's weekly day of rest. All printing bureaus and lithographic bureaus in Hong Kong were closed. Since Hong Kong's history, it was the first time that the printing industry closed all day on Sunday. Because the matter was sudden, many time-sensitive printed materials could not be delivered on time, such as the theaters. Because they were not prepared in advance, there were no theater programs at the opening, and many viewers complained. It is believed that there are many other time-sensitive printed materials that cannot be delivered on time, but this is only a temporary phenomenon. In the future, both parties may have ways to rectify.

### The Bank of China Pays Attention to the Overseas Chinese Remittance Business, Branches and Managers' Offices are Established Throughout the Ports of Southeast Asia, to Absorb Overseas Remittances and Strengthen the Financial Foundation During the War of Resistance

Overseas Chinese compatriots remit tens of millions of dollars back to the country every year. This huge amount of remittances is of great benefit to our country's foreign exchange, especially during the War of Resistance, the impact of overseas remittances is even more important. The Bank of China is one of the four major banks in our country, and has been authorized by the National Government to conduct international foreign exchange for more than 20 years. It has more than 200 branches and offices throughout the country, and has also established branches and managers' offices in various countries around the world to handle domestic and foreign exchange deposits and remittances. Since the War of Resistance, the bank has paid great attention to the overseas Chinese remittance business. Recently, in order to develop its business, it has successively established branches in Singapore, Batavia, Rangoon, and Hanoi to facilitate overseas Chinese remittances in Southeast Asia. At the same time, it is also planning to establish managers' offices in Siam, Surabaya, Medan, Kuala Lumpur, and Medan to absorb overseas remittances. According to bank staff reporters, the establishment of various branches or manager's offices in the future will not only protect the interests of overseas Chinese, but the remittances of overseas Chinese will certainly be more considerable, and the financial and basic foundation of our country during the War of Resistance will be greatly strengthened.

### Food Industry Association Decides: Only Vegetarian Food to be Sold on "July 7th"; Restaurants Create Anti-Japanese War Vegetarian Menu Named "Wan Ti"; Respond to Bond and Flower Purchasing Campaigns

The second anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War is only four days away. Various overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong, in order to commemorate this great day, have not only scheduled a memorial meeting for that day, but also unanimously responded to the United Relief Organization's vegetarian food festival and flower-selling fundraising campaign. The flower-selling work has been underway for several days, with 300,000 flowers already distributed. The vegetarian food festival is also being actively promoted. Hong Kong's pig, cattle, sheep, chicken, duck, fish, and meat merchants' associations have already decided to suspend slaughtering on the 7th. The food shops, restaurants, teahouses, tea rooms, Western restaurants, and merchants' associations also held a meeting yesterday and decided to unanimously sell vegetarian food on "July 7th."

Meeting Decides: Sell Vegetarian Food

The association convened a standing committee meeting of the presidium yesterday to discuss the response to the second anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident.

Other non-member colleagues are also notified to follow suit, in order to solemnly commemorate the day. Major restaurants in Hong Kong and Kowloon have prepared everything and plan to sell famous vegetarian menus on the "July 7th" anniversary. Several major restaurants in Hong Kong have already created anti-Japanese war vegetarian menus, naming dishes with anti-Japanese war and national salvation slogans to alert overseas Chinese. Tea houses, on the other hand, will follow last year's method, completely replacing the meat fillings in the dim sum they sell with vegetarian ingredients and renaming them with names such as "Resist Japan and Save the Country," "Resist Japan to the End," "Scorched Earth Resistance," "Kill All × People," and "Final Victory," to inspire people. The intention is quite profound.

### Britain Intensifies Training of New Recruits; Calls Veteran Soldiers in Hong Kong Back to the Country to Serve as Instructors

Britain has recently implemented conscription. Although Hong Kong has not received a conscription order, it is also affected. Due to the sharp increase in the number of new recruits in Britain, the need for military instructors has suddenly become acute. The British military has therefore taken the step of transferring officers stationed in the Far East and India back to the country for training. Some veterans and retired officers stationed in Hong Kong have been ordered to return to the country to participate in instructor training courses and serve as instructors for new recruits after graduation.

### Wing On Life Insurance Company Provides Free Vaccinations to Ensure the Safety of Policyholders

### Three Hundred Private Prostitutes Transform into Escort Girls; Escort Agencies Also Required to Pay Special Fees; Those with Potential Influence are Responsible for Maintenance

Yesterday morning, an English-language weekly newspaper reported that after the banning of prostitution in Hong Kong, the number of private prostitutes has increased dramatically. If they are aware of their illegal status, they must make friends with those who have potential influence and pay special fees for maintenance. Each private prostitute bears several tens of dollars per month. In the past, when the prostitutes in Shek Tong Tsui changed their profession to become singers, they tried to stop paying special fees, but ultimately failed. This year, escort agencies have been established one after another, like bamboo shoots after rain, because the name is newer and they are exempt from the burden of special fees. Therefore, private prostitutes in various districts have successively joined escort agencies, or five or seven sisters operate a love nest together, and the sign of escort is hung up, thus transforming private prostitutes into escorts. As a result, the income of influential figures has been greatly affected. Calculating only in the Central District, there are already three hundred private prostitutes who have become escorts, and some of them have previously owed special fees, which are not paid, resulting in a loss of approximately 15,000 yuan. Influential figures are constantly coming up with new names, and the term "escort" has already been clearly denounced by judges as a disguised form of prostitution. If this continues, it is truly unbearable. Therefore, they have contacted various escort agencies, instructing them to pay special fees as before. Several escort agencies fear that the contact will affect their business and have already agreed to pay. This kind of action is expected to soon become widespread among escort agencies.

### All Hong Kong Youth Groups to Present Swords to Leader to Comfort Soldiers; Organizational Outline Drafted by Student Relief Association; Meeting Tonight to Discuss; Expected to be Realized in August

The Hong Kong Student Relief Association held its third executive committee meeting a few days ago and decided to hold a sword presentation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and comfort the soldiers at the front during the summer vacation, to show respect for the leader and love for the soldiers. Later, because this event was of great significance and should be held more solemnly, the sword presentation campaign was expanded to invite youth groups from all over Hong Kong to participate.

### Hong Kong Radio Station Suspected of Being Disrupted by Foreign Radio Waves; General Speculation is That It is the Work of ×

Hong Kong's Z K radio station, which specializes in Chinese broadcasts, has been disrupted repeatedly in recent weeks. At first, it was thought to be accidental, but the repeated occurrence is very noticeable. As for the source of the disrupting radio waves, according to general speculation, only China or × are possible. However, Hong Kong's broadcasts do not contain any propaganda that is unfavorable to China, so why would there be disruption? As for × taking the initiative, it seems credible. Recently, the radio station set up by × in Guangzhou broadcasts mostly anti-British and anti-Hong Kong language every day. In North China and Shanghai, it has even set up powerful radio stations in close proximity to broadcast to Britain and the United States, disrupting them vigorously. As for the Chongqing Central Radio Station, it concentrates its target and disrupts it non-stop for twenty-four hours a day. Even Hong Kong's ZEW Western radio station has been disrupted repeatedly recently.

### More Than Eighty Students Transferred from Diocesan Boys' School; The Storm Comes to an End

Due to the opposition to Taiwanese students serving in the class, a storm occurred among the students of Diocesan Boys' School. Although Chairman He Minghua, Bishop, Huang Shi Luo Xuxiang, and Li Zhengyao, the head of the Student Relief Association, served as mediators one after another, they went to extremes and ultimately could not mediate. After half a month, according to a recent survey, the students who suspended classes and schools still insisted that they would not return to school if their goals were not achieved. However, for the sake of their future studies, they asked the school to give them a leaving certificate so that they could transfer to another school. The school also granted their request. It is heard that as many as eighty students have received leaving certificates to transfer to another school, and more than twenty students have returned to school to continue their studies. This major school storm will come to an end.

### Xiangjiang Middle School; Approved for Registration; Free. Half-Price; Quota

Since the school changed its name from the School Reform Association in the second semester of the 27th year and Mr. Chen Shulin took over as principal, it has specially set up free and half-fee quotas to accommodate young people from war zones and poor families. The library books, instruments, and sports equipment have been increasing day by day, and the school affairs have made considerable progress. For the convenience of management and education, the Xiangzhong Girls' Middle School has been merged into the Girls' Department of Xiangjiang Middle School. Recently, the school has been approved for registration by the Education Newspaper and the Committee. In order to continue to relieve the young people who have lost their studies in the war zone and the poor students in Hong Kong, the school plans to set up 200 half-fee quotas for middle school students in the war zone and 100 half-fee quotas for poor middle school students in Hong Kong in the autumn enrollment of the 28th year. That is, if the students in the school's summer class have good results upon graduation, they will not only be able to be promoted to each street without examination, but also enjoy the same free and half-fee preferential treatment.

### Chinese Amateur Alumni Association Holds Literary Evening

Life Insurance Principles

### Life Insurance and the Promotion of Education

— Gu Zhuolun

Parents have two important missions for their children: one is to raise them, and the other is to educate them. In fact, the problem of education is the problem of raising them: conversely, if they cannot be educated, they cannot be raised. Therefore, education and raising them are equally important, or the problem of education is even more important! Therefore, as parents, if they plan for their children's future, they do not have to worry about the management of inheritance. The first thing they should pay attention to is the education plan. Those who are wealthy can set aside a fund in advance so that their children can go from elementary school to middle school to university when they reach a certain age, which would be great; but when they are not very wealthy and cannot set aside a large sum of money in advance, it becomes a problem. The best way is to take out an education annuity life insurance. This insurance method has several advantages:

(1) For the education fund, you can pay in advance on an annual basis, without the burden of a one-time payment, and the insurance cost is low. For example, if you pay three or several tens of yuan per year, you will have a preparation of one thousand yuan, which is easy and everyone can do it.

(2) The education fund can be determined and is not affected by accidents along the way. Because life insurance has the advantages of paying survival refunds and death compensation, if you encounter an accident after taking out the insurance, even if you have paid a small amount of premium, the company will still have to bear the responsibility for compensation. When the policy is due, the payment will be made according to the agreement for the expenses accumulated by the insured, which is very different from depositing money in the bank on an annual basis, where you can only receive the amount you have saved in the event of an accident.

(3) The education annuity is withdrawn in installments, so it will not be used for other purposes. Because school education has a certain time limit, taking the whole amount at once is often easy to be used for other purposes due to temporary emergencies. It must be withdrawn in installments to achieve the purpose of cultivating children. With these advantages, the meaning of education annuity insurance can be clearly understood. As the ancients said, children are away from foolishness, books must be read, and they must be practiced after reading. You should prepare as early as possible. Saving some miscellaneous expenses today and paying insurance premiums for your children is really worth paying attention to.

Life insurance business

### A Comparison of the Life Insurance Business Between China and Japan

— Li Quanshi

In order to promote the importance of the life insurance business, the Wing On Life Insurance Company publishes a special life insurance supplement in the Hong Kong Shen Bao newspaper monthly. As the second issue is being prepared, I was specially requested to contribute an article. Unable to refuse the kind invitation, I will, despite my limited knowledge, present a comparison of the life insurance business between China and Japan for the consideration of knowledgeable individuals.

Looking back, China opened its doors to the world twelve years earlier than Japan (China officially opened in 1842, while Japan opened in 1854). Logically, all modernization efforts, including the development of the life insurance business, should have been more advanced in China than in Japan. However, the facts show the opposite. I do not wish to delve deeply into the reasons for this in this article. I will only discuss the prosperity and decline of the life insurance business in China and Japan, from which other aspects can be inferred.

Since the Sonno Joi movement and the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been emulating Western science in all aspects. It has also implemented a comprehensive system for financial organizations. In addition to the central bank, special banks, savings banks, trust companies, and securities companies, various insurance companies have been established. The insurance company system is roughly divided into companies that underwrite property loss risks, such as fire, marine, and movable property insurance, and companies that underwrite life loss risks, such as life, military service, simplified life, and postal annuities (divided into joint-stock and mutual types), as well as state-run institutions. The following is a statistical table of the development of the life insurance industry in Japan in the past five years for reference:

Development of the Life Insurance Industry in Japan (Unit: 1,000 Yen)

(1) Statistics on New Policyholders' Sums Insured

November 1934　November 1935　November 1936　November 1937　November 1938

Life　207,262　1,223,360　125,567　271,689　417,982

Military Service　23,696　34,486　27,122　26,693　45,313

Accident　27,590　26,344　25,520　32,712　34,278

Simplified Life　42,23　40,415　42,530　58,923　327,645

Postal Annuities　222　469　201　254　219

(2) Total Sums Insured of New and Existing Policyholders

November 1934　November 1935　November 1936　November 1937　November 1938

Life　20,045,400　2,521,177　13,232,503　15,324,982　178,778,7411

Military Service　920,231　1,026,411　2,183,190　2,381,019　1,600,405

Accident　207,726　236,915　221,802　240,624　268,307

Simplified Life　2,896,046　3,195,046　3,592,502　4,100,172　5,048,580

Postal Annuities　25,259　27,062　30,384　31,793　33,654

Total　14,094,662　16,007,021　18,260,742　12,078,549　24,879,323 (Source: Japanese Toyo Keizai English Edition, May issue this year, page 333)

The above table shows that the total effective sum insured of new and existing policyholders in the Japanese life insurance industry at the end of November last year reached a huge number of 24,879,323,000 yen. How does this compare with the total business volume of Chinese-run life insurance companies in our country? According to the latest China Financial Yearbook published in Shanghai, page 094, the total business volume of Chinese-run life insurance companies is as follows:

Hua An He Qun　08,406,854 yuan

Wing On Life　3,556,077 yuan

Sincere Life　1,969,712 yuan

Taiping　1,316,290 yuan

China　920,746 yuan

Ning Shao Life　537,969 yuan

Total　16,708,287 yuan

Assuming the effective sum insured is 20 times the total business volume, the total would be: 334,165,740.

The above table shows that even if the effective sum insured is 20 times the total business volume of each life insurance company, the total is only 334,165,740 yuan, which is only one-seventy-fourth of the effective sum insured in Japan. The contrast is too pitiful. However, if the effective sum insured of foreign insurance companies for compatriots in our country is also included in the calculation, the difference will certainly not be as significant. How to strive to promote life insurance and catch up with Japan is the task of those who are engaged in this business in our country.

A Brief Comment

### A Word for Policyholders

— Zhou Yandan

The insurance business in our country began to sprout about fifty years ago. Initially, foreign companies recruited people from our country to take out insurance policies. It was not until the first year of the Republic of China that companies with Chinese capital began to operate. Since then, more than a dozen large and small companies have emerged. After decades of promotion, the life insurance business in our country has established a considerable foundation. However, its development still requires our efforts to promote it in order to achieve results in the future.

(1) Do Not Be Superstitious About Fate

In the past, the people of our country were unenlightened, and most people in society attributed the success or failure of their life's endeavors to fate and geomancy. Their minds were muddled, their knowledge was scarce, and they had no understanding of scientific common sense. Therefore, they lacked keen insight to carefully examine and make thorough plans when facing matters. They were also unable to prevent problems before they occurred and prepare for contingencies. If misfortune occurred, they could only complain about bad luck or suspect that the ancestral tombs were not well located. It is important to know that we are born into this world and face various dangerous situations, such as fire, disability, and death. The occurrence of these dangers cannot be prevented by individuals in advance, but it is necessary to find ways to remedy the loss of property and economic ability. The function of various insurances is to enable a large number of people who are concerned about the same type of danger to contribute a corresponding amount of money to help the victims and ensure the safety of each individual. If you are worried about danger and death, you can use life insurance to compensate for the losses caused by death.

(2) Support Chinese-Funded Companies

In the past, the life insurance business in our country was mostly controlled by foreign-funded companies, and the profits were countless every year. In the past two or three decades, people with lofty ideals, driven by patriotism and seeking ways to remedy the situation, organized Chinese-funded companies to engage in the life insurance business. However, the general public believed that foreign companies had a long history and better credit, so they often targeted foreign companies when taking out insurance. This kind of observation and psychological error is probably due to a lack of understanding of the organization of life insurance companies. It is important to know that all the organizations of life insurance companies are based on scientific methods. For the amount of insurance underwritten, regardless of size, a reserve fund must be set aside. This reserve fund is calculated precisely based on mortality tables and investment interest rates. If you take out life insurance with a foreign company, all the premiums paid during the year will be remitted abroad for investment, and the profits will flow out, which is extremely harmful. In this era of national financial difficulties and national disasters, all our citizens should rise up and support Chinese-funded companies in order to strengthen the country's economic power.
