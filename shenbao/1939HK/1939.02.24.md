### The New Adventures of Japanese Aggressors

The policy of appeasement diplomacy by peace-loving and democratic nations, especially, not only fails to satisfy the insatiable demands of fascist aggressors, but also increases their appetite and emboldens them. It not only fails to temporarily alleviate the crisis of a world war, but also accelerates its outbreak and expands its area of devastation. The tragic harms suffered by Austria, Czechoslovakia, and recently Spain, are directly the misfortune of these intermediate countries, but in reality, they are democratic and peaceful nations weakening their own strength to aid their common enemy, the fascist aggressors.

This situation is naturally not limited to Europe. As the Spanish issue suddenly turns serious, and Italian and German aggressors prepare a new offensive while the European situation is disturbed, Japan, the aggressor in the East, immediately begins adventurous steps. The most obvious recent manifestations are the following three facts:

First, it is the dispatch of elite troops to carry out a forceful occupation of Hainan Island. The main intention of this aggressive strategy by the Japanese aggressors is, internally, to use the pretext of the precariousness of Japan's international status and the temptation of seizing the entire Pacific market, in order to pass a huge military budget, especially a naval budget, to extract the last of the assets of the Japanese people. Externally, it is to respond to the new strategy of the international fascist aggression front, first creating a serious situation in the Far East, in order to enable Germany and Italy to launch a new offensive in Europe, and to carry out greater intimidation and extortion against democratic and peace-loving countries. Furthermore, it is particularly noteworthy that this is being used to threaten Britain and France to halt aid to China, especially to coerce them to cut off the traffic between Burma, Annam, and our country, and to cut off foreign aid during our country's war of resistance.

Second, there is the planned implementation of the "Large Bombing of the Sino-British Border." The unprecedented catastrophe in Shenzhen, Luohu, and other places on the 21st of this month is only the preliminary manifestation of this plan by the Japanese aggressors. If it does not encounter serious protests and retaliation, then the expansion of its rampages is inevitable. The reason they are doing this is because after the Hainan Island incident, the response of the British and French governments was limited to "serious protests," and they have not taken any actual actions sufficient to threaten Japanese aggression. This makes Japan believe that the British and French governments are opening the door to compromise, and they can use even bolder actions to strive for conditions more favorable to Japan in the compromise negotiations, at least attempting to achieve a complete halt to the British aid policy to China, and further unite with Japan to demand that our government conduct negotiations with Japan for "peace."

Third, using the pretext of the recent assassinations of Chen Lu, the puppet Weixin government's foreign minister, and Li Guojie, and other key figures in the puppet organization in the Shanghai Concession, they are vigorously expanding the situation, falsely accusing the Shanghai Concession authorities of not maintaining law and order and assisting our government in destroying the puppet regime, using the slogan of "striving for the right of self-defense" to carry out an armed seizure of the Concession. In recent days, the Japanese parliament has been particularly flamboyant and vociferous about this, and Land Minister Itagaki has even clearly stated that appropriate measures will be taken regarding the Shanghai Concession. The purpose is, on the one hand, to plunder the entire Shanghai market and eliminate the important bases for the war of resistance work in the occupied areas of the East, and on the other hand, it has the same meaning as the Hainan Island occupation and the large bombing of Shenzhen and Luohu, namely, to threaten the British government, stop aid to China, and further unite with Japan to jointly stop our country's resistance, in order to realize the East Asian New Order in the Japanese aggressors' plan.

These new adventurous actions by the Japanese aggressors are entirely planned actions. If they do not immediately encounter major blows, then these adventurous actions will have even greater development. At the same time, the development of these adventurous actions by Japan will inevitably help the new strategies of the Italian and German aggressors in Europe, and will inevitably increase the serious crisis in the European situation. At this time, it will inevitably have some unfavorable impact on our country's war of resistance, but the most important thing is that it will make the situation of Britain and France even more difficult and dangerous, and will make the nature of the world war more brutal and the scope more extensive, and the way to save it will be even more difficult. However, so far, this crisis has not reached the point of being unrecoverable. The main reasons are: first, the seriousness of the internal and external crises of the Japanese aggressors, especially the panic of the Japanese aggressors' internal economy and finances, the imminent collapse of the people's livelihood, and the surging anti-war anger of the people in the country, colonies, and the army in China. On the one hand, this forces the Japanese aggressors to take adventurous actions, but on the other hand, it also buries the crisis that these adventurous actions will eventually fail. This is the fatal weakness of Japan's new adventurous actions, and the fundamental reason why Japan's new adventure is not worth a blow. Second, our country's intensified unity and persistence in the war of resistance, after the Sixth Plenary Session, the Fifth Plenary Session, and the three major conferences of the National Political Council, have obtained greater guarantees. This guarantee not only strengthens the victory confidence of the people of the whole country, but also increases the prestige of friendly nations and international figures towards our government and the hope for the victory of our country's war of resistance. This is the prerequisite for crushing the new adventures of the Japanese aggressors. Third, the socialist Soviet Union, its strength is growing, its anti-fascist and anti-aggression peace policy has recently had new achievements, especially the recent establishment of the new US-Soviet commercial treaty, the progress of the new British-Soviet commercial treaty, and the suspension of the Soviet-Japanese fishery treaty, and the recent re-suffering of severe setbacks in Japanese provocations on the Soviet-Manchurian border. On the one hand, it has raised the international prestige of the Soviet Union and the peace front, and on the other hand, it has also made Japan and the League of Nations afraid, especially fearing the cooperation between Britain, France, and the United States with the Soviet Union in the Far East. These facts not only foreshadow the compromise of the Japanese aggressors' adventurous actions against Britain and France, but also are the main reason why these new adventurous actions can only be stopped by the strong counterattack of Britain and France.

Now we can draw a conclusion, that is, this new adventurous action of Japan is a pre-planned, international, and part of a new strategy of the aggression front. Its main purpose is to threaten Britain and France to implement the cessation of aid to China, and to implement joint Japanese and Chinese forces to strongly stop our country's resistance. In fact, it will also make the Italian and German strategies in Europe even more insane, and make the world war situation even more serious. But at the same time, this new adventurousness has its own weaknesses, its inevitable factors of failure, and its conditions for being immediately crushed. For the liberation of the Chinese nation, for the security of democratic and peaceful countries, and for the protection of world peace and justice, we must develop these conditions, promote the three major factors that can crush the new adventurous actions of Japan mentioned above, and inflict a fatal blow before these new adventurous actions succeed.

### The International Situation Moving Towards War

— Sun Dehua

(Continued from the February 15th edition of this newspaper)

The development of the peace front is first manifested in the consolidation and expansion of Soviet power, the increase in political prestige, the strength against fascist aggressors, the approach to peaceful and democratic countries, the assistance to the war of resistance of weak nations, the beginning of the second five-year plan, Poland's distancing from Germany and befriending the Soviet Union, the refusal to renew the Soviet-Japanese fishery treaty, the severance of diplomatic relations with Hungary, the suspension of German-Soviet trade negotiations, the opening of US-Soviet postal flights, the technical and material assistance to China's ordnance factories and mechanical troops, and the spiritual and material assistance to the wars of resistance of China and Spain. These are all concrete illustrations.

The development of the peace front is manifested in China and Spain's persistence in domestic unity and resistance. After Munich, British-Italian negotiations wanted to "resolve" the Spanish war. The determination of the Spanish people and the unity of various revolutionary political parties have made the strength of the Spanish government's resistance impossible to shake by external forces. A similar situation is also manifested in China. Although some people still want to "mediate" the Sino-Japanese war at an "appropriate" time, China's united resistance is also impossible to shake by external forces. On the contrary, countries such as Britain, the United States, and France are more willing to actively assist China. The persistence of resistance in China and Spain cannot but be a powerful impetus for the world peace front.

The development of the peace front is manifested in the expansion of the activities of the People's Front and the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movements in various countries around the world. The last national general strike in France, the Social Party's active opposition to the tailism of the Daladier government, and the gradually developing movement, the strikes and demonstrations of the British people against compromise with fascist aggressors, and the Labor Party becoming the opposition party in Congress. Eden, Baldwin, Churchill, and others advocate a strong stance against aggressors. The development of the democratic front in the United States, in various small countries in South America, and in Germany, Italy, and Japan, the People's Front is constantly developing. This situation will achieve significant progress after the Eighth Congress of the Third International.

The development of the peace front is manifested in the activeness of the United States. The call for the revision of the Neutrality Act, the expansion of armaments and the fortification of Guam, the establishment of a permanent Atlantic Fleet, the signing of the US-British-Canadian trade agreement, the success of the Eighth Pan-American Conference in the solidarity of anti-fascism, the toughness towards Germany, Italy, and Japan, the embargo on arms to Japan, the loans and arms assistance to China's war of resistance, and the approach to the Soviet Union. In Europe, it helps Britain and France resist the ferocity of Germany and Italy. These are all concrete illustrations. The United States is one of the world's major forces, and its active influence on Britain and France and the strengthening of the peace front are of great significance.

4. After the fall of Catalonia

Germany, Italy, and Japan raise the banner of "anti-communism," and their knives of aggression are aimed at Britain, France, and the United States. Therefore, objectively, it will inevitably strengthen the conflict between Germany, Italy, and Japan and Britain, France, and the United States. Using cooperation among the four powers to ease the European situation and oppose the Soviet Union is just the fantasy of the financial oligarchs of Britain and France! The facts are the best witness. When Britain, France, Germany, and Italy were exchanging pleasantries separately, and the ink on the German-French non-aggression declaration was not yet dry, Italy put forward demands for Corsica and Tunisia, mobilizing troops to concentrate on the borders of French territories in Northeast Africa, with a momentum that had to be resolved. Hitler expressed his support for Italy. This cannot but give France a great lesson, so it quickly deployed defenses in Tunisia and Corsica. Daladier said that "regarding the interests of France, we must pay attention" and "will not yield." Britain said that "we will definitely help France." The conflict of interests between Germany and Italy and Britain and France will inevitably become more tense with the fall of Catalonia.

Why did Catalonia fall? This is due to the more crazy assistance from the German and Italian fascists to the rebels' offensive, due to the authorities of Britain and France still being unwilling to accept the opinions of the masses, abolishing non-intervention, and actively assisting the Spanish government. Due to some leaders of the Second International not truly working hard to unite the strength of the workers and assisting the Spanish government on a global scale, and also due to the fact that the Spanish government army was only established after the outbreak of the war, and compared with the dominant Germany, Italy, and the rebels, it was really not easy to deal with. Catalonia therefore fell.

The fall of Catalonia will of course increase the difficulty for the Spanish government to continue fighting, because it has lost the only reliable land route to the country, and faces the danger of being completely surrounded on land and blockaded at sea. However, these difficulties cannot suppress the revolutionary fire of the Spanish people and cannot stop the Spanish government from persisting in resistance. The Spanish government "has now rejected the attempts of Britain and France to persuade them to agree to mediation after the defeat of the resistance in Catalonia," and declared that "it will return to Valencia and continue fighting in southern Spain."

The fall of Catalonia has further fueled the aggressive trend of Germany and Italy. At the time of the fall of Barcelona, Mussolini's speech, "The victory of the Franco troops in Barcelona is a 'new page' in the European history we are creating," and "declared" that "we will pass through" the territories of the Spanish government, revealing its ambition to engulf Spain. Coupled with the victory in Catalonia, the demands for Italian colonies are even more urgent, because they already have a greater position to control the Mediterranean, and can more seriously threaten the concessions of Britain and France.

Therefore, Britain and France will also fall into a more difficult position. France is geographically besieged by Germany, Italy, and Spain. Not only are Corsica and African territories such as Tunisia in imminent danger, but France itself also feels a great threat. If Spain falls completely into the hands of Germany and Italy, British Gibraltar will lose its importance, and the Mediterranean Sea will be in danger of being blocked by Italy at any time. It will take more than a month to bypass the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa to reach Asia from Europe. The territories of the British Empire will easily be attacked by Germany, Italy, and Japan, and governance will inevitably become difficult. Germany and Italy are using the difficulties of Britain and France to carry out further aggression, and Britain and France cannot but actively prepare. Therefore, on a global scale, the conflict between Germany, Italy, and Japan and Britain, France, and the United States is developing forward.

However, although Britain and France do not want Germany and Italy to excessively encroach on their own interests, they are also unwilling to conflict with Germany and Italy. This is not only revealed in the many speeches of Daladier and Chamberlain, but the facts also illustrate that they still have a fantasy, the best is that Italy has no territorial desires for Spain, or borrow money to the Spanish rebels to exclude Italy. As for the demands for colonies, Britain and France may still have some room for compromise. Not long ago, some French people advocated "borrowing flowers to offer Buddha" to the Belgian and Portuguese colonies in Africa. However, in the entire process of international situation development, it will not be as imagined by the British and French financial capital groups. Continuing to compromise and retreat to the aggressors will only lead to the acceleration of war.

5. China's War of Resistance

Under the brewing of a large-scale outbreak of world war, and in the tense state of the European situation due to the fall of Catalonia, it is an opportunity for Japan to take advantage of, and a favorable condition for Japan to "muster its remaining courage" and launch another large-scale offensive against us. Now the battle lines in the Southwest, Northwest, and Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan are gradually becoming tense.

At this time, Britain and France are struggling to "ease" the European situation, and their attention to the Far East will be weakened for a while. Therefore, activities to find an "appropriate" time to "mediate" the Sino-Japanese war may reappear. This activity will also facilitate the activities of pro-Japanese elements in the country to compromise for peace. However, it will undoubtedly be met with a strong response from the Chinese government and people in their firm resistance.

On the other hand, Japan's barbaric and shameless aggression, and China's heroic and tenacious resistance, have caused the world's working class and peace-loving people to continuously expand the movement to aid China, and have influenced the governments of Britain, the United States, and France to actively assist us. This proves that our country's war of resistance for justice and peace can receive much international assistance, giving us more confidence to defeat Japanese imperialism.

We are not only fighting for the independence and survival of the Chinese nation, but also for world justice and peace. We must strengthen unity, crush the attacks of Japanese imperialists, establish closer ties with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, promote the world peace front, and eliminate the fascist and terrorist aggressive camp of Germany, Italy, and Japan.

### Relief for Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi: The Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai Expands Fundraising, Organizes Committees Divided into 26 Groups to Solicit Donations, Feng Bingnan Reports on Progress at General Meeting

[Shanghai Correspondence] In order to provide relief to the refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai established the "Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai Relief Fundraising Committee for Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi" last winter. Now, in order to expand fundraising, a general meeting of all fundraising members was held. Present were Vice Chairman Guo Shun, Guo Zhongliang, Executive Committee Member Cui, Pengxi, Li Ze, Lin Bingyan, Pan Zhiquan, Zheng Zhaobin, Yang Meinan, Cai Chang, and various representatives, totaling over two hundred people. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Feng Bingnan was absent due to illness. Vice Chairman Shun represented him in reading Feng's opening remarks, which stated: Thinking of Mencius's words, "Benevolence is man's heart," and "The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence." If benevolence is man's heart, then man's heart is inherently benevolent. Being moved by feelings then expresses itself as compassion. In this time of serious national crisis, soldiers and disasters have ravaged the land, rivers and mountains are shattered, homes are reduced to scorched earth, and fields are turned into ashes. The dead have no one to bury them, white bones pile up, and the remains are scattered across the fields. Those who are fortunate enough to survive are scattered and separated, exposed to the elements, wandering aimlessly, starving, and freezing, awaiting death. Under such circumstances, how can one not be heartbroken? Therefore, although I am ill, I still do my best in relief work, for no other reason than that the heart of compassion cannot help but move me. When the August 13th Incident occurred two years ago, sea routes were blocked, merchant ships were stopped, and railways were also busy with military affairs, unable to carry cargo as usual. Furthermore, airplanes bombed indiscriminately, everywhere was dangerous. Food supplies were hindered, and the number of refugees increased daily. I could not bear to sit idly by, so I rose from my sickbed and negotiated repeatedly with foreign shipping companies, finally restoring traffic on the sea routes. From then on, food supplies gradually resumed in the city. Refugees who had homes to return to were able to disperse at any time. Also, worrying about the travel expenses of the refugees, I jointly suggested to the municipal authorities to organize a refugee dispersal committee, raising funds to send the refugees back to their hometowns. As a result, tens of thousands of refugees were able to return to their hometowns. However, although the sea routes were open, refugees from all directions continued to arrive in Shanghai in an endless stream. After careful consideration, I realized that the refugees were gathering in increasing numbers, and the financial resources of one place could not permanently sustain them. Therefore, I suggested to the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross to organize international agencies to assume the responsibility of relief work. After six or seven weeks of effort by me and my colleagues, the International Committee of the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross was finally established, taking on various tasks. It is estimated that the largest number of refugees at that time was about 200,000. Not only was food provided, but diseases were also treated, and even pregnant women and infants were cared for. Now our compatriots in Guangdong and Guangxi have also suffered from the ravages of war, scattering in panic, with casualties piled high. Everywhere is nothing but danger, and there is crisis everywhere. Those fleeing for their lives have nowhere to escape, and those seeking refuge have nowhere to avoid. Therefore, we have specifically initiated the Relief Fundraising Committee for Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi. First, we held a tea party at my residence. Kindhearted people from our native place enthusiastically joined and generously donated. At my call, 10,000 taels of silver were immediately gathered, which shows that the heart of compassion is possessed by everyone, and everyone is as good as I am. Therefore, today's fundraising should use my personal team spirit to move everyone's heart of compassion, so that everyone knows that they have their own responsibilities and will not give them up. Mencius said, "There has never been a case where sincerity does not move others." Therefore, our only concern is that we cannot be sincere. I am willing to share this encouragement with all the fundraising gentlemen.

Report on Progress

Next, Cui Pengxi reported on the progress of the preparations, saying that after receiving a letter from the Guangzhou International Red Cross, reporting on the tragic situation of the disaster victims in Guangdong and Guangxi, Mr. Feng Bingnan, thinking of the suffering of his elders, brothers, and sisters in his hometown, invited fellow villagers in Shanghai to a tea party on December 13th of last year. On the same day, the Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai Relief Fundraising Committee for Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi was established at Feng's residence, and Mr. Feng was publicly elected as the chairman, and Guo Shun and Guo Zhongliang were elected as the vice-chairmen. All the participants immediately recognized and donated 10,009 yuan. All donations were deposited in 18 banks, companies, and organizations in the hometown. Next, Jiang Hezhuang reported, and Shi Enming, a representative of the Guangzhou International Red Cross, reported on the general situation of Guangdong and the relief work. Tan Rongpu, Guo Zhongliang, Li Ze, Chen Juhao, Situ Wei, Lu Songqian, Xu Songshi, and others then gave speeches.

Important Officials

Chairman Feng Bingnan, Vice Chairman and Vice Committee Chairman Guo Shun and Guo Zhongliang, Chief of General Affairs Section He Pusheng, Director of Design Section Cui Pengxi, and Fang Yusheng, Li Ze, Lu Songqian, Chen Jufen, Jiang Hezhuang, Guo Qiming, Chen Qihao, Pan Zhiquan, etc.

Group Fundraising

In order to promote the fundraising movement, the association has established 26 groups, including the Group Group, Delong Group, Financial Group, Shenshou Group, Silk and Cloth Group, Mian'an Group, Guang'an Group, Department Store Group, Guangdong Goods Group, Hardware Group, Tea Group, Industry Group, Shipping Group, Chinese Medicine Group, Foreign Affairs Group, Customs Group, Yan'an Group, Hotel Group, Restaurant Group, Women's Group, etc. Each group hires a number of people as fundraising committee members to solicit donations separately.

### Industrial Cooperation in China's Economic Mobilization

— Shou Miancheng

The emergence of the cooperative movement in China dates back more than twenty years. Although attention was paid early on to the promotion of production cooperation, the theoretical principles were first put into practice in local autonomy programs. Furthermore, special attention was given to industrial cooperation as a separate discipline. The Cooperative Academy of the Central Political Academy also specifically established a department of industrial cooperation to engage in exploration for application. However, the lack of development of industrial cooperation remained the same, which is a great regret in the history of cooperative economics in China.

The reason why industrial cooperation is important can be stated in several reasons. First, from the perspective of cooperation, various cooperative enterprises, such as production cooperation, transportation and sales cooperation, supply cooperation, credit cooperation, consumer cooperation, insurance cooperation, public utility cooperation, etc., should seek balanced development, as if forming a new economic system, in order to be used freely. Therefore, the promotion of industrial cooperation can make China's cooperative economic system more complete than before. This goes without saying. This is one. The purpose of the cooperative system is to seek the transformation of the entire economic society, and the scope of the transformation must include industry. Therefore, the promotion of industrial cooperation shows how we should apply the cooperative approach to seek the improvement of industrial organizations. This is two. Moreover, industrial cooperation is particularly closely related to agricultural cooperation and consumer cooperation, because the processing of agricultural products and the manufacture of consumer goods should be based on industrial cooperation. The operation of industrial cooperation also promotes the development of consumer cooperation and agricultural cooperation. Although the order of production may be different, their mutual functions are the same. This is three.

Second, from the perspective of industry, the abuses of the capitalist factory system are well known to everyone, and the more serious one is the spiritual separation between labor and capital. Capitalists almost regard workers as commodities or machines, resulting in a complete loss of emotion, and only exploitation remains. Laborers work hard for capitalists year after year, and capitalists not only do not know how to improve the lives of workers, but are also fundamentally indifferent. At the same time, the reason why laborers enter the factory to work is nothing more than being forced by livelihood. They cannot eat without working. They have never known the capitalist, nor have they ever felt any interest in their work. Over time, it is difficult to prevent labor unrest, and it is even more impossible to improve work efficiency reasonably. If the results of China's industrial development in the future do not know how to prevent problems before they occur, then the abuses will be combined, and the situation will inevitably be as serious as in other countries. Cooperative factories are a rational way of modern industrial operation. Therefore, the promotion of industrial cooperation is an important modification to the factory system. This is one. Although the size of industries varies, China's ordnance industry, basic industry, etc. may not be suitable for cooperative operation. However, even in industrialized countries such as Europe, America, and Japan, the proportion of industrial products manufactured by small-scale factories is still not small, and they are advocating the industrialization of rural areas, spreading industries to the countryside. What about our country, which lacks national capital and organizational capacity? Therefore, large-scale industries cannot do without small-scale industries as a supplement, and the cooperative approach is the most ideal method for small-scale industries. This is two. Moreover, small-scale industries are not without their special advantages, allowing their lives to continue permanently. Small-scale industries, labor and capital are relatively close, and it is not easy to cause disputes, and even if there are disputes, they are easily resolved, first. Small-scale factories have less fixed capital and are easier to adapt to market needs, so that capital is not wasted due to economic decline, second. Small factories have simple equipment and are easier to establish, so that opportunities are not missed, third.

### Bitter Fighting by Military and Civilians in Hainan Island; One-Fourth of Landed × Annihilated; × Still Being Blocked in Coastal Counties

[Lin 23rd Dispatch] Although × has reinforced Hainan Island and is aggressively attacking the interior, it has been blocked by us in the coastal counties and has not been able to advance further. Currently, it is stabilizing near An Ding, and the fighting is still fierce. The civilians on our island are assisting the isolated troops in resisting the war. In the past ten days, nearly one-fourth of the × that landed has been annihilated by us, showing the intensity of the fighting. Recently, a certain commander personally went to the front to direct the battle, boosting morale greatly. The major battles in various parts of South China have not yet begun. In the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, as well as between Zengcheng and Conghua, guerrilla warfare has been launched. There is contact with × every day. The main force of × is still concentrated in Guangzhou, Zengcheng, and Conghua.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 23rd Dispatch] Shaanxi Telegram: × is still actively attacking the guerrilla forces in Hebei and Shandong provinces, especially in southern Hebei. × has redeployed troops along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, the Jinpu Railway, and the Pinghan Railway. Local fierce battles are taking place in Jin, but the overall situation remains unchanged. There are only minor conflicts in central Hubei and eastern Henan.

[Our Newspaper Qing 23rd Dispatch] × reinforced Shicheng with more than 4,000 troops, spearheaded by a highly mechanized brigade. They launched a fierce attack on Tianmen with the cooperation of the army and air force. Our troops fought fiercely for two days and nights. Due to the disparity in numbers, we retreated slightly, but are still continuing the bloody battle. Our troops in Hebei have recovered Raoyang, Renqiu, and Su County in succession, and are now besieging Lixian and Hejian. Sun's troops are also fiercely attacking × head-on in the Weixian area. The troops on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines have lost contact, shattering their sweeping dream.

[Central News Agency, a certain place, 23rd Dispatch] On the 20th, 30 × planes raided Lanzhou. Initially, our air force shot down nine planes, with losses exceeding ten million US dollars. On the 23rd, more than 20 × planes invaded Lanzhou again. After a fierce air battle, a total of six × planes were shot down. Three planes caught fire and burned in the air, and three planes were billowing black smoke and crashed east of Lanzhou. The remaining planes frantically dropped bombs in the urban area and fled eastward in a panic. Our planes suffered no losses. This is the second major victory of our air force since the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance.

[Central News Agency Luoyang 23rd Dispatch] More than 10,000 members of the pseudo-self-defense forces in Liangxiang and Fangshan, including Chen Donglai, Bai Xiuting, Zhou Wenlong, and Hu Shihai, have revolted.

[Central News Agency Zhengzhou 23rd Dispatch] Tianjin News: Our volunteer army in the four northeastern provinces is becoming increasingly active. The railway along the Andong-Shenyang line near Fengcheng has been severely damaged by our volunteer army. The Beining Railway near Dahushan is also frequently attacked by the volunteer army. Currently, × troops have dispatched heavy troops to garrison along the road and are engaged in security.

[Central News Agency Yulin 23rd Dispatch] Our troops attacked the Baotou × airport the day before yesterday and encountered the × garrison, resulting in a fierce battle. × also dispatched armored vehicles for reinforcement. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time, destroying two × armored vehicles, seizing more than ten rifles, one submachine gun, and killing dozens of × soldiers. Our troops returned safely to their defenses.

[Associated Press Qing 23rd Dispatch] The Chinese Information Department here announced that the Chinese side currently has one million guerrilla troops, from Hainan Island in the south to Baotou in Inner Mongolia in the north, engaged in resistance in various ways within the Japanese defense lines. These guerrilla troops have now been reallocated and reorganized, with certain areas designated, and are completely and directly under the command of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Defense Council. All instructions and directions are issued separately by radio from here. The guerrilla strategy is to constantly restrain Japanese troops by flanking and rear attacks, so that the Chinese regular army can firmly defend its strongholds, and at the same time force the Japanese army to defend the lines of communication and dare not attack. Furthermore, it can trap and exhaust the Japanese army, forcing them to withdraw. In addition, the guerrilla forces have achieved excellent results in education and political work in the guerrilla areas, organizing the people and educating the people. This situation poses a threat to the rear of the Japanese army, and the victory of the War of Resistance depends heavily on it.

[Associated Press Chongqing 23rd Dispatch] The official here yesterday received a report from the Guangdong Provincial Government, stating that from January 1 to February 10, more than 3,200 Japanese troops died in South China, all of whom were cremated, and their ashes have been transported to Japan. In addition, a certain brigade of the Japanese army in Guangzhou was ordered last week to go to Hainan Island to reinforce the Japanese army there.

Among the more than 140 cases passed, most were of positive construction. Everyone is trying to help resist the war and build the country. The Supreme National Defense Council has transferred the resolutions of this council to the relevant authorities for proper handling, which shows that the government can give appropriate attention to the resolutions of this council. As for the handling of the transferred cases by the competent authorities, generally speaking, about 80 cases are under review, and about 40 cases are under discussion or for reference. As for the implementation and effect of the cases under review, it is not easy to find out in detail due to materials and time constraints. (Excerpt) In order to promote future implementation efficiency, the following suggestions are made: (1) The government should supervise the implementation of the previous resolutions, and in the future, the cases should be transferred to the competent authorities, and it is hoped that they will be implemented within a limited time within the possible scope; (2) The competent authorities should provide more detailed reports on the implementation of the resolutions of this council. If there are difficulties or problems in the implementation of important cases or expert reports, please also explain in detail so that they can be studied and resolved together; (3) The implementation of each case should be reviewed by the resident committee members at any time, and the Secretariat should assist in finding out the facts and report to the conveners of this council, Jiang Kang and Hang Liwu, at each meeting.

### Foreigners in Kuling Forced to Retreat; Some Still Remain in the Safety Zone; × Again Makes Threatening Remarks

[Reuters Shanghai 23rd Dispatch] Forty-seven foreigners and thirteen Chinese servants in Kuling, escorted by the captains of the British warship "Gnat" and the American warship "Oahu," walked 25 miles through the Sino-Japanese defense lines yesterday and arrived in Jiujiang. According to Japanese documents, the group of foreigners included 19 British, 11 Americans, 7 Germans, 3 Belgians, and 1 Russian and 1 Latvian. The remaining foreigners remained in Kuling, including an 84-year-old British woman who did not leave the mountain. The Japanese documents stated that the Japanese army hopes they are safe and sound, but if casualties are unfortunately caused by military actions, the Japanese army cannot be responsible. The documents also falsely accused the Chinese army in Kuling of cooperating with some foreigners and Chinese to obtain supplies and intelligence.

[Associated Press Shanghai 23rd Dispatch] A Japanese military spokesman here said that the British and American authorities have consulted with the Japanese authorities to delineate a safety zone in the curved surface south of Kuling to accommodate foreigners in Kuling who do not want to withdraw. However, if the Japanese army finds Chinese soldiers near the area, it will still attack. Since November of last year, the Japanese authorities have issued warnings four times, urging foreigners in Kuling to withdraw, so they cannot be responsible for the loss of life and property of third-country citizens.

### Shanghai × Presses Concessions; Britain Adopts a Tough Stance; Opposes Changing the Administrative Organization of Concessions; Morishima Reports to Foreign Minister Arita Yesterday

[Reuters London 23rd Dispatch] According to a Daily Mail reporter, the British government is extremely dissatisfied with the Japanese demands on the Shanghai Municipal Council and will adopt a tough and resolute attitude, as it did with the bombing of Hong Kong.

[Central News Agency London 23rd Dispatch] Those who pay attention to the Far East situation are closely watching the situation in Shanghai. British officials cannot state the government's attitude towards Japan until the content of the demands made by the Japanese authorities to the Municipal Council is certain. However, Britain opposes changing the administrative organization of the Public Concession by coercive means.

[Central News Agency Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] Shanghai Foreign News: Since the bombing in Nanjing Road during the victory celebration parade held by the Japanese military and civilians in Shanghai on December 3, 1937, Japanese newspapers have been constantly attacking the Municipal Council. The Japanese authorities have visited the Director-General of the Municipal Council and made demands to him. The content is similar to the demands made by Hashimoto, the chief of the Japanese special service agency, to the Municipal Council after the bombing incident last year.

[Reuters Tokyo 23rd Dispatch] Morishima, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, met with Foreign Minister Arita today to report on the situation in the Shanghai Concession. It is understood that Morishima will fly back to Shanghai with new instructions within one or two days.

[Reuters Tokyo 23rd Dispatch] In the House of Peers yesterday, Foreign Minister Arita said that the government is preparing to start new negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council due to the repeated occurrence of terrorist incidents in Shanghai. He said that the government had already requested the Municipal Council to increase the number of Japanese police and their powers as early as last year, and said that if the overall situation does not deteriorate further, the government does not intend to adopt the most extreme measures.

[Reuters London 23rd Dispatch] Newspapers here today launched a large-scale attack on Japan's attempt to expand its influence in the Shanghai Public Concession, saying that assassinations occurred in the "crime zone" that foreigners cannot manage and should be the responsibility of the Japanese. The Times said that the Japanese slander is completely unfounded, because the Japanese themselves often cause trouble in the Concession. If Shanghai were under Japanese management, it would immediately be on the verge of chaos. The Manchester Guardian said that Shanghai's security forces are extremely sufficient, but terrorists are often disguised as Japanese to cause disputes and then plan to attack. The Daily Mail said that no matter how far the Japanese army develops outside the Concession, the Public Concession has no need to make concessions.

[Haitong News Agency Shanghai 23rd Dispatch] Yesterday, the highest authorities of the Japanese Navy and Army, together with the Japanese Consul-General, visited the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and requested that effective measures be taken to deal with the recent activities of terrorists in Shanghai. Later, representatives of the Japanese Navy and Army visited the commanders of the British and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai and stated the requirements to the Municipal Council. However, neither the Japanese side nor the Municipal Council has announced the means of the so-called "effective measures" to this day. It is generally speculated that the steps taken by the Japanese side will be quite harsh, or that pedestrians will be banned from traveling in the evening, Japanese sentries will be stationed at important traffic points in the Concession, and passing certificates will be checked, etc.

[Associated Press Shanghai 23rd Dispatch] The Municipal Council here has formally denied the report in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun that the Japanese side made a request to the Municipal Council yesterday that included increasing the number of Japanese police. At present, both the Municipal Council and the Japanese side refuse to publish the exact content of the request. However, it is generally observed that the Japanese newspapers' propaganda is not as rampant as before, and it is assumed that it is due to the instructions of the Japanese government not to expand the incident in order to avoid causing too many international disputes.

### Closing Ceremony of the Political Participation Council - Full Text of Speaker Chiang's Address (Continued from Yesterday's Third Edition)

Establishing Democratic Politics - The Responsibility We Should Fulfill

How should we fulfill our responsibility to establish the foundation of democratic politics? From now on, I would like to take the opportunity to mutually encourage each other with all of you, the council members, to clarify what kind of true democratic politics our Republic of China wants to create, and what methods and steps we must follow. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, with his mastery of both Chinese and Western learning, deeply understood the global trends and the domestic situation. Based on his forty years of revolutionary experience, he personally created the Three Principles of the People, aiming to bring the Chinese nation to a state of prosperity, strength, and happiness. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's understanding of the Three Principles of the People was to implement a more thorough and practical democratic system than any other country in the world. In the Principle of Democracy, he criticized the theory of natural rights and advocated for revolutionary democracy. Secondly, he wanted the people to fully enjoy the four direct rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision was far-reaching, focusing on the highest and most distant goals. However, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was not only an idealist but also a revolutionary practitioner. He believed that the more practical the ideal, the better. Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed that only when the people could faithfully carry out the revolutionary principles and fulfill their revolutionary obligations could they be granted preliminary civil rights. He also believed that the people's minds must be trained through the exercise of civil rights before they could fully use those rights. The democratic politics that Dr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to create was a democratic politics that should be taken seriously, without any extravagance. However, the Chinese people, burdened by the bad habits of generations of autocracy, had weak intelligence and strength. People were accustomed to being undisciplined and selfish, and there were many obstacles within the country. Given such a background, achieving such an ideal naturally required starting with hard work and small steps, as it could not be achieved overnight. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen defined the implementation steps for completing the revolutionary work as three periods: military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government.

Strictly Speaking, Still in the Military Government Period

Since the establishment of the National Government, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, we first sought national unification and then began the tutelage government. We originally hoped to actively promote the realization of constitutional government and quickly achieve the goal of revolutionary nation-building. Unfortunately, unification was not achieved, and obstacles arose again. For five or six years, the majority of the nation's human and financial resources were used for the work of the military government period. Just as we were catching our breath, the Japanese invaders invaded deeper and deeper. The government, in order to protect the country's sovereignty and the people's lives, rose up to fight. After nineteen months of hard fighting, the loss of our country's territory and the losses of the people cannot be measured in terms of distance or quantity. Based on the current situation, not only has the work of the tutelage government period been hindered, but the work done during the military government period must be done all over again. In other words, we must first eliminate the invading forces, destroy the traitors and puppets, and destroy the revolutionary forces that poison the country and harm the nation. After the mountains and rivers are restored and the country is purified, we can then engage in tutelage government and prepare for constitutional government. Therefore, strictly speaking, we are still in the military government period. According to Article 6 of the Outline of National Reconstruction, the work at this time should be that "all systems are based on military government. The government, on the one hand, uses military force to eliminate domestic obstacles, and on the other hand, promotes doctrines to enlighten the hearts of our people."

Military Affairs are of Course Paramount, but Tutelage Government Cannot Be Neglected

However, as mentioned above, the current needs of our country and nation are to carry out resistance and reconstruction simultaneously. We must concentrate public opinion, mobilize the strength of the people, and actively prepare for the completion of national reconstruction after the war. At the same time, during the resistance against Japan, the people's sense of responsibility to the country and their understanding of the Three Principles of the People must also be improved. Therefore, even during the military government period of eliminating obstacles, the work of tutelage government must still be carried out simultaneously. In order to quickly complete the great cause of the revolution, we should not only actively promote tutelage government within the scope that does not hinder military government, but also hope that the progress of tutelage government can supplement military government. Therefore, we must understand that before the end of the resistance against Japan, "military affairs are paramount" and "victory is paramount." We must focus on the work of the military government period while actively carrying out the work of tutelage government. This understanding is essential; otherwise, all work will lose its focus. Because what we want to create is thorough democratic politics, we cannot neglect the procedures and steps.

Democratic Systems, Laws, and Extreme Respect for the People

At the same time, because our country has been accustomed to autocratic politics for thousands of years, the people's hearts and minds are accustomed to being governed and lack the qualities and training to participate in politics. To implement democratic politics, obstacles must be eliminated, and all foundations must be established. Therefore, we must go through revolutionary construction. Dr. Sun Yat-sen divided the revolutionary process into three periods and solemnly warned us: "The Xinhai Revolution, within a few months, overthrew the monarchical autocracy of more than four thousand years and the Manchu conquest class of two hundred and sixty years. Its destructive power cannot be said to be insignificant. However, to this day, the implementation of the Three Principles of the People is still far from being started because, after the destruction, there has never been a predetermined procedure for construction." Because at that time, some people ignored the natural order of things and extravagantly talked about democracy, resulting in the provisional constitution being reduced to mere words, and disasters followed one after another. This led to the country's laws becoming tools for politicians and warlords to do evil. Not only was democratic politics not realized, but it also created many obstacles and sins for democratic politics. Just as a revolutionary said during the French Revolution: "O Liberty, how many crimes are committed in your name!" We must correct this mistake by starting from the West and building the entire freedom of our country and nation, enabling the country and nation to obtain true freedom. Since the establishment of this council, all of us have been able to sacrifice our individual freedoms and personal prejudices to lay the foundation for true democracy, which is the most gratifying thing since the establishment of the Republic of China, especially during the period of resistance against Japan. It is deeply believed that in the future, we will be able to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings even more closely, advocate for the people of the whole country to work hard during the period of tutelage government, and take responsibility for promoting and practicing it, while preventing the recurrence of irresponsibility and disregard for the facts. We must make the general public aware that democratic politics cannot be viewed as a state of lawlessness, disorder, and anarchy. The public opinion on which democratic politics is based must be sound, collective, and representative of the will of the majority. The freedom granted to the people by democratic politics must be freedom that does not harm the public interest or violate national laws. Especially since our country is now in a period of severe foreign aggression, we must educate the people to respect the absoluteness of national laws and power. The government is the depository of national power, the executor of laws, and the protector of all the people. In order to effectively protect the interests of all the people and the entire nation, those who undermine laws and regulations and destroy the system must be sanctioned according to law. Sanctions based on law cannot be equated with oppression. In all countries that practice democratic politics, there are government systems and laws. The systems and laws under democratic politics must be respected by the people and cannot allow a few to destroy them.

### The Wuhan Refugees in Deep Water and Scorching Fire

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

It has been three months since the evacuation of Wuhan. During this period, how are our compatriots in the three towns who did not escape being trampled on by the Japanese? I think everyone must be extremely concerned. Although the Japanese have tried their best to block the river transport and cover up their evil deeds in Wuhan, their military strength is ultimately weak, and their defenses are lax. Recently, on the border of Hunan and Hubei, there has been a constant stream of Wuhan refugees who could not bear the trampling, escaping with great difficulty, finally breaking free from the tiger's mouth, and stepping onto the sacred and pure land of Hunan again!

On a train filled with soldiers and civilians of all ranks, from Miluo to Nankai:

"If I couldn't escape and was caught and killed by those Japanese devils, it would be better than living like a beast of burden in Hankou!" This was the first sentence spoken by a refugee with a knife scar on the corner of his right eye. He continued, "How can it be that we, the people of a great nation, are being bullied by those from a small country? What kind of 'ancient text' is this? Humph! It's just a dream!" He then put his pipe in his mouth. He looked about forty years old.

"When I, my fellow countrymen, arrived at our 'territory,' I was startled to see our sergeant on guard at the mouth of the small mountain valley. Later, when I saw clearly that it was our sergeant, I was extremely happy, so happy that I didn't even notice being searched all over (referring to the inspection)!" said another, a little younger. But his beard and hair were equally long, and coupled with a dry face, anyone would mistake him for someone close to fifty years old. They had escaped from the Japanese's "nine deaths and one life," so their faces, though dry, and their ages, though old-looking, could not hide their youthful joy.

The tin open-air car speeding southward was constantly and loudly clamoring "kong long kong long." I was really afraid that the valuable conversation of these two "survivors" would be blown away by the clatter of the train and the cold wind, so I moved closer to them and asked:

"What kind of suffering have you experienced in Hankou at the hands of the Japanese?"

"When the Japanese first arrived in Hankou, we hid in a shanty, and didn't hear any gunshots. One of my buddies thought they probably hadn't come yet. We had been hiding for three days straight, and we were out of food. We were just thinking of going out to take a look when three Japanese came and knocked on the door: 'Hey! There are many people hiding here. Are you soldiers or civilians? Civilians? Quickly hand over the silver dollars you're hiding!' We were hard-working people; where would we hide silver dollars? Unexpectedly, the two who didn't speak lit a match and set fire to the shack. Those two guys even blocked the door with bayonets, asking 'Where are the silver dollars?' This buddy (referring to the older man) was impatient and jumped out of the door first, and was immediately stabbed in the corner of his eye. The fire grew bigger and bigger, and we finally rushed out together. At that time, another buddy named Liu was unfortunately stabbed in the abdomen, and he pitifully fell down and didn't move!

"The rest of us, including me, five in total, were tied together like we were robbers and sent to a movie theater. At first, coming from the bright place to the dark place, we couldn't see anything. Later, when my eyes adjusted, I saw that it was already crowded with two or three hundred people, so much that we didn't even dare to cough loudly. I thought to myself: I wonder what they're going to do with us? Maybe tomorrow they'll use a machine gun to mow us down! The varnished wooden chairs were burned, and the stench was overwhelming, making us sick.

"Later, we were divided into batches and sent out of the theater to carry bullets and move things for them... If you were a little unwilling, they would take you to see the corpses of many people who had been shot and stabbed to death, covered in blood; they would even 'knock' a few people dead on the spot to warn the others, so we swallowed our anger and obeyed like beasts of burden.

"Our group was indeed a little older and couldn't carry things far, so we were taken to repair the airfield. Little did we know that the work was even harder in the freezing cold. It was just 'crocodile tears,' and they even pretended to pay us thirty cents a day, but as soon as you took the money with your right hand, your left hand had to give it to the Korean who was in charge of the thin porridge!

"When the Japanese arrived in Wuhan, because they didn't have any vegetables to eat, they couldn't wait to pluck any green leaves or grass and eat them. But our unlucky stars came again. After we got off work at the airfield, we still had to follow them everywhere to dig lotus ponds and arrowheads, no matter how deep the mud was or how cold the winter was, we had to go down to help them dig lotus roots and arrowheads. Once, when I pulled my cold, aching hands out of the mud to warm them, stones came flying at me, almost killing me in the lotus pond!"

The Japanese were so cruel that I couldn't bear to listen any further. At the same time, the eyes of the person telling me these tragic stories were a little red. So, I had to change the angle and ask another question:

"In these three months in Wuhan, haven't you encountered anything that made you even slightly happy?"

"That's right! If you hadn't brought it up, I would have almost forgotten." He rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand: "Every time our planes went to Wuhan, we were very happy. It wasn't just us; all the people of Wuhan were like that. Once, six planes went and dropped many bombs on the Japanese aircraft depot. Another time, nine planes went and had an aerial battle with the Japanese over Hanyang. Although the time was very short, they shot down a Japanese plane. We saw these two times with our own eyes, and we were so happy that we cried. In addition, planes flew to bomb Japanese warships at night, which we often heard people say.

"Also, when two of my buddies escaped, they first disguised themselves as villagers going to the countryside to buy vegetables and actually managed to fool the Japanese..."

"No; they were from our Dong Province!" The older refugee, who hadn't spoken for a while, suddenly interjected to correct him.

"Chinese are Chinese after all! When I was fighting in Shanghai, the Northeastern puppet soldiers often shouted to our side: 'Fellow villagers, raise your guns a little higher...'" Another wounded soldier began to describe this in detail, exchanging information with the refugees. But our spirits and imaginations were still injected into the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Wuhan. It seemed that the lives of deep water and scorching fire they were living were the same as what these two refugees had encountered!

### Chamberlain's Speech: Strengthening Military Preparedness to Protect Peace, Striving to Assist Trade Development, Requesting Support for Government Policies

[Reuters, London, 23rd] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a speech in Bracknell last night, asked the country to support the government's policies. He said that as the world situation is turbulent, the attention of the people is mostly focused on foreign politics and preparations are being made for times of emergency. Although military preparedness is sufficient, one cannot but consider the day when this military preparedness is used. If such a day comes, no one can escape its influence. We are now adopting a policy of maintaining strength to protect peace. This policy is sufficient to suppress all doubts and malice, rapidly establish the British Empire, and protect our rights and freedoms. Therefore, today, only the foolish will consider this policy inappropriate. The British government has now overcome the shortcomings of lagging military equipment production. Ships, artillery, airplanes, and bullets are being produced in a steady stream, and their strength has greatly increased compared to the previous few months. The Air Force has created a new situation in modern warfare and can endanger civilians. We cannot absolutely protect the safety of the people and avoid air attacks, but we can establish ways to reduce the effectiveness of air raids and avoid the people's panic. I guarantee that our country must maintain its fighting strength. Chamberlain then discussed the situation of domestic defense facilities under the guidance of Sir Anderson, saying, "I know that some people have fiercely criticized steel shelters, believing that the construction of these shelters requires an investment of 20 million pounds, yet they still cannot eliminate the danger of direct bombardment, so they should be abolished and replaced with deep underground shelters, so that the danger of any bomb can be avoided. However, if we think about it a little, we will know that the facts are not that simple. Just imagine, is it possible to enter an extremely deep underground shelter at will without panic or haste? Moreover, if the entrance to the shelter is subjected to a direct bombing, there will inevitably be significant casualties. I am deeply grateful to the people who voluntarily participate in national service. The significance of their assistance to national work is threefold: (1) to show the world that the British are willing to serve voluntarily without coercion; (2) to know how to respond when national disasters arrive; and (3) we can practically prevent war, because the more prepared we are, the less others dare to offend us. However, there are still shortcomings at present. I hope that our people will work harder and voluntarily participate in national service. Although our military expansion plan is very large, it is not used to intimidate anyone, nor is there any motive. My greatest wish in life is to establish peace and mutual trust. I firmly believe that if countries can develop mutual confidence, then the matter of arms reduction can be agreed upon and implemented by the public. Countries are expanding their armaments madly because they fear that arms reduction will produce adverse consequences. After this fear is dispelled, arms reduction can proceed automatically." Regarding the unemployment situation in Lancashire, Chamberlain said, "The main reason for unemployment is due to foreign competition, especially from the Far East. Today, if we want to restore the previous state of the cotton industry, it is impossible, but we are not doing nothing. The government and traders will cooperate in the following three aspects: (1) work together to develop trade that is still superior to other countries; (2) strive for internal sound organization to help the development of trade; and (3) develop new businesses and make them suitable for the people. Although the number of unemployed people registered in the United Kingdom last month reached two million, most of them were unemployed for less than six weeks, and many found other jobs after being unemployed. However, there are about 300,000 truly unemployed people. The government will do its best to find ways to settle these unemployed people. We have no reason to be pessimistic about the general occupational problems of the future and the special export trade. At present, the world's purchasing power is in a downward trend, which is a hindrance to increasing export trade, but I believe that the possible demand of foreign countries for British goods is still huge, but it is affected by the instability of the international situation. Therefore, I warmly welcome the recent British-German coal agreement. Commerce Minister Stanley will visit Berlin next month, which will be very helpful in improving British-German trade. The improvement of commercial relations between Britain and Germany may be the fastest way for the two countries to improve their relations. Last month, Hitler said that mutual trust and cooperation between the British and German people would be beneficial to the world. I very much agree with this statement. I go one step further now. This contribution to the establishment of world peace is very great. This mutual confidence is not cultivated in a day. If it is disturbed, it will take a long time to recover. I ask both sides to maintain this friendly situation, and the conflicts and anxieties of the past can be compensated for. I believe that people around the world will eventually be able to enter the clear air from the mist of arms expansion and war. Eight thousand people listened to Chamberlain's speech. Chamberlain and his wife were warmly welcomed. The venue was heavily guarded, and obstacles were set up outside the venue. Anyone who did not have an admission ticket was not allowed to enter. Women had to open their handbags for inspection to prevent possible bomb cases.

### China Forms a Great Nation in the Southwest - The Spirit of Unity is Becoming More Thoroughly Imbued - World Stability Really Depends on It - Mr. Guo Taiqi's Speech at Oxford

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Mr. Guo Taiqi, in a speech at the banquet of the Oxford China Association last night, said, "In 1938, China had experienced everything. Today, we can describe the past with hope and confidence." He said that China this year has discovered its position. In terms of both internal affairs and international relations, it is stronger than last year. China, although materially suffered a major disaster, but not spiritually. In the past year, China has lost various cities and most of its coast, but this is exchanging space for time. China has formed a great nation in the southwestern provinces during this struggle, and it is thriving. He said that the recognition that this result in the Far East is closely related to international relations is the most significant development in the past year, and it is exciting. The major historical processes and obstacles of the five continents of the world have been most clearly demonstrated in the Far East. What China realized in 1931, people all over the world now (1939) understand. China and Japan are now engaged in a major struggle, and their hopes and toxins have flowed into various countries. At this time, China's spirit of unity is becoming more actively imbued. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally telegraphed London, saying that the recent meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang was greatly encouraged by the recent more active policies adopted by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Ambassador Guo said that at present, the aid from the neighboring Soviet Union is gradually increasing, which is a great contribution to this war. Ambassador Guo then mentioned the development situation in the southwest, saying that China should not be unaware of the difficulties of rapid modernization. However, the perseverance and intelligence of the Chinese people are well known to the world. China, on the one hand, must train new troops and improve its strategy, and on the other hand, it must launch guerrilla warfare. It is exciting to have such achievements. This guerrilla warfare is another way of all-out resistance in China. China needs all possible assistance. Only with China's development can the world feel at ease. If China hesitates, the world cannot move forward. This is a definite fact in modern world politics. The same is true for seeking world prosperity. Then, Mr. Guo asked, "Should the world rely on the restoration of free trade between countries in the future? To achieve this goal, can there be no independent China to conduct trade?" Mr. Guo concluded his speech by saying that China is the vanguard of saving world politics and maintaining world economic life, not only now, but also in the future.

### Japan Already Shows Signs of Exhaustion

Ambassador Gu's Talk

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] Chinese Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, said to a reporter from the Associated Press today that Japan already shows signs of exhaustion, while the activities of Chinese guerrillas behind the Japanese lines are quite active. At the same time, 200 new divisions are being trained to prepare for a counteroffensive. When asked what China thought of Japan's actions near Hong Kong, Gu replied that the war situation should be viewed as a whole. Japan has been at war for eighteen months, and its goals are even more distant. The war-weariness of the Japanese army is growing stronger, while the Chinese army is becoming stronger the more it fights. Since November of last year, the Japanese army has stopped large-scale battles. All Chinese lines are tending to be solid, and at the same time, the Chinese army has recovered several strongholds. The guerrillas in Shanxi have penetrated deep behind the Japanese lines and recovered many lost cities. Several strongholds on both sides of the Yangtze River have also been recovered. The Japanese army's transportation lines have been destroyed by the Chinese army in many places, so Japan has changed to a passive position. At present, the Japanese army shows signs of weakness, and it is clear that its morale is also declining. Our belief in China's final victory is even more firm. From the perspective of military diplomacy, countries have understood Japan's attempt to control Guaya, and they have begun to act on the danger to world peace, which is especially gratifying. According to Chinese military experts, as a result of the activities of the guerrillas, the Japanese army suffers 20,000 casualties every month. Taking Hebei province as an example, there are two or three million Chinese guerrillas along the railway, and their military equipment is very sufficient.

### American Famous Reporter Urges Democratic Nations to Unite, Suggests Organizing a Joint Government to Solve World Problems

[Reuters, New York, 23rd] American renowned foreign correspondent Streeter's new book, "Now Is the Time to Unite," recently published here, has aroused significant attention among Americans. The book, soon to be published in the United States, suggests that to solve world problems, democratic nations should organize a joint government to handle all diplomatic affairs, while domestic affairs should still be handled by each nation's government. The author has spent twenty years exploring the principle of "civilization facing the danger of regression" and its solutions. This book is the culmination of this exploration. The book raises a question: would we rather risk peace or risk freedom? The author concludes that only through the rapid unity of democratic nations can peace and happiness be achieved. He points out that democratic nations have often succeeded in this kind of attempt. For example, after the United States invented this system of unity in 1787, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and British South Africans followed suit and succeeded. The author suggests that if the world's fifteen democratic nations, namely the United States, Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, South Africa, and New Zealand, could form a union, their power would be immense, and it is believed that no country or group would dare attack them. This union would have common citizenship, defense, customs, currency, and transportation systems, but it must guarantee that each democratic nation handles its domestic affairs according to its inherent customs. Other countries are not allowed to join. Democratic nations joining would retain their original republican or monarchical systems. The author claims that such a large country would control more than 68% of the world's necessities for war. Although this combined country would reduce armaments, it would still be stronger than the aggressor nations combined, freeing citizens from countless unnecessary taxes, tariffs, and military burdens.

### Serious Situation Between Soviet Union and Japan, Fishing Rights Negotiations Still Without Progress

[Reuters, Helsingor, 22nd] Today, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo negotiated for two hours regarding the fishing dispute between the two countries, without any progress. After receiving a directive from the Japanese government, Togo declared that the Japanese government has decided to use any means necessary to protect its fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters. According to Japanese sources, Litvinov stated that if Japan uses naval force to enforce its fishing rights, as reported in the Japanese press, it will inevitably lead to major disputes and serious consequences not limited to local areas. Togo also informed Litvinov that Japan would not participate in the fishing rights bidding to be held on March 15.

### US Military Expansion Plan Transferred to Senate Army Committee, Secretary of War Requests Unlimited Aircraft Production, US Fleet Exercise Scope Expanded

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The military expansion bill, after being passed by the House of Representatives yesterday with a vote of 367 to 15, has been transferred to the Senate Army Committee for review. The committee has recently completed the review of the air force portion of the bill and unanimously passed an amendment advocating increasing the air force military expenditure (including the cost of strengthening air defense in the Panama Canal Zone) from $300 million to $358 million, and increasing the number of aircraft to be built from 3,032 to 2,532. In essence, it aims to increase the total number of US Air Force aircraft to 6,000.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] US Secretary of War Woodring today requested the Senate Military Committee to remove the current limit of 6,000 aircraft in the national defense budget. Woodring wrote to the committee stating that due to mass production, the cost per aircraft can be reduced, so more aircraft can be purchased. If the restriction in the budget can be removed, it will greatly benefit national defense. The committee met and passed the national defense budget of $358 million, but did not agree to remove the limit of 6,000 aircraft.

[Haitong News Agency, New York, 23rd] According to the naval adjutant on President Roosevelt's cruiser "Houston," the current US fleet exercise will proceed to the central part of the exercise area, in the Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal defense line.

Small Commentary

### Utilizing Civilian Armed Forces

The War of Resistance Against Japan is a war for the entire Chinese nation to seek survival, freedom, and happiness. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize all the forces of the entire nation, and every Chinese son and daughter must contribute their mind, body, and wealth. The necessity of utilizing civilian strength is, of course, beyond question. However, in the past, the government authorities either failed to deeply understand its true meaning or failed to adopt appropriate methods for utilizing civilian armed forces. At the same time, the people's understanding of resistance was not sufficient. There were misunderstandings about the government's utilization of civilian armed forces, and traitors and collaborators took the opportunity to spread rumors and sow discord. Therefore, during the twenty months of heroic resistance, there were still some local civilian armed forces that failed to fully serve the war of resistance, and even unfortunate incidents that hindered the war of resistance occurred.

Today, this newspaper publishes a special dispatch from Chongqing stating that the highest authorities have ordered attention to be paid to utilizing civilian armed forces to assist the government in increasing the strength of the war of resistance. It is presumed that there is already an overall plan for this. We would like to offer a humble suggestion: First, to utilize civilian armed forces, it is first necessary to carry out extensive publicity work, explaining the meaning of the war of resistance and the government's true intentions for utilizing civilian armed forces to the people. On the one hand, enhance their national self-esteem and determination to participate in the war. On the other hand, dispel the rumors spread by traitors and collaborators that the government is forcibly conscripting civilian armed forces.

Second, the utilization of civilian armed forces must regularly, universally, and deeply conduct political work within the civilian armed forces. Negatively, it is necessary to overcome feudal traditional thinking, their conservative, stubborn, selfish, and self-serving mentality, and all liberal, heroic, and impulsive tendencies. Positively, it is necessary to promote their democratic, revolutionary, and fighting-to-the-end spirit, so that they become a revolutionary force that completely belongs to the revolutionary masses themselves, fighting for the freedom and happiness of the nation and the people.

Third, the utilization of civilian armed forces must simultaneously promote the implementation of the Three Principles of the People and the implementation of necessary democratic improvements. On the one hand, it is necessary to eliminate all feudal forces and corrupt elements that oppress the common people. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop all steps that are suitable for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Program and the development of economic construction and improvement of the people's lives as resolved by the Fifth Plenary Session and the Third Political Participation Council.

### The Japanese Don't Know the Taste of Meat

According to an Associated Press report from Tokyo on the 22nd: The Japanese people are now tightening their belts to maintain the Sino-Japanese War. Reducing the variety of dishes when dining and extending the wearing period of old clothes are the main methods for the Japanese people to accumulate money and debts. The content of the women's "standard meal" is only rice, soy milk, white radish, carrot, dried beans, salt, vegetable oil, and salted fish. We should have two understandings of this news. The first is to recognize that our heroic resistance war for twenty months has broken the Japanese invaders' boasting of conquering China in the past few months and years, and has had to force its citizens to tighten their belts to support a long-term war. The second is to recognize that the Japanese invaders' past declaration to their citizens that "attacking China is to strive for a happy life for the Japanese people" is completely a deception to squeeze the people's blood to maintain the war. But look at what the Japanese people have gained from the occupation of our four northeastern provinces for more than seven years? The occupation of North China and our major cities in the southeast and all the towns of fish, rice, silk, and tea has also been more than a year, and the Japanese people have not only failed to see a little happiness, but have even reached a life where they do not know the taste of meat and cannot make a living!

We see the Japanese people under the oppression of military fascist power politics, tightening their belts and dedicating their blood and sweat to support the war that seeks the interests of a very small number of rulers. We have infinite sympathy and pity for them, and hope that they will quickly realize, under the leadership of their domestic revolutionary parties and progressive justice figures, to actively fight for the liberation of the Japanese nation. But when we look back at our country and those compatriots around us who live excellent lives, and look back at their kind of drunken life, wasting money and indulging in licentious and shameless lives, how infuriating and disgusting it is! The invaders are stepping up the search for national power to destroy our entire nation, while our compatriots who evade national laws only know how to enjoy themselves, and should be subject to public opinion sanctions! Of course, I hope that everyone can examine themselves and strive to be good!

### New Dawn in the International Situation

— (Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in London) Uncle Di

In his speech at this year's National Socialist Party Congress, Hitler proved, to a greater or lesser extent, with a more moderate number of words than anyone expected, that in the face of the inevitable united front of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States, Germany would not risk provoking this suicidal war that is bound to fail. Following this path, if Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States can further consolidate their front, then it is indeed very possible to use peaceful means to sanction aggression and to impeach violence with overwhelming superiority in strength and resources.

In the days before Hitler's speech was delivered, the atmosphere in Europe was so tense that it was almost impossible to breathe. At this time, all the British and French intelligence networks were mobilized, and after great efforts, they could not get any clues as to what Hitler was going to say. Everyone knew that Italy's opinions had already been sent to Hitler in advance, and it was also rumored that in this speech, he would issue a challenge to Britain and France. However, a past precedent overturned everyone's predictions. For the next major speech, Hitler often changed his original words completely within a few hours beforehand. At this time, the British authorities were the most anxious. Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham was arranged in advance to coincide with the two days before Hitler's speech. At this time, most of the British authorities advocated that in this speech, Britain's attitude should be strongly expressed, and a warning should be issued to the aggressor countries. Their argument was based on the fact that Germany currently does not want to risk fighting a war at all. Therefore, in order to prevent her from taking out the old trick of intimidation again, Britain should take the lead and declare itself. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain's opinion was that doing so was too risky. For the sake of Britain, it is better to be cautious. As a result of the debate, two general conclusions were reached: 1. On the issue of armaments, Britain should no longer show weakness, and should clearly demonstrate its strength. 2. Britain is still prepared to negotiate with Germany and Italy's "wishes" anytime, anywhere. These two points were later incorporated into Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham.

After Chamberlain's speech was delivered, until Hitler's speech was delivered, in those two major days, we in Britain still heard some opinions from the "die-hard" people. That was: Prime Minister Chamberlain's doing this was "only to annoy Hitler" and issue a more intense challenge. "Humph, you wait and see!"

But look, Hitler's speech was delivered. The more moderate tone proved the correctness of the opinions of those who advocated a tough stance. However, although the atmosphere has temporarily eased, the fact is that this speech has not solved the problem. The large army that Germany has mobilized for several months has not yet been demobilized; and none of the other thorny issues that constitute the European crisis have been resolved.

Although the actual situation is still very dangerous, looking at the general trend, we can indeed see a ray of dawn. Following this path of development, under four conditions: 1. The "isolationist" people in the United States can talk less nonsense and let President Wisford wield his skills as a world statesman; 2. The British Chamberlain cabinet can abandon its so-called "Four-Power Pact" line; (This point has shown obvious signs in recent months, and is the main reason for the current easing of the atmosphere; to put it more clearly here, do not revive that illusion again.) 3. The French faction, actually headed by Foreign Minister Bonnet, which completely relies on British diplomacy, can lose power, and be replaced by independent diplomacy that insists on French national interests; 4. The Soviet Union's purge of the military can be completely stopped, or at least stopped for a considerable period, (Recently, it has been heard that the Soviet authorities have clearly announced that they have stopped this measure that weakens their internal affairs.) then, the prospects for world peace are very optimistic. Based on this, these four countries should, on the one hand, step up their own arms expansion; on the other hand, in the two ongoing wars, the Sino-Japanese War and the Spanish Civil War, adhere to the standpoint of international justice and treaties, and deny any so-called "fait accompli" created by violence; at the same time, step up large-scale assistance to China and the Spanish government forces. Then, perhaps a year later, we may be able to see a new League of Nations, a new collective security system, appear in the world again.

Of course, what is described above is conceived from the most optimistic future; but this future is very possible. What worries me is that we are not yet confident in guaranteeing the full realization of these hypothetical conditions. Recalling the situation before the Munich Conference last year, it seems that we should temporarily restrain our optimism. At that time, we knew that when the British Navy had already mobilized; US Secretary of State Hull had notified Britain that in the event of war, the US Far East Navy would decide to cooperate with Britain to deal with Japan; Soviet Russia formally notified Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia that they were preparing for war, and at the same time, with the cooperation of Litvinov and French representative Pongou, the League of Nations passed sanctions against the aggressor country Japan on the issue of the Sino-Japanese War; the French army had been fully mobilized, and the whole country was preparing for war. At that time, although the international situation was extremely tense, Germany's flaws had already been exposed, and as a result, a large number of officers headed by Chief of Staff Beck resigned; Italy's attitude also suddenly became ambiguous. In that way, if Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States continued to insist, it would be very questionable whether Germany and Italy would dare to provoke a war. But no one expected that Chamberlain, the Prime Minister of Britain, would suddenly create a Munich Conference. (To be continued)

### × Plane Bombing of the New Territories Incident: Britain Asks Japan for Compensation; Strange Aircraft Groups Suddenly Appear in Kowloon Airspace Late at Night

[Reuters, London, 23rd] According to the diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail," British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, will lodge a second strong protest with Japan regarding the Hong Kong bombing incident. This protest will be officially raised by the British government. The correspondent stated, "If the Japanese side does not automatically express compensation for everything, the British government will make ×× demands."

[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] Regarding the bombing by Japanese aircraft near Shenzhen village in Guangdong Province, China, well-informed sources here recently declared that reports received in London have proven that the responsibility for this case lies entirely with the Japanese side. Therefore, the government will instruct British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to demand compensation from Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in order to achieve this goal.

Haitong News Agency, London, 23rd. It is announced here that British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, received instructions from political figures today to protest again to the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the Japanese aircraft bombing of the New Territories in Hong Kong. It is heard that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita only apologized to the British ambassador for the first protest, acknowledging the mistake. Furthermore, the British ambassador requested compensation for losses, and it is heard that the Japanese side has agreed to the request.

(Local News) Since the × planes suddenly wreaked havoc in Lo Wu, New Territories, on the 21st, the casualties among local residents have been quite numerous. The British authorities are paying close attention to this matter. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, was immediately ordered to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese diplomatic authorities. It is now heard that Sir Robert Craigie will once again represent Britain in lodging a protest with the Japanese side. The content of the protest will ×× demand that the Japanese side automatically compensate for deaths, injuries, and all losses. Judging from the general situation, the British side's attitude towards this incident is extremely strong and resolute. As for the Japanese side, Foreign Minister Arita expressed his sincere apologies to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, yesterday afternoon. He also guaranteed in writing that measures would be taken in the future to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, and stated that the issue of compensation for deaths and injuries would be negotiated in Hong Kong by representatives from both sides, and that the Japanese government would do its best to facilitate an early resolution.

× Consul Pays a Visit to the Colonial Secretary, Makes No Mention of Compensation

It is learned that × Acting Consul General in Hong Kong, Oda, also visited the Colonial Secretary's office at 10 o'clock yesterday morning to meet Colonial Secretary Smith, saying that he was ordered by his superiors in Tokyo to apologize to Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote for the × plane bombing of the Lo Wu incident. It is heard that the × Consul had personally visited the bombed and machine-gunned areas and reported his findings to Tokyo. However, it is quite surprising that the × Consul did not mention the issue of compensation for losses during yesterday's apology. It is heard that although the × Consul formally apologized to the Hong Kong government yesterday, it was merely an example of diplomatic etiquette, and the authorities did not attach much importance to it. This incident is too serious, and a resolution cannot be reached through local negotiations. The responsibility for negotiating a resolution has been taken over by the British diplomatic authorities, who are directly negotiating with the Japanese authorities in Tokyo.

Troops Stationed in the New Territories Ordered to Deploy Defenses Closely

Since the bombing incident in the New Territories, the Hong Kong military authorities have been paying close attention to border defense. The troops of the Scottish regiment stationed along the border have received multiple instructions, and other precautionary measures have also been prepared. As for the police force in the border area, according to Police Commissioner Henry Evington's statement to Western reporters, the number of police officers in the border area has not increased since the incident. However, due to the large influx of refugees from the Chinese side into the New Territories, it has been necessary to send more police officers to the Fanling and Kam Tin areas in order to respond as needed. It is estimated that 12 people died and 9 were injured in the New Territories bombing.

Eight Mysterious Strange Aircraft Fly Over Kowloon Late at Night

Furthermore, yesterday afternoon, various Western newspapers in Hong Kong published news of strange aircraft appearing over Kowloon. According to the "Hong Kong Daily Press," between 3:00 and 4:00 yesterday morning (the 22nd), at least eight strange aircraft flew over Kowloon. None of the aircraft had navigation lights at night. For a time, the sound of the engines rumbled, and residents of Kowloon Tong and Prince Edward Road were mostly awakened from their dreams. However, they all assumed that it was either a Eurasia aircraft arriving or taking off, so they were not surprised. However, the person in charge of Kai Tak Airport stated that no aircraft took off or landed at the airport that morning. The aircraft carrier HMS Eagle was also docked at the naval dockyard at the time. The highest authority of the Hong Kong Air Force refused to make a definite or negative statement regarding the rumors of strange aircraft appearing. The "South China Morning Post" reported that although the police station and other related parties denied the matter, residents of Kowloon did indeed hear the sound of strange aircraft and witnessed them flying over Hong Kong airspace. The group of strange aircraft flew over Victoria Peak and disappeared in an instant. Shortly after the New Territories bombing incident, there were rumors of strange aircraft flying over Hong Kong airspace. The authorities × vigorously denied it, but eyewitnesses spoke with certainty. ×××××××××××××××××××××××

Four Thousand Shenzhen Refugees All Flee into British Territory

After the × planes attacked Shenzhen, another × plane was spotted over Shenzhen at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 22nd), flying very high and circling for reconnaissance. However, it did not drop any bombs. The small number of residents remaining in Shenzhen were still in shock. After scattering and fleeing, the × plane flew away, and they returned to the market town. Fearing another attack by × planes, they mostly gathered their belongings and fled into British territory. Currently, there are very few residents in Shenzhen, and the number of refugees in the New Territories is increasing daily. The number of refugees in Fanling and Kam Tin is approximately between three and four thousand, which is a significant increase compared to before.

Furthermore, according to Hong Kong's Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke, the Fanling North and South Refugee Camps were reopened that afternoon. The refugees previously housed in the Shenzhen refugee tents were relocated to the aforementioned two camps, which now house a total of 2,567 refugees. Approval has been granted by the Hong Kong government to build a fourth camp on Man Kam To Road in order to accommodate approximately 2,000 nearby homeless refugees. The camp is currently under construction.

### Air Defense Authorities to Hold Large-Scale Air Defense Drills; Seven New-Type Alarm Machines Have Been Delivered

In order to familiarize residents with passive air defense methods, the Hong Kong air defense authorities have held several air defense drills. Recently, seven new-type alarm devices purchased from Britain have been delivered to Hong Kong and will soon be installed in designated buildings in Hong Kong for testing. Once the tests are completed, a large-scale blackout drill will be held on a scheduled date, which will be announced soon. This type of alarm device is similar to the ones currently installed in the London city area. After rigorous testing, it will be put into use. Yesterday afternoon, according to Hong Kong's Air Raid Precautions Officer, Mr. S.B.B. Tyers, an additional six of these alarm devices have been ordered from London.

### Deep Night Bloodshed on Nam Cheong Street, Sham Shui Po: Street Vendor Stabbed and Seriously Injured

Subsequently, police officers arrived at the scene after hearing the shouts and immediately reported the case back to Sham Shui Po Police Station. Upon receiving the report, the Assistant Superintendent dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate in order to arrest the culprit. He also immediately dispatched an ambulance to the scene to transport the injured person to Kowloon Hospital for treatment.

### Before and After the "New Year" (2)

— Qi Zhuo

On one hand, decadence; on the other hand, solemnity!

Playing mahjong, watching movies, going to teahouses

Hong Kong was originally a mahjong world; "playing mahjong during the New Year" is even more extreme. Some do it for leisurely entertainment, some to kill boredom, and even more hope to make a fortune. Although the motives may be vulgar or refined, they are all equally dazed by the tiles, hoping to strike it rich. No matter where you go, the sound of mahjong is tightly surrounding your eardrums, and the shadows of mahjong are constantly appearing before your eyes.

Watching movies in Hong Kong has also reached its peak in recent days. No matter which theater, there are performances inside and a large crowd waiting in line outside. Signs saying "Sold Out, Please Come Early Tomorrow" and "Concessions Temporarily Not Valid" are hung high. If you want to see a movie, you have no chance unless you book one or two days in advance. Unfortunately, these films are either purely capitalist entertainment or feudal remnants of poison. Good films that subtly impart education are not non-existent, but they are rare gems.

The business of teahouses is also at its peak, with nothing more to add. Those that remain open during the "New Year's Day" are crowded due to the excess of demand over supply. After the reopening of all businesses on the fourth day, it is a good place for the vast number of customers to "spend money" and "enjoy" themselves. No matter which teahouse, it has been crowded these past few days with no empty seats.

Playing mahjong, watching movies, going to teahouses. These are all peak, unparalleled bustling phenomena. Compared to the War of Resistance against Japan in the motherland, it's like two different worlds. Shouldn't people be so crazy? I sincerely hope that overseas Chinese will reflect on it!

Three Major Events in the Cultural Scene

During the "New Year," there are three major events in the Hong Kong cultural scene that are worth noting. The first is that all newspapers have, as usual, suspended publication for seven days. This is not only a major disappointment for readers, but also most newspaper authorities express their deepest apologies! Although publication is suspended, the "Hong Kong Press Joint Publication" organized by this newspaper continues to work hard to report, fulfilling the duties of a newspaper. Daily sales are between 30,000 and 40,000 copies. However, the space is limited and still unable to meet all expectations. In addition, all kinds of tabloids have also emerged in response. The precedent of "suspending publication during the New Year" needs to be re-evaluated.

The first major event in the cultural scene is the symposium of principals of all secondary schools in Hong Kong. The Third National Education Conference will be held in Chongqing on February 1. The Hong Kong education sector has been summoned to attend, including the presidents of Lingnan University, Guangzhou University, and National University. Before departing, in order to gather the opinions of the Hong Kong education sector on education to provide the Central Education Department for adoption, the three presidents held a symposium of principals of all secondary schools in Hong Kong at the Swiss Hotel at 6:00 p.m. on the 16th of this month. More than 30 principals of registered secondary schools attended. Everyone shared the difficulties of running schools in Hong Kong and discussed a number of proposals, which were handed over to Principal Chan Ping-kuen to take to Chongqing. The results were very good. It is sincerely hoped that in the new life of the motherland, the overseas Chinese education in Hong Kong will also have a new transformation.

The third major event in the cultural scene is the large supply of cultural nourishment. Shops are usually closed during the "New Year" holidays. The only exception that supplies "spiritual food" is the Life Bookstore. The store held a 50% off sale for three consecutive days starting from "New Year's Day," which greatly reduced the burden on readers. Amidst the sounds of firecrackers and mahjong, a group of knowledge-hungry young men and women were moving around in the Life Bookstore. The store's daily income was over 500 yuan, almost three times the usual retail income. Until the last day, the third day of the New Year, it was extremely crowded!

The theaters are crowded, and the Life Bookstore is also crowded. The same crowding gives us two different feelings!

A Praiseworthy and Commendable Aspect

Although traditional customs and habits are firmly rooted in the lifestyle of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, with the advancement of the times and the stimulation of the sound of the War of Resistance against Japan, there are many progressive phenomena in this year's "New Year" in Hong Kong, which are worth praising.

The enthusiastic and crowded scene of the National Goods Exhibition is not only a decoration for the bustling scene of the "New Year" but also illustrates the progress of domestic manufacturers' products and the deep interest of overseas Chinese in domestic goods.

The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce's frugality campaign during the New Year's Eve market has been quite effective. For example, the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce posted notices at the doors of various businesses saying, "Stop paying New Year's visits during the national crisis." The burning of firecrackers has also decreased by half compared to previous years, which is a remarkable achievement.

Group travel to replace improper entertainment is promoted by organizations such as the Press Association and the Amateur Association. The Charity Association and the Children's Welfare Institute launched a movement for children to donate "lucky money," which has been very active in recent days, with a great impact and significant results.

In addition, the Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association and the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association are also actively promoting frugality and donations. It is heard that there will be good concrete reports in the coming days.

During the "New Year" in Hong Kong, although one side is decadent and shameless, the other side is working solemnly.

### Expansion of the Hainan War: Traffic Between Hong Kong and Hainan Cut Off; Foreign Ships Stop Sailing to Haikou and Cargo Transportation Halts; Shortage of Live Pigs Leads to Soaring Market Prices

Since × invaded Hainan Island, Hong Kong has been greatly affected. In recent days, the war on Hainan Island has continued to expand, and commercial ships of various countries traveling on the Hainan Island route have completely stopped sailing to Haikou. Traffic and cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Qiongya (Hainan Island) have therefore been completely cut off. Hong Kong's shipping industry has been severely hit, and live pigs, which occupy an important position in residents' food, have also increased in price due to this impact.

Ships Suspended, Traffic Cut Off

According to reporters' investigations, the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies and small-scale "wild chicken" boats that previously sailed to or passed through Haikou from Hong Kong have recently received orders from their respective company authorities. When ships sailing from Hong Kong and Singapore pass through Haikou, it has not been decided whether to berth as usual before sailing. According to the crew members of the Xinjiang and Dabao ship that recently arrived in Hong Kong via Haikou, the ships sailed through Hainan Island on the 10th of this month and initially berthed. Later, the shipowner saw that the island was filled with continuous artillery fire, × warships were everywhere at sea, and × planes were constantly circling in the sky. A large fire was burning near Haikou. The sound of gunfire reverberated in the distance. Knowing that the situation was tense, in order to avoid danger, they immediately changed course, bypassed the dangerous area, and sailed directly to Hong Kong. They heard the sound of explosions for about two hours after leaving Hainan Island. Therefore, the situation on Hainan Island is unknown. At this point, traffic between Hong Kong and Hainan has been completely cut off, and cargo transportation has also stopped accordingly.

Cargo Transportation Halts, Live Pig Prices Rise

The goods that Hong Kong needs to rely on Hainan for are mainly live pigs, with a small amount of sugar. Now that cargo transportation has stopped, Hong Kong's food supply has been greatly affected. Regarding live pigs, reporters learned from people in the pig industry that Hong Kong currently needs about 1,400 live pigs per day. In the past, most of them were supplied by Hainan. Before the outbreak of the war in Hainan, the market price of live pigs in Hong Kong was about 20 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). After the war broke out, it increased daily, and now it has risen to 33 yuan per dan, a difference of almost double. Hong Kong pig meat merchants have sent personnel to Guangzhou Bay to negotiate an increase in supply to meet the needs of the Hong Kong market. However, it is difficult for the market to return to normal before the source becomes sufficient. The Hong Kong residents' food prices are a problem. In addition, Hainan's local medicinal materials also had a considerable sales market in Hong Kong in the past. Now that the source has been cut off, the Hong Kong medicinal materials market will also be affected.

This year's Hong Kong Jockey Club's one-dollar horse race tickets have sold over 443,000 as of yesterday afternoon. According to the Jockey Club's payout method, the first prize is expected to be about 170,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, the reporter went to the exchange and saw that the number of Chinese and Western men and women going to Lane Crawford to buy lottery tickets was extremely crowded. It is believed that sales will easily exceed 500,000 tickets after the last two days of sales. If so, the first prize will reach over 200,000 yuan. I wonder who will be the lucky one to own this huge sum.

It is expected that classes will begin in September this year. The number of students is tentatively set at 50. The qualifications for applicants for the special normal class will be limited to current Chinese teachers of Chinese and English schools, with Chinese and English schools each accounting for half.

### × Invasion of South China Affects Hong Kong's Foreign Trade Plunges in January; Total Imports Down More Than 20 Million Yuan From Last Year; Goods Exported to South China Decreased by More Than 8 Million Yuan

Hong Kong's commerce relies heavily on the Chinese market. Since × people invaded Guangzhou and harassed the coast, causing obstacles to maritime traffic and the people of South China moved and their purchasing power was weakened, Hong Kong's imports and exports have suffered a serious blow. The official foreign trade statistics for January 1939 have been released. The total value of imports was 40,070,000 yuan, which is a huge difference compared to the total value of 61,700,000 yuan in January 1938. On the export side, due to the crowding of inventory last year, merchants tried to promote the total value, which slightly increased, totaling 40,020,000 yuan, while the same period last year was 39,400,000 yuan. As for the trade between here and South China, the export value last month was 2.3 million yuan, while the same period last year reached 10.5 million. Imports also decreased to 4.95 million, a decrease of 60% compared to the same period in 1938. Recently, Haikou and Beihai were ravaged by × people, and the trade volume will inevitably decrease further. Under these circumstances, Hong Kong's trade with the UK is one of the lowest among the 44 jurisdictions, with exports accounting for only 4.5% and imports accounting for 7.6%. According to related parties, the business in Hong Kong this year will decline to the level of three years ago, and the situation may become even more bleak, unless the situation in the Far East improves.

### Dongjiang [River] Bandit-Generals Expand Harassment; Our Army Actively Strengthens Defenses; Wu Qiwai Dispatches Troops to Increase Defenses in Dongguan and Shi'an; Guerrilla Forces in Various Counties Actively Expand and Reorganize

[Dongjiang Quick Dispatch] The Southern Battlefield bandit forces are weak in strength and most have now been transferred to Hainan Island for operations. Therefore, in recent weeks, the bandit military strength at various points and lines along the East, West, and North Rivers of Guangdong is weak. Moreover, because our major armies are gathered along various rivers and have overwhelming strength, they know it is difficult to advance. Therefore, the bandits recently planned to change their trickery, attempting to expand harassment operations in the Dongjiang [River] to shake our entire counter-offensive plan. Therefore, the Dongjiang situation has become tense. The various situations obtained through visits are noted below:

Bandits Plot to Expand Harassment Operations

According to military intelligence, the bandit army now wants to take advantage of the fact that our eastern route troops are still adjusting their deployments. They have specifically planned to expand military operations in the Dongjiang River at this time. In recent days, bandit troops have been transferred from various locations, including Sanshui, Huaxian, Conghua, and Nanhai, to reinforce various points in the Dongjiang River. Therefore, in the past week, bandit troops have suddenly increased at Zengcheng, Shilong, Humen, and Taiping. According to intelligence reports, there are approximately 2,000 bandits in the Humen and Taiping areas, over a thousand in Dongguan City, and about 3,000 in the Zengcheng and Shitan areas. Bandit troops in each stronghold are equipped with cavalry, artillery, and tank units. The bandits are also forcibly conscripting our people to transport military supplies and are forcing various villages to contribute grain. They are instigating traitors to scout out the strength of our main team's defenses. Looking at the bandits in the Dongjiang River overall, they certainly have a tendency to make trouble.

We Dispatch Troops to Open Dongbao [Area] and Increase Defenses

After investigating the increase in bandit troops in the Dongjiang River, the areas of Dalang, Nanshe, Fuzhangmutou in Dongguan, and Huangsonggang, Nantou, and Xixiang in Bao'an are all being harassed by bandit troops. Dozens of nearby villages have been burned and looted by bandit troops, and the disaster situation is terrible. It is found that Wu Qiwai, Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Group Army and Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route, in order to strengthen the military strength of Dongguan and Bao'an counties, to block bandit troops from coming out to harass [us], and to smash their plot to expand harassment, specially dispatched a certain unit yesterday to open Dongbao [Area] and increase defenses, and to cooperate with local guerrilla forces to annihilate the bandit guards. Also, it is found that the Eastern Route Headquarters is now located in Longchuan. In order to facilitate commanding various troops and guerrilla forces in combat, it was decided to establish an Eastern Route Forward Command Post at a certain location on the front line, and preparations are currently underway.

Guerrilla Forces in Various Places Expand and Reorganize

In addition, it is found that in the past ten days, the guerrilla forces in various counties of the Dongjiang River have been awaiting orders for new reorganization, so their activity capacity has inevitably been slightly affected. Therefore, bandit troops have been able to take advantage of the situation to make trouble. It is found that Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, believes that the bandit troops have repeatedly harassed various places in the Dongjiang River and that urgent defense should be carried out to give the bandits a head-on blow. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed Wang Ruozhou, Commander of the Dongbao District Guerrilla Column, and Luo Fengxiang, Commander of the Huibo District Column, to quickly reorganize their subordinate guerrilla teams in accordance with the new regulations to strengthen the anti-bandit forces. Commander Wang Ruozhou received the order and yesterday sent personnel to separately count and incorporate the original Japanese teams in Dongbao, and issued them equipment, ammunition, and military pay, and appointed Deng Tan as the Chief of Staff. At the same time, the headquarters was quickly prepared. Commander Luo Fengxiang has also reorganized the Liang Zhu, Luo Kun, Zeng Sheng and other units of the Huibo counties guerrilla teams, and after a week, the strength of the Dongjiang guerrilla force will be stronger than before.

### Shaoguan Establishes a Garrison Headquarters; Wang Zuohua Appointed Garrison Commander

[Shaoguan Quick Dispatch] Since the Guangdong authorities made Shaoguan the new provincial capital, most of the party, government, and military agencies have converged and concentrated here. It is recently found that Zhang Fa, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, and Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, in order to strengthen Shaoguan's defenses and anti-traitor forces, specially established the Shaoguan Command Headquarters and appointed Wang Zuohua as the garrison commander. Mr. Wang took office yesterday. [He is] in charge of air defense, military police, and anti-traitor matters.

### South China Bandit [Army] Organizes Guides; Lian Named Team Leader

(Beijiang Quick Dispatch) The invading bandit army of Guangdong often takes advantage of our frustrated military personnel and bored politicians to establish various puppet organizations to implement the trick of using Chinese to control Chinese. It is found that most cold-blooded scum recognize bandits as fathers and are willing to act as tiger accomplices. According to reliable information, the South China bandit army, in order to facilitate its military invasion of our country, recently specially organized a "Guide Team" and sought out traitors and local bullies from various counties and cities to serve as guides for the bandit army's harassment work. Yesterday, Lian was appointed as the team leader and dispatched a group of team members to infiltrate our inland areas to scout the troop defense strength. The Fourth War Zone Command Headquarters has reportedly issued orders to its subordinates yesterday to implement strict defenses.

### The Lu Feng Uprising Under the Auspices of the Bandits and Its Suppression

— Bai Wei

The Lufeng uprising can be regarded as one of the major events in the Dongjiang region recently. However, due to traffic congestion, we still do not know the details. Fortunately, yesterday the Lufeng County Government sent a representative, Ye Xiu-Zhi, to Hui to report to the Dongjiang Special Operations Headquarters. The reporter learned the whole picture of the uprising and the process of its elimination during the interview.

Although the bandit’s invasion of South China has suffered continuous military blows, they still have not given up their dangerous ambitions. However, because of the weakness of their military strength, except for the Northwest and Liangjiang Rivers in important areas, the others have mostly changed their military actions and adopted political methods, instigating traitors and puppets, lurking and harassing, and implementing the vicious "using Chinese to control Chinese" method. The Lufeng uprising is a prominent example.

Lufeng borders Haifeng and Jieyang counties, and is a coastal county in the Dongjiang region. It is located in the middle of the coastline of eastern Guangdong. Occupying Lufeng can control the outer garden operations of Huizhou, Chaozhou and Meizhou, and its situation is quite important. In particular, the navy can use it as a base for disrupting the coastal areas. In this way, it was coveted by the bandits. However, this time, the bandit’s greedy mouth has become a bloody mouth.

As early as the end of December last year, the bandits sent a henchman, Liu Wufang, along with several special agents to Lufeng to carry out activities. They used the name of the Central-sent Civil Affairs Work Team, paid visits to local authorities, and then set off to various districts, ostensibly to inspect, but secretly to instigate the villagers and recruit followers. However, the shameless activities and conspiracies of these traitors have gradually been seen through by the local authorities. Ou Rujun, the magistrate of Lufeng County, immediately secretly sent personnel to investigate.

In the middle of January, the news that the bandits were landing in Shantou became tighter, and Liu's activities became more intense. He set up a secret agency in Jiazizhen, a coastal area of Lufeng. All the supplies of guns, ammunition and funds were transferred by the bandit ships to fishing boats and transported in from the sea. At that time, the Lufeng County Government was implementing the law of banning opium, preparing to eradicate the opium seedlings in Wuyundong Township, Hetian District. Liu took this opportunity to send his party members to incite the villagers of Wuyundong Township to armed resistance, and used 2,000 yuan of national currency to persuade Ye, the captain of the Self-Defense Corps squadron stationed in Daan District, to follow him. It was decided to launch an uprising at the end of the month, attacking the Donghai County government in three routes, killing military and political leaders, and seizing the county government, forming a dangerous conspiracy of a major uprising. Fortunately, Ye was unwilling to sell the nation and his hometown for thousands of dollars, and join the traitors, so he secretly informed Magistrate Ou to take strict precautions.

Sure enough, in the few days of the uprising, many bandit ships had gathered on the sea of Jiazi, and a small team of bandit planes threatened the sky over Lufeng. The entire Lufeng fell into a state of tension. Liu intended to lead the ignorant villagers of Wuyundong to attack the county seat, but was captured halfway by the ambush team of the county government’s technical team and the self-defense corps. The remaining party members knew that the conspiracy had been leaked, and they also fled and scattered. A bandit ugly drama was changed into a comedy of ours, which can be regarded as a new historical material in the history of bandits invading China.

Liu was originally from Dabu County, a graduate of a certain university, a scumbag of the intellectual class. This time, he was assigned by the bandits to work in Lufeng, hoping to receive the reward of the pseudo-county magistrate after success. As a result, he ruined his precious personality and life. When he was arrested and interrogated, he always hesitated and denied it. Later, he was shown the letters of communication with the bandits seized from the post office, and he bowed his head in silence. He was executed on the day he was captured. A few bullets ended his despicable life and washed away a little stain for the nation. At the moment of execution, he kept shaking his head and shedding tears, perhaps repenting in his conscience. Poor traitor!

Due to the quick and secret disposal, the people of Lufeng knew nothing about it beforehand. When the county government announced martial law, and then Liu was executed by shooting, the whole county was shocked like a thunderbolt in a clear sky. Angered by the viciousness and inferiority of the traitors, the people of Lufeng are now automatically engaged in the good-tidying movement, assisting the government in searching for the remnants of Liu’s party, and using the power of all the people to eliminate the appearance of traitors forever and to smash the bandit’s conspiracy of uprising forever. Based on the lessons of Lufeng, their anti-traitor and anti-spy work will be more enthusiastic and thorough.

### The Bandits Attacking Dagan Ridge Were Defeated by Our Valiant Garrison; One Platoon Leader Wounded in This Battle; Forty to Fifty Bandits Killed or Wounded

[Beijiang Quick Dispatch] The Guanghua battle on the North Road has been quite tense in the past week. The Guangzhou bandit army has mostly concentrated in the Huangpu XinZhou area. A large amount of grain and gasoline is stored in Meihuacun. The bandits have repeatedly transferred reinforcements from Guangzhou because our troops in Ren'gang Ridge and other places are strong. The bandit troops stationed in the Shahe to DianyanDong area of Guangzhou belong to the Ikeda unit of the 112th Division of the bandits, about one battalion. In recent days, there seems to be a state of mobilization. There are 65 bandit planes at Tianhe Airport. The bandits in the Huaxian area, Macong, Xinjie, Longkou Longtan, and Zhongluotan areas have no special activity for the time being. As for the Conghua area, our army inflicted heavy damage on the bandits on the morning of the 20th. Therefore, the bandits attacked Dagan Ridge with more than 30 infantrymen from Shengang in the morning. This time, it seemed to be of a exploratory nature. It was attacked and defeated by a part of the Wu regiment of a certain division of our 12th Group Army. After the bandits were defeated, they attacked again at noon with more than 100 infantrymen under the cover of artillery. The firepower was extremely fierce. Our army fought back with blood, and the battle was extremely fierce. The fierce battle continued until night, and the bandits began to shake due to the increasing number of casualties. They collapsed and retreated along the original route. In this battle, our army wounded one platoon leader and several soldiers. Forty to fifty bandits were killed or wounded. After this defeat, the bandit's momentum was frustrated, and they have retreated to the Shengang area to await reinforcements.

### Chaozhou-Meizhou Rice Shortage Becomes Increasingly Serious; Officials and Merchants Request Exemption from Customs Duties on Imported Rice; Supervisor Liu Houwu Telegraphed Zhang and Li to Quickly Plan Relief Measures; Chaozhou-Meizhou Gentry and Merchants Suggested Setting Up a Grain Adjustment Agency

(Shantou Quick Dispatch) Chaozhou and Meizhou have never had enough food for themselves. Every year, the food supply relies on outside sources, accounting for five or six months. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the source of rice production in Central China has been cut off. Imported rice is expensive due to heavy taxes, and rice merchants dare not purchase large quantities. Therefore, Shantou has repeatedly experienced rice shortages, which have become more serious in recent months. In the inland areas, only seven catties can be purchased for every yuan, while in Shantou City, only about five or six catties can be purchased for one yuan. The rice-producing areas are narrow and there are dangerous situations. Sufficient food is the basis for sufficient soldiers. Moreover, Chaozhou and Shantou are located in the vanguard of the Dongjiang national defense, and the food problem should be resolved as soon as possible. Therefore, the Chaozhou and Shantou business circles specially convened a meeting at the beginning of the lunar year to discuss countermeasures for relieving the rice shortage. All believed that in order to solve the food shortage in Chaozhou and Shantou and eliminate the famine, it is necessary to request the government to exempt imported rice from taxes so that imported rice can flow in continuously. In addition, it was found that the total amount of rice shortage in Chaozhou and Meizhou this year is about 2 million dan. It was decided to jointly present reasons from the business community and groups in various counties, as well as the Shantou City Chamber of Commerce, to the Ministry of Finance to approve the exemption of imported rice tax in order to maintain the food supply in Chaozhou and Meizhou. Wu Qi, the mayor of Shantou, also believed that the late rice harvest was not long ago, but Chaozhou and Shantou were experiencing a rice shortage. In the future, during the period when the old and new crops are not yet connected, the food panic will become more serious. Therefore, he recently telegraphed Commander Zhang Fakui and Chairman Li Hanhun to report and request relief measures, and also telegraphed the Chaozhou Pingdi Company in Siam to quickly import the 180,000 Japanese rice quota that the Ministry of Finance had approved tax exemption but had not yet been transported in, in order to save the current famine. In addition, the rice price in Meizhou is also abnormally high, with each 100 catties of white rice rising to 17 yuan and 4 jiao in paper currency. Meizhou produces more rice than Chaozhou. Recently, rice merchants in Chaozhou rushed to purchase from various places in Meizhou. When the amount of rice flowing out was exhausted, they turned to Shantou for transportation. However, the river channels are shallow and dry in winter, making transportation difficult, resulting in high costs and soaring prices, and the poor are suffering endlessly. Tan Baoshou, the administrative inspector of the sixth district, has now ordered various counties to step up the urging of planting miscellaneous roots and advocate eating rice, etc., in order to make up for it as much as possible. At the same time, he also telegraphed the provincial government to suggest comprehensively planning the province's food management plan, designating provincial funds, and establishing rice and grain adjustment agencies in Chaozhou and Meizhou to purchase surplus grain from neighboring provinces for storage and reserve, so that the military and civilian food will not be lacking. Zhang Fakui, Commander (Fakui), Li Hanhun, Chairman (Hanhun), believing that various commissioners, county magistrates, business community groups, etc. in eastern Guangdong have sent letters and telegrams requesting relief from the rice shortage, and Liu Houwu, the central supervisory committee member who had just arrived in Shantou on patrol, had also telegraphed to request a quick solution, in addition to telegraphing the arm to request approval of the exemption of imported rice import tax, and also telegraphed back to Liu Houwu, the committee member, saying, "The great telegram has been read and understood. We also attach great importance to the rice shortage in our Guangdong, and are discussing relief measures in separate ways. We are very grateful for your instructions and have followed your instructions to present to the central government to request exemption of imported rice import tax to slightly relieve the people's difficulties. We will inform you again after we receive a reply. Li Hanhun, Zhang Fakui, bow." It is also found that Liang Hanzhao, the county magistrate of Chaoan County, recently received a telegram order from He Chunfan, the commissioner of the fifth administrative region, saying that the price of grain and rice in Chaozhou is too expensive, and he should convene local merchants and relevant agencies to properly propose relief opinions and reply by telegram. Therefore, the county held a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce at about 2:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month to discuss relief measures, chaired by Liang Hanzhao, the county magistrate. The result of the discussion was that the reason for the high price of rice in Chaozhou is the difficulty in transportation. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance in South China, traffic has been congested, and Wuhu and other places have fallen successively. National rice cannot be transported in, and imported rice is subject to taxation, which increases costs and makes it difficult for people to purchase. The only way to save is to request the immediate cancellation of the imported rice tax, so that the rice price can be reduced and the rice shortage can be leveled. Therefore, these opinions have been presented to the Fifth District Commissioner's Office.

### The Philippines Team Moves to Macau, Today Battles the Australia League, Intention to Fight the Eastern St. Joseph Joint Army After Returning to Hong Kong Cancelled

[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] Although the Philippine football team's visit to Hong Kong for the inter-port competition resulted in three losses due to inferior skills, their high-speed performance and full spirit left a good impression on the Hong Kong side. Their entire team is full of energy, which is a crucial requirement for the strenuous sport of football. Individual skills can be developed through experience, so given time, this reporter dares to assert that the Philippines' football technical level will certainly be equal to that of Hong Kong.

The Philippine team arrived by special boat a few days ago, so they wanted to return by special boat as well. Unfortunately, this required them to leave Hong Kong on the 27th. Therefore, they intended to hold another exhibition match this Saturday, where they would compete against a joint team composed of Eastern and St. Joseph players. However, the Philippine team's trip to Macau was delayed yesterday morning, and they only took a steamer to Macau in the afternoon. The scheduled match against the Macau team yesterday had to be rescheduled for today. They will return to Hong Kong by steamer late tonight from Macau. Therefore, being constantly on the move, it is impossible to avoid fatigue. It has been decided to cancel this exhibition match.

This Sunday, there will be a charity match between South China and the Hong Kong League. To raise more charitable funds, it is impossible to hold another eye-catching match that would affect ticket sales. Therefore, since the Philippine team's exhibition match against the Eastern St. Joseph Joint Army cannot be held on Saturday or Sunday, there is no suitable date. (Eastern Son)

### Basic Training Methods for Shot Put

Regardless of any throwing sport, the maximum application of physics and mechanics is required. To achieve good results, we must conduct scientific research based on these two aspects. In the past, physical educators or athletes have already introduced their experiences in detail. Now, I will just discuss a few points regarding basic training methods that I know.

(1) Method of Increasing Strength
Shot put is very important in mechanics, so the first step is to discuss the method of increasing strength. There are many ways to increase strength, not limited to one. Now, I will briefly list a few examples below:

A. Hanging Exercise on the Horizontal Bar
Every morning or evening, do this once. When doing it, hold the bar with both hands (with a regular grip). Do not allow the body to swing. Gradually pull the body upward as much as possible. Gradually increase the number of repetitions, reaching about 20 repetitions. Over time, you will naturally feel the effect.

B. Push-up Action After Handstand
It is best to do this exercise without relying on other objects. However, it is a difficult task for beginners. But you can first lean against a wall or get help from another person. First, place your hands on the ground, then raise your torso and lower limbs, leaning against the wall or asking someone to hold your feet. Then, gradually bend and extend your arms up and down, gradually increasing the number of repetitions. The more the better. Return to the original position when you feel tired.

C. Use of Equipment or Other Objects and Habituation to Angles
For equipment, elastic devices such as Chest Expanders can be used. Hang it on the wall or other heavy objects, hold the other end with your right hand, and use vigor to make a throwing posture, pushing it out along a 45-degree angle (the direction of the throw). Practice at least once or twice a day. There is also a simple method, which is to use the help of two people. One person in front (A) and one person behind (B). The person in front's left foot is in front and the right foot is behind, making the posture of starting to put the shot. The other person's right foot is in front and left foot is behind, with the right hand and A's fingers and palms bent and interlocked. At this time, it is like adding a heavy ball to A's hand, then instructing A to use force to push it out in the direction of the throw. B uses his own strength to pull back and release. This can cultivate strength and develop correct posture and angle habits.

(2) Coordination of Movements and Posture

Posture can indirectly affect performance, so we must pay attention to it. But the relationship between movement and posture is extremely great. Improper movement will directly affect poor posture. Therefore, for movement, one should first learn it before holding the ball (i.e., the imitation exercise of throwing the ball). But when learning, one should pay attention to the following items (for detailed explanations, please refer to Track and Field New Techniques, pages 78 to 80):

A. Initial Posture
B. Leg Swing and Arm Placement
C. Sliding Footwork
D. Final Posture

(3) Ball Handling Exercises
Ball handling exercises are the last type of basic training. This type of training can both increase strength and obtain correct ball handling, preparing for the shot put. The method is as follows:

A. There are two ways to hold the ball. See Track and Field New Techniques, page 78.
B. After holding the ball correctly, you can perform ball handling exercises - (1) Raise upward - raise upward for counts 1357, return to the side bending position from the upward position for counts 2468, do one to four eight-counts. (2) Push diagonally upward at a 45-degree angle - push out on counts 1357, retract on counts 2468, do one to four eight-counts. This type of exercise can be practiced in the morning or from 4 pm to 5 pm. The more persistent you are, the better, but never force yourself to increase progressively.

The above three basic training items are closely related to the performance of shot put. Those who aspire to this sport and want to achieve good results must use this practice as an introduction.

### Splendid Awards Ceremony at Kwong Wah and Kwong Chung School Sports Day

The Hong Kong Kwong Wah and Kwong Chung Boys' and Girls' High Schools held an awards ceremony for their school sports day and a spring parents' gathering at the Central Theatre yesterday. Attendees included the school principals Guo Henjie, Chen Lanfang, Zhan Bochao, Liu Yuyun, Ye Lanquan, Du Bingzhang, Lu Guomian, Liu Hansheng, guest Zhang Lanzhou, and over two thousand male and female faculty members and students' parents from both schools.

Principal Huang Yanqing delivered an opening speech, stating that the seventh session of the third school sports day of the boys' and girls' high schools was held at the South China Athletic Association stadium on Caroline Hill at the end of last year. The results were more satisfactory than in previous years. More than 700 students participated in the sports events, breaking previous records. This year, they were grateful to Zhan Lesheng Hall for providing prizes and to Mr. Zhan Bochao for personally officiating the ceremony. The male and female students were deeply grateful. In the past six months, in addition to focusing on education, the school has also contributed to the country and society, such as donating medicines and cotton clothing to frontline soldiers and purchasing public bonds. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association jointly presented a flag and monetary donation, and the school was fortunate to win first place, receiving the title of "Best Performance" from the Education Association. For refugee relief efforts, they first went to Muk Wu and Heung Yuen villages in the New Territories, and the second time they went to Shenzhen, donating large amounts of clothing, medicine, and food to the Shenzhen Hospital. They also worked with the Chung Sing Charitable Society to serve refugee areas. The faculty and students of the school dare not be complacent and will work harder in the future, following in the footsteps of enthusiastic patriotic individuals. Subsequently, speeches were given by Chen Lanfang, Ye Lanquan, Liu Yuyun, and Zhang Lanzhou. Zhan Bochao presided over the awards ceremony, encouraging the prize-winning students. Over a hundred pieces of silverware prizes and over two hundred medals were awarded. Finally, Chen Shaotang delivered a vote of thanks on behalf of the school board. After the ceremony, photos were taken, and the entertainment began. Among them, the military exercises performed by the male and female students were the most exciting, and the performance of planting branches and leaves by the Huang family's three sisters, Peizhu, Peixin, and Peiying, also won applause from the entire audience. The atmosphere was the most lively.

### Charity Cup Volleyball Championship Battle, South China University Wins Final Victory, Awards Ceremony Today, Champion Team vs. Select Team Players

The final match for the Hong Kong Chinese Newspaper Reporters Association's Charity Cup Volleyball Tournament was held yesterday at 4:00 pm. By 3:00 pm, the St. Paul's College Stadium was packed. The referees, Tao Shaofu and Chen Xipei, blew their whistles, ordering the start of the battle. The athletes of South China University and Pui Ying immediately engaged in fierce combat. Pui Ying first relied on skilled coordination, with Qiu Guangxie and Chen Yingji attacking left and right, and Huang Chaoqun, Mei Qiusiang, and Chen Zhetang seizing opportunities to advance. South China University was caught off guard and lost the first set 17-21. In the second set, South China University counterattacked. Huang Dingfen's hits landed with flourish, and Xu Heng's spikes were frequently successful, winning back the set 21-16. In the third set, Huang and Xu's spikes remained sharp, and Li Fushen, Ceng Jingquan, and Xiao Dianchu further saved the crisis, winning another set 21-17. In the fourth set, Pui Ying was unwilling to fall behind, and Qiu Guangxie, Li Lianze, Mei Qiusiang, and Huang Yaohua unleashed their prowess, winning 21-13 and creating a 2-2 tie. The fifth set was the key to victory. Both sides proceeded cautiously and step by step, and the battle situation was extremely tense. The scores followed closely, from 1-1 all the way to 17-17, all tied. South China University finally won the final victory with 21-19 due to its composure in battle, winning the championship. To raise more charitable funds, the organizing committee has scheduled an exhibition match between the champion team and a select team at the awards ceremony at 4:00 pm this afternoon, at the St. Paul's College Stadium.

### This Year's Davis Cup, the United States Has Hope of Keeping It, Ample Youth Reserves, Riggs Replaces Budge

The major tennis competitions of 1939 have now been set. Wimbledon will begin on June 26th, six days earlier than last year, but it still has not changed the usual practice of starting on the "third Monday in June." The French Championships will be held on June 8th in Paris, and the German Championships will open on July 14th in Hamburg. The U.S. Championships will still be held on September 7th at Forest Hills. The first week of the Davis Cup will begin in early May, and the final week will end in Philadelphia, USA. Last year, the final week was held at the Germantown Cricket Club, but the battlefield of these many famous players seems to be a bit unsuitable, so the American Davis Cup Committee has decided to borrow the venue from the Philadelphia Cricket Club.

USA

Although the United States has now lost its mainstay Budge, their reserves are very sufficient. California is the most sufficient corner, so we must not hastily predict that the United States will "say goodbye" to the Davis Cup this year. In the middle of last year, Australia climbed to the vicinity of the Davis Cup. If it were not for the young Riggs defeating Quist, Australia would have packed up the big silver cup and transported it back to Australia long ago. Of course, the United States cannot immediately find a suitable Budge replacement to defend the Davis Cup, but she has many useful materials as raw materials for manufacturing Budge's representatives. For example, Riggs, Tibor (he has not been defeated by Riggs), McHugh (the only person in the U.S. Championships who could win a set from Ceki), etc. In addition, there are former American Davis Cup representatives Wood and Shields. They are both only 27 years old, the same age as Tilden when he first won the Wimbledon Championship.

Italy

Italy has also joined the competition this year. In Europe, the Mussolini movement in Italy is now the most magnificent sports collapse in Europe. Their famous player Steffani recently treated his injured foot in London and will soon be able to return to the court. Balloni, Romanoni, and Canabi have all made considerable progress, while Parmili has joined the professional world. The Czech Republic has lost several good players, and its strength is probably not comparable to last year. Denmark has a very good player this year, Jacobsen, who defeated France's strongest Borotra and Pouceus at the Swedish King's Cup competition this year.

Britain

The British Davis Cup team will probably be produced soon. They have quite a few good new and old materials. In the middle of last year, if Auster and Lee were used to play singles and Heath and Butler to play doubles, Germany probably would not have won the European belt championship. If this team can attend this year, there is still hope for the European belt championship. However, their careers and their age will break this dream. So in practice, we need to find another team for training. Butler, Scheeres, Philby, etc., have gained a lot more experience and made considerable progress in their ball skills since returning from the African competition. Johnson's results this year are not bad, and he and Hale will soon go to the West Indies to compete, while Wilder and Bewton will also go to Norway and Sweden next month to compete.

### Post-Match Review of the Volleyball Championship Battle

(Our Newspaper Special Dispatch) During the Spring Festival, there were many events in the ball city. Especially football matches, which were held almost every day. I am a professional football fan, and I have gotten a little tired of watching too much.

Yesterday afternoon, the Charity Cup Volleyball Championship Battle was held at St. Paul's College Stadium. Because I wanted a change of pace, I also joined the group of spectators.

The clock had just struck four, and I had already arrived at my destination. I saw that the stands were full, and there was no place to insert a foot. I finally found a spot that could barely accommodate my feet and stood there for two hours.

With the sound of the whistle, the two armies prepared to fight. The South China University members wore red uniforms, and the Pui Ying generals wore white uniforms. The red and white contrasted with each other, especially clearly.

A fat man, holding a paper-made loudspeaker, shouted and danced, looking quite ridiculous. The South China supporters echoed in unison, encouraging the morale of the army.

The first set of the fierce battle immediately began. Pui Ying first used a strategic of left, right, and middle row attacks, with Li Lianze providing the ball, and the two killers, Qiu and Chen, taking the opportunity to swing and strike, which proved to be effective, taking the lead all the way. The "tall man Xu" and Huang Dingfen from South China University also had many good shots with one spike and one hit. However, Pui Ying was at the peak of its momentum at this time, winning the first set 21-17.

In the second and third sets, South China University tried to block Qiu Guangxie's spikes on the one hand, and on the other hand, Xu Heng used his height advantage to display the special skill of spiking from the middle, which was indeed effective, frequently gaining points. They won two consecutive sets with 21-16 and 21-17.

In the fourth set, Pui Ying still used left and right spikes as the only way to win. Qiu Guangxie was able to fully exert his skills, winning 21-13 quite easily. At this time, the general spectators saw that Pui Ying's momentum was strong, thinking that Pui Ying might win the final victory, but the fact was not so.

The fifth set was the life-and-death juncture for the two armies. The battle situation was not only exciting but also tense. They fought directly to 16-16, and it was still unknown who would have the last laugh at the final moment. However, South China University after all knew how to act according to circumstances, and again implemented spikes from the middle, the situation suddenly took a turn for the better, and finally secured the overall situation with 21-19. According to the statistics, South China University won three to two and won the championship.

In my opinion, Pui Ying's strategy mostly relied on spikes, so the ability to score often focused on the second row. Li Lianze in the front row was solely responsible for providing the ball. Therefore, the skill of spiking from the front net was only occasionally seen.

South China University not only emphasized left and right spikes in the second row but also was good at using the front net for spiking. Xu Heng was tall and strong and took advantage of this. Therefore, the front and middle rows were able to combine spiking, and they won the final victory. Xu Heng should be given first merit.

The front row of South China University was also able to block the net, putting on a good performance. The back row rescue and serving skills were also just right. Pui Ying's net blocking skills seemed to be less assured than those of South China University. However, Li Lianze's left and right ball supply had the style of his elder brother (Li Lianying).

In short, this was a battle where both sides were equally matched. Pui Ying's defeat was because they could only spike but rarely spike down, and South China University's victory was because they could spike as well as spike down. But this is only the simplest criticism that I have seen. (Ball Field Grand Duke)

### Film and Drama

Entertainment... The Queen's Necklace

Marfe Antofnette

This film, in every aspect, can be called a great success. Every scene is full of moving romance and tense, terrifying tragic overtones. At the same time, Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power, in their first collaboration, are even more able to vividly portray the tragic fate of a French queen. The acting of the two in the film has reached the highest peak of artistic expression.

Norma Shearer plays an Austrian princess full of enthusiasm and hope in the film, who unfortunately marries the foolish Louis XVI. Disappointed, she indulges in a life of luxury and licentiousness, and falls in love with Duke Fersen. But in the end, because of wasting national funds to satisfy her lust, she fails to gain the understanding of the people, and due to Louis' mediocrity and incompetence, the people are left in dire straits, and a revolution breaks out. It is in this chaos that her extremely tragic fate is created.

The film vividly brings this moving historical event to the screen. The scenery and costumes are also extremely magnificent and luxurious. At the same time, the film provides an extremely realistic depiction of the Queen's extravagant and licentious life, the environment that created her character, and the situation of the French Revolution at the time, further enhancing the film's realism. This "Queen's Necklace" is a work that is extremely worth recommending to audiences.

Empress Peace Same Screen... The Adulterous Wife Disguised as a Maid

Say It Iu Fronch

A humorous and crazy romantic comedy with a fairly interesting story, depicting a marriage full of jokes. Ray Milland plays an American athlete who brings his newly married wife back from Paris, but in order to save his father from bankruptcy, he has to pretend to be engaged to the daughter of a shipping company boss. Because he can't arrange for his beloved wife to live, this new daughter-in-law has to temporarily hide from her mother-in-law and father-in-law and act as a maid. As a result, under these special circumstances, many jokes ensue.

The female lead, Olina Brierina, plays this humorous and lively role, which is very suitable for her personality. She gives a satisfactory performance in the film. Ray Milland's acting is also magical and interesting. The director has handled this film in an extremely relaxed and lively manner. It is a good work for entertainment.

Orient... Racket Busters

Racket Busters

The first half is more dull, while the second half is quite tense. Overall, it is still a good film in the 'gangster education' genre. Humphrey Bogart is known for playing gangsters, and his performance here is nuanced and portrays people with subtlety. Zhizhi Bolun also shows a good attitude, breaking away from the comical roles, and Alan Jenkins plays well. Gloria Dixon is a superfluous character and can be dispensed with.

Great China... The Morons

Beau Hunks

Cathay... Tarzan's Revenge

Tarzang Revenge

A new Tarzan has been cast, with Grant Morris replacing Johnny Weissmuller. The story is, unsurprisingly, unremarkable. An explorer takes his wife deep into the wilderness with the aim of capturing the "White Carp." Unfortunately, the local guide colludes with the barbarian king to forcibly abduct a girl. Thereupon, "our hero" Tarzan comes to the rescue, saving the girl from danger. The two fall in love, and the girl never returns to civilized society.

The female lead, Eleanor Holm, is the former American world swimming champion who was expelled for drinking. However, the swimming scene here is only a small section.

### A Powerful Accusation

— Shi Yi

Introducing Fanshibai's "Japanese Spies"

Spy novels have become wartime speculative commodities for general idle scholars and opportunistic booksellers, so I have never paid much attention to them. But this autobiography by Fanshibai, "How I Became a Japanese Spy," not only attracted all my attention, causing me to neglect sleep and food to finish reading it, but also made me feel earnestly that it should be introduced to those who have not read it.

As Mr. Tian Bolie (an international friend of China) said, "This is a personal story." The author, Fanshibai, served in intelligence work for the Allied Powers during World War I. After the war, he was hired by Zhang Zuolin in China to help him rule the three northeastern provinces, dealing with bandits, drug dealers, arms smugglers, revolutionary people, and the Soviet Union. After the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces, he was spotted by Doihara and, under duress, followed them in doing espionage work. In short, he was a spy who was not very respectable in the past, but the writing of this book has lifted him out of sin. He himself said that the book is "to declare the truth and brand the label of infamy on the foreheads of the Japanese militarists, to expose the greedy and cruel Japanese officers before the conscience of the world, to point out to what depths of shamelessness the actions of these uniformed beasts can degenerate, and, in the name of humanity, culture, and justice, to tell of the calamities suffered by the people of Manchuria under their oppression." In fact, he has indeed completed this righteous and heroic act, making a powerful accusation.

The whole book begins with his work during the Zhang Zuolin era, and Zhang Zuolin's assassination, the truth about the September 18th Incident conspiracy, the tragic experiences of the people after the Japanese occupation, and the process of his being forced into service. It then exposes the ugly face of Japanese rule, colluding with bandits, monopolizing the pornography industry, trafficking drugs, gambling, conspiracies against the Soviet Union and the investigation mission, and openly kidnapping people. Interspersed are the heroic attacks of the Northeast Volunteer Army, the people's discontent and resistance, and the infighting within the military. Almost all of it is raw, truthful historical material that no outsider could possibly know.

This truth not only arouses our shuddering anger, but also makes us more firmly believe in its inevitable collapse. Promoting this collapse is not only the duty of the Chinese, but also the most sacred duty of all humanity in the world.

The author's writing is very vivid, so that we feel a stronger emotion than reading hundreds of ordinary records of atrocities. However, like Mr. Tian Bolie, we also feel that the author sometimes inevitably curses the entire Japanese nation, touching on the Japanese people, who should not be responsible for the crimes of the fascist militarists and who will also suffer their calamities. This is a major shortcoming.

This book has a digest attached to issue 43 of the Wen Zhai, which is an excerpted translation. An excellent full translation by translator Zun Wen was recently published. In addition, there is a serialization in the supplement of the Xing Bao, but it is not yet finished.

### Old Man

— Li Liwen

But as soon as he approached the house, his wife's cry pierced his heart like a sharp arrow. The old man couldn't bear it, he wanted to rush to his old wife, but he didn't. He just sat there woodenly. He suddenly saw the fishing net in the corner of the door. At the bottom of the net, there seemed to be some fish and shrimp jumping. The old man didn't dare to think any further. He felt his heart swelling as if it was about to burst open. So, he grabbed the early tobacco pipe he was used to smoking and ran out of the house in a hurry, walking around aimlessly. It wasn't until the scorching sun awakened him that he realized he had walked far away from the village. But where to go? He was at a loss...

The old man walked around the nearby hill like this, sitting and letting the heavy, broken heart be tossed by endless waves of sorrow.

Finally, just as he was thinking that life was just an illusion, the smoke exhaled by the old man seemed to be much lighter.

But his old wife was still a burden, wasn't she?

Then, he seemed to hear his old wife's sad cry again.

The old man didn't dare to think any further. He quickly looked into the distance, wanting to immerse himself in the scenery before him...

The afterglow of the setting sun was now illuminating the earth with a golden hue. The endless mountains stretching to the end of the sky, clusters of villages, the verdant fields just sprouting tender seedlings, the fish ponds shimmering with thousands of scales of light, the silently flowing river, all showed an extraordinary tranquility. One or two flocks of returning birds flying across the evening sky further embellished the infinite picturesque quality of the mountain village. On a wheat-yellow village road, three young men wearing shorts and rolling up their sleeves were walking slowly at a leisurely pace. They gradually approached the hill, but suddenly turned back to the left, stopped at the edge of a large fish pond covered with reeds, bent down and went into the grass.

The old man knew these three people well. They were all the sons of the village elders in this mountain village. And the old man also knew what they were up to in the reeds.

"Stealing fish again," the old man thought angrily. "They spend all day playing around and guarding themselves so well, but not one of them is being drafted."

A very strange idea floated into the old man's mind. The old man wanted to smash everything in this mountain village to pieces.

"Without me, there would be none of you," the old man said to himself.

So, the old man stirred up that bitterness, suffering, despair, anger, and that incomparable hatred that was difficult to repay. His heavy heart was very disturbed, very heavy...

An eagle was howling in the vast sky gradually filled with night clouds. The night wind at the end of September was indeed a bit chilly. The old man felt around in his tobacco pouch, but the tobacco was gone. Only then did the old man feel a bit hungry. He hadn't eaten lunch, but home, wasn't that exactly the thought the old man couldn't bear to think about?

Woodenly gazing at the familiar village where cooking smoke was rising, the old man hesitated for a long time. Suddenly, a strange light shone in the old man's eyes, and two lines of tears dripped down his dry cheeks again.

So, the old man quietly stood up, leaving behind the tobacco pipe he had been smoking for more than twenty years. Without looking back at his village, he passed the hill, walked into the dense pine forest behind the hill, untied his belt, made a circle on a branch, and silently stuck his head into the circle.

The night mist began to pour down dimly. A flock of returning birds screeched as they flew across the sky. (End)

### We Are Chinese

— Ren Jun

We are Chinese—

On our chests:

Hang the symbol of shame,

Also hang the badge of pride.

Yesterday—

Kicked by others,

We still have to kowtow with tears,

Pretend to be happy;

But, today—

We have already raised our lowered heads,

Stretched out strong arms.

Let the powerful enemy feel surprised and panicked…

We are Chinese—

From now on, on our chests:

Will tear off the symbol of shame,

Hang the badge of pride forever.

### Spring Spent Under Bombardment

— Du Wenhui

The dawn of March. The sky is always as dark as ashes. In the blue green western countryside the sky drizzles ice-cold rain. I climb out of bed and get dressed, and go to the country office, and through the worn-out windows, I watch the gnome like roofs shivering on the cold air. On the open plain, covered in straight, green, fertile grass, on the distant sea enshrouded in gray fog, can be seen dimly several black battleships. Prowling around near the Asian Tonggushan area.

Shutting the window. I hastily take the basin and run downstairs to wash my face. Returning to the room, I eat a couple of hard crackers, and sitting in the room, listening to the ticking of the alarm clock. In my heart is a loneliness and terror.

In these past few days x's ships have constantly been shelling the nearby area, x's planes are constantly circling and reconnoitering the town. Most of the people in the town have cleared out. The only ones remaining are the soldiers, militia, and strong young men with a responsibility to protect the land. The whole town seems to have fallen into a tense and deathly silence, whether it is day or night, people are trembling with fear and cowardice, waiting for the x people to land with a heroic and indignant rage - this sentiment is just like the plum blossoms that are in full bloom in the town, like the lush, fertile grass in the countryside, like the barks from dogs suddenly streaking across the cold sky. In these ruins, they are like living in a silent tomb, like living in the fog before the storm. I can't recall what kind of anxiety and misery I mixed through at the time. Am I afraid? No! This is my responsibility! This is what I expected! But I must admit that I am weak after all, my body is trembling a bit, not from the cold, but from the excitement in my heart. I am preparing to sacrifice, haven't I been preparing for this day for several months now!

I suddenly stand up, clench my fist, as if about to have a fight with a ferocious x person in front of me. I turn to look out the window, the plum rain has stopped, the sky is a bit brighter, but it is still so gloomy, I feel a line of disappointment and glory. I lie wearily in the bed. I am pained by the unknown destiny, bewildered by so many, mysterious ideas. I seem to be laying on the sea, drifting through such a delicate dream, as helpless and pitiful as an abandoned orphan on the road!

Suddenly there is a sound of rapid footsteps in the stairwell. I ask with a furious tone: Who's there!

It's us, Hui. I recognize it's the voice of the female rescue worker. More than one person, so many footsteps. I stand up and open the door. The first to flash in from the dark stairwell, following her are Shou and Fang, they are both here at the service of the comrades.

Followed up by them? Hui pants and says. It seems like there's something important going on.

Is there any news from the outside? I am agitated and eager to know a bit more.

It's the same as before. We just came out and saw five bombers flying towards Dongguan, maybe they will come pay a visit to here. What are you hiding here for? Better run out there! Shou says.

I put on my black coat, take the revolver under my pillow, hold a walking stick, lock the door, and leave together with them. We run on the slippery cobblestone, the streets are cold and quiet, the stores are all tightly shut. There are no pedestrians, only the self defense forces are patrolling with old-fashioned 79 rifles on their backs.

We run into a small diner to eat breakfast, countless black flies buzz annoyingly. We had barely eaten half our meal: when we hear the deep 'rumbling' of artillery fire in the distance. We hurriedly finished our meal, paid the bill, and walked towards the streets, running out of the street and then stepping onto a long stone bridge, on that bridge we saw some flames flashing on the x battleship, followed by a deep artillery fire that reverberated through the freezing sky, stagnating in the hearts of the people.

"Shelling Guye!" Fang points at the place that is eight or nine li away from us. The artillery fire sounds constantly, but there are no steamships landing.

We run across the bridge, on the other side is a patch of green grass, on the left of the grassland is the sea, on the right is a belt of fruit trees, we walk into the forest of trees, climb onto the high branches and look into the distance. Only to see that the defense forces on the Niuwan fort have already begun to fire back. The sound of artillery fire reverberates through the sky, drifting in the grassland and the valleys on the highway, at this moment we don't feel terror, only joy and excitement! We have seen this kind of playful artillery fire many times. From experience we know: this is just one kind of shameless attempt from the x people!

The sound of artillery fire continues for twenty minutes, the x ships begin to retreat. Gradually retreating from the coast to the left of the five thousand meter Dawangzhou. The smokestacks are constantly belching smoke, like a beaten dog panting there, hesitantly stroking the wound on its pain-wracked form.

Suddenly x's cannons fire towards the Xixiang area. 'Rumble rumble rumble' three times, one shot lands near the highway, one shot hits the third village, and one shot has not even reached land and falls in the sea. The sound of the explosion attacked our eardrums, almost causing us to fall from the tree to the ground.

We fall silent. Until that deep echo is gone. The x ships have already sailed to that distant sea, that gray shadow gradually dissipates in the hazy mist.

We climb down the tree and run to the place that was hit. When we run to the vicinity of the highway, there is a hole that is more than ten feet deep, mud and metal pieces scatter on the ground nearby. That house was also blown up. Those wooden boards are still burning there, the people have all run away, only a pile of tiles and rusty farming tools lie quietly there. What a thought provoking picture of the front lines of national defense this is!

We run back to that forest, Fen and Shou are playing the harmonica, we sing the March of the Volunteers, singing the Mobilization Song. The happy mood of youth is once again reinvigorating our limbs, taking hold in our souls. Like the red petals of the peach blossoms on the road! Like the green vitality of the grass on the countryside!

'China will not perish', China will not perish! Will not perish! Will not perish! Will not perish!... When we sang to the final, most tragic section of 'The Song of Eight Hundred Heroes', it felt as if we already had this conviction in our hearts! In front of us there was an unyielding courage and firm conviction as if it were a matter of fact!

The delicate spring sun has illuminated that melancholy gray mist, illuminated that blue sea and green earth, illuminated the thoughts in our hearts! All that is before our eyes is full of the loveliness of spring and the charming scenery. I rejoice, that I have been able to live again in this cradle of the 'Spring of Life'! I sing to praise this victory of repelling the x people!

I love spring, I love the delicate sun. But this spring and the delicate sun will slowly disappear in the dusk of the bombing. It becomes a past of regret and memories. With a sense of longing after the frenzy, I recall the tail end of spring that was spent under bombardment!

### Rural Prosperity

— Ai Wu

Thoughts on the Journey, Part One

The rural economy of inland China has been shrinking day by day under the threat of foreign goods. For example, earth-style weaving machines and spinning wheels, at first, stop and start, barely maintaining themselves. Then, they are sealed off by dust, even stuck with chicken droppings. Later, they simply become spider nests, filled with many Bagua formations. This is a most obvious example that you can see at a glance when you go to the countryside.

Thanks to the blockade by the x's warships, the foreign goods that invaded China, especially their own Japanese goods, were all blocked. As a result, the rural economy in the rear area during the year of resistance against Japan has become particularly prosperous. First of all, in every village, there are sounds of cotton fluffing, spinning, and weaving. These sounds loudly reach the ears of passersby, coming over the fences and mud walls, making people feel that the previously silent villages are now being revived.

I saw in southern Hunan that in villages and towns where foreign yarn had disappeared, the village girls spinning thread and the farm women carrying children all looked happy. Then, the homemade cotton yarn, packed in baskets, was waiting for buyers like a competition. Think about it, if you spend one yuan to buy cotton and spin it into yarn, you can earn eight or nine jiao, or even one yuan, when you sell it. Who wouldn't be happy to do this business?

Thanks to the blockade by the x's warships, our rear area villages have benefited and become greatly prosperous. This is one of our greatest victories after the resistance against Japan.
