### The Future of the Black Market Exchange Rate

— Bao Leti

Automatic Contraction, Not Forced Collapse

Nothing is more alarming than the sudden changes in the black market exchange rate. But looking at the process of this change: the cause is clearly the banks selling foreign exchange automatically contracting the exchange rate, and even automatically stopping the sale of foreign exchange. This is different from a forced collapse, with a clear distinction between subject and object. HSBC is a British bank, but because it is a major player in the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, it implicitly acted as the representative of the Chinese Ministry of Finance in the black market for foreign exchange. Its actions were based on the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, acting under orders. There is no reason to strike oneself. Based on common sense, it is clear that this sharp drop in the exchange rate is a change in our government's policy on foreign exchange controls, and has nothing to do with the safety of the legal tender itself.

Several Ridiculous Speculations in the Market

But when HSBC first contracted the exchange rate against the British pound from eight pence to seven pence seventy-five on the morning of the 7th, rumors abounded and gossip spread in the market. Some people maliciously slandered and attached political interpretations, even saying that this was a means for Europe and the United States to forcibly mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Some people made wild guesses about the equalization fund, creating rumors and undermining it, even saying that China's foreign exchange reserves had lost more than half due to long-term trade surpluses and speculative purchases by the Japanese puppet regime. Some people speculated that our government had decided to change its policy of controlling foreign exchange, implementing currency devaluation, and even moving the agency supplying foreign exchange from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Furthermore, because all parties were eagerly awaiting the Ministry of Finance to announce the aftermath of this sharp change in the exchange rate, and the Ministry of Finance remained silent, not revealing any opinion in the past two and a half days, it made people even more suspicious, worried about whether there would be problems with the legal tender itself. In addition, the circulation of copper coins in Shanghai gradually contracted, and the public utility vehicle company explicitly revealed news of a shortage of copper coins. This strengthened the psychological hoarding of copper coins by all parties, and even led to the use of various substitutes, even using postal stamps for redemption. This made people worry about the future of the legal tender. Rumors of issuing banknotes and contracting five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender banknotes resurfaced.

Eight Pence and Import-Export Trade

The Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee ××××××××××× stabilized in the black market at the level of eight pence for more than nine months. At that time, there was no balance mechanism, so there was no balance operation relationship. The emergence and stability of this eight-pence black market rate was purely accidental, and there was no theoretical basis.

The establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, and the use of this eight-pence black exchange rate as the standard for balanced conversion, had no basis other than assuming that it was equal to the purchasing power parity of the currency. But as mentioned earlier: The mission of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, in addition to eliminating speculative activities and reducing the losses of minor import exchanges not approved by the central government, was also to restrict various unnecessary imports and promote the export of local products.

However, according to the recent trend of sharp increase in import trade: This eight-pence black market exchange rate, which is lower than the official exchange rate, is obviously unable to restrain general import trade, especially in Shanghai: The import value in the first four months of this year reached 185.7 million yuan, nearly doubling from 68.7 million yuan in the same period last year, accounting for 46.8% of the total import value of the country.

But Completely Different from Devaluation

When the exchange rate in the black market drastically deviated from the official price after the implementation of foreign exchange controls last year, until the black market exchange rate naturally stabilized at the level of eight pence against the British pound; in the domestic academic community, there were many people who advocated appropriately lowering the official price. The reasons for advocating lowering the official price were nothing more than restricting imports and protecting domestic exports, so as to promote exports, and even attract remittances from overseas Chinese to return to the country as the most powerful measure. However, in addition to resolutely maintaining the external credit of the legal tender and never wanting to take any action on this, the government authorities have also been carrying out various means to achieve the above-mentioned goals in other aspects, and have achieved remarkable results. For example, very few importers can purchase foreign exchange at the official price, and most of them purchase it at a high price in the black market, which has invisibly restricted imports. At the same time, most of the domestic transportation tools are in the hands of the state, and the state naturally selects import goods according to their needs and the degree of need. Unnecessary and even unnecessary imported goods have also been strictly restricted in transportation. As for the purchase of military supplies from overseas, most of them have been implemented by means of barter. The determination of the prices of goods from each other does not require manipulation by devaluation policy. Therefore, it will no longer affect the development of export trade. As for the remittances of overseas Chinese returning to the country, there have been considerable gains in the development of patriotism alone, and the existence of the gray market is indeed enough for overseas Chinese to choose from.

In the face of these facts, since the government has no need to devalue the official price, then this contraction of the black market exchange rate by HSBC Bank is of course completely different from the devaluation policy. And we can obtain an opposite clear proof from the content of the second item in the statement of the Ministry of Finance spokesperson recorded above.

As mentioned earlier: At present, due to seasonal reasons, imports are quite large, especially the increase in imports of non-essential goods. Therefore, there is a basis for adjusting foreign exchange market prices on the basis of Chinese economic standards to maintain the balance of international payments. This clearly reveals that the future level of the stabilized black market price is quite different from the past in terms of policy.

(1) The Central Bank has always maintained the official price of one shilling and two pence and will never change it. However, the Exchange Equalization Committee will abandon the past policy of freezing at a certain point (like pegging to eight pence) for equalization operations in the black market, and will adapt to circumstances according to the standards favorable to the Chinese economy and with reference to the seasonal relationship between imports and exports.

(2) Although the standard of equalization will be determined according to circumstances, it must be based on whether it is beneficial to the Chinese economy as the principle of selection. This is obviously completely different from the past pinning policy. Therefore, the new level that will appear in the future is not an unchangeable level. It can be smaller than eight pence, and it can also be larger than eight pence.

Crushing the Conspiracy of Japanese Puppet Regime's Speculative Purchases

Everyone knows: Japan relies on issuing non-convertible banknotes to plunder raw materials and local products from the occupied areas of China. In addition to transporting a part of them to Japan for consumption by its factories, it also resells another unnecessary part to Shanghai and other places, thereby absorbing legal tender to speculate on foreign exchange. Needless to say: This scheme of his must have the unlimited supply of the black market as a prerequisite, and at the same time, it must have a stable black market exchange rate to obtain full benefits. Especially in recent months, when the Japanese yen has sharply appreciated against the legal tender, and at the same time, the black market exchange rate of the legal tender has been stable for a long time, his necessity and profit of speculating on the legal tender foreign exchange have become even greater. According to recent reports: He is currently using this method to purchase large quantities of cotton and wheat from overseas on behalf of his factories in Shanghai: However, due to the contraction of the foreign exchange black market this time, it is impossible to import. From this, it can be seen that this sudden change is completely in line with the "anti-Japanese strategy."

However, merely contracting the black market exchange rate is absolutely not enough to combat the Japanese puppet regime's conspiracy to speculate on the legal tender foreign exchange. Unless we can also find ways to restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market at the same time. Although during the sharp changes in the exchange rate market, there was once a rumor that the location of foreign exchange supply would be moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong, there is no such indication in the statement of the Ministry of Finance spokesperson. Although this is a major regret, it is sufficient to reflect the government authorities' consideration of the convenience of Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, as well as to reflect the strength of China's foreign exchange reserves.

### The Political Education Work of a Model Teacher (3)

— Xiang Rong

5. We should develop a heuristic teaching method, such as pre-setting assumptions and asking soldiers to handle them; or proposing three answers to a question and asking soldiers to think about which one is correct; or, when encountering a problem that is not easy to understand, making an appropriate analogy, etc.

6. After the purchase and teaching are completed, it is best to lead the soldiers to read the textbook several times. Although it is not rote learning, the way of reading can also help the soldiers understand and remember, especially the soldiers who do not know the words and cannot read by themselves.

7. The seriousness of classroom discipline and the improvement of soldiers' interest in class are not contradictory. That is to say, do not neglect to improve soldiers' interest in class because of the need to strictly enforce classroom discipline. How to improve soldiers' interest? For example, inserting some appropriate jokes in the teaching (jokes related to the course); making some gestures for some things that can be done with gestures, or calling everyone to stand up and sing when the soldiers feel tired, etc. These are all ways to improve interest.

(7) Extracurricular Discussion

1. After each class, extracurricular discussions should be held in units of squads during self-study time. The advantage of holding discussions in units of squads is that everyone can speak, time can be saved, and the method is much more active than platoon discussions.

2. Therefore, each research group should have one study group leader, who should be appointed by someone with a high level of political and cultural knowledge to lead the discussion meetings of each squad.

3. If there are problems that cannot be solved at the discussion meeting, then temporarily ask cadres above the platoon to make a conclusion, or leave it to be solved during the review the next day.

4. Instructors and teachers should convene the study group leaders of each squad before the discussion meeting to hold a preparation meeting, instructing them on how to conduct the discussion in order to improve the ability of the study group leaders.

(8) Review:

In order to deepen education, in addition to improving teaching methods and holding extracurricular discussions, the education progress should not be too fast. Our rule is: one day of class, one day of review. The review is still held in units of companies, reviewing the class taught yesterday. How to review?

(9) Auxiliary Education:

1. The layout of the salvation room of the company should be suitable for the content of daily education, so as to achieve the role of assisting military, political and cultural education.

2. Political organs must regularly produce some auxiliary teaching materials (such as wall charts, songs, and scripts, etc.) according to the content of education for use by companies.

(10) Testing:

1. Individual temporary oral tests are held by company and platoon cadres at any time in order to understand the degree of understanding of the soldiers in a timely manner.

2. Regular tests can be held once a week or every two weeks. Each company takes turns to test one established squad.

(11) Education in the Environment of Marching and Combat

The peacetime education system should be maintained in the environment of marching and combat, and should not be stopped. If the marching distance is within 60 li, one class can still be held (one day for military and one day for politics). The class time can be reduced to about half an hour, and the content can be reduced appropriately.

2. The content of education in the environment of marching and combat should focus on explaining the tasks and precautions of marching and combat. If the marching period is longer, then after the temporary teaching materials are completed, continue to carry out the regular teaching materials.

3. In the environment of marching and combat, attention should be paid to the use of free time (such as rest during marching, waiting for opportunities or defending during combat), but in principle, attention should be paid to not affecting combat tasks, not increasing the fatigue of soldiers, and adopting more flexible and active methods (such as holding in units of squads, holding on the spot at the position on the battlefield, holding in the sentry post, and using singing, storytelling, guessing riddles, etc.).

(12) Education of Miscellaneous Personnel:

Miscellaneous personnel in the company refer to cooks. Why should they be specifically mentioned? Because they cannot participate in the classes of ordinary soldiers due to their own duties, so there must be a separate plan.

Should miscellaneous personnel take classes in units of battalions or companies? We chose the method of taking classes in units of companies. What time should it be held? After dinner is the most suitable. What is the progress? One class per day (two political, two military, one health per week), about half an hour each time, and the content can be reduced to half of that of ordinary soldiers.

(13) Education Preparation Meeting

The education preparation meeting is convened for the lecturers before class. It is held in units of battalions, and the instructors and teachers of each company attend. It is presided over by the battalion instructor. The preparation meeting is held once a week, first summarizing the education of the previous week, and then preparing the education for this week. The matters to be prepared are as follows:

1. Unified interpretation of the content of political education this week;

2. Formulation and supply of auxiliary materials for political education this week.

(14) Extracurricular Political Education

What has been said above is mostly about the specific problems of attending political classes. Political class is regarded as in-class education in the troops. In addition, there is extracurricular political education. What are the contents of extracurricular political education and what methods are used to carry it out?

1. Soldiers' Congress, held in units of companies, battalions, or regiments. All members must attend. This meeting is convened to convey a certain important political issue, or to explain the specific tasks of the unit, or to discuss the daily work and life of the company (in the soldiers' congress of the company). The soldiers' congress in the company unit is held once every two weeks. The ones in the battalion unit and regiment unit are irregular, but there is at least one every month.

2. Question and Answer Evening Party, held in units of companies. All company soldiers participate. A more active way is adopted to deepen the education of a certain important political issue. At this kind of party, some questions are formulated in advance, asked, and designated to answer. Rewards are stipulated for correct answers (such as peanuts and melon seeds), and punishments are imposed for wrong answers (punishments for singing, punishments for doing ventriloquism, etc.). The company question and answer evening party is held irregularly, but there must be one every month.

3. Evening Party: Conducted in units of battalions or regiments, the main content is the performance of songs, dances, and dramas. Although this kind of party is entertaining, it also has great educational significance. There is no propaganda team (and theater company) in each regiment in the troops, so the company soldiers can see a play once every other week.

4. Commemorative Meeting: Held on commemorative days, in units of regiments, battalions, or companies, depending on the war situation at the time and the significance of the commemorative day.

5. Reading Newspapers: The division political department publishes a regular newspaper, once a week: The content of the newspaper, on the one hand, is to give a brief overview of the anti-Japanese situation, important domestic and international current affairs of the week; on the other hand, it is troop communications, about the practical experience and opinions of troop work.

6. Extracurricular Speeches: Regarding current affairs questions and the actual problems of the troops on a daily basis, which need to be educated among the soldiers, the division political organs compile speech materials and use extracurricular time or morning and evening roll call time to give speeches. This kind of speech is held irregularly, decided at any time, and then carried out at any time. It is not stipulated within the entire education plan.

B. Political Education of Cadres

The political education of cadres is divided into company and platoon levels, battalion and regiment levels, and division and brigade levels according to the differences in the political and cultural levels of cadres at all levels. At the same time, because the work of cadres at all levels is different in complexity, and the ability of self-study is also strong and weak, the methods of implementation are also different.

(1) Political Education of Company and Platoon Cadres:

1. The political education of company and platoon cadres is held once a week (with another military education), gathering in battalion units for class. The lecturers are the teachers of each battalion.

2. The educational materials have been said above. What needs to be said here is that, based on the existing materials, a concise and popular outline should be drawn up so that the lecturers can grasp the center and those who receive the education can easily understand, because the political and cultural level of the current company and platoon cadres is still not high in terms of reading ability.

3. The education method is to first explain by the lecturer, and then discuss in company units.

4. Testing can be held once every two weeks, not every week, because when cadres encounter testing, they often spend the whole day and night looking for materials and writing answers, thus hindering a lot of work. At the same time, the questions should also be more flexible: Some specific questions that connect theory to practice should be asked to avoid copying the textbooks on the one hand and rote memorizing the articles on the other hand without being able to apply them flexibly.

(2) Political Education of Battalion Cadres:

The general problems of the education of battalion cadres are similar to those of company and platoon cadres. The special ones are that the content should be deeper, the progress should be faster, but the number of classes should be less, and self-study should be more. Why? Because the political and cultural level of battalion cadres is higher, the practical experience is richer, and the problems seen are also more extensive, so the content must be deeper than that of company and platoon cadres, and the progress must be faster. At the same time, the education of battalion cadres is carried out in regiment units. Due to the relationship between stationing, they are often far apart, so the number of times should be less and self-study should be more. According to our regulations, battalion cadres have one week of military education and one week of political education, that is to say, political education is carried out once in two weeks.

In addition to attending classes, battalion cadres should also focus on self-study. How can they be helped to self-study? First, designate appropriate books for self-study; second, formulate some questions based on these books; third, organize them to collectively discuss; fourth, regularly check and supervise and answer some of their questions and difficulties.

Regarding current affairs questions, we also adopted this method: the division political department printed and distributed the radio news received every day to the regiment and battalion (not to the company). The cadres at the regiment level held a current affairs forum once a week, summarizing the anti-Japanese situation, important domestic and international events of the week, and exchanging opinions. In this way, on the one hand, the cadres can be promoted to study current affairs questions, and at the same time, they can provide preparations for reporting to the lower levels.

(3) Political Education of Division and Brigade Cadres:

According to our current situation, I am afraid that the higher the political education, the more difficulties there will be. Why? The first is because the more senior the cadres, the more questions they need to understand and the greater the requirements; the second is precisely because of the above reasons, so it is more difficult for the instructors; and the third is also because the comrades in the front lack educational experience.

According to the current situation, the political cadre education of the division and brigade mainly adopts the two methods of forum and self-study. The method of attending classes is more difficult.

The forum adopts the method of rotating reports. After the reporter's report, the comrades attending the meeting will supplement it. The forum is held at least once every two weeks. If there are temporary problems (such as relatively major current affairs problems in the group and internationally, etc.), it can be convened temporarily.

(4) Other

The political education of cadres at all levels mentioned above is all about carrying out work without leaving their posts. In addition, in order to train cadres, there are also educational and training classes that leave their posts and are specialized in training.

There are two types of training classes, one is opened for manufacturing cadres, and the time must be four months to six months, and the other is temporarily opened to strengthen the ability of current cadres, and the time can be from one month to two months.

C. Wartime Cultural Education

(1) Education Time: The weekly cultural education time is five times, with three literacy classes, one arithmetic class, and one natural knowledge class.

(2) Grouping: Because the cultural level of the soldiers is different, the literacy class should be divided into three types: A, B, and C. The arithmetic class can be divided into two groups, and the natural knowledge is not grouped. Group A: Can keep a diary and can read ordinary documents:

Group B: Can recognize more than 50 words:

Group C: Knows less than 50 words.

(3) Lecturer:

1. The instructor is responsible for natural knowledge;

2. The teacher and the clerk share the arithmetic;

3. The literacy classes of Group A and B are combined and the instructor is responsible. The clerk is responsible for Group C.

(4) Requirements: The literacy class of Group A focuses on solving the writing of lessons and teaching the methods of writing essays, diaries, and letters. Gradually teach them to fill in sentences, write essays, write letters, etc. When teaching new words, they must go through these three stages: first teach reading, first teach explanation, and third teach writing.

(5) Extracurricular Self-study: After class, soldiers should be mobilized to carry out extracurricular self-study. The self-study methods for literacy are practicing writing, playing literacy cards, keeping diaries, reading books, writing communications, etc., and the self-study methods for arithmetic can be mobilized to do arithmetic games.

D. Cultural Education of Cadres:

The cultural education of cadres does not use the method of attending classes, but uses the method of self-study. How to carry out self-study? The main ones are reading books, keeping diaries, etc. The self-study of company and platoon cadres is stipulated to be carried out during the political class and cultural class time of the soldiers, but it must be gathered in the company headquarters and guided by the instructor. The diary of the platoon-level cadres is the responsibility of the teacher of the company for revision, once every three days, and the diary of the company-level cadres is revised by the battalion instructor or a designated person, once a week.

Regarding the extracurricular work and entertainment work in the troops, as well as the organizational problems of leading the political education work in the troops, I will not talk about it here. Because these need to be discussed in a separate article.

To say one more thing, the above simple and shallow experience on the political education work in the troops is for the reference of the leading comrades in the anti-Japanese troops and the comrades who actually bear the political education work. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that everyone will exchange experiences so that the political education in the troops can be further improved.

### Lu Northwest Correspondence: A Record of Crossing the Yellow River Northward

Seven: Night Meeting on the Embankment

In ××—that beautiful small town nestled against the Yellow River, we happily and systematically spent two full days. In the morning, when the sunlight of Di Tian shone on the river, emitting golden light waves, Secretary Tiao and we often climbed onto the large wooden boat moored on the shore and sang in unison. In the evening, again, our group would gather on the ×× that stretched far into the river to discuss issues and review our work. This made us forget the fatigue of running around to nearby villages during the day. We only felt the warmth of leisure, interest, and friendship. As night fell, the moon rose, shining a bright white light on the river. Secretary Yao and I sat on the earthen shoal by the river, waiting for all the comrades to come for a discussion meeting.

"Secretary Yao: You seem a bit down today. Why?"

"I'm not down," he denied.

I pressed him again, "Then why are you staring blankly into space?"

"I'm wondering if we should obey orders to retreat."

"Retreat?" I was shocked by his low voice. "Why?"

"Why? Because of orders! It's said that ×× has fallen, and ×× is in grave danger. Moreover, the situation in the city has been unclear for the past few days, and bandits have looted the city. Chief × just called, saying that there are orders from above for us to retreat to Henan immediately!" He said angrily, shaking his head with resentment.

"Are we just going to obey the orders and retreat?"

"I think we can solicit everyone's opinion…"

A fierce debate arose at the discussion meeting regarding this issue, but the majority of comrades advocated continuing forward. The reasons were: everyone knew from the beginning that the work of crossing the river would be difficult; if they were afraid of hardship, they shouldn't have come. Since they came, they were not afraid of hardship and shouldn't turn back halfway. Moreover, everyone was stirred by the secretary's words.

"First of all, everyone must know that × City is ours. Precisely because × City is in danger, we are even more needed to awaken and organize the good people and enable them to participate in the struggle to defend their homeland. This is a work of great significance… Assuming that Japanese soldiers have already occupied × City, we must still find a way to recapture it. Besides, it is now the bandits who are creating the tense atmosphere in × City. I think bandits are always Chinese people, not untamable beasts. And persuading them and winning them over to join the anti-Japanese front is the responsibility of our political workers…"

The sound of the river flowing at night was especially loud, accompanied by our impassioned shouts, creating a wonderful symphony.

"We want to go to × City!"—Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

"We will not retreat to Henan!"—Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! We will not retreat to Henan!"—Hooray!

The river seemed to understand human intentions, shouting loudly with us.

Under the silvery moonlight, we saw Secretary Yao waving his hand forcefully. This clearly showed his decisiveness.

"Comrades! Since you all agree to go to × City, then we will decide to leave tomorrow. However, everyone must have a firm will and the determination to live and die with × City. If anyone lacks the perseverance and doesn't dare to go, he can voluntarily report to me tonight. I will give him the necessary travel expenses and send him back to Jinan for retraining. In any case, don't sneak away…"

To × City!

The next day, we bravely and decisively embarked on the road to × City. Not a single person asked to return to Henan. The only five female comrades in the team were even more energetic and excited. The comrades marched in step, singing powerful songs.

Let's go to × City,

Toward the battlefield of national liberation!…

Editorial

### Further Discussion on the Tianjin Crisis and Britain

"When can the British government revitalize Britain's prestige?"

This was a question posed in Parliament by British Member of Parliament Ponsonby to the British authorities. We are thousands of miles away from Britain and unable to witness the scene firsthand. However, in a gentleman's country, a model of political deliberation, at a time when the world is watching, under a solemn atmosphere, there was actually such a question. How can one not imagine the questioner's emotions, how depressed, how bewildered, how blood surging, how tearful. For the British people and even friends of Britain, all who love Britain, there is probably no one who does not have such doubts, no one who does not sympathize with this question. At that time, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, who represented the government at Parliament, remained silent and did not report. Alas, what a scene, what an omen, in that moment of silence? ××××××××××××××××××× Those who love Britain are filled with doubt, and those who envy Britain coldly watch its decline. Have you heard what the German Sea News Agency reported from London on the 14th? It described the Tianjin crisis, saying, "The prestige of the Great British Empire depends on the success or failure of this matter!" It said that the Germans today are mocking, stimulating, and awakening the British in their bewilderment and distress in order to urge Britain to be tougher on Japan. There is no reason, no event, to force them to do so. Those who love and those who envy speak in unison, observe in unison. This is heaven's law and absolute truth.

The outcome of the Tianjin crisis is unpredictable. It is in the process of evolving. As of the time this reporter is holding his pen, there are not only no signs of easing, but it is also reported that Japan, in addition to implementing a blockade of the British and French concessions, is even preparing to use 50,000 Japanese residents and 2,000 reserve soldiers to enter the British concession as a pretext for sweeping graves. The intentions shown by the authorities there are even more extreme. As the military spokesman said, Britain is required to recognize the East Asian New Order proposed by Japan. As the Foreign Ministry spokesman said, Britain must guarantee not to interfere in Japan's Far East policy anymore. As newspaper editorials said, foreign concessions in China have proven to be the biggest obstacle to Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia. Therefore, they should all be abolished. In all these statements, we don't need to analyze their meaning or clarify their impact. Even the most foolish person can directly understand their desires from their words. We only want to add one more word: these are all reports from various international news agencies in Tokyo in recent days. They must have been widely published in newspapers around the world in recent days. They are confirmed news. Therefore, it is said that not only are there no signs of easing, but the situation is becoming increasingly serious and even extreme. This is to be expected.

World public opinion, the governments and the public of various countries, are all expressing anxiety about the Tianjin situation. Some are deliberately showing restraint and slightly optimistic. On the contrary, in Britain, the desires publicly stated by Japan and the rejection of arbitration methods are all ignored. It is said that the matter will be resolved through diplomatic channels. It is also said that Japan does not want to cause new disputes in the Far East, and Britain is working hard to deal with European events, so it also wants to avoid disputes. Those who make this statement, need not be doubted for the source of their news or their nationality, nor need be praised for their extraordinary generosity, are insufficient to represent British public opinion, and even less can this be seen as a sign of easing. According to yesterday's final news from London, the British government has indeed considered implementing economic retaliation against Japan, strengthening practical assistance to China, and inviting the United States to join forces because of the Tianjin crisis. Members of Parliament are running around, and the authorities are nervous. The details of the events and people involved are as detailed as they are in today's newspapers. Indeed, there is a sense of a storm coming. If this is promoted, the coast of the East Sea may not be spared a temporary and painful sacrifice, but the various existing treaties related to the Far East will therefore be preserved, the two-year war will therefore be easier to end, international justice and human righteousness will therefore be restored, and Britain's prestige will therefore shine with its full glory.

Although the British government's proposed plans are as described above, and the inevitable outcome of promoting them is so, the actual outcome is still unknown. Why? Because action will depend upon deliberation, but deliberation may not lead to action. During this period, the devil, Japan, implemented a blockade of the Tianjin concession, especially favoring American expatriates, while the isolationist faction in America attempted to blockade President Roosevelt. As a result of the influence, the British policy was hesitant and courage was weakened. This is one devil far away. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union desperately need each other, both in Europe and in the Far East. Since this has been the case, the Tianjin crisis proves it even more so. However, the United Kingdom has a haunted heart when it comes to allying with the Soviet Union. ××××××××××××. As a result, the most helpful factor for the stability of the Far East is weakened by this mutual distrust. This is the second devil nearby. The United Kingdom has been publicizing various proposals against Japan recently. If they can be implemented, they will definitely be effective. However, the traditional British idea is that simply talking about them is enough to make Japan know what to fear. Therefore, implementation is not considered a necessary action, and publicity is considered an effective method. Although the British are the most practical nation in the world and despise politicians and propagandists who only talk and do not act, they are blinded by their traditional self-esteem, overestimating themselves, and always believe that the publicity they make is different from others because it has the backing of strength. The audience must know what to fear, and fear is effectiveness. How could the entire nation of Japan, in evaluating the United Kingdom, not be as high as the United Kingdom evaluates itself? Moreover, the military in power in Japan, in evaluating the United Kingdom, is not as high as the steady faction in Japan evaluates the United Kingdom. Because of this discrepancy, what the United Kingdom wants to achieve with its "proposals" is what Japan uses to...

### Prelude to the Major Battle in Southern Shanxi: Over ×10,000 Troops Converge on Yuanqu in Seven Routes; Hebei-× Feigns Movement to Restrain Our Troops in Shanxi

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] According to reports, × troops, under the cover of aircraft and warships, forcibly landed near Shantou on the morning of the day before yesterday and surrounded the city, pushing forward. The garrison troops resisted bravely. The fierce battle is still in progress. To understand the battle situation and the intentions of the × people, the reporter visited the military authorities and asked about everything. According to a spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission, the attack on Shantou by the × troops was expected. Our troops in the area had already made preparations and deployed strictly. Therefore, in addition to giving an unexpected blow to the landed × troops, they are still concentrating their forces and fighting fiercely with them near Shantou, striving to achieve our predetermined goal of consuming the × troops. As for the occupation of Shantou by the × troops, from a military point of view, it has no value. Shantou has long been a dead port. Everyone knows that the × side's claim to cut off our country's import of military equipment is nothing more than self-deception. Therefore, the occupation of the area by the × people is the same as the occupation of other coastal commercial ports. Their main attempt is not military, but economic. It is their main purpose to invade the rights and interests of various countries along the Pacific coast and drive out European and American forces in China, in order to realize their ambition to dominate East Asia and establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia." Since the × troops occupied Hainan Island, their active restlessness towards our coastal ports, such as Gulangyu, Shanghai, and Tianjin, shows that the invasion and occupation of Shantou also has no small international significance. In short, the recent major commotion of the × troops is just enough to prove that they are struggling in dire straits. Our troops will give × a severe blow in accordance with the pre-determined plan and promote the early collapse of the government.

× Offensive in Southeast Shanxi

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 21st] In the southern Shanxi area, □□15,000 troops and many aircraft have launched seven offensives against Zhongtiao Mountain in four routes since the 20th, attempting to converge on Yuanqu. The battle is fierce and unprecedented. It is estimated that 2,230,000 troops from Jiangxian County are invading Suicun and Dongjing Village in the east. Our troops are meeting them in battle. It is reported that 4,500 troops from Wenxi are invading Dianshang and Shangxia Yin (both southwest of Hengling Pass). Another force of 1,000 troops is joining forces with 1,000 troops from the south of Hengling Pass and harassing Yanjia Mountain. Our troops are bravely meeting them in battle, engaging in hand-to-hand combat several times, killing many × troops. They are currently engaged in a fierce battle with × troops in a certain area northwest of Gaoluo Town. 5,600 troops from Yanzhang, Xiaxian County, invaded the Yamaguchi area in separate routes on the morning of the 21st and engaged in fierce battles with our garrison troops on Tangwang Mountain, Heights 1526, Shengcheng Ridge, Fanjia Cha, Shangjia Bu, Fanjia Yao, and Shangxia Jiao Miao. This battle was the most intense. In the Tangwang Mountain Haocheng Ridge area, × troops relied on aircraft and artillery fire to launch a fierce attack on us. A senior military commander of our army personally went to the front line to supervise the battle, charging back and forth. Corpses piled up like mountains. The casualties of both sides were heavy after a day of battle. At the moment, we are firmly defending the area south of □□ and continuing the fierce battle. A certain unit of our army has divided and bypassed the flanks of the × army and will launch a large-scale encirclement and annihilation of the × army.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun told reporters today that Japan's occupation of Shantou has no impact on the war situation. However, one point is noteworthy: the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou is a prelude to an operation against Hong Kong. Because Japan will definitely take action against Hong Kong when the time is right.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 23rd] The × troops who launched a four-pronged attack on Yuanqu have had fierce battles on each front since the 20th. The enemy who invaded southward from Yanjia Mountain has gradually increased to 6,700. In order to avoid unnecessary losses in positional warfare, our army made a planned transfer. Gaoluo Town (north of Yuanqu) was captured on the night of the 20th. Yuanqu was captured on the morning of the 22nd.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 23rd] A certain military observer said that the purpose of the × troops' attack on Yuanqu is still to "sweep away" our strength in Zhongtiao Mountain and shake our guerrilla base in order to achieve their goal of opening up the Baicheng-Jin Highway and stabilizing the southeastern Shanxi border. Yuanqu has been captured several times, but it was forced to retreat in no more than half a month. Judging from past facts, it is expected that the army there will suffer another defeat.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 23rd] Approximately 10,000 troops from Wutai, Mengxian, Pinging, and Jingjing and Yangshan in western Hebei launched six attacks on our eastern Shanxi border starting on the 18th. On the 19th, 2-3,000 troops from Wutai, carrying several cannons and under the cover of three aircraft, attacked the areas of Yaotou Jiaochang, Chenjiazhuang, and Bailan Town (south of Wutai). Our troops fought bravely and the battle was extremely fierce. After holding out until evening, the × troops still failed to succeed. Until noon on the 20th, the × troops, because of the difficulty of advancing from the front, copied and attacked us from the left and right wings, attempting to encircle our army. At the same time, four aircraft wantonly bombed our villages and towns. At 3:00 p.m., they transferred to the highlands northeast of Bailan. The × troops then invaded Bailan and Wangcheng Village. Currently, × and we are engaged in a fierce battle.

Battles Reported on Shantou Periphery

[Reuters, Shantou, 23rd] Japanese troops completed their occupation of Shantou this morning. The retreating Chinese troops, in accordance with the scorched earth policy, set fires and destroyed the city walls. The flames blazed fiercely, and the sky was red for several miles. Countless warehouses and houses have been burned down and are still burning. The water plant has also been burned down and cut off.

[Dalu News Agency, Xingen Urgent News] After our army withdrew from Shantou, it is now guarding the defense line from Anbu to Jinsha City, and the Yixi line and Chaoyang form an outer ring surrounding Shantou. Japanese transport ships brought more than a thousand cavalrymen and many armored vehicles, preparing to break through our defense line and cut off the eastern trunk line. Our military and political authorities have now retreated to a certain place to command. The Japanese army, led by Iijima, launched a fierce attack on Anbu yesterday morning. Our defending troops stood their ground, dying to defend their position. The × troops suffered considerable casualties. A small number of × troops are now emerging northeast of Anbu. We are prepared and will definitely not let them succeed. According to reliable news, a certain army of ours has dispatched a large army in three routes to provide assistance. The vanguard troops arrived yesterday and adopted an arc-shaped encirclement line against the × troops in Shantou.

[Central News Agency, Chaoan, 23rd] The × troops who invaded Shantou launched a four-pronged attack on the 23rd: (1) They invaded Dahao from Donghu. After our fierce resistance, many × troops were killed. The × troops then reinforced several hundred and bombarded us with dense artillery fire. Due to terrain constraints, our army transferred to the west bank of Dahao in the evening and is engaged in a fierce battle with × troops. (2) More than 600 × troops invaded from Sijiwei and are currently engaged in a fierce battle with us in Xincun Yangcun (about four or five li northwest of Sijiwei). (3) In the Qilu Airport area in the eastern district of Shantou, the × troops used a combined attack by land, sea, and air, but our army still held the position and the × troops could not advance an inch. Shantou was still in our hands at 8:00 p.m. (4) The × infantry and cavalry who repeatedly circled and invaded Anbu were defeated and fled after our head-on attack. They then used more than 20 small motorboats at about 11:00 p.m. on the 22nd to carry several hundred × soldiers and attacked along the river. They were intercepted by our army in Yangxi (east of Guangbu). A mixed battle broke out between the two sides.

### Foreign Observers Talk About Guerilla Warfare in Shanxi: Japanese Like Fish in a Net, Wanting to Escape but Unable to; Our Armories Densely Distributed in Remote Areas

[Reuters, Chengdu Correspondence] A foreign neutral observer, after touring the northwest guerrilla area, returned to Chengdu. According to his words, "The Japanese army in Shanxi is like a big fish in a net. Although it can jump around, it cannot escape in the end. The railway in Shanxi is in the hands of the Japanese, but nothing is gained on both sides of the railway line. The east and west sides of the Japanese army are all guerrilla worlds. The combat experience of the guerrillas is becoming richer and their tactics are becoming more effective. They oppress the Japanese army whenever they have a chance. The Japanese army's combat has no important goals, so morale is low. The guerrillas often attack in small groups, luring the Japanese army away from its nest, and then destroying its fortifications and taking away military equipment. Sometimes, large groups of people sneak into the rear of the Japanese army, ambush secretly, and send someone to shout and challenge the Japanese army. When the Japanese army goes out to search, the challengers avoid entering the mountains, and the ambush troops rise up and annihilate the Japanese army. The guerrilla leaders know that they cannot drive out the × troops by relying solely on guerrilla tactics, but they are still confident that, over time, an industrialized country like Japan will perish. The guerrillas' supplies are quite abundant. Before I arrived in a certain place in Shanxi, the guerrillas suddenly removed about fourteen miles of railway tracks controlled by the Japanese and recast them into bullets and weapons in their small armories. These small armories are distributed throughout Shanxi and are numerous. After the Japanese army's armored vehicles and tanks are captured by the guerrillas, they are also used in the same way. The terrain in the guerrilla area is not suitable for armored vehicles. There are no national currencies in the front line of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces for fear of falling into the hands of the Japanese. The soldiers use provincial banknotes, which cannot be exchanged for foreign exchange even if they are obtained by the Japanese. Everything is very active in the 8th Route Army defense area. Road construction projects are being carried out in all directions, and the expenses are provided by the central government. There are no Soviet advisers in the 8th Route Army. This is one interesting fact I discovered.

### Soviet Aircraft Bomb Puppet Territory: Kwantung Army Communiqué

[Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd] A Kwantung Army communiqué received here today stated that Outer Mongolian and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly challenged the Japanese and "Manchukuo" forces. Since Monday, more than a dozen Soviet aircraft have repeatedly crossed the border and bombed various places in "Manchukuo". The "Manchukuo" government lodged a protest on Monday.

### Xiamen Japanese Consul Rejects: Three-Nation Protest: The Gulangyu Food Problem Has Not Been Resolved

[Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd] The consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Gulangyu recently jointly sent a note to the Japanese authorities, stating the serious situation of the lack of food in the concession. The Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen replied to this note in writing yesterday, saying that this situation is "unavoidable".

### British and American Warships Sail to Shantou: British Nationals Ordered to Stop Evacuation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Shanghai Foreign News: British and American warships berthed in Shantou have not agreed to Japan's request to leave the port. All foreign nationals have not evacuated. The American destroyer USS Pillsbury arrived in Shantou, while the American warship USS Pope and the British warship HMS Scout arrived this afternoon. In addition, the American destroyer USS Asheville is heading to Shantou from Hong Kong. According to sources in Shantou, the Japanese side has announced that warships and other ships of various countries and nationals of various countries must leave Shantou today. The United Kingdom had evacuated some women and children, but stopped slightly after receiving instructions from Shanghai, because the British authorities firmly believe that once they evacuate, it will cause difficulties when returning to Shantou in the future, as in other places in China.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Shanghai News: British Consul General Philip recently sent a note to the Japanese authorities on the matter of the Japanese side's request for British nationals and British warships in Shantou to withdraw before 1:00 p.m. today, submitting a reply, the general meaning of which is the same as the reply from U.S. Commander of Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, briefly stating that British nationals in Shantou have the full right to remain there, Shantou is a commercial port, and British ships also have the right to sail there to engage in trade. The Japanese side's request is difficult to accept.

### Situation of Foreign Nationals in Tianjin Increasingly Difficult: British Nationals Forced to Strip Naked; Soviet Women Suffer the Most Insults

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Tianjin News: The Japanese side continues to discriminate against British nationals and has imposed particularly brutal behavior on British nationals yesterday. Yesterday morning, three British nationals, one was Dan Wesi, one was Muse, and the other was Laut, planned to enter Special District One. When Dan Wesi arrived at the blockade line, the Japanese side approved his passage without obstruction. However, when Muse and Laut stepped forward to wait for inspection, the Japanese army immediately asked, "Are you British?" The two immediately replied, "Yes." The Japanese army immediately ordered them to take off their clothes in front of the wooden fence in front of a large group of Chinese women and children, stark naked. The search of the two men's clothes was especially thorough. The Japanese soldiers also ordered Laut to open his mouth, and Laut immediately did so. The Japanese soldiers ordered him to open it wider. Laut, having already opened it to the maximum extent, feared that it would be difficult to obey. The Japanese sentry immediately placed Laut's pass in his mouth, forcing him to open it wider. Laut's hair was also pulled off by Japanese soldiers. After the Japanese soldiers checked the clothes of the two men, they also ordered each of them to spread their legs and searched back and forth for a quarter of an hour before allowing them to pass. British Consul Jameson has protested to the Japanese side about this. According to reliable news, there was another incident of Japanese soldiers brutally insulting British nationals yesterday. Five British engineers and workers from the Beining Railway, including Chief Engineer Willis and Accounting Director Burton, planned to go to the office in the public service room yesterday via the International Bridge. Those traveling with them were French nationals. When they arrived at the blockade line, the Japanese soldiers immediately approved the French nationals to pass, but the five British nationals were all ordered to take off their clothes by the Japanese soldiers and were thoroughly searched. A large number of Chinese people were also present at the time. Also, a British worker from Magalli, yesterday while walking through the Ma Baodao blockade line, was ordered by Japanese sentries to take off his clothes and searched naked before being allowed to pass. Two five-yuan French banknotes beside him were also taken away by Japanese soldiers. Also, Ms. Duan Tesheng, a British national, planned to pass through the blockade line from the British Concession to her residence outside the concession yesterday. After being searched by a Chinese female police officer, Duan Tesheng planned to return home. Unexpectedly, the Japanese sentry ordered her to take off her clothes. Upon hearing this, Duan Tesheng ran wildly back to the British Concession.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 23rd] According to eyewitnesses, approximately 200 Soviet citizens residing in Dagu were subjected to even more unbearable insults when the Japanese army inspected them, especially Soviet women.

### ×Anti-British Rally: The British Concession on Alert

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A foreign dispatch from Tianjin reports that an anti-British rally will be held in the occupied area this afternoon. The authorities of the British Concession are apprehensive that this may lead to violent acts of assault on the Concession. Therefore, since this morning, they have intensified security within the Concession. At the same time, special forces have been dispatched to the vegetable market to protect the merchants and residents there, because the vegetable vendors in the market have been intimidated by Japanese and Korean individuals, who have threatened that if they continue to supply vegetables to foreigners, harm will come to them and their families. They have reported this situation to the British authorities, so special personnel have been sent to protect them today. No beef is sold in the British Concession today, and chicken, fish, and other fresh vegetables are also lacking. The sausage workshops in the Concession have decided to temporarily suspend business due to a shortage of raw materials. According to foreigners entering the Concession today, inspections have become stricter, and all identification documents are being closely examined. Several German residents were also checked by the Japanese army today.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the Japanese anti-British propaganda is intensifying, even to the point of personally attacking the leaders of the British community here. Moreover, those engaged in this propaganda are not limited to Chinese newspapers; Russian newspapers are also involved. Anti-British propaganda can be seen everywhere within the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and the Japanese and their employed Chinese henchmen are sparing no effort in promoting it. The Japanese government-controlled Chinese newspapers publish lengthy articles every day, depicting how Britain has committed all kinds of evils in China, thereby urging the Chinese people to oppose Britain unanimously. The newspapers also demand that the British hand over the British Concession and state that all Chinese should immediately cease trading with British merchants.

### Female Guerrilla Leader, Cai Jinhua, Rumored to Have Married a Military Doctor

[This Newspaper, Shanghai, 20th Dispatch] According to foreign news, Ms. Cai Jinhua, famous throughout the country for commanding guerrilla forces in the Taihu area, is rumored to have recently married a military doctor surnamed Wu. It is said that Cai and her female comrade, Ms. Zhang, disguised themselves as peasant women and infiltrated the city of Wuxing in Zhejiang to post slogans. They did this for three days and, thanks to local farmers hiding them, they did not encounter any accidents. Before they left, they used four hand grenades to "treat" the camp of the * army. The * pursued them out of the camp, and Cai was unfortunately shot in the leg, but still managed to escape. She sought medical treatment at a rear hospital in Ningguo, Anhui, where she developed feelings for Dr. Wu and eventually married him. It is said that Cai's former husband was also a guerrilla leader who was killed by the *. It is said that Wu and she share the same aspirations and will work together to drive out the * invaders.

[Reuters, Shanghai Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the increasing number of Japanese residents in the International Settlement, is offering cash rewards to British and other foreign employees in the police force to learn Japanese.

### British Financial Expert Discusses Chinese and Japanese Finance: The Steps Taken by China Show Great Foresight; Japan's Cash and Foreign Exchange Are About to Be Exhausted

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Today, financial writers have made detailed discussions on the currency system of the Far East. All writers agree that China's strict measures to escape the legal tender are necessary. At the same time, the bankers completely deny the rumors that the "equalization fund" has consumed too much. Some bankers believe that the Equalization Fund Committee has great foresight and that the strategy it has adopted is sufficient to reject speculators. The Times said, "Under the current situation, managing China's foreign exchange and currency system is more difficult than in any other country in the world. It is amazing that China can maintain its currency system and foreign exchange without taking more strict restrictions!" The Financial News said: "Japan is stepping up its currency control, which is not surprising, according to Far Eastern people in London. Japan's cash and foreign exchange are being consumed very quickly, and they are about to run out."

[Reuters, Shanghai, 23rd] The Japanese yen continues to fall. Buyers can now purchase one Japanese yen for only 97 cents in Chinese national currency.

### General Association of Young Journalists Sends Condolences to Shanghai Press

[National Salvation Society, Chongqing Dispatch] The General Association of Young Journalists of China, in view of the efforts and unwavering spirit of Shanghai friends and journalists struggling under the terror policies of * puppets, is inspiring the whole country. A telegram of condolence and encouragement was sent from Chongqing the other day. The full text is as follows:

To the Shanghai Branch and All Unyielding News Colleagues in Shanghai:

In the past twenty-odd months, the resolute support for resistance and national construction and the relentless attacks on the traitorous regime by the three million residents of Greater Shanghai are due to the hard work style and the firm and accurate political leadership of the comrades. The glorious history of the comrades has been recorded on the indelible two pages in the course of the Chinese people's war of liberation. The excellent style of the comrades has set the most exemplary model among the new Chinese journalists. We would like to represent more than a thousand friends across China and call on all progressive journalists to pay our highest respect and sincere condolences to you.

Naturally, since Wang Ni arrived in Shanghai, using his past position and a large number of big and small traitors surrounding Wang Ni, such as Zhou Fohai, Chen Bijun, Tao**, Gao Zongwu, Chu**, etc., the comrades' work will encounter greater hardships and difficulties, and the comrades' environment will fall into greater dangers and uncertainties. We are always in remembrance of the safety and lives of the comrades, but sacrificing for the national liberation war is the highest morality and the minimum belief of the Chinese people today. In order to combat the shameless words and absurd propaganda of the * bandits and to stop the rise of all traitorous theories, we must overcome any difficulties, step over any hardships, and advance forward! Under the subject of the Chinese nation's liberation war, under the subject of striving for world peace and human happiness, we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and pay any price of blood and flesh. We must fight to the end with * bandits and traitors!

Comrades! The heavier the oppression of us by the * bandits and traitors, the more it proves the glory and merits of our past history that cannot be buried. Today, on the eve of approaching dawn, we ask the comrades in Shanghai's press to grit their teeth, make persistent efforts, and consolidate our southeastern news fortress. We must not hesitate to strike at the rise of traitorous theories at any cost. We call on all progressive journalists in China and peace-loving press colleagues all over the world to be the support behind the comrades. From today, we must first call on the journalists under the banner of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association to do everything possible to support the comrades!

Comrades, the slogan we shout is: Do everything possible to consolidate Shanghai's anti-Japanese and national salvation press fortress, and do not hesitate to strike at the rise of traitors at any sacrifice. We respectfully pay tribute to the victory of the War of Resistance and National Construction!

Chinese Youth Journalists Association

### Returned Overseas Chinese from the United States Talk About the Anti-Japanese Movement in the United States

Americans

[Min Ge She Dispatch] Ninety-nine percent of Americans sympathize with China's resistance against Japan. Usually, when they hear the news of "China's victory," they are overjoyed. Otherwise, even if it is a small defeat, they will feel as frustrated as the Chinese.

However, since the beginning of China's resistance against Japan, 54% of Japan's military raw materials are still supplied by the United States. Isn't this contradicting the original intentions of the Americans and helping the aggressors? Therefore, the "China Aid Council" and the "Friends of the Chinese People," two groups that regularly promote aid to China, are actively engaged in the movement to boycott Japanese goods. At the same time, they organized a "Committee to Boycott Japanese Goods" to undertake this work.

The director of this association is Robert Norton, the former editor of "Today China." Under his enthusiastic and capable leadership, much has been gained over the past year, but the intended purpose has not been achieved. Upon review, it was found that the previous work line was wrong:

Because of "boycotting Japanese goods", many American friends bought more goods from German and Italian aggressors under the belief of this slogan. This is indeed contrary to their "peace movement" and is opposed by the Jews. Therefore, from the second year onwards, the work line of this association became more active and has progressed from "boycotting Japanese goods" to boycotting the goods of aggressor countries.

According to the government report last December, only one of the twelve aircraft factories had a suspicion of exporting aircraft to Japan. This spring, the owner of this factory voluntarily announced that he had long stopped exporting aircraft to Japan (here, U.S. Secretary of State Hull's warning to manufacturers last July was a direct cause); and the export of raw materials to Japan has also been greatly reduced (here, the U.S. Department of Commerce's warning to merchants last summer that Japan's reserves are empty and that cash is required for delivery was a direct cause). All this proves that the effect of this movement is constantly increasing.

The United States cannot provide further assistance to China and suppress Japan because the "Neutrality Act" is in the way. Therefore, amending the "Neutrality Act" has become a consensus among most Americans. This spring, in response to this demand, under the leadership of former Secretary of State Stimson, a "Committee of Americans Who Do Not Participate in the Japanese Aggressor Movement" was formed to devote itself to this movement.

This association passed a concrete plan this year: if their work cannot use political means to amend the "Neutrality Act" before the congressional adjournment in July this year, they will implement an embargo on all military supplies and raw materials to the aggressors with the power of the masses. Using this method, after a considerable period of time, I believe that the purpose can also be achieved. On March 6 this year, the mayor of Akutoriya City in Northwest America automatically ordered that all industrial raw materials and military supplies could not be shipped to Japan through this port. This example shows the bright future of this movement. The masses of many other seaports are also actively carrying out this movement.

Overseas Chinese

Overseas Chinese resolutely advocate resistance and support resistance. Although they are all very loyal, their observations and actions are very correct. For example, Wang Ni, this political "prostitute", does not seem to be liked and sympathized by overseas Chinese in the United States. It is really pitiful for Wang Ni. The newspapers he used to run abroad are now not only not his mouthpieces, but also the vanguard of "villaging Wang". For example, the New York "Minqi Daily" used to be founded by him as the backstage boss, but before the "Yan Dian", when Wang Ni secretly interfered with "peace", it was the "Minqi Daily" that fired the first shot at Wang Ni. After the "Yan Dian" was published, the "Minqi Daily" stood on the position of the nation-state and attacked Wang Ni until he was "completely bruised". The sign of this "Minqi Daily" was originally Wang Ni's inscription, but it has been demolished since this spring.

Overseas Chinese's national salvation organizations were initially very scattered, but with the progress of the war of resistance, the organizations have gradually become more advanced and consolidated. From the end of 1937 (four or five months after the start of the war), the entire U.S. Overseas Chinese established three supreme organizations for resisting Japan and saving the country:

(1) The All-American Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Fundraising General Association: The association's address is in New York. All anti-Japanese national salvation work of the East American Overseas Chinese is led and directed by this organization.

(2) Volunteer Donation Association: The association's address is in San Francisco, which is the highest organization for anti-Japanese national salvation of the West American Overseas Chinese.

(3) Anti-Japanese National Salvation Fundraising Association: The association's address is in Chicago, which is the general agency for the anti-Japanese national salvation work of the Central American Overseas Chinese.

In addition to this, every small port with traces of overseas Chinese has organizations such as the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Support Association", which regularly undertakes the responsibility of resisting Japan and teaching the country.

Japanese Overseas

The invasion of China launched by the Japanese warlords this time not only did not benefit the Japanese people, but also increased their infinite suffering. This situation is the same at home and abroad. Therefore, the anti-war sentiment among Japanese overseas in the United States is also very high. The "Japanese Labor Association" leads this anti-war movement. This association has more than two hundred members.

Since the "September 18th Incident", their core members have joined the "Friends of the Chinese People", and they are constantly working to propagandize against the invasion of China. They often consult with members and some Japanese who truly love Japan to petition and demonstrate at the Japanese Consulate. At that time, the name they used was "Japanese Patriotic Association".

Once, the leader of this association,□□□, gave a street speech against Japan and in support of China. An American old woman asked him, "You are Japanese, why do you promote anti-Japan?" He replied, "I love the country." Then he gave a moving speech, saying that the invasion of China would ruin Japan's national fortune, and that only by opposing the war and helping China's resistance against Japan could the Japanese people have a way out.

The most courageous in this work is the Japanese female writer Ms. Matsui. She participated in all the work against the war of aggression and often gave speeches at various venues and streets; when she spoke passionately, she must have tears in her eyes, and the audience was moved. Therefore, the effect is also the greatest. After each speech, she must donate a sum of money to help China. The Japanese government has ordered her to be arrested and killed, but under the protection of justice, she is still working hard.

Koreans

For decades, Koreans have been subjected to cruel oppression and rule by * people and are always looking forward to liberation. Only when the Chinese nation is liberated can they and the Taiwanese be liberated. They understand this truth, so they are very sympathetic and helpful to our resistance against Japan.

In order to help China resist Japan in order to seek a way out for their own ethnic group, Koreans merged many small groups and organized the "Korean China Aid Federation."

In the past two years, they have done many things to help China resist Japan, especially in the performance of donations. They are continuing to work hard, and we believe that all Koreans will come into China's embrace in the future! [The above is a conversation between Mr. Zhu Yaoqu, an overseas Chinese living in the United States, recorded by Lin Lingjun]

### Chamberlain Expresses Patience While Awaiting Japanese Repentance; Members of the House of Commons Ask Questions One After Another, Unanimously Requesting Positive Action

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The British government previously inquired to the Japanese government about the Japanese side's final attitude towards the Tianjin incident, but has not yet received a reply from Tokyo. According to reliable sources, the British side is now planning to move the location of the negotiations on the Tianjin incident from Tianjin to Tokyo. At the same time, the British side plans to adopt various measures of economic sanctions against Japan, which have already been drafted. It is heard that the Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs Committee will initiate a discussion on the Tianjin incident by member of parliament Molein, and then send a delegation to visit Prime Minister Chamberlain to petition. British people from all walks of life and members of various political parties have gradually felt that if the British government delays in taking resolute action, it is tantamount to encouraging the Japanese side to continue its atrocities. Not only will it not achieve satisfactory results, but it will also lead to aggressive acts elsewhere. Currently, British newspapers list the return of the British King and the events in Shantou and Swatow as equally important news. As for the matter of the Swatow Japanese naval authorities issuing an ultimatum to Britain and the United States, official reports have not yet been received here. The local authorities are currently handling the evacuation of British women and children from Swatow, but British officials believe that once the British expatriates withdraw from Swatow, it will be difficult to return in the future, because this is the situation elsewhere.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Today, in the British House of Commons, someone asked whether the Prime Minister would report on the situation of British expatriates in Tianjin. Chamberlain replied, "The perishable food supplies in the British concession in Tianjin are only about 10 percent of the normal supply. The British authorities are considering ways to remedy the lack of food. However, non-perishable foods, such as rice flour and wheat noodles, are still abundant. You must have all heard reports of the insults suffered by the British in Tianjin. Foreign Secretary Halifax has met with the Japanese Ambassador to present the negotiations on such incidents." Member of Parliament Adams asked whether the Prime Minister would notify Tokyo that this kind of action to insult the British would have a serious impact on Japanese expatriates in all British territories. Chamberlain replied, "Foreign Secretary Halifax will clearly express to the Japanese Ambassador the intolerable insults we have thought about." Then Henderson requested an explanation of the situation in Swatow after the Japanese side issued the ultimatum. The Prime Minister replied that he had not yet received official information, but according to news reports, the Japanese side seemed to have withdrawn its original intention and made some concessions. Bellington asked whether the Prime Minister was considering taking retaliatory steps immediately. Chamberlain replied, "No, I don't think it has reached such a serious stage." Halechi asked whether the Prime Minister knew that the British people were in high spirits and did their best to support the Prime Minister's words on dealing with the intolerable insults. Chamberlain did not respond to this.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the situation in the Far East in the House of Commons today, saying, "The British government has made preparations to evacuate British women and children in Swatow. The necessary merchant ships have now gone to Swatow. The Japanese naval authorities have agreed to facilitate the evacuation of British expatriates in Swatow and will also respect British industries. As for the situation in Tianjin, it has not changed. Obstacles to the entry and exit of British people still require strict searches. Although the import of food into the concession has been delayed, it is still sufficient. Many British expatriates in Tianjin are now going to the beach to escape the summer heat. The British authorities have prepared everything for them, and the first batch of personnel have already set off. The British warship "Saint Weiji" arrived in Tianjin on the 20th, and the "Loweistodoff" ship, which was originally planned to go elsewhere, is still berthed there." Then, Labor Party member Greenwood asked whether the Prime Minister would take stronger action in view of the repeated occurrence of invasive acts to express the British government's disgust for this. In his reply, Chamberlain asked Greenwood to relieve his mind, saying that the British government is paying great attention to this matter. As far as the Tianjin issue is concerned, the situation is extremely serious, but the British government still hopes that it can be resolved locally. If negotiations fail, the British government will consider further measures. Conservative Party member Milner asked if the Prime Minister had seen the Japanese side's news that British Ambassador Craig had visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and asked him to show great mercy and suspend the Japanese side's actions. The Prime Minister replied that it could be seen as fabricated just from its appearance. Labor Party member Beck said that this kind of infringement on the rights and interests of foreigners is actually a prelude to the monopolization of the Far East. Chamberlain said that he hoped that the facts in the future would not be as Beck expected, otherwise the situation would be extremely serious.

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported in the House of Commons yesterday the latest news on the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, generally meaning that there was no progress in the Japanese restrictions. Mr. Zhang also said that the Japanese army landed near Shantou on the morning of the 21st. The Japanese side has agreed to respect British property. The British warship "Scut" has just arrived in Shantou. Another ship, "Sloot," arrived there today. The food problem on Gulangyu is getting worse. The food source from Daman and the mainland has been cut off. However, third-country ships are currently having no difficulty buying food.

[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] The Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs Committee held a non-opening conference this afternoon to discuss the Far East issue. They immediately listened to the report of Member of Parliament Molein and then discussed the Tianjin incident. The details of the process have not been published.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Times said in its editorial today, "The Japanese army's occupation of Swatow will not cause serious international problems, because there is a foreign concession there. The purpose of the Japanese army's move is very clear. Swatow is the only important port in China currently. The Japanese army's occupation of it is intended to cut off the region's foreign trade and the supply of military supplies from abroad." Then, Chamberlain's statement on the Tianjin incident was mentioned, saying, "If the negotiations on the Tianjin incident do not achieve satisfactory results, the government will consider further steps." The newspaper commented, "Public opinion is welcoming the government to provide assurances that it has been studying retaliatory steps in the nine days since Tianjin was blocked."

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Famous political commentator Dunardi wrote in "Le Temps" today, "Recent events in the Far East will make the United States participate in the execution of the German and Italian instructions and destroy the honor of the American flag. It has made the United States participate in the defense of democratic interests in the Far East. The German and Italian sides may not be happy about this kind of action by Japan."

### France Endeavors to Improve Franco-Spanish Relations, Prepares to Return Spanish Gold Reserves

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 23rd] According to well-informed sources here, the French Ambassador to Spain, Pétain, visited Finance Minister Reynaud on Thursday and held lengthy talks. It is heard that the main issue of the talks was to discuss the return of Spanish gold reserves in France and French loans to Spain. It is said that the French government has now decided to accelerate the return of the gold reserves to Spain and recognizes that loans to Spain are necessary. Therefore, it can restore initiative and urge the French government to accept the Franco-Spanish exchange. The general public recognizes that Spain's demands and the steps taken to improve Franco-Spanish relations, changed to Ambassador Pétain is the person in charge of the two issues.

### Shantou Situation: Hull Is Calm, No Plans to Negotiate With Tokyo for the Time Being

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Secretary of State Hull said at a press conference a few days ago that he maintains a calm attitude towards the situation in Swatow and that the State Department does not intend to negotiate with Tokyo on this matter for the time being.

### German Side Propaganda Large Quantities of Military Supplies Transported to Poland

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 23rd] According to reliable sources here, several ships have recently arrived at Gdynia Port, fully loaded with war materials. The Polish ship "Lublin" recently transported a large number of military weapons. The American ship "Momapu" also unloaded a large number of light tanks, aircraft, and aircraft engines on the 21st of this month. In addition, several British ships also arrived, carrying a large amount of goods. The ships unload their cargo at night. It is said that the goods are actually heavy and light artillery tanks.

### British King and Queen Return to London: Enthusiastic Welcome from the Public and Loyalty Oaths from Parliament

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The HMS Queen Mary arrived in Southampton yesterday. The two princesses boarded the destroyer HMS "Cope Thorne" to greet them, and dined with the King and Queen. This was the most enjoyable event of the entire trip for the royal couple. They chatted happily about their travels. After the meal, they released colorful balloons decorating the dining room to entertain the welcoming crowds. When the Queen Mary sailed into Southampton, the crowds cheered wildly. Notably, two thousand children, representing youth organizations in Southampton, greeted the King and Queen with cheers. As the King and Queen disembarked, the children led the cheers. There was a slight drizzle in Southampton, but by the time they arrived at Waterloo Station at 5:20 PM, the sun was shining brightly and the weather was excellent. Both houses of Parliament announced a recess minutes before the arrival of the King and Queen in London, so that all members could see the King pass through Parliament Square. The area and the streets along the route were extremely crowded. Several postal workers carrying heavy packages were unable to move through the crowd and had to be helped by the police. The ceremony upon the arrival of the King and Queen at Waterloo was simple. The King spoke with Prime Minister Chamberlain, and together with the Queen and Queen Mary, walked past the lined-up cabinet members and foreign diplomats. Special attention was given to Ambassador Kennedy of the United States. The King and Queen then rode in an open carriage, its top removed by Pippen, through the streets, heading towards Buckingham Palace. The crowds along the route waved British and American flags, as well as banners with the words "Welcome Home," and cheered enthusiastically. The King and Queen smiled and waved in acknowledgment. As they passed the members of Parliament, the parliamentarians cheered, waving top hats and handkerchiefs. Westminster Abbey also rang its bells in welcome, and ships on the Thames River sounded their sirens. As the royal party passed the monument, the King raised his hand in salute, and the Queen and princesses bowed. After leaving the monument, the King and his party entered the final stretch of their journey to Buckingham Palace, with the crowds cheering thunderously. Approximately 50,000 people were waiting in front of Buckingham Palace to welcome the King and Queen, some of whom had been there since 8:30 AM, when the two princesses went to the Queen Mary. After the King and his party entered the palace, the crowd shouted, "We want to see our King!" The King and Queen and the two princesses appeared on the balcony at 6:15 PM to thank the welcoming crowd. However, the crowd did not leave. The King and Queen reappeared on the balcony at 8:30 PM for five minutes. Prime Minister Chamberlain entered the palace at 9:20 PM to meet with the King, but the crowd was unaware, as they were all looking up at the balcony, hoping to see the King and Queen again.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain proposed in the House of Commons to present an address to the King, expressing the Lower House's unwavering loyalty to the King upon his return from his trip to America. He stated, "The King and Queen were warmly welcomed by the masses wherever they traveled, which indicates the people's love and affection, beyond all expectations. Thanks to newspapers, radios, and newsreels, we, although remaining in the country, were able to learn the details of our King's travels. The King's travels not only demonstrate the great significance of the monarchy to the empire, but also demonstrate the genuine emotions transformed from the abstract concept of the monarchy. When the King and Queen arrived in the United States, they received a grand welcome from the American president and people, the enthusiasm of which was unprecedented. We are deeply moved by the warmth of the American government and people, which is due to the King and Queen's own impressive virtues, as well as the deep sympathy and friendship of the American people towards the empire." Labor MP Greenwood seconded the proposal, saying, "If President Roosevelt were to break precedent and visit England or a British dominion, he would receive the same enthusiastic welcome." This remark was met with great applause. Greenwood stated that the King and Queen's visit to America has opened a new chapter in Anglo-American relations, proving the depth of blood ties and demonstrating the friendship of people under the banner of freedom and democracy. The Prime Minister's motion was then passed amidst enthusiastic applause. The Upper House also passed a similar motion.

### Franco-Japanese Trade Agreement

Signed in Tokyo

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] France will sign a trade agreement with Japan in Tokyo on Friday, rebuilding a trade balance favorable to France. The agreement adjusts the situation caused by Japan's recent sharp reduction in French imports and the French implementation of a licensing system for Japanese imports on May 23rd.

### Duke of Windsor to Visit Spain

[Haitong News Agency, Barcelona, 23rd] According to local newspapers, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor will visit Spain in approximately July.

### Christians Worldwide to Pray for China; Anti-Aggression League in England Demands Government Take Immediate Action to Stop Japanese Aggression

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The Archbishop of York and twenty bishops have jointly issued a circular letter, asking Christians of all countries to pray for China on July 9th. The original text of the letter was published in the newspapers today. The British General Assembly of the International Anti-Aggression League also passed a resolution, requesting the government to take diplomatic and economic action immediately, without waiting for the expressions of other countries, to stop the aggressive actions of violent Japan. When Britain implements sanctions against Japan, it should act jointly with members of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty signatories.

### Japan's Public Debt Continues to Increase

[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Japanese government has issued a total of ¥6,300,500,000 (approximately £370,000,000) in war bonds. Within this fiscal year (ending March 31 next year), ¥4,505,860,000 (approximately £265,000,000) in bonds remain to be issued.

### French Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Foreign Policy

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 23rd] According to an official announcement here on Thursday evening, a meeting of ministers will be convened on Saturday, chaired by French President Lebrun. It is reported that the meeting is specifically to discuss various foreign policy issues.

### New Anglo-French Proposals Unacceptable to Soviet Union; Discrepancies in Information; Talks May Be Delayed Again

[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Regarding the proposed agreement to discuss the Anglo-Franco-Soviet treaty, representatives of the three countries held another round of negotiations at the Kremlin today for half an hour. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin, British Envoy Strang, and the ambassadors of Britain and France were all in attendance. It is reported that Molotov has informed the British and French representatives, stating that the new proposals are still unacceptable. Unofficial sources believe that the new Anglo-French proposals still fail to satisfy the Soviet Union's insistence on concrete guarantees for the Baltic states. However, in the current situation, it cannot be said that the negotiations have broken down. The results of the talks have been separately reported to London and Paris. Before new instructions arrive, the trilateral talks may be temporarily postponed.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, the message released from Moscow, saying the latest advice Britain had obtained did not make any progress to the Anglo-Soviet talks is not entirely thought of in the London diplomatic circles; The British proposal, to the Soviet proposal, had already made major concessions in principle, even if the wording had not been specified, it is believed that the Soviet Union is persisting with its attitude, or there are other internal reasons, rather than merely issues with the style, only the correct form of explanation is too early in coming; Anglo-Soviet talks had never been expected to progress quickly, and now its future will be extended; At the same time, London had not received any formal confirmation that Molotov had rejected the British proposals, in the current situation, the report from the British Ambassador Seeds must be waited for, before Britain can make any further proposals.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 23rd] According to the "Daily Express," British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds, and Strang, head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, will soon be instructed by the government to resolve the points opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov: (1) avoiding mentioning the names of the Baltic states in the agreement; (2) regarding countries with special important relationships to one of the contracting parties, the contracting parties should consult each other before providing assistance under the agreement.

German Industrial Delegation Prepares to Go to Moscow

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Several key German industrialists are now sending a delegation to Moscow, with the aim of restoring German-Soviet trade relations. It is reliably learned that the delegation is tasked with presenting a ten-year credit loan of 750,000,000 marks to the Soviet Union, to be used by the Soviet Union to purchase German goods. At the same time, Germany is also prepared to purchase large quantities of raw materials from the Soviet Union, mainly wood, leather, and oil. Foreign political circles believe that the purpose of this move is to undermine Britain's policy towards Moscow.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] Germany has proposed establishing a ten-year credit purchase agreement with the Soviet Union. Observers here believe that Germany intends to resist Britain's alliance plan.

### Greek King to Visit Italy

[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 23rd] This morning's local newspapers reported that King George of Greece will visit Italy next week and attend the wedding of Duke Spoleto and Princess Irene of Greece. The King will arrive in Venice on his yacht "Hellas" on the 28th of this month.

### Anglo-French Naval Conference in Singapore: Both Countries Attach Great Importance; Close Liaison Achieved Among Britain, America, and France

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] British and French Far East naval and military commanders will hold a meeting in Singapore on the 22nd. Naval circles here comment that this meeting was decided to be held long ago and was not convened due to the Tianjin Incident. However, its importance has been increased by the Tianjin situation. Since the Tianjin Incident has become a question of naval balance between the Far East navies and the Japanese navy, the combined fleet strength of Britain and France in the Far East is not sufficient to cope with the Japanese navy. It must rely on the United States to compete with it. Although the United States has no representatives attending the meeting, there is no doubt that the Singapore naval base will be available for use by the U.S. fleet in the event of war. Furthermore, although Japan is making every effort to avoid offending the United States, the recent incidents have proved that a local resolution of the Tianjin case is not what Japan wants. Currently, its intention is actually directed at all foreigners, which is inconsistent with the assurances provided by the Tokyo government. If this view is given time, the United States will also agree. A glimpse can be seen in Hull's recent remarks. The Japanese naval authorities' request for foreign ships to leave Shantou has been rejected by Yarnell, which shows that the United States has now taken decisive steps to accommodate the wishes of Britain and France. Once Britain, France, and the United States fully maintain their joint relationship, the current situation should change. What the Singapore conference is discussing is how this joint relationship should be technically developed.

### International Labor Conference Concludes Discussion of Report

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Geneva, 22nd - The International Labor Conference concluded its discussion of the report submitted by the Director-General of the Labor Bureau this morning. Director-General of the Labor Bureau, Weintraub, in his speech, quoted Chinese representative Li Pingheng as saying, "The diligence of the general public should be used to promote human happiness, not to manufacture armaments and war. We must never forget the suffering of China's 59 million workers due to the war. We should do our best to relieve them."

Short Comments

### "Friends of the Wounded"

Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, in order to reduce the suffering of wounded soldiers, recently allocated 20,000 yuan from the慰勞總會 to organize "Friends of the Wounded" groups to serve in various war zones. We believe this move is extremely important because passively alleviating the suffering of wounded soldiers contains the positive and great significance of boosting morale and close cooperation between the military and civilians.

The War of Resistance is nearly two years old, and we have relied on the bloody battles of millions of soldiers on the front lines to overcome the dangers of national subjugation. We have relied on the generous sacrifices, broken legs, and arms of the soldiers on the front lines to see the light of future independent and free victory. We should expand assistance to the families of fallen soldiers, and we should respect and cherish the wounded soldiers even more. Moreover, the road ahead for the War of Resistance and national construction is still arduous!

Although we have been spared from the killing and plundering of × people's artillery fire, can we turn a blind eye to our motherland? We hope that all overseas Chinese communities will rise up and support Madame Chiang's move, organizing "Friends of the Wounded" groups in various places. At the same time, we hope that experienced and wealthy leaders in the overseas Chinese community will generously donate to build a cause!

### Important Statistics

According to a military expert's research on the recent × Qing results, there are the following noteworthy results:

(1) × has mobilized 2 million troops to invade China;

(2) × has suffered more than 1 million casualties, including 300,000 deaths;

(3) Currently, there are 31 × divisions operating in China, distributed in North China, Central China, and South China (excluding puppet troops);

(4) ×'s war expenses for invading China:

1937: 254 million yen;

1938: 485 million yen;

1939: 527 million yen.

These statistics are mostly based on public figures from the military and political authorities of both countries. Although they cannot be said to be absolutely accurate, they are generally credible, as they do not exaggerate or underestimate excessively. From this, we can see the significant losses the × army has suffered, especially the increasing burden of military spending! At the same time, we can also see the threat that our soldiers in the north and south battlefields pose to the anti-Japanese ×. The more days our War of Resistance lasts, the more damage it inflicts on the Japanese ×! Furthermore, we can see how today's advocates of peace and compromise are helping the Japanese × save themselves from danger, helping the Japanese × replenish their strength to destroy all of China!

### Battle for the Baltic Sea

— Translated by Shi Chang

"Outline of the Future European War

Recently, we have often heard about the status of the Baltic countries and the relationship with Germany's 'advance' policy. However, general discussions have focused on political actions, and there does not seem to be a thorough discussion of the strategic importance of these countries.

If a war breaks out in Europe one day—a war between aggressor and anti-aggressor countries—then the military position of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia will be absolutely important. It is very clear that if Germany advances into the Baltic Sea, the Soviet Union will not remain indifferent and will definitely implement the defense of the Baltic countries, because these countries are the Soviet Union's natural fortress in terms of terrain.

In a major war, the Soviet fleet will occupy a very important part. No one can know the strength of the Soviet navy; it is an absolute secret. However, there is no doubt that the Soviet fleet is strong enough and cannot be compared with its strength in the last World War. Excluding the Black Sea and Far East fleets, the Soviet Union's naval strength in the Gulf of Finland area is as follows: two 23,000-ton battleships, equipped with 10-inch guns; six well-equipped, modern cruisers; about 15 destroyers; more than 60 elite submarines; and 12 large motorboats. Such a navy, led by capable commanders, is very powerful. Even when dealing with the German fleet, it can achieve good results. Moreover, the German fleet must maintain considerable strength in the North Sea.

Berlin boasts that the North Sea coast is already guaranteed not to be invaded, because in the past two years, from Sylt in the north to Boulogne in the south, unbreakable fortresses have been built. However, modern knowledgeable naval strategists all agree that even with very strong defenses along the coast, it is impossible to completely avoid external attacks. Therefore, although Germany's western defenses are strong, they are also at risk of being attacked. Moreover, in order to maintain the continuation of the war, Germany must maintain trade with the Scandinavian countries, especially Sweden.

In the last World War, Germany was able to sustain itself for four years. The main factors were: (1) Germany constantly transported large quantities of magnets from Sweden to manufacture military equipment and ammunition; (2) Jewish professor Haber's new invention, which extracts ammonia from the air. If the Allied forces had been able to control Baltic Sea traffic at that time and cut off Germany's transportation with Sweden, the war could have ended earlier. The British submarine fleet once dominated the Baltic Sea, hindering Germany's transportation with Sweden and causing Germany great unease. However, due to the stagnation of the Russian fleet, which did not cooperate with the British submarines, Germany was fortunate enough to continue transporting magnets from Sweden and sustain the European War for as long as four years.

The current situation is fundamentally different. The agile Soviet fleet can be active in the Baltic Sea, which is a serious blow to Germany and Sweden's maritime traffic. The German naval authorities are also very clear about this, so its strategy is to strengthen the naval defenses of the Gulf of Finland to contain the Soviet fleet, especially to prevent the submarine fleet from having opportunities to operate. However, Germany cannot currently execute this great task because the bases around the Gulf of Finland are not in Germany's hands; moreover, Danzig and Memel are too far from the Gulf of Finland to be of any help. The only things Germany can utilize are Riga in Latvia, Tallinn in Estonia, and the Dago Islands in the Baltic Sea, all of which are important naval locations. If Germany can control them, it will be enough to deal with the Soviet fleet, and the Baltic Sea will become Hitler's world. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that Germany will still respect the neutrality of the Baltic countries once war breaks out.

The Soviet Union has accurately determined that when a war occurs, Germany will inevitably seize the coastal areas of Latvia and Estonia. If the Soviet Union strictly adheres to its maritime defense policy, it can avoid attacks and maintain the strength of its fleet. Enemy air strikes must be strictly guarded against. In short, no one can know what policy the Soviet Baltic fleet will adopt except for the Moscow naval authorities. Recently, many senior Soviet naval officers have strongly advocated an "offensive" naval policy, so the Soviet fleet will definitely take active action when something happens.

The Baltic countries are, in terms of terrain, a natural fortress against Germany's advance into the Gulf of Finland. If Hitler can control this important bay, then in naval strategy terms, the Soviet fleet will be equivalent to nothing and useless; and all of the Soviet Union's sea routes, except for the White Sea, will be cut off.

The Baltic countries are the center of the current international political situation and will also be the decisive battlefield for the future German-Soviet War. (Excerpted and translated from the Hong Kong Telegraph, 22nd)

Anecdotes

### Weather Bureau

The Archbishop of York in England has launched a global prayer for China on July 9th by Christians worldwide. We express our deep gratitude and have nothing else to say. But we hope that while praying for China, we can also pray for the whole world, to reform the too barbaric races to a reasonable state, and to reform the too civilized races to stand up straight.

Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been going on for three months, turning and turning, but they have not yet converged. Each has their own reasons, and each thinks they are right. What should we say? What do the thousands of villages matter? Why offend people on either side?

Some charitable society has organized a Hong Kong and Kowloon ultra-Chinese martyred soldiers and civilians ten thousand people's fate meeting. It is scheduled for the 20th, lasting seven days, and is presided over by some Living Buddha. We do not quite understand this matter at all and do not know if it is another "Kalachakra Tantra Assembly" of the kind. This is: everyone can save the country, and each has different clever ways.

Today's "Small Anecdotes" on this page introduces the little history of ice cream. Ice cream is called "snow cream" in Hong Kong. One friend said that "snow cream" is the most beautiful translation name in Hong Kong; another friend protested, saying that the name is elegant, but not very communicative, ice cream is really made of ice, not snow. It is said that the distinction between ice and snow in Hong Kong is very vague, because Hong Kong has no snow at all. Whether this is indeed the case, we are still reserving our opinion. If any old Hong Konger among the readers knows and is happy to instruct us, it would be quite welcome.

### One Person a Day

Ma Junwu

Dr. Ma Junwu, who used to be the principal of China Public School and Guangxi University, was a hardworking and determined educator.

Dr. Ma was extremely frugal in his personal life. His clothing, shoes, food, and drink were all of the most basic kind. It was naturally even more impossible for him to give gifts or entertain guests.

It was in Guangzhou when, one day, Dr. Ma suddenly received an invitation: "Respectfully inviting you to a modest feast at the Grand Three Yuan Restaurant on the afternoon of a certain month at 6 o'clock." Signed below were two familiar friends.

Why are they hosting a feast? Dr. Ma was a little confused. However, it is impolite to decline an invitation. So, he decided to arrive on time.

That night, the Grand Three Yuan was very lively, with a constant stream of cars and people. Many virtuous people had gathered. There were many people, and the food was good, so Dr. Ma ate very well. After getting his fill of wine and food, Dr. Ma was preparing to find the host to express his gratitude and say goodbye. However, the two hosts who had invited him were nowhere to be found. All the other guests, however, surrounded him and said, "Thank you, Mr. Ma, for today's treat." One by one, they left.

Dr. Ma was truly perplexed. He quickly ran to the counter to take a look, and on the menu board, it was clearly written: "Number Five - Mr. Ma Junwu's Treat." Only then did he realize that he had been the victim of a prank.

### I Am a Prisoner of Hitler

On the Line of Death

Mr. Julecius, the publisher of the German "Catholic Weekly," was invited to a concentration camp by Hitler because he often faithfully reported the atrocities of the Nazis to his readers. The following is a page from his diary in the camp:

May 16th. The diary reminds me that I came to this place on March 9th. It's been more than two months. I live on the third floor, in this small, dark room. Although it's not very comfortable, I don't care. The days seem to pass quietly, and the jailers are quite willing to talk to me.

But finally, it came; around one o'clock at night, two people came, saying they were secret detectives and wanted to take me for interrogation. The jailers didn't even have time to look at their orders, and I was taken away. They escorted me through the corridor to the administration office, took out bandages, and blindfolded me. Then, they pulled me east, west, up the stairs, down the stairs, many times, just to disorient me. Then, they led me to a room.

The blindfold was removed, and my eyes were dazzled by the bright lights. I vaguely saw that it was a rather spacious room. In front of me, many bright electric lights were shining on me. In the darkness behind the lights, many people were sitting, but because of the darkness, I couldn't see them clearly. In short, it was like a stage, I was the actor, under the lights, and they were the audience, all in the dark.

"Dr. Julecius!" A voice like a cow's bellow came from the darkness. At this time, I could vaguely see a few dark shadows moving.

"Who told you about the Brown House news?"

"I am responsible for any text published in my newspaper; no one else." I replied coldly.

"It seems you are unwilling to reveal your accomplices, is that right?" Another harsh voice said.

"I am unwilling." I simply retorted.

For a second, the room was dead silent. Then, I was pressed onto a table, and rubber batons rained down on me, striking twenty-five times.

I ignored it.

I was pressed onto a chair again and interrogated again.

I refused to open my mouth.

"You old dog, we will make you speak immediately."

Then, I was beaten again, about twenty-five times again. I almost fainted, and staggered back to the chair, breathing with difficulty.

"Are you willing to confess now?"

Why should I confess?

With a bang, a pistol was thrown on the table. Someone roared an order, "The gun is there, take it and commit suicide! You, you villain!"

I opened my mouth, "I won't commit suicide, I am a Catholic." I knelt down and prayed, I was only focused on praying to God, and let them do whatever they wanted to me!

Perhaps they were afraid of God's condemnation. They discussed among themselves for a long time and didn't dare to kill me.

The interrogation ended like this. I was still led out of the room by two secret detectives. Just as I reached the staircase, someone pushed me hard, and I fell down the stairs, lying on the floor. Just as I was about to touch the railing to get up, someone stomped down on my hand with heavy leather shoes.

I lay still, and there were feet wearing riding boots kicking me. Someone shouted loudly:

"Are you willing to talk? You old dog!"

When I returned to this small, dark room, I was covered in blood. I prayed to God again. I thanked Him, because although I suffered a brutal attack, I was still alive. One day I will be able to continue my work.

### Short Anecdotes

— Ice Cream

The thermometer has jumped to over ninety degrees, and you're sweating like rain; you have to have ice cream again—Hong Kong calls it snow cream. But, do you know the anecdotes and history of ice cream? I'll tell you a little bit now.

The origin of ice cream cannot be traced back at all. It is only said that Queen Alexander loved to drink ice water and cold drinks, and specially sent subordinates to knock ice to return, and to pick fresh fruits to freeze them. The taste was good and cool to the heart. Thus, it became a sacred product. Perhaps this is some of the origin.

In the early seventeenth century, King Louis XIV of France wrote in his diary after attending a court banquet: "At the end of the banquet, each guest was presented with a silver cup containing an egg-like thing. Many people were curious about this new thing. After tasting it, they found it was a very delicious frozen cream."

It wasn't until 1660 that there were cafes in Paris selling frozen cream. England and other countries also competed to imitate it, but before this period, all frozen drinks had no sweetness; later, the method of making ice cream was compiled into a special book, which told people that they could add sugar and various fresh fruit juices, and thus there was progress.

At the same time, the ice cream making method was introduced to the Americas. An American chef named Philen carefully studied it and published his opinions in the newspaper. He devoted himself to the improvement of food and was very famous at the time, so this immediately became even more popular. In the United States, the name of Philen was very well-known. In fact, everything he did was learned from London. In 1789, George Washington held a historical banquet, and the ice cream used at the banquet was handled entirely by him.

Changing with each passing day, the ways of ice cream are naturally becoming more and more advanced. Now, the most advanced way is in the streets of America, you can drop a coin into a box, and immediately, you can get a cup of ice cream.

"When the judge questions you, you should smile like this first."

### Rain Flowers

A: I lost my parents when I was nine months old, and since then I have become self-reliant and prosperous.

B: How could you support yourself when you were only nine months old?

A: I crawled to a baby competition and won the first prize. That was the starting point of my success.

Host: I have something to do at five o'clock tomorrow morning, remember, come and wake me up then.

Servant: I know, at that time you just need to press the bell, and I will come and wake you up.

### Sea Storm

— Thirty Knights by Lawton translated by Yang Pi

Excerpt from the previous article: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was carrying eight million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Cox Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel in Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship began to run wildly aimlessly. Soon, the radio transmitted news that there were icebergs nearby. Fortunately, the icebergs soon slid past, but the passengers were frightened and became abnormal, causing a commotion. Jack had a conflict with a German professor...

"Make enemies! How could that be?" Jack said unconvinced, "That guy is just a fierce and cowardly coward. He—"

"Well, that's true, but he is a German professor—"

"Forget it! Do you also take these things to heart?"

"That's right, he is a professor at the German Military Academy. This Professor Rawicki is a very important figure in Germany." Balfour told him sincerely.

"Okay, Mr. Long Chicken, no matter what strange words he calls, or whether he is such a big figure as you said, he is always a coward. If he follows his lead and goes to the captain to find trouble for me, I won't be worried at all. First, my current position is just a volunteer officer, and second, I can bet you a pancake, or bet you that big apple you like, that old Mr. Long doesn't even have time to cover up what he did last night, how can he reveal it again?"

This Jack was wrong. In the future, he would know that Professor Rawicki would not let him off so easily.

Six. Warships are coming

This afternoon, Jack heard some passengers who couldn't stand the stimulation shouting in horror again. He quickly ran to the middle deck and saw a thick cloud of smoke in the northern sky. Moreover, he could see that it was a ship. In the telescope, he could already see that it was a warship? But, it was not possible to identify which country it belonged to for a while.

Jack quickly ran into the radio room. Balfour said that he had not received any telegrams, nor had he heard any news related to this strange ship. On the beams, the crew members were discussing in surprise. This warship was moving closer every minute. It was a black, wide, and short ship with two very thick smokestacks, from which very thick and a lot of black smoke was billowing. In front of her bow, large piles of white foam splashed up, showing that she was rushing forward rapidly.

After waiting for a while, Balfour shouted, "Ah, here it comes!" He quickly wrote it down and handed it to Jack. Jack saw that it was written on it:

By order of the Emperor, stop proceeding immediately.

HMS Berwick

"I'll send it up immediately," Jack shouted, "Hayes, listen hard, see if there is any more news."

"I don't think I'll miss it, Jack, do you think they will fire at us?"

"I don't know, I guess they will if we don't stop." Jack said, and quickly ran away.

After the captain read the note, he said, "That's exactly what I thought."

"Do you want me to tell Hayes to reply that we have stopped?" Jack asked.

"Stop! I cannot obey the British warships to stop." The captain said irritably.

He immediately picked up the phone, ordered the engine room to increase the heat as much as possible, and make the ship 'accelerate forward'. Thus, the ship shot forward like an arrow, with piles of black smoke rolling out of the chimneys, and coal ash falling like rain on the deck.

### Foreign Trade: Barter Trade Effective; Tea Exports to the Soviet Union and Tung Oil Exports to the United States; Barter is the Main Export; New Transportation Lines Can be Utilized

Since the implementation of barter trade for foreign trade, it has been quite effective. As a result, China's tea exports to the Soviet Union have increased sharply, and are concentrated in Hong Kong for export. For example, from January to April, tea exports from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union amounted to 19,903,258 pounds, with a total value of several hundred and twenty-two million seven hundred and seventy-four thousand Hong Kong dollars, accounting for more than 80% of the export value. In addition, the export volume of raw silk, tung oil, pig bristles, sheepskin, and fur has not decreased sharply due to the war. It is heard that the barter trade method will be gradually promoted. The current practice is to barter tea for goods from the Soviet Union and tung oil for goods from the United States.

Appropriate Millions to Promote Production

Since the Executive Yuan issued an order to all provinces to promote production and instructed the competent authorities to raise funds, it was decided that the competent authorities would allocate 10 million yuan to develop inland production enterprises. Guangxi, Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, and Yunnan provinces were designated to improve seeds, promote sideline occupations, prevent and control pests, pay attention to water conservancy, and reclaim wasteland for agriculture. For industry, they were to improve technology, promote domestic products, reward small industries and handicrafts, develop mining enterprises, and invigorate rural finance, improve the organization of various industries, etc.

Centralized Export to Obtain Foreign Exchange

Since the Trade Commission implemented the management of exports, it has assisted in exporting no less than tens of millions of yuan. Centralized exports of foreign exchange have amounted to nearly tens of millions of yuan. For example, the tea, oil, and silk stored in Hankou, as well as the silk and tea from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, were transported to Hong Kong to obtain foreign exchange only after the Commission's dredging and rush transport. Other assistance in transporting and purchasing materials from various provinces has also been quite successful. Recently, it has also increased the handling of barter trade with a certain country, and its business has therefore developed further. It is expected that the value of managed exports this year will increase more than in the previous two years.

Open New Routes to Promote Trade

Since the withdrawal of our troops from Shanghai, foreign trade has been concentrated in Guangdong and Hubei. Since the withdrawal from Guangdong and Hubei, the ability to export foreign goods through Haiphong has been due to the central government's encouragement and assistance. Afterwards, the sharp increase in the trade volume of various inland ports, and the continued increase in the export value of certain commodities, would have been difficult to achieve without the Trade Commission's mediation. Recently, the central government has expedited the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway and established a certain company, which will further promote trade, enabling major local products to be exported continuously through the new transportation lines. This is truly a good phenomenon in the War of Resistance and national construction.

### HSBC Continues to Supply Foreign Exchange, Rumors Subside and People are at Ease, Black Market Foreign Exchange Remains Stable as Ever, Cash Prices Fall Back from Yesterday

[Shanghai Dispatch] Since the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee adjusted the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai, the British-owned HSBC Bank has continued to provide as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries. As a result, the black market exchange rate has tended to stabilize, with the British pound at six and a half pence and the US dollar at 12.625 yuan, seemingly reaching the so-called new horizontal line. Last Saturday, the financial market spread rumors that HSBC had stopped selling black market foreign exchange, causing rumors to rise and cash to skyrocket, reaching a peak. The day before yesterday (18th) was Sunday, and the banks were closed. After the market opened yesterday on Monday, the facts proved that HSBC Bank had not stopped selling, so people were at ease, the rumors subsided, and cash prices had also fallen back. HSBC has not changed its temper.

### Rainy Night

— Shi Qi

Hearing the news of the fall of my hometown was already after midnight.

I grabbed an old, bald pen and scribbled on the paper, trying to press it on the paper to leave some traces.

The light of the weak kerosene lamp diffused, constantly shaking, rising above the lamp, shaking, making a slight hissing sound. The pen tip only pressed some circles, straight lines, stone-like unconscious things on the paper. Only these things were abandoned by the melancholy inertia in my heart.

Outside the window was a black expanse, hiding secrets and ominousness. There were no stars, no moon, no clouds, no fog in the sky. It looked like a black, stern, and cold face. The contours of the spires of the buildings were inserted into the black mist.

Suddenly, a sound of a gust of wind rolled in, the continuous sound of droplets hitting and hitting, in my mood filled with melancholy and old thoughts, it was just a collection of cries of misery and anger. The rain continued, and outside the window was still a black, vast expanse. A faint glow from the window lattices of distant buildings reflected the crystal clear raindrops, and my eyes also dripped crystal clear blood tears.

Like the black clouds before the sudden rain, all the memories squeezed tightly into the entire heart, as if it was too full and about to vomit.

On the calm river water of the Han River, by the riverbank, my father looked at the stagnant river water and said to me: "Will life be as calm as the river water?" He issued such a sigh, and an ugly smile appeared on his face. He just parted like that, in the miserable cries of the whistle.

Then, when the river water was dyed blood red, people drifted in all directions! Ah, until now, it has been two whole years. In these two years of exile, I have always been unable to figure out the sigh that my father said, "Will life be as calm as the river water!" Is it true? Perhaps it is, after enduring this period of refugee time, life will be as calm as the river water, right?

The sound of the rain gradually lowered, and only the sound of one or two drops falling and touching the ground broke the silence of the late night. The flame of the kerosene lamp also jumped higher and higher indefinitely. I knew: it was about to go out. The bald pen was still scribbling on the paper, still those circles, straight lines, stone-like things.

The light suddenly went out, and suddenly it seemed that the people I remembered had turned into a fire of resistance, breaking through the life as calm as the river water and going towards the boundless sky.

### I Acknowledged It Silently

— Qing Mu

At dusk, a faint crescent moon hung on the pale sky. I like to sit at a square table by the wooden window at this time. I look at the green mountains, the ancient and bent-backed pine trees. One evening, a shepherd boy led his cattle past the wooden window. He saw me.

——Are you sick?

——No.

——Why don't you come out and take a walk in the mountains?

——After you lead the cattle back, come to my place to play!

——Okay, but you have to wait a long time.

He pulled up his calico clothes and wiped the sweat off his face. That oily forehead was so dark from the sun. He stared at me with a pair of round, bright, black eyes. He seemed to want to tell me a secret.

His thin lips were moving, but he didn't say anything. His uneven, grassy hair and two soft ears that fell forward seemed to be expecting something.

——What is it?

——I saw a pair of colored ones again. Do you say that bullets can still come out of the calf after they have entered?

——Of course…

——Then can't we pick them up… and shoot them into the heads of the Japanese devils!

He didn't understand my smile, the strange smile.

——Go back. Let's talk about these things later, okay?

He pulled up the corner of his clothes again, wiping his sweat:

——…Okay…

He walked away. Then came the night. Night—that still night with a heavy terror: every tree branch turned into a demonic hand that could strangle people's throats. I watched the sky gradually darken, and finally felt tired and lay down on the wooden bed. I felt a little weak, but as long as the heart was still beating, no matter what, I had to work.

I was a little cold, so I had to support myself from the wooden bed, groped for a match in the dark, and lit the oil lamp. I looked at so many "Personnel and Weapons Statistical Reports" on the table that I still had to process. I was excited, I realized that just now it was a dream—a very bad nightmare!

"That is a shame!"

I acknowledged it silently, I acknowledged it silently. The flame of the oil lamp was jumping. I recorded that moment just now… every detail was written down. It's a mirror, right? Or it will become a mirror.

### Fang Fan Ting (Square Meal Pavilion)

— Yuren

Fang Fan Ting,

A dilapidated ancient temple,

Stands erect on verdant Five Wave Ridge!

History has brought you this

Poetic name!

The wailing of the pine wind,

Seems to lament your ancient sorrow;

Your hall is engraved with a posthumous portrait of Wen Tianxiang,

On his silent face,

Still remains the wound of a fallen nation!

Like the plaintive song of a nightingale,

Like the heroic desolation of the desert wind!

Your historical deeds of hundreds of years ago,

Echoes in the heart of this wanderer!

Today, I come from the distant horizon,

To offer you endless elegies!

Fang Fan Ting,

You must still be sighing and lamenting! —

That in those days, Wen Tianxiang's hunger was not resolved,

But instead his life was forfeited!

The bloodiness on the bandit knives beyond the border pass,

Floated to the embroidered national territory!

Today, the mountains and rivers of the Divine Land,

Are again surging with a rampant murderous aura,

Blood is rushing,

Blood turns into kerosene

Raging on the earth!

The beacon fires of tyrannical aggression

Again fill the azure southern sky!

Fang Fan Ting,

Fang Fan Ting!

Let the heroic fighters

Again have a meal in this pavilion of yours!

How many millions are there

Of Wen Tianxiangs in the new era?

Oh, Wen Tianxiangs in the new era! —

Possessing tenacious fighting power,

Will certainly not be bound at the end of the road!

Must —

Drive the devils out of

Our territorial land!

Oh, Fang Fan Ting!

I shed tears and pay homage for you

I sing a passionate song for you!

Today,

National liberation and hatred of the enemy

Fills the mainland,

Oh, new Wen Tianxiang,

Must use red hot blood

To write the battle "Song of Righteousness"

Oh, new Wen Tianxiang!

Must ignite the beacon fire of justice,

Refine the mountains and rivers of a new China!

### Bacterial and Anesthetic Warfare (Part 1)

— Written by JMurray, Translated by Tianren

Recently, a Belgian scientist announced that bacteria will be used as deadly weapons in the next war, which has sent chills down the spines of billions and sparked heated discussions among countless experts.

French newspapers have reported that German chemical laboratories are working day and night to cultivate billions of bacteria with various toxicities to decimate the × nation's people. Many French chemical experts have even solemnly classified these deadly bacteria and specified the diseases that each bacterium can cause. Some British scientists, while not believing these rumors, solemnly nodded in agreement regarding the question of whether bacteria would be used in the next major war! It is difficult to predict.

When the secrets of these deadly weapons that will appear in the next war are yet to be revealed, people tremble at the mere mention of them. Everyone is reluctant to discuss this bacterial warfare that could wipe out billions of human beings. However, many European newspapers now deeply regret the mistake of having neglected this issue in the past. Because after starting to discuss this issue (although feeling slightly late), they have reached a credible conclusion, believing that the damage that bacteria can inflict as weapons is extremely limited.

(1) The application of bacteria is extremely limited.

Experts in both Britain and France firmly believe that the implementation of bacterial warfare is even more restricted than the use of other weapons. The scientists of various countries know about all the bacteria that have been discovered. Their habits and characteristics have been deeply studied and classified and recorded. Poison gas can be manufactured in laboratories, but bacteria—even if new species that can devastate humankind can be cultivated—are difficult to cultivate in large quantities. Even if a country's military attempts to use known bacteria for warfare, there are still many difficulties.

There are two ways to spread diseases:

The first method is to transmit diseases through direct contact between individuals. Therefore, if the aim is to spread the disease widely in × country to force it to submit, countless own country's troops must first be sacrificed, allowing them to become infected with the disease and then secretly dispatching them to × country. Using this method to attack × people is obviously too great a sacrifice. Because even if this method manages to fulfill its mission, × people can isolate the patients and try to eliminate this epidemic.

The second method is to inject diseases into × country using fleas, rats, etc. as vectors. Using this method, the military must carry millions of fleas and rats. And they must be infected with pneumonic plague or bubonic plague.

(2) Rodents cannot complete the mission

When I raised the question of whether fleas and rats could be used to spread diseases to × country to a Swiss chemist, he said it was impossible. Because fleas and rats have no national consciousness. Those who experienced World War I can prove that they cannot distinguish between × allies and enemies. Therefore, fleas and rats will spread diseases indiscriminately across borders, causing infectious diseases to prevail on both sides of the front line.

A British microscopic scholar, John Fawcett, said that the above two methods could exterminate × people, unless the following occurs.

He said: Once the bacteria of each disease is known, it can be resisted with a serum. This serum is made from the blood of animals infected with the disease and has the effect of preventing epidemics. Therefore, when various known infectious diseases occur, or even before they occur, blood can be quickly and massively shed to reduce the harm of the disease.

"Only some unknown types of bacteria can truly exterminate human races. If a country's bacterial research department can secretly cultivate an unnamed epidemic bacterium and can produce a serum to inject into its own people, then that country can truly use this uncontrollable epidemic to destroy × people. However, this possibility still seems very remote.

(3) Warfare using anesthetics as weapons.

Those experts who discuss the weapons used in the next war firmly believe that anesthetics will prevail. A British writer, John Carpenter, who specializes in the study of weapons of war, once said in an article that anesthetics can be used on a large scale as weapons of war, and they are easy to use. He described the use of anesthetics as follows:

"When the war breaks out, millions of soldiers gather on the front line. Suddenly, × side artillery fires, bombarding them fiercely. The shells falling in their midst are a bit different, they all explode into shattered dust. Waves of "shell dust" fall on the soldiers, and immediately thousands upon thousands fall to the ground, losing consciousness. In an instant, millions of troops are anesthetized and fall to the ground. Then the artillery stops firing, followed by large numbers of × people surging in like a tide. Millions of unconscious people are disarmed. And they are surrounded by × people, with many machine guns placed in important strongholds. Soon, they gradually wake up. When they regain consciousness, loudspeakers placed all around tell them that if they do not surrender, they will be annihilated. Naturally, they feel that sacrifice is useless and surrender unconditionally. The war ends in this way.

(4) George Bernard Shaw would rather have anesthetic or gas warfare

The great British writer George Bernard Shaw, in his recent comments on weapons of war, declared that he would rather be anesthetized and lose consciousness, or even be suffocated by poison gas, than be blown to pieces by a sixteen-inch caliber cannon.

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

8.  Reminiscences on the Hanbao Road

"Strength to uproot mountains, spirit overshadowing the world,

The time is unfavorable, and my horse will not run;

If my horse will not run, what is to be done?

Yu, oh Yu, what is to be done?"

And committed suicide by drawing his sword. Heroes often have short-sightedness, and arrogant soldiers are bound to fail. Those who are tyrannical and domineering are bound to fail. It is not only Xiang Yu who is like this, even Napoleon, the unparalleled hero who dominated Europe, eventually had to retreat from Moscow in defeat and could never rise again. We have seen the brutal and domineering aggressive atrocities of the Japanese warlords, and in the near future, they will inevitably suffer the same consequences as Xiang Yu and Napoleon.

Passing through the plank road and Liuba, we reach Miaotaizi. The place is extremely quiet and the scenery is beautiful. There is the "Han Zhang Liuhou Temple," also known as Zhang Liang Temple. Liu Bang gained the world with the help of Han Xin, Zhang Liang, and Xiao He, calling his dynasty Han, and establishing himself as Emperor Gaozu of Han. Afterwards, he became suspicious of Han, Zhang, and Xiao. Eventually, he put Han Xin, the founding hero, to death. Xiao He was imprisoned. The extremely intelligent Zhang Liang saw all this clearly and understood his future fate (if he did not leave). So he resolutely hid his talents and, according to legend, came to this tranquil place to live as a recluse. After losing these three heroes, Emperor Gaozu Liu Bang's accomplishments began to decline. This shows the importance of talent to the country and the nation; it shows that a leader without the capacity to tolerate others cannot achieve anything in politics. This is a universal truth throughout history and across the world.

Leaving Chaiguan Ridge and entering Shuangshipu, a small town that forks into two roads: one to Baoji, and the other to Tianshui in Gansu Province, passing through Xinjiang, and connecting to the Northwest National Highway of the Soviet Union, which passes through here. From this, we can understand that the recent activities of the devils in central Hubei, attempting to control the Han River, attack Xiangyang, and threaten Hanzhong, are not without reason.

Passing through Bianshipu, we gradually enter the Qinling Mountains. The cliffs are towering and majestic, and the snow in the stone walls and valleys is several feet deep. It is said that airplanes passing through here often cause people's mouths and noses to bleed due to the high air pressure, and inexperienced pilots dare not fly over these mountains lightly. The car spent two hours climbing to the top of the ridge; descending the mountain, we made twenty-seven turns before reaching the foot of the mountain. Leaving the mountainous area, we entered the Ban-Yuan (half-plain) of the Wei River, and Baoji, our destination, shone in the distance with ten thousand lights.

Baoji is also a small city, but because it is located at the western end of the Longhai Railway, connecting to Xi'an in the east and then to Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and other provinces, and entering Hanzhong in the south and then to Chengdu and Chongqing. If the War of Resistance enters the second stage and all the railway lines are lost, this place will be a hub for the highway lines connecting western and northern China, with constant traffic. It is precisely for this reason that Baoji has become increasingly prosperous since the War of Resistance; more and more roads have been built, and there are one or two two- or three-story Western-style buildings; electric lights have been installed, and the smell of kerosene is gone from the sidewalks; the War of Resistance has put Baoji on the road to a capitalist city, although it is still only beginning.

At 9 p.m., I boarded the only remaining train in the motherland—the Longhai train—heading towards Chang'an, the capital of every dynasty, and the birthplace of national revival.

### Local Naval Authorities Notify British Ships to Sail to Shantou as Usual. Ignore Unreasonable Demands. Firmly Deny the Right of × to Blockade Shantou. Britain and the United States Warn × Army to Ensure the Safety of Foreign Nationals. First Batch of Refugees from Shantou Arrives in Hong Kong on Norwegian Merchant Ship Yesterday

After × people began to invade Shantou, they attempted to block the seaport under pretexts to exclude the interests of third countries. The × chief Kinteng has invaded Shantou. On the day of the invasion, he resorted to intimidation and made unreasonable demands on Britain and the United States to withdraw their warships. The momentum was fierce, and the situation was serious. British and American authorities have insight into the conspiracy of the × side and decided to ignore its illegal demands. The local naval authorities have notified British ships to sail to Shantou as usual. A US warship also arrived in Shantou from Gulangyu yesterday to cope with any unexpected events. Both Britain and the United States have warned × party to be responsible for protecting the safety of foreign nationals. It can be seen that the attempt of × party to blockade has been thwarted.

Local Naval Authorities Notify British Ships to Sail to Shantou

Yesterday, foreign news reported that after the Japanese army invading Shantou notified foreign ships to leave Shantou, the local naval authorities yesterday notified various British shipping companies, ordering them to send ships to Shantou as usual, regardless of the Japanese warning, because Britain absolutely cannot recognize the Japanese right to blockade Shantou. After receiving the notice, Jardine Matheson, Swire, Jardine and other companies have made such preparations. Jardine Matheson's Fuso Wheel first set off for Shantou at 1 pm yesterday. Swire Shipping's Jiangsu Wheel is also scheduled to depart from Hong Kong to Shantou on Sunday this week. In Shanghai, Jardine Matheson's Desheng and Zesheng also opened Shantou yesterday. After arriving in Shantou, the wheels will first moor outside the mouth of the Han River. Wait for the order of the British warship captain stationed in Shantou, and then drive into the port. At that time, the British warship will **** drive into Shantou Port. Jardine Matheson's Haicheng Wheel also left Hong Kong yesterday afternoon, but because there were no passengers and goods to Shantou, it will not stay when passing through Shantou and go straight to Fuzhou.

Britain and the United States Warn × to Ensure the Safety of Foreign Nationals

As for the foreign ships registered in Shantou, there were originally three British ships "Shan Ni Tu", "Scott" and the US ship "Bit Siba Cai". Although the Japanese side threatened to order them to leave Shantou on the 20th, all foreign ships decided to ignore them. Yesterday, the Japanese side's letter of mourning and atonement expired, and the result was beyond the Japanese side's expectations. Each ship is still stationed at the mouth of the Han River, and there is no change. The commander of the US Fleet in China, Shi Ge Luo Chen, drove the ship "Zun Di Bu Bi" from Hong Kong to Gulangyu on Tuesday of this week. Because the war in Shantou broke out, he returned to Shantou from Gulangyu yesterday. When entering Shantou Port, he passed through the Japanese fleet's line, and assisted the British ship "Scott" to monitor the mouth of the Han River. Both Britain and the United States have severely warned × chief Kinteng to be responsible for protecting the lives and properties of foreign nationals. There are more than two hundred British overseas Chinese in Shantou City, fifty-eight American overseas Chinese, and sixty people of other nationalities.

Norwegian Merchant Ship Carries More Than 100 Refugees to Hong Kong

The Norwegian merchant ship Borin Merlin arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou at 7 am yesterday. This is the first foreign merchant ship to depart from the Shantou war zone after the Shantou war. The ship left Shanghai fully loaded with passengers and goods on the 18th of this month and went to Shantou. The Shantou war broke out on the 21st, and was trapped in the port. It was not until the 22nd that it was ordered to pick up foreign women and children from Shantou to Hong Kong. It set off from Shantou at 11 am on the 22nd and arrived in Hong Kong at 7:30 am yesterday. First, it entered the sea ban for quarantine, and then sailed to the sea off Sai Wan, where Chinese and foreign passengers took barges to land. In addition to carrying more than 150 Chinese and foreign passengers, there was also a large shipment of goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Shantou. The goods shipped to Shantou included flour, dried bean curd, bean cake, salted fish, matches, onions, gypsum, soap, medicinal materials, light bulbs, etc. After the goods were shipped to Shantou, they were waiting to be unloaded, but the war broke out suddenly and they had to be stored on the ship and shipped to Hong Kong. As for the goods shipped to Hong Kong from Shanghai, there are foreign fire, foreign fire paper, medicinal materials, onions, brassware, wood, yarn, canvas, lead powder, flashlights, foreign cloth, hawthorn, groceries, etc., a total of 2,820 pieces. After arriving in Hong Kong yesterday morning, all of the above goods were unloaded in Hong Kong.

Seven Foreign Nationals Arrive in Hong Kong, Others Still Remain in Shantou

The reporter of the Minzhong Society boarded the ship for an interview. According to a statement issued by a senior Western staff member of the ship, when the Shantou war broke out, the ship was moored in the sea off the Shantou Port Customs, and there was also a Taikoo company Yinzhou Wheel moored at the pier in front of the Customs. At 4 am on the morning of the 11th, the Japanese aircraft first bombed Shantou City. At 8 am on the morning, five Japanese warships entered the port and began to attack Shantou City.

### Hong Kong Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday. Appeal to Chaozhou Overseas Chinese in Nanyang to Relieve Their Homeland

The Hong Kong Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association for Disaster Refugees held a meeting at the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce at 8 pm yesterday. Those present were Chairman Lin Zifeng, Lin Zishi, Chen Rongzhai, Li Zhizhang, Lin Yide, Chen Zizhao, Xu Youmei, Ma Zemin, Huang Lansheng, Hong Heyou, Chen Junfu, Xi Ziting, Chen Eshi, etc. Dozens of people. After the meeting, the record Li Lianfa first announced that the previous cases were correct, and the chairman Lin Zifeng signed and sealed them as true. Then he stood up and announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that he invited representatives of various groups to the meeting this evening because the iron hooves of the devils have stepped on the homeland, and all Chaozhou overseas Chinese should urgently rise up to jointly seek the responsibility of relief. At the same time, for fear that the local relief force is weak, I intend to send a telegram to the overseas Nanyang ports to appeal, requesting overseas Chinese to carry out the movement to relieve their hometown. Tracing back to the past, Hong Kong Port, because it is adjacent to the motherland, is often the overseas Chaozhou overseas Chinese's transit voice machine. Now that the hometown is in danger, it is reasonable to inform the public, so as to jointly seek ways to provide relief facilities, and also ask everyone present to express their opinions, so as to collect ideas and broaden the benefits. Then Lin Zishi stood up and suggested: (1) First seek to select a location to accommodate refugees, so that refugees can be resettled at that time, (2) Expand the scope of work of the association, and collect all Hong Kong Chaozhou overseas Chinese from all walks of life such as business, industry, academia, and specialized technicians, and register them all to jointly handle the hometown relief work, (3) Set up a temporary council under the fundraising association to be solely responsible for this relief work in Chaoshan. Finally, he also proposed to collect Chaozhou sailing ships in Hong Kong for transportation when necessary, such as providing Chaoshan with food and transporting refugees, etc. Secondly, if there are Chaozhou refugees coming to Hong Kong, they will be entertained and comforted. Following Lin Zishi, Lin Yide, Chen Yongxu, Ma Zemin, Xu Youmei and others provided opinions. After discussion, it was resolved that (1) the news and its process of the fall of Shantou this time should be sent to all Chaozhou overseas Chinese in Nanyang, and they should be urgently requested to raise funds for relief and the authorities should be requested to provide relief quickly, (2) Lin Zifeng, Lin Zishi, Ma Zemin, Xu Youmei, Chen Yongzhai, Chen Zizhao, Hong Heyou and other seven people were elected to plan and investigate fundraising matters, and Lin Zishi was responsible for drafting all the details.

### National Currency Stabilizes and Rises. Prices Soar.

The previous day, various Chinese-funded banks in Shanghai were ordered to restrict withdrawals. When the news first came out, it was mixed and uneven, and the national currency market also swayed. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the measures taken by Shanghai Bank were beneficial to the national currency, and people's hearts were greatly settled. The national currency stabilized and began to rise again. At the close of the market yesterday afternoon, the national currency rose to 4.4, and the Guangdong currency rose to 3.65, which is far from the lowest record of 3.95 (national currency). At the time of the rise and fall of our national currency, the Japanese yen has been consistently depressed. Yesterday, each Japanese yen was only worth 97 cents, and a large amount of foreign exchange had been dumped to maintain it. As for counterfeit money and the devil's military tickets, they are only worth 83 cents.

### After Hong Kong and Macao Reciprocate Quarantine, Travelers Feel Greatly Inconvenienced. The Number of People Going to Macao Has Decreased Sharply, Affecting Various Industries in the Market. Some People in Macao Sell Certificates for Profit.

Since Hong Kong and Macao have reciprocally designated each other as epidemic transmission ports, passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Macao must hold a vaccination certificate before being allowed to land. This measure is to take care of the health of residents in both places and prevent the spread of the epidemic. However, due to the troublesome procedures, passengers feel greatly inconvenienced, and the number of people traveling between the two places has decreased greatly. According to passengers who took the Xi'an Wheel to Macao yesterday, passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Macao must hold a vaccination certificate issued by a Portuguese doctor or a Hong Kong government doctor before it can take effect. However, more than thousands of people go to Macao every day, so there are hundreds of people waiting in line at various Portuguese doctors and government doctors all day long to get vaccinations and issue certificates. Some people wait all day and still do not get their turn, and the procedures are extremely troublesome. The same situation has occurred in Macao, and cunning people have taken the opportunity to make profits. One person is vaccinated multiple times and obtains multiple certificates, and then sells them to passengers who want to take the ship to Hong Kong. The selling price is about one or two yuan per certificate. Most passengers, for the sake of convenience, also buy them from these people. The Macao government has now discovered this matter and is paying attention to prevent it. Anyone who brings an old certificate to the anti-epidemic office to apply for a new one must check whether their age and name match the information filled in at the office before allowing the replacement. After this method was implemented, the number of people secretly selling certificates has decreased. However, because the certificate for going to Macao from Hong Kong has a photo of the person affixed to it, it cannot be transferred to others, so there have been no cases of reselling certificates so far.

According to a visitor from Macao, since Macao implemented import quarantine, residents of Hong Kong, because of the troublesome procedures, do not take a step forward without important tasks. The number of passengers going to Macao from Hong Kong every day has decreased by 30% to 40% compared to before the implementation of import quarantine. Various shopping malls in Macao have been affected by this, and business has become sluggish. The biggest impact is on hotels, casinos, entertainment venues, and food stores.

### Affected by the Shantou War, Grain Market Prices Have Soared Daily; Hong Kong Government Pays Attention to Regulation; Original Prices Should Be Restored Soon

After the fall of Guangzhou, the residents of Hong Kong relied heavily on Shantou for their food supply, especially vegetables. With the outbreak of war in Shantou, cargo transportation was also cut off. As a result, grain prices in Hong Kong have been affected for the past three days. The market price of various grains has even doubled. Pork, however, has not seen a major change in the market situation due to the ample supply from Guangzhou and Beihai. Similarly, eggs and other items have been continuously supplied from Wenzhou and Guangzhou Bay. The Hong Kong government is paying extraordinary attention to the food supply for residents. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it has been closely monitoring changes in the sources of various grains. The authorities are also deeply concerned about the impact of the Shantou war on grain prices and are currently considering methods of regulation. According to observations by vegetable merchants, the recent increase in vegetable prices is due to the stimulation of the Shantou war, which is unavoidable. Judging from the current situation, the source of vegetables from Guangzhou Bay is expected to increase in the future, and vegetable prices are expected to return to normal soon.

### Another Impact of the Shantou War: War Risk Insurance Premiums Increase, Effective Next Month

Before the outbreak of the war in South China, all goods entering and leaving China used Hong Kong as a hub. Hong Kong exporters are accustomed to insuring their goods with insurance companies based on the value of the goods. In the past, insurance types were limited to water damage and general safety. Since the outbreak of the war, war risk insurance has also been required. War risk insurance premiums are the highest. Previously, the war risk insurance premium was six dollars and twenty-five cents per thousand dollars of goods. Recently, due to the Shantou war, certain insurance companies have jointly discussed raising war risk insurance premiums. If they reach a unanimous agreement, it will be implemented next month, it is said. Furthermore, as × people repeatedly bomb undefended cities in China, goods arriving in China and entering warehouses, or being unloaded from ships, are often attacked. Foreign insurance companies are not responsible for this type of loss. Only a small number of insurance organizations with Chinese capital are willing to take on the greatest risks to encourage import and export trade. They will cover the loss if goods shipped to the mainland via Hong Kong are destroyed by × aircraft within seven days of storage. However, before the goods are transported to the ships, most are on vessels anchored midstream. Although the transfer distance is short, there are still various risks. Accidental events such as typhoons capsizing boats occur frequently in Hong Kong. If a boat is carrying goods, it will inevitably suffer losses. Therefore, Hong Kong trading companies routinely purchase additional insurance from insurance companies when goods are loaded. If an accident occurs on the boat, the insurance company will compensate for the loss. There is no fixed term for this insurance, which merchants find convenient. However, these insurance companies have not been able to accommodate the Hong Kong insurance regulations. If insured goods are on a boat for more than 24 hours, they are not liable for compensation. Export ships are often delayed in arriving in Hong Kong for various reasons. Merchants find it difficult to unload the goods from the boat, which is very inconvenient, it is said.

### Hollywood Actress Glories Deu Leaves Hong Kong After Only a Few Hours: "Traveling in the Orient is Always Risky, With the Danger of Death at Any Moment"

According to her, she had longed for the scenery of the Orient for a long time. When she announced her trip to the East in Hollywood, people there regarded her as mad and said that traveling in the East was a risky undertaking, with the danger of death at any moment, it is said.

### A Yacht Arrives in Hong Kong from Shanghai, The Entire Trip Takes 160 Hours

Mr. Huadiya, a senior official of the former Shanghai French Concession Public Works Department, recently built a steel-hulled yacht in Shanghai. It weighs 65 tons and is 72 feet long, named "Gabrielle II". On the 12th of this month, Mr. Huadiya, along with his assistant Bang Sa and two Shanghai Meteorological Observatory staff members, Weiboao, and five sailors, one public servant, and one cook, set sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong. They arrived safely on Thursday last week and docked opposite the Army Club in Wan Chai. According to Mr. Dai Sa, who spoke to reporters, "When we left Shanghai, the wind was blowing from the southeast. The ship sailed using both sails and motors. Two days later, we arrived at Haitan Island at the mouth of the Taiwan Strait. Due to bad weather, we stayed there for two nights and then continued south. We encountered many merchant ships and steamers along the way. The weather was excellent at first, but then the waves became very large. The ship's speed was five nautical miles. The entire trip from Shanghai to Hong Kong took 160 hours," he said. It is reported that Huadiyas will stay in Hong Kong for a short time and will sail to Vietnam during the day. The yacht is well-equipped and beautiful, with radio, electric ice refrigerator, generators, etc. There are three bedrooms, a bathroom, a dining room, and a kitchen.

### Official News: Old Nickel Coins to be Abolished from August 1st; Total Issue Amounted to 1.63 Million Dollars; After Active Recall, Only 210,000 Dollars Remain

In order to unify the subsidiary currency and eliminate the harm caused by counterfeiters to merchants, the Hong Kong government issued new one-cent and five-cent coins some time ago to replace the old currency in circulation. At the same time, it actively recalled the old currency. To date, the old currency that has been recalled accounts for more than 60% of the total amount. The date for announcing the abolition of the old currency has been repeatedly extended and has not yet been determined. According to official news, the authorities, with the assistance of merchants, have achieved considerable results in recalling the old currency since announcing the recall. It is estimated that the total amount of one-cent and five-cent subsidiary coins issued by the Hong Kong government some time ago was 1.63 million dollars. As of now, nearly 1.4 million has been recalled. Approximately 250,000 dollars are still in circulation in the market. It is expected that another 100,000 dollars can be recalled this month. The remaining 150,000 dollars are expected to have flowed out of Hong Kong, and some may have been lost. The date for abolition has been repeatedly postponed and has not yet been announced. Recently, an instruction has been received from the British government to set August 1st of this year as the date for announcing the abolition. After the announcement, Hong Kong merchants should promptly collect and exchange the old currency to assist the government in completing the entire task of unifying the subsidiary currency, it is said.

### Conflict Erupts Again in the Isolated Army Camp; Two Attempts to Escape Are Prevented by Guards; Fortunately, No Fatalities Occur

The Dongjiang garrison engaged in fierce fighting with the × army in Shenzhen, in the Sino-British border area, last winter. Due to straying off course, they mistakenly entered British territory and were escorted to the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp and detained. Over the course of several months, the isolated army was determined to resist × and dissatisfied with their daily living conditions. Therefore, they often thought of escaping the camp and returning to the country to serve. Three months ago, secret escapes occurred one after another, resulting in deaths from guard shootings, which caused a sensation for a time. Recently, it was discovered that conflicts between the isolated army in the camp and the guards occurred again last week. The authorities dispatched armed police to quell the situation, preventing a major disaster. The above news occurred several days ago, but it was not until yesterday afternoon that reporters obtained official confirmation. The occurrence of this conflict was the third time. When two incidents occurred in succession in a few weeks, the authorities felt that the matter was becoming serious and dispatched more armed police to guard the camp, so that they could stop any disputes at any time. It is heard that the date of the most recent incident was last Friday. A part of the isolated army attempted to secretly leave the camp again, thinking of digging a tunnel to escape, but was stopped by the guards. On Saturday, when the isolated army was exercising in the open space inside the camp, they refused to return to the dormitory and clashed with the guards, using stones as weapons to attack the guards. The situation was quite serious at the time. Fortunately, the armed police arrived quickly to suppress the situation, quickly sent the isolated army back to the dormitory, and added locks, and the matter subsided. On Sunday, a part of the isolated army outside the dormitory thought of escaping again, but was stopped by the armed police. After the repeated incidents, the situation in the camp did not return to calm until this week. The motive for the isolated army's repeated attempts to escape was purely dissatisfaction with the living conditions. The government is now considering moving the isolated army to a more secure location, but for some reason, it has not yet been implemented. However, judging from the repeated unfortunate incidents in the Ma Tau Chung camp, the relocation of the camp is a matter of urgency, it is said.

### Prohibit Opium Completely by the End of Next Year; Li Hanhun Telegraphs Commissioners and County Heads to Complete Smoker Registration by a Deadline

(Shaoguan Quick News) Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun telegraphed each district commissioner's office and instructed the county mayors, stating, "The registration of opium smokers is a fundamental measure for banning opium. Before March of this year, the Civil Affairs Department telegraphed the commissioners to supervise the subordinate counties to earnestly handle the matter. Now, it has been almost two months since this telegram was sent, and the counties have not effectively implemented it, which is extremely lax. It must be understood that the central government's opium ban plan requires the completion of the ban by the end of 1929. Since taking office, I have made the greatest determination to follow the central government's instructions and intensify efforts. Now, the ban period is approaching. If the counties continue to procrastinate and fail to complete the task by the deadline, how can they answer to the central government and the people? You are urgently instructed to immediately supervise your subordinate counties, step up their work, and complete the registration on schedule without any omissions to facilitate implementation. You must also report the progress of compliance."

### Net Underneath the Pole Vault Bar Replaces Sandpit: Invention of an American Veteran Coach; Records May Reach Sixteen Feet

[Los Angeles Dispatch] Mr. Monte Van Maer, a 70-year-old veteran coach of the Southern California Athletic Association, recently, considering that world pole vaulters often suffer injuries upon landing after clearing the bar, as well as the psychological impact on performance, has proposed using a rope net instead of the commonly used sandpit or wood shavings. It is said that after adopting this new method, not only will injuries be reduced, but the world pole vaulting record will likely be increased by several inches or even over a foot. In his decades of coaching experience, Mr. Monte has witnessed pole vaulters fall and get injured numerous times, such as the famous athlete Midu (pole vaulting record holder) of the University of Southern California. Therefore, Mr. Monte has come up with a unique idea, imitating the rope nets used by "trapeze artists" in circuses, and setting up a pole vault landing net. This net has an area of ​​six feet long and ten feet wide, installed on a steel frame with wheels, and rope nets are stretched on the steel frame. The net is about eight feet above the ground, so those who fail to clear the bar can still run through under the net without accidents. Mr. Monte believes that after the danger of falling from a high altitude is eliminated, the current world record of fourteen feet, eleven and three-fifths inches will undoubtedly be raised to sixteen feet.

### From Ancient Greek Negotiations to Various Aspects of the Olympic Movement

— Ding Lao

—One of the Most Valuable Histories of Sports—

Thus, the ancient Greek Olympic Games were revived. This is the reason for the modern international games. We can say that the revival of the Olympic spirit is the most effective education policy in modern times. Therefore, the second half of the nineteenth century, known as the era of Physical Renaissance, stands in contrast to the literary Renaissance of the fifteenth century, and has equivalent value in the history of human evolution. In 1886, the world began to organize sports associations. Five years later, the Pan Achaean Athetic Assaciation was organized. When Coubertin held a meeting in Paris in 1894, Trikups, a politician who had served as Prime Minister of Greece three times, was worried about financial difficulties and abandoned the railway project from Athens to Salonika. However, he made every effort to advocate holding the first conference in Greece for the international competition. Coulerin prepared a budget of 35,000 Greek coins, intending to seek donations from Prince Constantine, but all failed. It was not until Triknpi resigned that the plan was realized. The venue was funded by the Greek tycoon Aucroff with 20,000 Greek coins and built entirely of marble. Thus, the festival of Atticus (a friend of Emperor Hadrian) in 121 BC was revived, which was from April 5th to 13th, 1896.

In modern times, European sports are roughly formed in three core styles: German popular gymnastics associations Turuverein, Swedish school gymnastics, and British athletic sports.

From the 14th to the 16th of August one thousand and nine hundred and ninety six, the conference was held again for three days to coordinate the five days starting from July 3rd, 1897. In the complete Gymnastics Alliance in Russces Fcdcratf On Ecl c c Bc Gzmn astipuc (Ecegi chc Turntud), Akcrus was elected as the chairman of the standing committee, agreeing on the main points of the gymnastics alliance, publishing gymnastics publications, exchanging documents with each other, and receiving gatherings of nationals from various countries, completely separating the religious and political meanings, only recognizing the participation of national institutions, without the rules of participation conditions.
