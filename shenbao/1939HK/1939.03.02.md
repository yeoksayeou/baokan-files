### Beware of the Aggressors' Conspiracy

London, 27th - Reuters transmission of a "Daily Express" report states: "The Japanese government has now taken a completely unexpected step towards peace with China. Japan has suggested to the Chinese side that a new government be organized with Chairman Chiang in an important position. If the Chongqing side accepts this suggestion, the majority of Japanese troops in central and southern China will withdraw..." The spread of peace rumors has happened more than once or twice. Upon examining the inner workings, it is nothing more than the conspiracy of the aggressors. To say that the Chinese authorities, amidst the extreme effects of the brutal war of aggression, still have the possibility of making peace halfway is truly absurd and akin to a fool's dream.

What we must pay special attention to regarding this kind of news is the common conspiracy of Eastern and Western aggressors. It is indeed a fact that the Japanese aggressors, because the planned operational period is nearing its end (originally intended to end the war in one year and organize the occupied territories in one year), are eager to end the Sino-Japanese War. However, they must obtain the full price for which the war of aggression was fought before they will give up. Recently, they originally intended to take advantage of the Franco troops approaching French territory and the opportunity for Germany and Italy to restrain Britain and France to seize the price of the nine months of the war of aggression. Therefore, recently, in addition to occupying Hainan Island, they have also created a serious situation in the Shanghai concessions, and there have also been more active military actions on the northern and southern battlefields. Various strongholds along the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong are also within their calculations. However, the situation has unexpectedly turned against Japan's intentions. Britain and France have sought to stabilize the European situation by recognizing the Franco government, and Japan has lost the conditions to demand a price through further coercion. Therefore, it wants to use its political conspiracy to compensate.

If we examine the joint military and diplomatic conference that Germany, Italy, and Japan are holding in Berlin, it is not difficult to think of another basis for this peace rumor. Although Hitler hopes that Japan will "conquer" Asia, he especially desires that Japan has sufficient strength to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the Sino-Japanese War expanded to Wuhan, Germany repeatedly warned Japan not to consume too much strength. Among Germany's targets of aggression, Ukraine occupies a very important position, but Germany cannot attack Ukraine without Japan's response in the East. The issue of the Soviet-Japanese fishing agreement has now reached a critical stage, and what kind of incidents will occur during the April fishing season is something that no one can predict. Hitler cannot ignore this opportunity, and he cannot help but warn Japan again: end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible!

Because of the easing of the European situation, and Japan losing the use of military threats to guarantee the construction of Hainan Island, Japan has no choice but to use the strategy of appeasing Britain and France to allow the United States to maintain its military construction on Hainan Island, in order to complete the two iron fists in the future Pacific War—Taiwan and Hainan Island. The Japanese aircraft bombing the Hong Kong New Territories as a test has met with British resistance. The issue of sending warships to Hainan Island has also been put on the agenda of the British Parliament. France, in order to protect Guangzhou Bay and Annam's territories, is naturally paying more attention to the issue of Hainan Island. Under this situation, Japan has no choice but to use deceptive means to appease Britain and France. It is believed that Japan still needs some time to decide to provoke a Pacific war, waiting for its naval construction in the Pacific to become more complete.

What we should pay special attention to regarding every peace rumor is the conditions for inducing surrender proposed by Japan. In a situation where the Japanese government has repeatedly declared that it does not recognize our national government as a negotiating counterpart, and has repeatedly slandered the highest leader of our resistance against Japan, the sudden emergence of news that "Japan has suggested to the Chinese side that a new government be organized with Chairman Chiang in an important position, and if the Chongqing side accepts this suggestion, the majority of Japanese troops in central and southern China will withdraw" is indeed a bit peculiar. Even if this news is reliable, we must never trust Japan's proposal. The Japanese aggressors have no credibility whatsoever, as the Italian Fanci Pai, who was in the Japanese military and political circles and participated in confidential work, said: "...I don't believe the Japanese military at all. Their saying they are friends with China and friends with other countries is unreliable." We have been fooled by Japan many times in the past few decades. At this critical juncture of survival, we must be more vigilant against the political conspiracy of the aggressors to induce surrender and resolutely stick to the idea of striving for final victory.

Japan is still deceiving the world, especially Britain and France. Japan's hope for this peace is intended to have Britain and France take the field for it. If Britain, America, and France harbor illusions of mediation, then they will be greatly fooled by Japan. Today, Japan is appeasing Britain, America, and France in order to complete the construction of Hainan Island. When its Pacific naval construction is completely successful in the future, it will inevitably turn around and drive the forces of Britain, America, and France out of the Pacific. Japan's existence today is all caused by the deception of the world's major powers. As Fanci Pai said: "Japan's prosperity is all caused by the excessive encouragement of European and American countries, and Britain should be particularly responsible..." "They (referring to Japan) are starting an arrogant boast, and allowing them to boast is indeed a pessimistic thing" (Fanci's talk in Hong Kong). Today, Britain, America, and France should increase their efforts, firstly to make Japan give up Hainan Island; secondly, to make the Japanese troops withdraw entirely from Chinese territory and restore the situation before "September 18th."

### The War in Western Shanxi

— Guo Congzhou

[Chongqing Hang Telegraph of the Central News Agency] The Fen River and the Lüliang Mountains, naturally forming this area of western Shanxi, the Guancen Mountains that oversee the northwest, are the source of the Fen River, flowing south through Jingle, Yangqu, receiving the Dongshui on the left, and the Wenguhe on the right, crossing Xinjiang and turning west, flowing into the Yellow River at Hejin, which is the second largest tributary of the Yellow River, about 690 kilometers long, forming the "Fen River Land and Sea." The Lüliang Mountains connect to the Guancen Mountains in the north, running vertically between the Yellow River and the Fen River, stopping at the Longmen Mountains by the river. The Lüliang Mountains and its tributaries make western Shanxi a complex "block mountain area."

After the withdrawal from Linfen last March, the counties in western Shanxi also successively fell into the hands of the enemy. However, after a very short period, we finally repelled the occupying enemy troops and successively recovered the counties. However, the Datong-Puzhou Railway in the east, the Fenli Line in the north, and the Wanjiang, Jishan, and Hejin in the south are all in the hands of the enemy. In this way, western Shanxi is in a situation of being surrounded by the enemy on three sides. Despite this, we have restored and consolidated the regime in this area, established guerrilla bases, and become the political and military center supporting the war of resistance in Shanxi. Obviously, this is a major threat to the enemy's rear.

What are the enemy's intentions in launching an offensive against western Shanxi in the past month?

First, to advance into the Lüliang Mountains and "break the political center" (a slogan of the enemy during the "Eight Route Army Encirclement" of Jixian last spring), in order to "mop up" the Lüliang Mountains guerrilla base. Recently, the slogan found by the enemy in Damaigou is "Down with the county government, mop up the guerrillas," which is very clear evidence.

Second, the Datong-Puzhou Railway is often damaged by our army, and the rear communications are constantly threatened. They attempt to build a highway along the west bank of the Fen River, open up another transportation line, control the various ferries of the Fen River, and cut off the connection between eastern and western Shanxi. At the same time, they invade Guxian County in western Shanxi, block the various mountain passes east of the Lüliang Mountains on one side, and repair the semicircular highway of Fenyang-Xixian-Daning-Puxian-Linfen on the other side, which is connected to the Fenxi Highway, in order to increase reinforcements and suppress the activities of our army in the Lüliang Mountains at all times.

Third, south of Hukou on the Yellow River and north of Shijiatan, the inner waterway is narrow and the current is swift. Every year in winter, ice forms. The enemy plans to use the "ice bridge" to cross the river and seize northern Shaanxi, restrain our army, and coordinate with its "fourth-phase operation center" to attack Lanzhou strategically.

Therefore, at the beginning of December of last year, the enemy mobilized the garrison troops on the Datong-Puzhou Line, starting from Xianning in the north and ending at Quhou in the south, and generally crossed the Fen River to invade the west. At that time, our army east and west of the railway immediately cooperated to attack. Except for the Wulong Palace, which was worth 300,000 yuan, being burned down by the enemy, the enemy did not gain anything. Soon after, western Shanxi had heavy snowfall, and the roads were blocked, and the enemy's plan temporarily subsided. However, the enemy's offensive is still being prepared, constantly increasing the number of troops along the Datong-Puzhou Line. It is estimated that about 6,700 in Fenyang and Xiaoyi, 3,000 in Hongtong and Zhaocheng, 3,000 in Quwo, Houma, and Xinjiang, and 2,000 in Hejin and Jishan are invading the west in a big way. The second offensive started on December 24th. (To be continued)

### Selected Essays from This Newspaper's Middle School Student Essay Competition – The Issue of Middle School Students' Work for National Salvation During Winter Vacation – First Place, Zhang Dalian, Zhiyong Middle School

What is valuable in a middle school student in China is known to everyone, especially now during this time of resisting the violent enemy. We do not know how many of our schools have been bombed and burned down; we do not know how many middle school students have suffered misfortunes, carrying their knowledge—knowledge that ordinary people rarely obtain—without contributing even a little to our country, falling by the roadside, lying under collapsed roofs, quietly dying. Or wandering around, unable to find their classrooms. Under these circumstances, what responsibilities will we, the fortunate survivors, shoulder towards national salvation?

We know many things that many people do not know. We really should do what we should do to the best of our ability. However, we are just people receiving education. Because of this, we lack sufficient time. But now the winter vacation is here. This is a good opportunity to exert our full strength. We should seize it tightly.

If, before the winter vacation arrives, we first allocate time and establish a work plan, and then implement it step by step according to this plan, then our work will be systematic, and its effect will definitely be much better than doing it scattered and randomly:

For the national salvation work of our middle school students during the winter vacation, we can divide it into two parts to discuss.

First, many people regard national salvation work as superficial, only thinking that carrying burdens and running to the battlefield, or at least doing the work of organizing and training the masses, or doing propaganda and fundraising, can be considered national salvation work, and fundamentally neglecting the importance of self-improvement. We fully understand that "nation-building will succeed" is closely followed by "resistance war will succeed." If we do not educate ourselves to become the most needed and most useful people in the nation-building period, on whose shoulders will the responsibility of nation-building be placed? And just say in the most immediate resistance war. We need to take up the work of organizing training and propaganda. Is what we know enough to cope with all this and be able to do it very well? This is easy to understand, the answer must be "no." If we ourselves do not have a clear understanding of the War of Resistance, how can we grasp the center of propaganda, and not just shout: "We want to resist the War!" this empty talk? If we cannot analyze and see through current affairs, are we just reading newspapers to people who do not know how to read? If we do not lay a good theoretical foundation for ourselves, how can we organize and train the masses? Do we use an algebraic formula or geometry as the best education? But if you have no way to organize them and go among them, how do you learn?

These questions have clearly told us the importance of self-education in the entire work of national salvation, and it itself must be one of the main tasks of national salvation. In the world facing us, and in this great era, there is too much we need to learn. We do not deny the education that schools give us, which is the main basis for determining the belief that "the nation will succeed." And self-education, whether in the stage of resistance or nation-building, is the most needed and most useful thing.

A person does not need to, and cannot, create an all-rounder. However, in order to adapt to the needs of this objective environment, our knowledge should be multifaceted. All events and academics have their philosophical points of view and basis. Therefore, if we do not have a clear understanding of philosophy, everything we do may be wrong, or at least lack its "soul." Social science, and other books on various theories of resistance, are piled full in bookstores. Usually, due to time constraints, people cannot read them. During this winter vacation, although we cannot read many, it is at least a great opportunity to read. Another very important point is that our attitude towards reading these books should be research-oriented and critical.

If you have several like-minded friends, you can organize a reading seminar. Present a book and have everyone study and discuss it. In this way, not only can everyone guide each other and help each other, so that they can get more benefits, but everyone can also borrow books from each other, and it is also a good way to borrow books!

In addition to this, many people have overlooked one thing, that is, not only is self-criticism the best and most effective self-education, whether in the nation or for individuals. After a job, or at a certain stage, make a general review of your previous work. Keep the good ones forever, and criticize and improve the wrong ones as much as possible. The implementation of this method requires extreme sincerity, frankness, and the greatest enthusiasm for the work. The adoption of this method can make a group more united and work more perfect. The same is true for individuals.

Second, the work of national salvation to the outside world.

The first issue we need to pay attention to is the environmental issue. The environments of each person in each place are different. At the same time, the way we carry out our work is also different. There is no need to choose a better environment. Everyone is on their own post. Moreover, in addition to grasping the environment and adapting to the environment, if we feel that this environment is not good, we must also use various techniques to change this environment.

For the various ways of external national salvation work, there is no need to talk about them all. Just divide them into two aspects: group and individual.

Here, there is no need to exaggerate. To tell the truth, there are still many people around us who are still confused or hold war-weary ideas. However, since they are people of the same country, the same race, and the same world as us, they still have their value in this peaceful war of resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for someone to persuade them. If we encounter an opportunity, we can unceremoniously take on this responsibility. But are we just waiting for the opportunity forever? Absolutely not. At times, we can talk to our friends in letters, but a more effective method is to discuss it face to face. And isn't this winter vacation a good time for us to hold individual talks? Some people have the mistaken idea that such time-consuming trivial matters are not worth doing. Then he underestimates the value of this individual talk. Such talks first give people a sense of intimacy, and do not make them have a bad preconceived notion of you. The less he considers you to be doing propaganda, the greater the effect of your propaganda. It is not so important to people you don't know. If the opponent is a friend, encourage him with frank friendship and move him with true theories. Isn't the effect imaginable? And if you overcome and train a member of the knowledge class, isn't this value greater?

Personal work of this kind can be implemented anytime and anywhere.

As for group activities, the scope is wider in terms of both form and content. During a short week-long winter vacation, it is not easy to have a lot of work. This should be noticed when planning in advance. Only seek the quality of its excellence, and do not seek the abundance of its quantity. There is no need to arrange too much work, and make the work outline only an unfulfilled "bad check."

If there were any organizations in the school, it is best not to let it stop its life with the end of the semester, but let it continue to live on the students. In this way, we can save ourselves the trouble of organizing it again, and make the work of the winter vacation and the work during the semester continuous, and continue until the second semester. In this way, not only can we keep working even in the shortest time, but also its significance is greater in the entire student movement and national salvation movement.

However, if there was no organization in the school, we now have to organize a group according to our ability and interest and devote ourselves to one or two national salvation works. Although we may have a slight pause during the organization period, we can extend its life to the next semester and extend it forever until we reach our final goal. Do as much as you can during the winter vacation.

The country has nurtured us, and we dedicate everything to the country; we are a member of the Chinese nation, and dedicate everything to our nation; we live in this world, and dedicate everything to this world. This is beyond doubt!

For true peace, for our eternal survival, we must make our greatest efforts and enthusiasm, not care about all the difficulties and blows, not delay a minute of time, and advance towards the future of resistance and national salvation.

### The Problem of Middle School Students in National Salvation Work: Second Place, Huang Shizhen, True Light Girls' School

——Review and Preparation That Should Be Done During This Winter Vacation

The purpose of the essay contest held by Shen Bao this time is to set a topic within the scope of "the issue of middle school students' national salvation work during this winter vacation." I believe that focusing solely on the work aspect is still unavoidable to fall into "empty talk," because in reality, the winter vacation period is very short. No matter where you are, it is fundamentally impossible to produce work with significant results. Even if you are just preparing, school will already be starting. In that case, even if there is a very rich and comprehensive work plan, it is just a good-looking article, and it is difficult to target the "current situation." Even if we take a step back, there are still things that can be done later, but based on observations over the past year, the progress of national salvation work is truly not in line with the progress of the war of resistance. This is a major obstacle to achieving victory. What are the reasons for this mismatch? Apart from insufficient objective conditions, solely from the perspective of subjective conditions, the general student body itself has many problems in their work. Since these problems have been discovered in the work, they should be immediately corrected. So, if no other work can be done during this very short winter vacation, this period should be used as an opportunity for reflection and improvement. The actual situation should be like this, so this article also uses this as a topic and bases its argument on this.

We must first discuss what position middle school students occupy on the front lines of the war of resistance and national salvation, and then we can see how serious our mistakes are, and further know what we should improve and prepare. Let us see how important the position of middle school students is on the front lines of the war of resistance and national salvation:

From the perspective of the number of middle school students nationwide, they can exert a significant portion of strength in the nationwide mobilization.

From the perspective of level (including knowledge and ability), they can do the work of enlightening the general masses of farmers and workers, and lead them.

From the perspective of physical fitness, they are all young and strong youth. If they directly participate in combat units, they are also a large group of elite soldiers.

Based on the above three points, we can know how powerful the inherent potential of middle school students is. If this power can be fully developed, it will not only strengthen the front lines of the war of resistance and national salvation, but also accelerate the collapse of the enemy and propel our country towards the final stage of victory.

During the past eighteen months of the war of resistance, the facts tell us that some middle school students have made the greatest efforts and left indelible achievements in the history of the war. For example, directly participating in the ranks of the war of resistance, they appeared very actively on the battlefield and in guerrilla areas, inflicting significant blows on the enemy. Some, after receiving various trainings, served with the army. Regardless of life or death, they went in and out of gunfire, rescuing wounded soldiers; undertaking tasks such as eliminating traitors and transporting supplies, cooperating with the army in combat. Others established national salvation organizations in the less disturbed rear areas, enthusiastically engaged in propaganda, fundraising, persuading people to buy government bonds, donating money, comforting soldiers, and rescuing refugees. All of these can prove that some middle school students have indeed fulfilled their responsibilities and lived up to the country's education.

But conversely, what about the majority of middle school students who were originally in safe areas, and those who moved to safe areas from the occupied areas? Taking Hong Kong as an example, what is mostly manifested are:

(1) Studying textbooks to death, seeking good grades, without caring about the survival of the country. These people believe that studying desperately is fulfilling the duty of a student.

(2) Various national salvation organizations are nominal and peter out. At meetings, they are enthusiastic and speak loudly; the work plans are full of paper. In the end, they disappear without a trace.

(3) After purchasing bonds and donating money, they do not ask about other things, believing that this is fulfilling the responsibility of a citizen. It seems as if they have contributed money, and others have to contribute their efforts, and in the end, victory can be bought with their own money.

(4) The various comfort items made are not practical. For example, the cotton clothes are too thin, and the knitted gloves are too loose, and cannot keep out the cold. They only create large numbers, which are touching and sensational in propaganda.

(5) During concentrated military training, many cannot endure hardship; some even sneak back to Hong Kong as soon as they enter the camp.

(6) Having been stimulated by the environment, they still cannot overcome various temptations, and still go to entertainment venues in large numbers, or play at romance.

From these things, we can also see how serious the mistakes are manifested by the middle school students who occupy an important position on the front lines of the war of resistance. Lacking self-reflection, lacking correction, lacking training—their understanding of the war of resistance is still insufficient, and they lack political cultivation, so they cannot overcome laziness and complacency, and the habit of seeking temporary ease.

We have already said that the winter vacation is very short, and most schools only know what the mistakes are, which does not help future work. Knowing but not being able to correct or replenish is the same mistake as not knowing where the mistake lies. Therefore, I believe that exploring one's own problems is more important than forcing oneself to do a few days of external work without results, and this is indeed a part of national salvation work, and can also be said to be the foundation of national salvation work.

So, what exactly should we do during this winter vacation that will benefit future work? In general, there should be the following items:

First, convene a review meeting among students at the school to conduct a self-criticism of the entire national salvation work in the past. Strictly point out all kinds of efforts and errors, and publicize them as a basis for improvement. After this team is formed, it should be transformed into a supervisory body. After school starts and various national salvation work continues, it will urge its improvement and reduce future defects.

Second, establish a forum. Gather together for two hours each day to discuss various international and domestic issues, increasing our understanding of all aspects. Don't just listen to what others say; we must use our own ability to think and observe to analyze and judge.

Third, students from various schools can voluntarily arrange three or five times during the winter vacation to invite people everyone believes in to speak on various issues that everyone does not understand, providing guidance in thinking.

Fourth, hold reading groups regularly. Students participating in this group can voluntarily contribute money to purchase books about the war of resistance and other knowledge that the school library does not have, and distribute them to everyone immediately. Decide that each person should read at least a certain number of books during this vacation, and stipulate that meetings should be convened at appropriate times to discuss the knowledge gained from the books. At the same time, fully apply general correct theories and understandings to every specific issue.

Fifth, organize visiting teams or investigation teams to investigate the internal situation of various refugee camps and various national salvation organizations, to know what is needed, and to know how others' work is generally done, in order to improve their own work efficiency.

The few things mentioned above are easy to carry out in a short period of time, and are most likely to be effective on one's own. In this winter vacation of just over ten days, I think the most practical work is only these.

In terms of the current environment, work that truly contributes to the war of resistance cannot be completed in a dozen days, even if it is done, it should not be done blindly and confusedly. If you think that you should continue to do what you did in the past, then you will waste time and energy, and the results will not help the progress of the war of resistance. We must know that review and reform are important steps in the work in progress, and also elements of success, especially in national salvation work, which occupies a foundational position. Since the short winter vacation cannot fully develop the abilities of middle school students, then why not seize this opportunity, work hard to correct the defects in the work, and more thoroughly enrich ourselves, strengthen self-training, become a solid soldier, and then engage in arduous struggles? If middle school students can first thoroughly understand the problems in their own work, then the national salvation work they do will be effective and valuable. I hope that the leaders and classmates will point out this idea.

### Our Army Reinforces Henan and Hubei; Enemy's Western Offensives in Central Hubei Suffer Heavy Blows; Large-Scale Guerrilla Warfare in Hebei and Shandong

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] Shaanxi Telegram: The enemy's offensive in central Hubei is an attempt to contain our forces so that they can attack our guerrilla units on the north bank of the Yellow River. However, our military has had meticulous plans for a long time. In addition to increasing our forces to inflict heavy blows on the enemy's western offensives in central Hubei, we have also sent reinforcements to a certain place to prevent the enemy's westward offensive from eastern Henan. The enemy now wants to repair roads outside the railway lines in various key points in Hebei and Shandong in order to control the overall situation, reduce worries about the rear, and then seek to invade the northwest. However, we have launched large-scale guerrilla warfare in Hebei, Shandong, and northern Henan, destroying roads and demolishing cities everywhere, shattering the enemy's plans. Although the enemy has three divisions in Shandong Province, they have attacked us every day for more than a month. We avoid the real and attack the empty, and carry out patrol operations, which eventually put the enemy in a difficult situation and failed to break through. The new line of defense in our various places, southern Hebei, has been constantly fought for more than 20 days since February 9. Nangong and other places have been entered and exited four times. Although the battle situation on the front line has not been reported in detail due to transportation reasons, the enemy has indeed been exhausted, and the Pinghan and Daoqing roads have been destroyed by us from time to time. We will make great progress in the short term. Although the enemy in southwestern Shanxi has slightly increased, it is still transferred from other places. Our river defense is extremely strong, and there is no possibility of sneaking across.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] Guizhou Telegram: There are only local contacts in various places in South China. Near Guangzhou, along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and between Zengcheng and Conghua, our guerrilla units are constantly engaged in fierce battles with the enemy. The enemy has not increased on Hainan Island recently. Our security team and the people's militia guerrilla everywhere, capturing quite a few.

[Central News Agency, Lian County, 28th] At 12:00 noon on the 27th, four enemy planes dropped more than a dozen bombs in and around Beihai, sinking one ship. Deaths and injuries are unknown.

[Central News Agency, Lian County, 1st] Our guerrillas in the Sanshui, Nanhai, and Shunde areas have achieved close contact. In the past ten days, they have launched attacks on the enemy one after another, which have been very successful. The enemy in Foshan, Lanshi, Sanshui, Jiujiang, and Heqing and other places are extremely threatened. In order to cope with the surprise attacks of our guerrillas, a large number of plainclothes people have been arranged to form multiple guerrilla teams to search everywhere, but they are not familiar with the terrain and their movements are sluggish. They have been discovered and annihilated by us in large numbers in recent days.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 1st] The enemy troops in the Xinjie and Xinminbu areas of Hua County were attacked by our division. The troops launched a surprise attack. The enemy fought back in a panic. Our army bravely defended and killed more than 70 enemy troops. By the 26th, the enemy retreated to Daling.

[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 1st] The enemy plainclothes team in Nanzhangdian Town, Xia County, raided the Gucheng Village area (southeast of Zhangdian) around noon yesterday, shelling Yaotou Village (north of Zhangdian), firing dozens of shots in total. At the same time, a part of the enemy fled to Qianhoutan (south of Luodian), all of which were repelled by our army.

[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 28th] At 10:25 a.m. on the 28th, three enemy planes passed through Daqingguan to Wangjiazhuang, dropping more than 20 bombs. We suffered no losses. At 11:00 a.m., they passed through Chaoyi Sanhekou and returned to the east. At 11:50 a.m., an enemy plane scouted the Daqingguan, Tongguan, and Sanhekou areas, and then fled to Shanxi Province.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] The pseudo-Mongolian army (Sedeng Norbu) department, accompanied by enemy special agent Ijiye, was active in Baotou Ningyikezhao League on the 21st. When they met our army in Hangpai, Sedeng immediately led his troops to revolt and surrender. Our military authorities gave them accommodation and reorganized them.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 1st] According to the Japanese spokesman, the number of battles between the Japanese army and the guerrillas has decreased slightly recently. For example, heavy troops are stationed in Jinghu, Bengbu, Wuhu, Hangzhou and other places as bases for mechanized units. In other occupied areas, only a small number of Japanese troops are stationed. However, foreign observers here said that the new strategy of the Japanese army is extremely unfavorable because a small number of important strongholds are stationed with troops, the transportation lines in the inland occupied areas are tantamount to being abandoned. No wonder the Jinghu Railway is often interrupted by Chinese guerrillas.

### Chaotic Situation in Guangzhou: Rape, Abduction, Arson, and Killing Occur Almost Every Day; Enemy Recruits Pseudo-Police Who Dare Not Fire Guns

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 28th] It is heard that the situation in the city is still chaotic, with rape, abduction, arson, and killing occurring almost every evening. Several foreign shops have been affected. The bandits are all carrying firearms, and the pseudo-police are only holding wooden sticks, which are of no help.

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 28th] The pseudo "Maintenance Association" decided to continue to increase the number of pseudo-police by 500. Recruitment has now been announced. All training matters are presided over by the Japanese military police. No firearms will be distributed this month, only a wooden stick will be given.

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 28th] The pseudo "Public Security Maintenance Association" supported by the Japanese here recently found that there were too many gambling dens here, and it was difficult to control them. Therefore, it has now temporarily banned business and is planning a tax system in Hengji in order to obtain a large amount of gambling tax. Once the decision is made, the gambling dens will reopen.

### Passport Issued for Wang Jingwei to Go to Europe; Travel Expenses Reach 200,000 Yuan

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] The passports for Wang Jingwei, Chen Bijun, and Zeng Zhongming to go abroad have been issued by the competent authorities. They are traveling in name, and all countries in the European continent have been filled in. The travel expenses are 200,000, which is given by a certain important person. However, after Wang received the passport, he was still surrounded by his entourage and could not leave in the short term.

### Hunan Provincial Assembly Postponed

[Central News Agency, Yuanling, 1st] The Hunan Provisional Provincial Assembly was previously ordered to be postponed to March 1 due to insufficient preparation. Later, due to the reorganization of the provincial government and the fact that the resumes of candidates sent by counties far away from the province had not arrived, a request was specially submitted to the Executive Yuan to postpone the formation to April 1.

### Enemy Bombs Haifeng

[Central News Agency, Shantou, 1st] Haifeng Telegram: At 11:00 a.m. on the 27th, an enemy plane flew into the county airspace. After circling slightly, it dropped four bombs, all of which landed on wasteland. At 10:00 a.m., an enemy ship arrived in Shanwei, dropped five speedboats, burned eight fishing boats and sailboats, and then sailed west. There are currently no enemy ships in Linghai.

### Chongqing-Kunming Long-Distance Telephone Officially Opens

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Kunming, 1st] The long-distance telephone between Chongqing and Kunming officially opened on the 1st.

### The Situation in Shanghai Slightly Relaxes, but the Situation in Tianjin is Tense Again; Enemy Builds Roads to Surround the British and French Concessions; Authorities of Various Countries Closely Watch the Development of the Situation

### Auspicious Clouds Covering Changsha

— Special Correspondent, Geng Ya, of this Newspaper

Changsha, generously referred to as having "only taken a fiery bath," naturally has many people with a particularly transcendent imagination—they believe that Changsha's location makes it nearly impossible to avoid being sacrificed or destroyed in this war of resistance. This is not to say that our scorched-earth policy allows us to sacrifice it at will; it is to say that the *'s brutality and indiscriminate burning and killing means that they certainly will not easily let go of the provincial capital, the essence of Hunan. Therefore, Changsha seems destined for a certain fate, though not to be reduced to ashes by the *'s arson like Shanghai and Nanjing, it will inevitably suffer like Guilin and Guiyang from indiscriminate bombing and burning by * planes. In any case, it will not easily maintain its golden integrity.

Furthermore, they also believe that although Changsha is now destroyed, the scorched earth still belongs to us. As the ancients said, "With land comes wealth." They also said, "The country is built by the people." In the future, what kind of fashionable new clothes shall we dress this Changsha, which has just suffered grievances and undergone a "fiery bath"? What kind of healthy and beautiful figure shall we cultivate it into? This is entirely in our hands and not difficult at all.

There are also a few individual surveys of the disaster victims' consciousness. The important excerpts are noted below:

"If they hadn't added fuel to the fire later, the houses in our area wouldn't have burned so badly; moreover, nothing happened on the first night..." A middle-aged disaster victim surnamed Wang sighed and said; but his words were interrupted by a vendor setting up a stall on the spot:

"Is that still worth saying? How many banknotes and receipts from the ×× Bank couldn't be moved out and were burned anyway!"

"The bank—that's public property!"

"Public property? Public money is still national money!"

"That's right, whether public or private, having a little more money is good for fighting the *s a little harder!" The one surnamed Wang, as if newly enlightened, turned the conversation back to the center of the war of resistance: "Originally, I didn't engage in useless regret for the accomplished fact of the fire. However, we must grieve the magnitude of the loss from this fire. Everyone should grit their teeth, try their best to recover, those who can resume business should resume business quickly to strive for production; those who cannot resume business should quickly organize to help the resistance forces carry the wounded soldiers!"

Of course, in fact, there will never be a large number of wounded soldiers needing thousands and tens of thousands of disaster victims to organize stretcher teams to transport them. However, in the mouths of ordinary people, the phrase "carry the wounded soldiers" cannot be viewed too simplistically. It is full of enthusiasm, including all departments of wartime labor that the people can do! If we can guide and train them appropriately, wouldn't we be adding a new force to the battlefield service?

"Police officer! During the last fire, I don't think you would have retreated completely as generally rumored, right?" I politely asked a police officer standing guard.

"No? We were just transferred from other places to serve. We dare not say what the situation was like during the fire, but many of our comrades have vowed to avenge the past injustice. In the long days ahead, if we encounter an emergency situation again, every post our police put out will be like an iron tree planted with deep roots, blooming and dying there—we will never make the same joke as last time."

What is the mission of the police in extraordinary times? It seems that it depends on the situation at the time and cannot be rigidly demanded of them; but it must be said that their ability to have this new, clear-cut, and conscious determination is a commendable cleansing given to them by the fire.

From a large circle of burned-out courtyards, two innocent girls ran out, about eleven or twelve years old, chasing each other, simply kicking the rubble on the ground with a loud crash. Looking into the courtyard along the line they ran out of, there were two or three factory sheds leaning against the wall. In the courtyard were stone flower terraces, broken flower pots, and charred embers of flowers and trees. In the past, it must have been a refined household.

"Little friends, are you still so happy? Look at your houses..."

"Um! This—what does it matter? As long as the front lines win victories, as long as we drive away the Japanese *s, that's better than living in the "Imperial Palace"...' Before she finished speaking, she jumped and ran back into the courtyard.

They were as lively and alert as two clever birds, and I wished I could pull them back to talk a few more words; however, "fragrance doesn't need to be plentiful," these few words are enough. Stalin said, "Youth and children are our hope, our future." So, how far-reaching will the future of our national liberation war be? And how much more glorious will the new China growing up be in the future? It is not difficult to imagine and obtain its symbolism from the vigilant conversation of these two little birds.

Also: When the reporter arrived in Changsha and when he left, it was both at four o'clock in the morning. In the darkness, he turned and turned through many streets. What was particularly special was: he never heard a single rooster crowing, but as soon as the east turned white, whether near or far, in broken walls and ruined courtyards, or in ancient temples in the countryside, the loud military bugle would suddenly blow out and the majestic songs would start, causing the whole of "sleepy-eyed" Changsha, it seemed, to tremble! Then, "light" stood on the post of "darkness"! What else does this symbolize? Of course, it is even easier to imagine.

Mr. Gu Ren, a Western doctor who is in charge of Xiangya Hospital, and Misses Fei and Han, although they are blue-eyed and blond, are very sympathetic to our war of resistance. They help us treat wounded soldiers and the poor and sick for free. Because they do not have enough manpower, they are so tired that they even have to cut back on their meal times, but they are very happy. They are always smiling when they see people!

Once, Mr. Tian Han published an article "China's Medical Education," saying that foreigners like Mr. Gu Ren and Misses Fei and He are righteously helping us rescue wounded soldiers, but our own doctors and nurses with medical experience have fled far away. Can they betray their conscience?

When Mr. Gu Ren saw this article, he smiled from ear to ear and said to people: "The original intention of learning medicine is to help the world and save people. Misses Fei, He, and I have been serving Chinese society for many years. Now that China is fighting Japan's fascism for world peace, human justice, and national liberation, we will certainly do our best to assist, so as to adhere to our original intentions. However, we apologize for our weak ability and inability to provide extensive relief; we are still praised by public opinion, how dare we be worthy of it!" A few days later, the hospital added a ward and hired a doctor and four nurses.

——Overall, the various phenomena after the robbery in Changsha, as well as the psychology of ordinary citizens, although seemingly disparate and unrelated, in spirit, they have a common ideology, that is, everyone unanimously wants to support the long-term resistance to the war, striving for final victory and seeking compensation from Japanese fascists for all the losses and sacrifices of the Changsha fire! Moreover, the symbols of the final victory that must belong to us are emerging endlessly, already visibly forming a fresh and auspicious aura in the air above the scorched earth!

### Fierce Debate in the British House of Commons: Attlee Fiercely Criticizes the Prime Minister; Chamberlain Responds Eloquently; Motion of Censure Ultimately Rejected

[Reuters London, 1st] Yesterday, Clement Attlee, the leader of the anti-government faction of the British Labour Party, introduced a motion of censure against the government, questioning Chamberlain's authority to unilaterally recognize the Spanish rebel government. He also criticized Chamberlain for not notifying the House of Commons in advance regarding the recognition of the rebel government, and stated that Chamberlain had opposed further investigation of the matter this week. Chamberlain interjected, "At the time, I meant that I could not answer immediately because I had not been notified in advance." Attlee continued, stating that Chamberlain wanted to defend his actions with a partial truth, and that this partial truth was even more hateful than a lie. Chamberlain stated that the part of Spain controlled by the current Spanish government is very weak, but the Spanish government still has power and possesses an army of 500,000 men. Chamberlain's disregard for international law is unmatched by anyone. It is unknown what guarantees Chamberlain obtained to ensure that Franco would not immediately join the Berlin-Rome Axis after being recognized. Chamberlain replied that he had not heard such a fierce attack on an individual in a long time. He reminded the House of Commons that the debaters belong to the most important issue, and turning the discussion of important issues into personal attacks seems to hinder your dignity. Chamberlain denied that he had obscured the House of Commons on Monday to avoid debate regarding Attlee's accusations. Attlee frankly stated that French Prime Minister Daladier told the French Assembly on February 24 that the British government had decided to recognize the Franco government. Chamberlain replied that what Attlee said was not true. Chamberlain then read Daladier's original words at the time, stating that this was not a decision, but an expression of opinion. Chamberlain stated, "We have two wishes. We believe that the time has come to recognize the Franco government. We hope to maintain consistency with the French government. We do not want to recognize it until France has agreed to this move."

[Reuters London, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, responding to the Labour Party's motion of censure against the government, stated, "France's attitude towards recognizing the Franco government had not been decided until last Friday. I once said that France could not make a final decision until after Friday, which is completely correct. In fact, the decision was made on the weekend. As for whether recognizing the Franco government would destroy the confidence and goodwill of democratic countries towards Britain, I really cannot believe it. Look at the democratic country of France, whose opinions and actions are completely consistent with ours." Regarding the question of whether the British government's recognition of Franco was a violation of international tradition, Chamberlain stated, "Such events have not happened for the first time; there have been precedents in the past." Then he cited international law to prove that the government's actions were in accordance with general precedents, and said, "After General Franco occupied Barcelona and Catalonia, he still could not obtain a superior position? Can the Republican government still be called the legitimate government? The answer to this question is very obvious. Does the Republican government still have enough weapons and food to continue fighting? What is the hope of final victory? The area of the Republican government that has not been occupied is now small, and no one knows how to form a government. The president has resigned, some cabinet members are in France, and other cabinet members are in Spain. It is doubtful that such a government can be considered a legitimate government. Therefore, I say that if recognizing the Franco government is said to violate international traditional habits, it is more appropriate to say that not recognizing the Franco government goes against international traditions. If we do not recognize the Franco government, there will be no benefit to the Spanish Republican government and the people of Madrid, but it will only make the relationship between Britain and the new Spanish government not harmonious. Moreover, the Franco government has made guarantees to the British government that it will not take retaliatory measures against political prisoners." At this time, Chamberlain read the documents sent by Franco to Britain, including this guarantee. Chamberlain continued, "Spain will never accept foreign interference that damages its dignity and sovereignty. Opposition party members have earnestly stated the cruel actions of Franco's troops, but have not said a word about similar actions on the Republican side. Therefore, it is unreasonable to ask General Franco to pardon all those who have committed the most terrible crimes in advance. Many countries have now recognized the Franco government. This is actually an action to maintain formal contact between Britain and the Franco government. What is needed now is to stop the Spanish war. If Britain can find a way to have representatives from both sides of the Spanish war negotiate a ceasefire, it will be happy to do so. I believe that peace in Spain will be realized soon. Once the war stops, I hope the Spanish people will work hard to restore what the war has destroyed and rebuild a prosperous and happy country with a glorious history."

[Haitong News Agency, London, February 28th] The British Labour Party's motion of censure due to the government's recognition of the Franco government, after a long debate, was rejected this evening by a vote of 344 to 137.

### Spanish Government Withdraws Envoys to France; Embassies and Consulates Taken Over; Rumor Has It U.S. Will Follow the Lead of Britain and France

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] Representatives of the Franco government officially took over the Spanish Embassy here at 6 PM last night. The diplomatic representatives were accompanied by several French Foreign Ministry officials to the Spanish Embassy. At 6:15 PM, the flag of the Franco government was hoisted on the roof. About 100 colonists supporting Franco saluted the flag and shouted "Franco," but no disturbances occurred.

[United Press Paris, 1st] It has just been learned that according to reports received from various places here yesterday, officials from the Spanish Republican government consulates in various parts of France have withdrawn, and representatives of the Franco government have taken over. "Le Temps" stated that Panbi Nansi's consul, Chalitai, went elsewhere three days ago.

[Central News Agency, Paris, February 28th] After the French government recognized the Franco government, the Spanish Republican government ambassador left the embassy in the afternoon and bid farewell to Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. The embassy was also transferred by the French authorities to Leon, the representative of the National Army government stationed in France (who served as ambassador to France during the monarchy), who changed the flag to the National Army flag. Baso, Speaker of the Spanish Parliament, told Havas reporters that President Azana's letter of resignation has been received. According to the constitution, at least 100 members of parliament must be present to authorize the Speaker of the House to act as president.

[Reuters Burgos, February 28th] Hudson, the British representative sent to contact the Franco government, met with General Jordana today. Jordana said that the current government welcomed Mr. Hudson as chargé d'affaires before the British government sent an ambassador. Hudson hoped to see the British flag flying in Burgos soon. Here, there is no expression regarding the recognition of the British and French governments, as if Australia does not care.

[United Press Washington, February 28th] The official here is currently silent regarding the British and French recognition of the Franco government. However, well-informed sources believe that the United States will soon follow in the footsteps of Britain and France and grant recognition. President Roosevelt mentioned the actions of Britain and France at a State Department meeting, and the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Silva Seri, also visited Secretary of State Hull, claiming that he is still the ambassador to the United States for the legitimate Spanish government. It is reported that businessmen with interests in Spain are now putting pressure on the government, hoping for early recognition of Franco. Public opinion, however, is quite divided.

[Reuters Belgrade, February 28th] Today, the Yugoslav government decided to grant legal recognition to the Spanish rebel government.

Spanish President's Letter of Resignation

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] Spanish Republican President Azana's letter of resignation to National Assembly Chairman Barrio was made public to reporters by his secretary in Collonges-sous-Salève yesterday. The letter stated, "The commander-in-chief of military affairs in central Spain reported to me in front of the military that the war was lost by the Spanish Republican government and suggested that I prepare to leave Spain. I believe that it is my duty to immediately conclude a peace agreement and maintain humanity, so as to avoid unnecessary sacrifice for the soldiers defending the country and the people of the whole country. I have personally worked hard, hoping to realize this wish, but I have not succeeded. What is even more advanced is that major powers such as Britain and France have actually recognized the government of Burgos as legitimate, so that I cannot announce the procedures for resignation to the governments of various countries, but I am a Spaniard and driven by my conscience, I do not want to put the people of the whole country in a long-term war. The administrative institutions of the Spanish government have now been dismantled. I only hope that domestic and foreign groups will follow my wishes to cope with the situation. I really cannot stay in office, which will hinder the realization of peace." It is noted that the letter was signed and dated on February 27th.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] Political circles here commented on President Azana's resignation and stated his political achievements in Spain, saying that Azana strongly advocated joining the Allied forces during the European War. Before General Rivera's coup in 1923, he belonged to the Reform Party, and later joined the Republican Party and led the Republican movement. After Spain declared a republic in 1931, he served as Minister of War in the Zamora cabinet. Six months later, Zamora resigned, and Azana succeeded him as Prime Minister. Catalonia declared autonomy in 1931, and an anarchist movement broke out the following year. Azana was chased to resign in September. In 1934, Catalonia launched another anti-Catholic riot. Azana was elected President of the "Catalonian United Republican Government." That movement ultimately failed, and Azana was banned by the Madrid government. Later, he was secretly tried by the High Court of the Spanish Republican Government and restored his freedom. He resumed his post as Prime Minister in May 1936. In May 1936, he succeeded Zamora as President. Two months later, the Spanish war broke out.

### US Senate Debate: Army and Air Force Expansion Bill; Senator Lee Expresses Support, Calling it a Response to Dictatorship

[Reuters, Washington, February 28] Today, during the US Senate debate on the Army and Air Force expansion bill, Senator Clark launched a fierce attack on the bill, stating that the United States faced no danger and that the bill's drafting was due to a case of hysteria. "European warmongers, after only twenty years, are stirring up another war. They spare no effort in their schemes to instigate war," he said. Senator Borah also expressed similar views, calling the bill a "hollow show of strength," and claiming that military experts had told him that the 3,700 aircraft the authorities planned to purchase were "beyond the Army's needs." At the same time, twelve Liberal senators proposed restoring the Ludlow Amendment to the Neutrality Act, which would require a national referendum before the government could declare war. Senator La Follette supported this proposal, stating that the amendment "would provide a final check on secret diplomacy that draws us into foreign wars," and adding that the last British involvement in war was the result of such secret diplomacy. Senator Lee rose to express his support for the bill, stating that "the only language dictators understand" is this bill. Subsequently, after a lengthy debate on the purchase of aircraft by France, Senator Nye stated that he believed the United States should forever cease selling aircraft to foreign countries. He questioned, "Why should we arm the world for a small profit, only to have the armed turn against us?" and added, "The Japanese aircraft that bombed our warship 'Panay' used American gasoline, and its bombs were made of American metal." Senator Borah also participated in this debate, stating that the United States had been selling military supplies to Germany for years, only stopping after Germany demanded colonies, which he called a peculiar form of neutrality. Subsequently, Democratic Senators Barkley and Lee defended the sale of aircraft to France, stating that it was entirely appropriate. Lee stated, "The more aircraft we sell to democratic nations, the fewer aircraft our own United States will need. If the strength of the democratic nations is comparable to that of Germany, there will be no Munich Agreement, and no downfall of Czechoslovakia."

### Guam Not Fortified

US Navy and Marine Corps Disappointed

[Central News Agency, Washington, February 28] US Navy and Marine Corps officials have expressed disappointment over the rejection of the Guam fortification plan. The Navy and Marine Corps believe that while the lack of fortification on Guam may have little importance in terms of national defense, the fact that Japan may now mistakenly perceive the US's Far Eastern policy as turning weak is of great significance. Senior Army officials stated that the rumor that fortifying Guam was akin to holding a knife to Japan's throat was unfounded. The intention of fortifying the island was to warn the Japanese people that while the United States did not wish to be drawn into the vortex of war, it strongly opposed Japan's acts of aggression and was dissatisfied with Japan's foreign policy. Not fortifying Guam would only encourage Japan to implement further policies of aggression, they said.

Brief Commentary

### The Power of the Countercurrent

The darkness before dawn may be even more terrifying. In the raging torrent of the times, there will inevitably be turbulent countercurrents. Recent developments in international affairs have also revealed countercurrents, starting with the xxxxxx's policy of compromise with aggressive nations, and including the recent recognition of the Franco government by the British and French governments, and the US's rejection of the Guam fortification plan, which can be described as the most alarming countercurrents. Our x people, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and pro-peace elements, are taking advantage of this countercurrent to denigrate the peace front, denigrate the United Nations striving for peace, denigrate our country's twenty months of heroic resistance, while exaggerating the greatness of the fascist aggressors' power, and concluding that we must submit to this power, we must submit to the dark forces and countercurrents!

However, the activities of these x people, traitors, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and pro-peace elements are unfounded. First, although many countercurrents have emerged in the current struggle against fascism, the power of these countercurrents is limited and can be overcome. For example, the British and French rulers' recognition of the Spanish rebel government has already triggered and developed a high tide of the Anti-Appeasement Movement among righteous people throughout Britain. In recent days, the British and French people have been constantly holding parades and demonstrations. Although the British Labour Party's motion to censure the government was rejected on the 28th by a vote of 344 to 137, the power of the 137 dissenting votes is a force not to be ignored in the future. In addition, yesterday (March 1), a rally to boycott Japanese goods was held in London, with balloons bearing slogans supporting China flying across the sky, indicating that a vast and strong force is also developing at an accelerated pace along with the political countercurrents! Secondly, such as the US Senate's rejection of the Guam defense plan, has now aroused opposition from people across the country, that the Army and Navy authorities also unanimously recognized that this move greatly reduced the United States' status in the Pacific, enough to create the crime of helping Japanese x to expand the world war. In addition, such as the US House of Representatives' rejection of the US restriction of silver purchase bill, Morganthau's advocacy of giving the government extraordinary powers, are all visible to the rising strength of the American people's anti-fascist aggression forces, and can also see that the isolationalist faction's attempt to violate public opinion, and its future will eventually fail.

Second, the x people, traitors, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and pro-peace elements' attacks on the Soviet Union's peaceful policies, on our country's long-term resistance, and on the democratic peace front are also unfounded. First, the Soviet Union's domestic strength is developing, and the Third Five-Year Plan will make important decisions at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party on the 10th of this month to ensure the progress of the Soviet Union's defense strength and the people's lives. Second, our country's war situation is moving straight toward a "x our strength are equal x" situation, new troops are constantly growing, and international assistance is also making great progress with the new adventures of the Japanese x. The close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is an even greater guarantee. As for the rulers of a few countries within the pro-peace front, although they disregard the country and the world for the temporary interests of their own class and have a tendency to reverse course, the forces they represent are a small number of financial capitalists, and their strength is not worth paying attention to. At the same time, the increasingly developing people's front movement is a major obstacle to the development of reactionary forces.

Let us wake up in the darkness before dawn! Let us be invigorated in the face of the countercurrent of the times! Our ranks will be vast and strong!

### Balloons Released in London to Support China; Lady Gladstone Speaks, Urging Britons to Boycott Japanese Goods

[Central News Agency, London, March 1] The rally to boycott Japanese goods here was held today, chaired by Lady Gladstone, who gave a speech urging Britons not to wear Japanese silk stockings or use Japanese ties anymore, stating that there was no benefit to wearing Japanese silk fabrics, and that the gold thread used to buy Japanese silk fabrics was all used for the purpose of massacring humanity, which British people all knew well and should not knowingly commit such acts. After the speech, several hundred balloons bearing slogans supporting China were released into the air by the actress Miss Bradley, filling the sky. Each balloon had large-character slogans such as "Boycott Japanese Goods," "Don't Wear Japanese Silk Stockings," and "Support China," as well as a prize incentive for whoever found the balloon that flew the farthest.

### Ciano's Visit to Poland Fails; Germany and Italy to Hold Consultations to Discuss General Axis Policies; Italy to Increase Troops in Libyan Territory

[Reuters, London, March 1] According to forecasts from Berlin in various newspapers here, Hitler and Mussolini may hold consultations in northern Italy, because the Axis policies of Germany and Italy need to be re-examined after the changes in the European situation. Berlin officials do not attach as much importance to Ciano's failed visit to Poland as generally imagined. They believe that Ciano's failure to obtain any assurances from Polish Foreign Minister Beck regarding the future involvement of France in the war was expected. For this reason, the dictators intend to hold consultations to discuss general policies.

[Central News Agency, London, February 28] Well-informed sources here recently declared that Italian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Bastianini had yesterday informed British Ambassador Perth that after France repeatedly dispatched troops to Tunisia in North Africa, Italy's ability to transfer troops in times of emergency was not as fast as France's. Therefore, it is planned to send a large number of troops to Libyan territory in North Africa. Ambassador Perth, upon hearing this, expressed his regret.

[Central News Agency, Paris, February 28] After Guazzone, the Rome correspondent for the Belgian "Indépendance Belge," was expelled by the Italian authorities, the French government has decided to expel the Paris correspondent for the Italian "La Stampa," Monelli, and has ordered him to leave France within a week.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, March 1] The Governor of French Tunisia, La Bonneterie, announced that he would be inspecting central and southern Tunisia in the coming days. Furthermore, French officials are very concerned about the night-time exercises of the aircraft detachment attached to the French Mediterranean Fleet. It is reported that the fleet has been patrolling the coast of North Africa for several weeks.

[Associated Press, Rome, March 1] According to a correspondent for the Italian official news agency ANSA in Tunis, France is greatly expanding its military force along the Tunisian border with Libya, with many ships transporting military supplies and many trains filled with soldiers and munitions arriving in Tunis at night. As a result, rumors are rampant, and business is suffering. At the same time, Italian Chief of Staff General Badoglio has returned to Italy from Tripoli after inspecting the Italian defense lines in North Africa for eight days.

### Madame Tabouis Publishes "The Undercurrents of the Nazi Government"

—Translated by Huang Ping

—The Inside Story of Goebbels Being Beaten—

Everyone should remember that not long ago, there was news that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels had been beaten up for flirting. Later, there was a different report that Goebbels's beating was not really due to flirting, but the result of infighting among Nazi government officials for power and profit, but no truthful facts were published at that time. Recently, the famous French journalist Madame Tabouis, who specializes in the study of European political situations, published an article in the weekly "L'Œuvre," revealing the truth about the infighting among Nazi government officials. Although she does not state that this is the real reason for Goebbels's beating, it is clear to discerning people.

The following is only an excerpt from her article - Translator.

Although Hitler is a busybody, he has never been very happy to interfere in other people's private affairs. In the past, in many purges, although the crimes of "personal disgrace" and "improper behavior" were often seen, that was just talk; everything had its own political reasons.

However, there is an exception now: Hitler has expressed dissatisfaction with the private life of his propaganda minister, Goebbels. He believes that Goebbels's enjoyment is too extravagant and cannot share the hardships with other Nazi leaders. According to Hitler's opinion, life in the world has only one goal: to work for Nazism, to do one's best, and to die only after completing one's service.

The other Nazi leaders—except for Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who is a special exception approved by Hitler—are all very frugal. They rarely eat a hearty meal and never seek out entertainment beyond the regulations; all they are busy with all day long is their work.

Goebbels is different; his life is indeed unusually extravagant: he eats delicacies and fine wines, lives in luxurious apartments, has servants and many cars; all this is something Hitler cannot tolerate.

At the most recent celebration of the anniversary of the founding of the Nazi Party, Hitler, in addition to reviewing the past achievements of the Nazi Party, praised all the Nazi government leaders one by one. Only one person was not mentioned, and that was Goebbels.

Not long after, Hitler suddenly organized a "Newspaper Incitement Department" dedicated to studying and dealing with foreign newspapers attacking Germany. This new organization was not subordinate to Propaganda Minister Goebbels but was directly controlled by Hitler's deputy Hess. All policies were instructed by Hitler himself and handled jointly by representatives of Goebbels, Secret Police Chief Himmler, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop.

The purpose of this new organization is undoubtedly to strengthen Germany's propaganda work, hoping to obtain better propaganda results under the cooperation of the Propaganda Department, the Secret Police Department, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and under the leadership of the leader and his deputy.

After the establishment of the new organization, the first person affected was naturally Goebbels. Not only did he lose face in propaganda work, but his general status was also greatly reduced.

Goebbels's misfortune was not accidental but the result of his quarrel with Secret Police Chief Himmler not long ago.

In Germany, everyone knows that Goebbels and Himmler have always been somewhat irreconcilable. Both of them have hired many spies to operate domestically and abroad. In the past two years, Himmler has used various methods to recruit many of Goebbels's spies into the secret police. In this way, Goebbels could not command those spies who were nominally under his command.

Himmler was not satisfied with taking this advantage. Recently, he suddenly launched a major attack on Goebbels. He said that, according to information he had obtained from abroad, Goebbels's propaganda policy was completely wrong. He believed that there were many things that could only be said to Nazi personnel in secret, but Goebbels disregarded everything and spread them abroad. He criticized Goebbels for talking too much.

This time, Goebbels could not bear it anymore and turned against him, stating that his propaganda work was entirely based on the instructions of the leader and did not need others to interfere. As a result, the two became increasingly at odds and became mortal enemies.

Goebbels is indeed a brilliant propaganda talent. In Germany and in the world, he is considered top-notch, but when it comes to secret work, he is no match for Himmler. Moreover, the two of them know each other's many private scandals very clearly. Goebbels was too embarrassed to use his propaganda skills, but Himmler unceremoniously publicized all of Goebbels's private affairs. Therefore, not long ago, Goebbels's rumors were rampant, making him look like he was about to be disgraced.

Hitler also knew about this. He was already not very satisfied with Goebbels's extravagant life, and this made him even more dissatisfied. However, Goebbels in Germany is considered second only to Goering in terms of his leading role. Hitler had to be lenient and have some scruples.

As a result, after Hitler considered it, he used the method mentioned earlier to embarrass Goebbels.

After Goebbels received this punishment, he was indeed very unhappy. Therefore, some time ago, when Germany was busy with the anti-American movement, he did not come out to lead it, expressing passivity. Later, after much persuasion from Goering, Hess, and Ribbentrop, he agreed to reorganize and boasted that only he could incite the German people to participate in the war against capitalism.

Although the dispute can be considered to have come to an end, the infighting among Nazi personnel will always exist. The old grudges have not been resolved. Goebbels has suffered this loss from Himmler, and he will always want to retaliate in the future. Everyone is waiting to see.

### Fourth Day of Racing; "Noose Early" Easily Takes the Championship; "Trot Lucky" Withdraws

Yesterday, most horse racing fans originally intended to see how fierce the competition between "Noose Early" and "Trot Lucky" would be for the championship and who would ultimately win, but they were greatly disappointed because "Trot Lucky" did not appear, allowing "Noose Early" to show off and return with a triumphant song. It turned out that "Trot Lucky" suddenly suffered from diarrhea yesterday and was in critical condition, so he was forced to withdraw. As for the races, because horses that had won once in the previous three days were disqualified and could not participate, and after several days of observation, the strengths and weaknesses were clear, and everyone knew them well. As a result, good horses received enthusiastic support, and inferior horses were almost ignored. As a result, all the "hot" horses won, and the lottery payouts for each race were extremely small. In the Double Event, two horses tied for first place, and each ticket was only worth more than eight dollars, setting a new low record. There is a two-day break today and tomorrow, and there will be another race on Saturday, which will mark the end of this meeting.

### Siamese Government Revises Tariffs, Heavily Taxing Our Imports While Reducing Tariffs on Japanese Imports: Chaozhou Merchants Association Asks the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Negotiate Based on Reason

Recently, the Siamese government authorities have particularly increased the taxation on goods imported from our country.

It has also been learned that Japan exports the most of the above items to Siam. Now, Siam has increased the import tax on Chinese goods on the one hand and reduced taxes on Japanese goods on the other, and its fawning over the invading country is obvious.

### In the Midst of Rising Firewood Prices, There Are Actually Major Merchants Plotting a Monopoly: Hope the Authorities Pay Attention

As × people invade South China and war breaks out, transportation between Hong Kong and the mainland is blocked, the source of firewood is interrupted, and market prices immediately rise, which has a profound impact on the lower and middle classes.

It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

### This Newspaper's Essay Competition Award Ceremony

— Qi Zhuo

From Strangers to New Acquaintances

Young people don't have the bad habit of being late for meetings. Yesterday afternoon, before 2:00 pm, the young friends who were warmly welcomed by this newspaper gathered one after another in a beautiful hall on the second floor of the Winsor Hotel.

The names of the twenty-five people selected for this newspaper's essay competition for middle school students have slipped through our hands countless times, and have been reflected in our eyes countless times, but what exactly do their appearances look like? This interesting imagination was vividly captured until yesterday. In the realm of friendship, this is a mysterious paragraph.

An Excellent Group

Ah! So you are thin, you are short and fat, your student uniform is truly the style of a student, and your suit is also very much the style of a Hong Kong student; study hard, you are already wearing glasses; the life of fleeing has tormented you, your green face has been engraved with traces of wind and frost! Unfortunately, the reporter cannot open up the conversation with this excellent group in detail, but only briefly greets each person in the limited short time.

The first-place winner, Zhang Dalian, is from Jiangsu and used to study at Guangzhong Middle School in Shanghai. His father went south to work, and he only entered Zhiyong Middle School's high school program to study for a year. He is quite tall and healthy, and looks like a mature and steady person. As the champion, he is naturally the most noticeable person in the entire venue.

The second-place winner, Miss Huang Baozhen, wears glasses and has the demeanor of a scholar. All four women in the entire venue are classmates from their Zhenguang school. They rival each other with the six classmates from the Guangzhou People's Affiliated Middle School. The group results of their two schools are both relatively outstanding. The two schools are also schools that fled.

The third-place winner, Mr. Zhu Xinghua, is an overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia and has been in Hong Kong for three years. He speaks fluent Mandarin. He is dressed in a Western suit, but in a short conversation, one can also detect that he is a young medical student with a "soul."

Mr. Ouyang Lian, Xu Ruxian, and Liu Shizhi are old students in Hong Kong. Mr. Wei Beinan is from Shantou, Mr. Fei is from Taishan, Mr. Chen Jiongchao is from Guangzhou, Miss Guan Zhenru is from Kaiping, and Mr. Mo Yule is from Dongguan. These students have only been studying in Hong Kong for a year and a half because of the war.

In addition, there are Yin Songping, Zheng Shuicheng, Wu Boshan, Lu Jingwei, He Zhuoliu, Huang Shunuang, Huang Fangao, Sheng Cishi, Chen Jianqi, Huang Yingyuan, Wen Gongli, but there was no time for a long conversation. A total of twenty-two students attended, and three others were unable to attend due to other commitments. More than ten colleagues from this newspaper participated, and the gathering was lively and filled with the joy of youth.

Meeting and Encouragement

The meeting began, and Mr. Bu Tao first gave a speech: "Newspapers are a form of social education. This newspaper, based on its consistent historical spirit, spares no effort in promoting cultural movements. This newspaper held a middle school student essay competition this time, and we are very grateful to all of you for your enthusiastic participation. We hope to continue to stand together in the future and continue to work hard for the country and for culture..."

After Mr. Lu Fu reported on the process of this essay competition and judging, Mr. Wu Jingsong gave a speech: "...In Hong Kong, one can see the emphasis on physical sports and competition and the neglect of mental training and competition. Physical education is something we Chinese should promote, but cultural movements should also absolutely not be neglected because culture is the foundation of national survival. During the period of resistance against Japan, we must not only preserve our culture but also improve our culture and promote the current stage of struggle culture. We are in Hong Kong, this special region, and we should sow some seeds well. It is easier to carry out work here with young people and women. We hope that you will work hard to make a difference locally and to connect your work and spirit with those at home and abroad. One more effort will bring one more harvest."

This was a very pertinent speech.

Mr. Pan Qi, like Mr. Wu, first apologized for not being able to speak Cantonese before elaborating on his grand theory: "We have received three proofs from the essay competition: first, it proves that Hong Kong's young students have a very correct understanding and advanced thinking; second, it proves that the cultural level of most Hong Kong students is above average; third, it proves that there are also many thoughtful and progressive women in Hong Kong. Through this, we know that some people's criticisms of Hong Kong students are misunderstandings and disdain.

"In the essays, we found that many people expressed dissatisfaction with the school and teachers. We especially hope that you will understand the difficulties of the school authorities in this environment. Do not be too eager to create a bad situation of opposition between teachers and students. It is best for students to unite and express their opinions to the school authorities in good faith to help the school develop..."

Mr. Pan used progressive facts to comfort the young students in Hong Kong and earnestly hoped that teachers and students would work together, which was naturally a moving speech.

After Mr. Lu reported on the essay competition, he translated the main points of the opinions of the previous gentlemen again! He also spoke eloquently about the Hong Kong environment and made another sincere and practical wish:

"Although some people in Hong Kong are living in licentiousness and shamelessness, we should work seriously. The rear and the front are equally important, and it is also necessary to leave some workers in Hong Kong to work. We must recognize and use this special environment to strive for Sino-British friendship to expand international publicity. We must strengthen self-education, provide theoretical support for saving the nation from the historical legacy of the nation and mankind and from the practical work of saving the nation as a guide for the action of saving the nation. We must constantly research, work, and practice, and apply the correct theory of saving the nation to practical work. We must especially overcome the past styles of formalism and headstrongness..."

The gentlemen of this newspaper said a lot, and it was rare for a guest, Mr. Yang Guohua, to propose "in this environment of living in a drunken dream, there is actually a new situation of the press and young students working hand in hand" under warm applause to encourage and encourage each other.

When the essay competition champion Zhang Dalian gave a speech, the serious atmosphere became tense and warm again. "We are very grateful to Shen Bao for its kindness to us, and we sincerely hope that Shen Bao will lead us..."

A calm and sincere speech ended under everyone's focused gaze. The warm applause broke through the surrounding silence.

It is a pity that this group of young friends is still a bit childish and shy, and they dare not say what they want to say in their hearts.

Receiving the Prizes and Starting on the Road to Success

The tea party began, and everyone chatted and laughed. Photographic commemoration, may our spirit always be together. As for the silver tripod and silver cup awarded to the second and third place winners, it is only a small token of respect in material terms. All twenty-five winners were awarded half a year of free subscriptions to this newspaper, and the common prizes made us feel a little more at peace in our hearts. We also place unlimited hope on the spiritual food of young friends.

Dear young friends: You are the most outstanding descendants of the Chinese nation. You have developed an interest in writing. If you have good habits in reading, you have grasped the important conditions for success. You must firmly believe in your self-confidence and move forward. The new China is looking forward to the growth of outstanding descendants who are striving forward! I wish you to receive the prizes and start on the road to success!

### Jockey Club Derby First Prize Winner Is a Wealthy Child: Lottery Ticket Stub Writes the Name of a Girl, Zhou Ruilian, the Boy Who Kept the Ticket Is Peng Liangjun

The first prize of 240,000 yuan for the Hong Kong Jockey Club's Spring One-Dollar Derby lottery ticket was said to be won by four lucky children. The details have been published in this newspaper. However, who these four lucky children are was only learned after the reporter's investigation yesterday. One is Peng Guojun, one is Li Qingxiang, and one is Zhou Ruilian (female). As for the other one, the details are unknown. The lottery ticket stub of the Association uses Zhou Ruilian's name. As for the person who kept the lottery ticket, it is Peng Guojun. Peng is currently a student at St. Joseph's College and has several brothers. Peng is twenty-two years old and currently lives with his parents on Wong Nai Chung Road. His brother ××, it is said that it is ×××Shipping Agent of Foreign Trading Company, has made great progress in the industry in recent years and has obtained considerable assets. According to him, suddenly received a call from Peng Guojun from Golden Dragon Restaurant on Monday (28th) night, saying that he had won the first prize of the lottery ticket and was drinking and celebrating with friends at the restaurant. In the past few days, he has rarely been at home. Now he has driven out, and I (Peng ×× claims) do not know where he is now. My father is also waiting for him to come back to meet. Peng continued, "Speaking of one to two hundred thousand gold, our family already has it. It is not surprising that my younger brother has won sixty thousand gold." Therefore, I hope that Mr. Peng will follow the purpose of disaster relief and use this huge prize to do his best to solve the crisis and save those in distress, and benefit the poor overseas Chinese and the suffering compatriots who have fallen into a foreign land.

### After Demolition of Shantytowns in Peninsula, Thousands of Poor People Roam the Streets: Village Houses in Kowloon City and Shek Kip Mei, Etc., Are Crowded, Due to Livelihood Reasons, Many Poor People Are Unwilling to Go to Refugee Camps in the New Territories

After the Hong Kong authorities ordered the demolition of the shantytowns in Guangdong Road and Tak Kok Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, and Tai Kok Tsui a few days ago, yesterday was the deadline for the Tai Kok Tsui area. Therefore, the police dispatched personnel to the scene to supervise the demolition yesterday morning. As a result, the shelters that thousands of poor people had managed to build after countless hardships had to be hastily evacuated. According to the authorities' instructions, they could request the authorities to take them into the refugee camps far from the urban area. However, these five or six thousand poor people are mostly coolies on the streets or other laborers with a monthly income of seventy or eighty yuan, and many families have many mouths to feed who rely on it for a living. If they leave the urban area once, it is tantamount to losing even this ten yuan. Try asking how they will maintain their future life, so although they want to obey the order to move, it is really impossible. Therefore, after the general poor people were ordered, they went to the small village houses in Kowloon City, Ngau Chi Wan, and Shek Kip Mei in Sham Shui Po to find small attics and small rooms for residence. In a few days, the above-mentioned village houses were rented out, and there was a shortage of people. Moreover, the rent was raised several times. In the past, the annual rent value of a small attic or small room in each village house was only about six or seven yuan, but now it costs four or five yuan a month, and there are still not many because the demand exceeds the supply. It is really impossible to accommodate these four or five thousand people. Yesterday, the reporter crossed the sea to investigate the poor areas and saw that the general poor people were only dismantling their shacks in a mess, retrieving the bamboo and wood raw materials that had been built with blood and sweat. Those who were fortunate enough to rent accommodation in Kowloon City and Shek Kip Mei and other villages had calmly moved away a few days ago, but this was only a small part of them. Most of them still had no place to stand and were at a loss. After sighing under the demolition of the shacks, they carried their sons and daughters, old and young, shouldered everything, and returned to the arcades of the streets to taste the taste of eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew again. The situation was very miserable. In addition, among these poor shantytowns, there were about ten who were refugees who had fled from the mainland and had requested the authorities to take them into the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp, but there were very few of them.

### × Attempts to Invade East Guangdong, × Planes and Ships Repeatedly Harass the East Guangdong Coast, Shelling Shenquan Caused No Losses to Us, Many Fishing Boats Were Burned and Plundered by ×, Shantou People's Hearts Are As Stable As Usual

[Special News from Shantou] The invading × army has recently moved a large team to the east, attempting to invade the Huibo Heyuan area along both sides of the Dongjiang River. Therefore, in recent days, the Chaozhou-Shantou sea and land areas, Huizhou-Yang areas, and coastal × ships and × planes have transformed their movements to stir up trouble, hoping to contain the army and civilians of the Dongjiang River. On the 27th of last month, the × naval and air forces jointly harassed the Huilai-Lufeng Chaoyang coastal areas. It was learned that at about 9:00 am, three × ships suddenly sailed from the west to the sea off Shenquan Port and fired artillery shells at the shore. At the same time, two × planes assisted in the air and dropped five bombs in Shenquan. The × ships fired seven artillery shells, but they all missed the ground, and we suffered no losses. At 3:00 pm on the same day, three × ships suddenly came to the Lufeng sea and put down several speedboats to capture fishing boats. As a result, five fishing boats were looted by ×, and the lives and deaths of the fishermen are unknown. At about 3:00 pm, a × destroyer was found at the Chaoyang Dengtai, and the fishing boats fled one after another. Among them, two ships failed to escape and were set on fire and sunk on the spot by ×.

Another report said that on the 27th and 28th of last month, × ships often appeared on the sea off Chaozhou and Shantou. The Chaozhou Yanglongtoushan, lighthouse, Hedumen sea, Mayukou and other coastal areas all had × destroyers cruising and spying. At 12:30 on the 26th, a × plane flew in from the sea and circled over Shantou for about 20 minutes, and then flew to the Pingtuolin area. It did not drop bombs. Currently, the air raid in Shantou is slightly tense. The military organs are guarding against traitors from causing disturbance to public security, and the team is stepping up patrols day and night. People's hearts are still stable, and the market is also good.

### Jiujiang × Position, Our Divine Eagle Team Takes Action to Show Its Power, × Is So Scared That Faces Are Bloodless and They Flee One After Another, Plainclothes Team Night Attack on Heqing Annihilates Many ×

[Special News from Jiangmen] The × army entrenched in Jiujiang has not dared to cause trouble for ten days, but our army team has decided to wait for the armies of all parties to gather before launching a counterattack. According to military news, our new air force's Divine Eagle team of twelve planes flew to the West River off the Sea of West from a certain place on the third day of the lunar New Year to reconnaissance the × army positions, and then flew to the vicinity of Jiujiang, circling several times and dropping many bombs on the × army positions. The position was destroyed, and the × army was caught off guard by our planes and was so frightened that their faces were bloodless and they fled one after another. After our planes dropped the bombs, they circled for another week before flapping their wings and flying back to their original defense. At that time, the citizens of Jiujiang learned that the planes were dropping bombs and were extremely happy. It was also learned that on the evening of February 25, our army's plainclothes team of several dozen people took advantage of the dark moonlight and went directly to Heping from Gulao and launched a counterattack against the × army. The × army was caught off guard, and our army beheaded and killed many of them. After our team completed its mission, they triumphantly returned to defense.

### No War in Huibo, Peace Restored: Rumors of × Invading Hualian and Demanding Peace Untrue; Both Areas Guarded by the East River Special Operations Detachment

[Rapid News from Boluo] It was previously rumored that two divisions of × troops had been dispatched to the East River to reinforce and were planning to invade Huizhou and Boluo counties again. It was also reported that over five hundred remnant × infantry and artillery troops had launched another attack on Longhua Lianhe, engaging in fierce battles with our troops and militia. As a result, residents of Huiyang and Boluo became unsettled, leading to widespread rumors and spontaneous evacuation of citizens, causing extreme distress. Yesterday, the 27th, the reporter visited Liang, the general commander of the East River Special Operations Detachment, to inquire about the situation. General Commander Liang stated that in the Huizhou and Boluo areas, our regular army and guerrillas were diligently monitoring the × troops in the Dongguan and Zengcheng areas. According to repeated reconnaissance, although there were troop movements, the number of × troops had not increased. As for Longhua, it is garrisoned by our detachment (referring to the East River Special Operations Detachment), and the defenses of Lianhe are the responsibility of Bu Zhiyang and Lin Junsheng's units. The × troops have not dared to intrude. The rumors circulating outside are untrue. The reporter also spoke with responsible individuals from the local political and military coordination agencies, who confirmed that nothing of the sort had occurred. It has been verified that Longhua Lianhe, located in the lower reaches of the East River, is currently very peaceful. Only the ignorant men and women in Huizhou and Lianhe are creating unnecessary panic. The local authorities are now working to dispel rumors and reassure the public.

### Luo Fengxiang Organizes and Reorganizes the Guerrilla Forces in the Third District

[Rapid News from Huiyang] Luo Fengxiang, commander of the Seventh Guerrilla District, has been newly appointed by Zhang Fakui, commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone, as the commander of the Third Guerrilla District's Younger Brother Column in the Fourth War Zone. After receiving the order, Luo completed the reorganization of his subordinate troops yesterday and issued a proclamation stating: "The Japanese invaders are increasingly aggressive, and disasters are frequently occurring. The fate of our nation hangs by a thread. The government bears this heavy responsibility and is deeply aware of the difficulties. It has been deeply considering and comprehensively planning all essential measures for national self-defense and resistance against Japan to achieve the goal of repelling the enemy and saving the nation. Since the counties of Huiyang and Boluo fell into enemy hands, the government, recognizing the current situation and to meet the needs, has incorporated a portion of the local forces into the Third Guerrilla District for centralized training and deployment. In the Huiyang area, there is Zhong Mengsu's First Battalion and Yang Weiquan's First Company. In the Boluo area, there is Chen Shinan's First Company. In addition, the remaining unorganized local forces will be temporarily sent back to await orders for deployment to ensure that the front and rear of the resistance are mutually supportive and consolidated. This command will implement these matters diligently and in accordance with the regulations. In addition to separate orders, this proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge. All members of the local forces who have not been organized and have been sent back should engage in farming and temporarily pursue their respective occupations. When necessary, they will be ordered to assemble. It is hoped that everyone will uphold the principle of sharing weal and woe, pay attention to local public safety at all times, and jointly maintain order and stability. This proclamation."

### Heshan Local Forces Launch Sudden Attack on × Troops; × Suffering Over a Hundred Casualties; Our Troops Withdraw Calmly

(Rapid News from Heshan) The × troops' plan to bypass Heshan from Jiujiang and launch a flanking attack on our Gaohe and Gaoyao areas has failed to materialize. This is because our Sixty-fourth Army advanced from Sihui, trapping the × troops in a tight encirclement, rendering their delaying tactics ineffective. Additionally, due to the weakness of their forces in the Sanshui area, they were unable to implement their usual tactic of breaking through the center. Therefore, they were eager to seize strongholds to gain a foothold. Our troops and local forces in Heshan have taken strict precautions. The × troops attempted to cross the floating bridge at Jiujiang to attack Heshan and achieve their goal of flanking our forces. On the evening of the 27th of last month, our Heshan local forces dispatched the ×th Detachment, led by Commander "Big Fist," with over a hundred men, to lie in ambush in a certain area of Gubu. Taking the × troops by surprise at night, they launched a fierce attack. The × troops panicked and fought among themselves in the dark, resulting in over a hundred casualties. Our troops, having destroyed key parts of the floating bridge and achieved their objective, calmly withdrew. It has been verified that in addition to the casualties, the damage to the floating bridge was significant, rendering it unusable for the × troops to advance.

### Some × Cavalry Troops from Sanshui Withdraw to Guangzhou

[Rapid News from the West River] More than four months have passed since the town of Hekou in Sanshui was occupied by the × troops. Despite repeated reinforcements and attempts to attack our positions at Mafang, Luju, and Ganggang, they have been repelled by our forces. Recently, our main forces have been transferred to the West River, with heavy troops stationed along the Jinli, Beishui, and Yong'an areas on both the north and south banks. At the same time, the front lines in Sihui and on both banks of the Yuhe River have also been fortified with strong defensive lines, confronting the × troops across the river, awaiting an opportunity to launch a general counter-offensive. The × troops, realizing the strength of our forces in the West River and the difficulty of invading, are merely building fortifications along the river and holding onto their existing strongholds, not daring to cross the line for months. On the 26th of last month, a portion of the × cavalry stationed in Sanshui city, about five hundred men, suddenly retreated along the Guang-San Road, stationing themselves in the areas of Wu Yan Qiao and Chou Bu Xu. It is said that this cavalry unit was ambushed by our guerrillas in the areas of Gantang and Sanjiang Xu a few days ago and suffered heavy losses. Therefore, they were withdrawn to the rear for rest and replenishment.

### Special Encouragement for Civilians with Guns to Join Self-Defense and Kill ×

[Rapid News from Shaoguan] Li Hanshun, chairman of the provincial government, believing that the military development of the resistance war in the first phase has been re-adjusted politically, and considering that the people in various counties have not fully contributed their weapons to participate in killing ×, has specifically ordered the county magistrates to instruct the heads of districts, townships, and towns to promptly persuade civilians who possess self-defense weapons to hand over their weapons to the district, township, and town offices for registration and stamping, and to actively participate in self-defense groups and guerrilla forces, to be dispatched at any time to defend their villages.

### Special Shipping News

The Guang Fu Xiang, a ship of the Ming Sheng Company, sailed to Macau yesterday. It is understood that due to damage, it needs to be docked for repairs. It is said that it will take about a week before it can continue sailing. Currently, the ship is docked at a shipyard in Sham Shui Po, awaiting repairs.

According to news from the French postal ship agent, the Bodoumei ship, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Saigon yesterday, has stopped its voyage as it is deemed unnecessary to come to Hong Kong. Also, the President Doumei of the company is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai at noon today and depart for Saigon, Shizhu, Masi and other places at 4 pm.

The Lian Hai, agented by the Prince's Company (formerly the "Haining" of the German Delis Company), is currently under repair at the Kowloon Dockyard. It is said that it will be completed within days and is scheduled to sail to the Philippines on the 4th, carrying more than a thousand tons of goods.

### Liu Houwu, Supervising Commissioner of the Control Yuan, Advocates Thrift Movement; Calls for Saving Time and Money for National Salvation; Continuing Hedonism Undermines Resistance

[Shaoguan Correspondence] Liu Houwu, a supervisory commissioner of the Central Control Yuan, after leaving Hong Kong, went to Shantou to inspect the political situation. Due to certain matters, he came to Shaoguan and strongly advocated a thrift movement to reporters, expressing his views as follows: "Our country is striving for national independence and the survival of the nation, rising up to engage in conflict with the violent ×. All our officials and civilians should unite and save time and money to overcome national difficulties together. Among the officials, gentry, and merchants in Chaozhou and Shantou, many are able to abide by the law and work diligently. However, there are also not a few who regard the resistance work as if it were unrelated, showing indifference. It is obvious that unnecessary social gatherings also cost hundreds of dollars, and they compete to drink foreign wine as a sign of pride. Little do they know that such pointless social gatherings are a waste of time and money, and that drinking foreign wine causes money to flow out of the country, which is even more inappropriate. Moreover, the thrift movement was advocated long ago during the New Life Movement, and the National Government has repeatedly issued orders, which all officials and civilians should abide by. Such a hedonistic lifestyle will only undermine the strength of the resistance. If social gatherings are indeed necessary, it is hoped that both hosts and guests will make every effort to economize to avoid wasting public funds and to strengthen the power of resistance."

### Returning from the Pingshan Guerrilla Area

— Zhu Baishui

——Sketches of the Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force——

Embarking on a journey at dawn

On the morning after the New Year's Day of firecrackers and celebratory sounds, at dawn, we boarded the Guangzhou-Kowloon train. At this time, the gray sky still faintly held onto the lingering stars.

We were a comfort delegation from the Datong newspaper. Due to work and opportunity, the writer joined them. Our destination was the Hui-Bao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force in Pingshan. When the train reached Dadi'ao, it stopped due to the interruption of the "Big Wheel" bus heading to Shayu Chung. We had to walk to Dadi Market for an early meal before taking a bus to Shenzhen. From Shenzhen, we took a long-distance bus towards Zhonggang. The passengers were very crowded, but after only fifty minutes of driving, we had to start walking because the roads ahead were all damaged. However, what we saw along the way was only burned and small debris. The × could still drive if they made some minor repairs. It can be seen that the destruction was not thorough enough.

Passing by Gangbian, Gangbei, and reaching Longgang, it was already half-past noon. Longgang is a large market town. It was devastated and burned by the × in early October last year. The dilapidated buildings were heartbreaking. But the residents have gradually returned, but it still feels very deserted.

It still takes four hours to walk from Longgang to Pingshan. People were originally very tired and hungry, but they still marched bravely forward. Among them were several female workers and a female teacher who were also very vigorous, which was quite commendable.

Many places we passed had been occupied by the ×. The original atmosphere after the robbery has not recovered, and the rumors of re-invading the East River are on the rise again, and the situation is very tense. Therefore, in addition to strengthening military defense, the destruction of highways is better than the previous section. Many traps, square or long, were dug between the distances. If the ×'s armored forces or cavalry advance, they will be attacked.

In the evening breeze and wheat waves at dusk, tired steps began to step into the Pingshan guerrilla area. This is a rather large city near Danshui. The streets are still clean, and the residents are busy spending the year, so it is still very calm. The first thing that caught my attention was the slogans filled with the walls, all issued by the Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force and the Pingshan Anti-Japanese Comrades Association, etc., which made people very excited.

Extreme fatigue was driven away by a high degree of joy. We stepped into the guerrilla area.

They are the combatants who defend the East River

The Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force knew of our arrival in advance, so they lined up to meet us at the entrance.

Standing at attention, I first saw the pure and solemn heroic posture of the armed guerrilla warriors. I couldn't help but return a solemn smile. The place where we first arrived was originally Pingshan School, which is now the training institute of the Second Team. It is open, magnificent, and very quiet.

It has been less than three months since the emergence of the Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force. However, this active team, which enjoys a high reputation in the East River, has survived, advanced, and become an outstanding and progressive guerrilla force in this short period of time.

In early October last year, the × began to attack Guangdong and invade places such as Aotou, Danshui, and Pingshan, and the vast masses, under the leadership of the Huiqing Work Corps, launched a simple armed resistance. After a period of continuous struggle, they produced the prototype of the Hui-Bao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force. But at that time the number of people was only dozens, and the guns were only more than ten borrowed from Uncle Hai's brigade and seized from the ×. But the greater struggle is increasing. It's only been about three months now, and the number of people has skyrocketed to hundreds, hundreds of guns, and heavy machine guns, light machine guns, and mobile machine guns.

The rapid development shows that the loyal people's guerrillas are growing and developing in the struggle. It also shows that our war of resistance is progressing.

Because their actions have protected the faith and support of the broad masses of people, and further gained the trust and cooperation of friendly forces, and were officially approved for establishment by the government, its development has become even greater, and its own organization has also grown soundly.

In terms of the current political and military situation, no one denies the possibility that the × will invade and occupy the East River again. Therefore, the action to defend the East River should be urgent. How to truly mobilize the power of the masses to engage in the war of resistance under the cooperation of the military and the people is extremely urgent. The Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force is currently working towards this goal. At the same time, they are the combatants who defend the East River.

In terms of organization, they still adopt the three-three system of the army. They are now divided into three teams, each brigade having three companies, and each company having three platoons. There is also a special operations brigade, whose work is to be responsible for the machine gun company and political cadres. In order to meet actual environmental needs, a women's team was recently established, with about twenty people.

So far, they are still semi-independent, so the supply of military fire and life depends on the continuous assistance from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and sailors. There are now frequent comfort delegations from various community and worker organizations to comfort them. (To be continued)

Movies and Theater

### Edgar Bergen Insures Charlie McCarthy – Insurance Amount is $5,000 –

Eighteen years ago, a piece of ordinary, unremarkable pine wood was transformed into the face of a mischievous child by the artistic hands of Theodore Mack, a woodcarver in Chicago. Eighteen years later, that piece of wood has become the most valuable in the world, worth at least five thousand US dollars! This is the famous puppet Charlie McCarthy. He is truly a lucky "blockhead," unprecedented and, one dares to say, unparalleled. There is absolutely no second piece of wood like him because he is the real deal, a brand name, and no imitation is allowed.

However, recently Edgar Bergen - Charlie's manager - has spent thousands of dollars trying to create an identical Charlie. Edgar Bergen has no intention of abandoning Charlie. On the contrary, he is showing Charlie all the love in the world, finding him a double to perform in dangerous scenes. He has visited the best woodcarvers in the United States, but none of their works have satisfied him. He even made a plaster head mold of Charlie for carving, but the result was also a failure.

"I can't say exactly what the flaws are in those new faces. They look exactly like Charlie, down to the smallest detail, but they are not Charlie. Why can't a second face that is exactly the same represent the same person? ...... Unfortunately, Theodore Mack died several years ago. In other words, even if he were still alive, he might not be able to recreate his masterpiece.

Bergen doesn't need a second Charlie yet, but Charlie is in the new film 'You Cheat An Honest Man' and has to act for eight hours, and his co-star, the mischievous W.C. Fields, is always unreasonably picking fights with Charlie. This is extremely painful for Bergen. What if his little friend gets into trouble? Since a substitute is hard to find, he can only insure Charlie. After consultation, the insurance company has agreed to insure him for $5,000, and according to Bergen's intention, he would like to sign a $50,000 insurance policy.

Hollywood Tidbits

### Sonja Henie

Sonja Henie is extremely annoyed. After each ice skating performance, there are always people waiting outside the backstage door, determined to ask her to dinner. Now she has a clever plan to ward them off. When she encounters this situation, she says, "Okay, as long as you can treat our entire company, I'd be very willing to go." This clever move often makes those self-proclaimed playboys retreat.

### Fredric March

Fredric March recently discovered something incomprehensible while filming his new movie "Trade Winds." He noticed that the Japanese people's clothes, both men and women, were loose robes with large sleeves. So he asked a Japanese man next to him,

"Hey, when you all wear the same clothes, how do you tell men from women?"

"Really?" The Japanese man smiled slightly. "Let me ask you the same question. When you foreigners, both men and women, have short hair and wear trousers, how do you distinguish between men and women?"

The big star thought for a while and finally answered, very cleverly, "It's very simple. Just look at those carrying handbags. They are women."

### Charles Bickford

Charles Bickford, a rough-and-tumble type who usually plays tough guys in movies, has suddenly softened up. This time he tore up a twenty-thousand-dollar contract and had a falling out with the great director Cecil B. DeMille because he refused to perform an extremely dangerous shot in "Union Pacific." He said, "Once in a Universal film, I was bitten by a lion, and as a result, I spent more than six months in the hospital. Another time, a piece of flesh weighing a pound was lost from my leg in the mouth of a carp. Isn't that enough? This time, they want me to hold a cigar in my mouth while Akim Tamiroff uses a twenty-five-foot whip to knock it off in one fell swoop. Forget it. It's not worth losing an eye, an ear, or a nose for twenty thousand dollars."

### Johnny Weissmuller

Johnny Weissmuller, after a two-year hiatus, almost lost the opportunity to reprise his role as Tarzan upon returning to Hollywood. The story goes like this: One day, when he tried to make his world-famous Tarzan yell, the receiver was only able to pick up a very sharp high pitch, which wasn't very loud. The company was naturally dissatisfied. He himself said; it wasn't caused by the divorce from Lupe Velez, but rather by the lack of opportunities to practice climbing trees. But, he believes that within a short period of time, his past fierce and majestic roar can still be restored.

### Arthur Treacher

This actor, like Edward Horton, is known for playing butlers on screen. Have you seen "Stolen Heaven"? The tall guy who follows Herbert Marshall is him. We may think he looks ugly, but he has always been proud of it, believing that there is no one taller than him among the current movie actors. This time he met a tough opponent. An Englishman named Lionel Brahm came to Hollywood, standing seven feet five inches tall, weighing two hundred and eighty pounds, and with a chest of fifty inches. He immediately dwarfed the skinny Arthur. But after a few days, he said again: "Okay, no matter what, my height is always the same as President Lincoln's."

### James Stewart

Movie fans will see this star's new trick in the new film "Ice Follies of 1939." In the film, he was originally a skating expert, but once he broke his leg and could only do some light and easy comedic performances. Here he and Lew Ayres play a "skating horse" together. Lew Ayres plays the horse's head, and the rest is him.

### Jack Oakie

He must have made a fortune somewhere and come back. Someone saw him signing a check for a hundred dollars in a public place and casually using it to light a cigar.

### Jack Haley

Jack Haley is not only a famous comedian on screen, but also a great philanthropist. He often donates considerable sums to an orphanage, and this time, in addition to donating a full set of uniforms for the orphanage's music class, he also equipped them with many previously missing musical instruments.

### Shirley Temple

A time clock has been added to the 20th Century Fox studio. This matter once bothered Shirley Temple for a while. When this little star saw the children working with her in the same film, walking out and always going to punch the clock, she cried. Why can everyone else punch the clock and play, but she can't? No matter how the staff in the studio explained to her that because she was a red star with a weekly salary of more than a thousand dollars, she didn't need to be restricted by punching the clock to record her time, this could not make her feel relieved. She always regarded it as a happy and wonderful thing. In the end, there was no way to satisfy her wish, so the company set up another one for her, allowing her to punch the clock as much as she liked.

### Singapore Chinese Football Team to Depart Mid-Month; To Visit Hong Kong After the Philippines; Delegation of Eighteen People Elects Xu Houkun as Captain

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Although the Philippine team was defeated in all three games of the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Tournament held during the spring break, the lively scenes and wonderful performances left a deep impression on us. Now that the Interport Tournament has become a thing of the past, the football scene continues to be active in Hong Kong, this paradise. The new stimulation of football events is truly endless and never gets tiresome.

Let me tell you that the Singapore Chinese Football Team will be coming to Hong Kong at the end of this month. Yesterday, my friend Qi Gong received a letter from Xu Houkun, the captain of the team, detailing when the team would depart from Singapore for the Philippines, when they would travel from the Philippines to Hong Kong, and the list of all the team members. This new news should be welcomed by the readers, and I have to report it accordingly.

The delegation of eighteen people will nominate Deng Yuehan or Yan Jixiang as the leader, and Xu Houkun as the captain. It has been decided that they will depart from Singapore on the 13th of this month aboard the Victoria, an Italian ship, for the Philippines. There will be multiple games in the Philippines. After the matches are completed, they will move from the Philippines to Hong Kong on the 26th for three games. On April 1st, they will play against the South China Athletic Association team, on the 2nd against the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese team, and on the 5th, a joint Singapore-Hong Kong Chinese team will play against the military team. All games will be played at Jia Shan. It is assumed that the South China Athletic Association is responsible for hosting the Singapore team during this visit.

Xu sent an English letter, so the surnames of his team members have been translated according to what is known, totaling fourteen people. There are still four people whose translations may not be accurate, and there may be errors. (Playing Football as a Tai Sui)

### Chu Minyi's Recommendation to the Ministry of Education: Send an Art Troupe to Participate in the World Games, Followed by Performances in Various Countries After the Games; Chu Willing to Take on Preparatory Work for the National Games in Shanghai

[Shanghai Correspondence] China has decided to send two soccer teams to participate in the 12th World Games. Previously, Minyi sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education, requesting special attention to national defense and the organization of a martial arts troupe to perform at the games. The original telegram is recorded as follows for your consideration: To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education in Chongqing, Vice Ministers Yuan and Zhang, and forwarded to President Dai Jitao and Wang Rutang: The 12th World Games will be held in Finland next year. Our country should participate as usual. If it has been decided, preparations should begin immediately. Recalling the results of the previous participation, we lagged behind in various competitions. Fortunately, the martial arts performance was welcomed by foreigners, bringing much honor. This year, we should pay special attention to this, and the scope of all organizations and athletes should be expanded compared to the last time. The quality should be even more refined and substantial. Regarding Shanghai's responsibilities, if I am entrusted with them, I will do my best. I hope that with thorough preparation, we can gain international honor. Furthermore, the martial arts troupe can take this opportunity to perform in various countries after the games, to promote our country's inherent martial spirit, which is also conducive to propaganda for the war of resistance and national construction. I humbly submit my opinions for consideration and request a special reply by telegram. Respectfully, Chu Minyi.

### Maharaja of Jodhpur Plans to Invite Three Tennis Stars to Perform in India; Negotiations on Remuneration Proceeding Smoothly

According to a communication from India on February 6, the Maharaja of Jodhpur plans to personally invite three world tennis stars, Budge, Vines, and Pan, to perform in India this year. He is currently seeking the consent of various authorities and negotiating remuneration. Once these matters are settled, he will contact the All India Lawn Tennis Association regarding the dates of the matches. It is said that the negotiations are proceeding smoothly. If this materializes, the three tennis stars may tour various cities in the Far East before arriving in India. It is unknown whether the Hong Kong Lawn Tennis Association is also preparing to invite them to perform in Hong Kong during their visit. Hong Kong has a history of inviting famous professional tennis players to perform, and we have seen performances by renowned players such as Vincent Richards, Ellsworth Vines, and Tilden. However, the world of tennis has advanced rapidly. Seeing the current three stars perform together would undoubtedly be refreshing. I sincerely hope that the Hong Kong tennis community will fulfill our expectations.

### Discussion on Triple Jump Training (Continued)

— Zhuoyue

(4) HO - Single-leg hop, STEP - Step jump, JVMP - Double-leg jump - Points to note

(1) HOP: When starting this, the body should maintain the posture of running. The heel should also touch the ground when taking off, but the toe should leave the ground first. The other knee should be raised high to naturally move the head forward. When the foot leaves the ground, the body and arms should maintain the movement of running. The distance between the two feet should not be too far, and the head should not be tilted backward. The right foot should still be behind the left knee. When the take-off force is about to be exhausted, raise the left knee again to move the left leg to the front. However, the left foot should still be behind the left knee; otherwise, when landing, the left foot will inevitably fall straight down. The right foot should naturally extend downward, the knee still slightly bent, and the arms extended forward to maintain balance. The left knee should be raised extremely high. When the left foot lands, the body should still be slightly forward, and the right foot should be lifted up behind, maintaining balance.

(2) Step: When striding, it is not advisable to go too high, about one-third of a single-leg hop. During the single-leg hop, make every effort to increase the distance and use the remaining momentum for the step. Then, focus all your energy on the final jump. The proportion is roughly 9-8-10 feet or so. At this time, the right leg leaves the ground first, the left knee is slightly bent, and the upper body is not bent. The right leg strides forward vigorously, and the left knee must not be raised high. The body should be extremely balanced. When the right knee is at the highest point of the stride, the right thigh should be parallel to the ground. The left foot should be behind and should not be raised too high. The heel of the right foot should touch the ground first, and the body should lean forward to increase the force of advance, so that you can continue to work hard for the long jump.

(3) Jnmp: When the left leg is parallel to the ground, it should not be raised too high, otherwise the body will not be able to balance or tilt backward, resulting in a reduction in distance to about 12 or 13 meters. If you can pay attention to this point on weekdays, so that there is no backward tilt, I believe you can get better results. Therefore, the triple jump and the long jump also have the same importance regarding this issue. When landing in the sandpit, the two feet should be extended forward as shown in Figure 1, and the hands should be behind to maintain balance. When the feet land in the sandpit, the upper body should be as shown in Figure 2, with both hands swinging forward and upward, and the waist and abdomen also using force to push the upper body forward to avoid tilting backward.

In summary, the first step in triple jump training is to pay attention to running speed. The second aspect is to pay attention to the continuous movement from the start of the run to the landing in the sandpit - within these two, there is constant movement, and there can be no slight pause. It is also necessary to use basic exercises as an aid, so that the increase in strength and the correct posture development are the starting points. (The End)

### Why Exercise Promotes Health

— Wang Xuezheng

Everyone knows that exercise can promote health, but most people do not know why exercise promotes health, the harms of various exercises, slow progress, and misconceptions about exercise.

To understand why exercise can promote health, you must first understand the true meaning of health. Health does not only refer to "no disease or pain," but also contains a sense of "beauty" and "strength."

In the physical aspect, the effects of exercise are nothing more than the following three: —

(1) Exercising Internal Organs — To make internal organs strong, the most important thing is to promote metabolism and make the circulation, respiration, and digestion systems function normally and actively. Metabolism has a mutual relationship with the circulation, respiration, and digestion systems. If the respiratory, circulatory, or digestive system is weakened, other systems and metabolism will inevitably become abnormal.

During exercise, the three systems that are most affected in the body are these three systems. We all know that the lungs absorb oxygen from the air, and then the circulatory system transports the gas to all parts of the body. The tissues of the body use oxygen to "burn" those "substances" that can generate energy. In this process, waste products are also produced, and carbon dioxide is one of them. Blood circulation transports oxygen to the exercising tissues or muscles on the one hand, and also transports carbon dioxide to the lungs on the other hand, and then the lungs expel it from the body.

When muscles exercise, the first phenomenon that occurs is the increase of carbon dioxide in the blood. There is a small part in the brain that has the most sensitive feeling to the chemical changes in the body - especially the chemical changes in the blood composition. When the blood contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, this sensitive part produces a reaction, issuing a special nerve stimulation. This stimulation can reach the heart and lungs, and also cause the entire body to produce various necessary exercise procedures)

During exercise, because it is necessary to expel carbon dioxide on the one hand, and also to supply a large amount of oxygen to the exercising muscles on the other hand, the required oxygen is eight times more than usual. The heart is also the same. Usually, the heart pumps out a certain amount of blood per minute. During exercise, the nerve stimulation from the central control part stimulates the heart, causing the blood passing through the heart to increase, and the speed of blood circulation can also be eight times faster than usual.

In order to adapt to this need, the heart accelerates its work on the one hand, and the pulse increases from 75 times per minute to more than 150 times. On the other hand, the heart also temporarily expands, increasing the amount of blood it pumps out. At the same time, the heart muscles must have strong elasticity. The greater the expansion of the heart muscles, the greater the ability to transport blood. Relying solely on heart expansion and heart rate increase is still not enough to meet the needs during exercise.

The parts that are most active or work most intensely during exercise should receive the most blood supply. The digestive system is not very active during exercise, so the blood supply is reduced. However, after exercise, the digestive system can not only restore its proper blood supply, but also accelerate the digestive function and absorb the nutrients of food as much as possible.

Exercise can also enhance the function of blood vessels. Because during exercise, active and intensely working tissues and muscles should receive a large supply of blood, the blood vessels in that area dilate to prepare for the transport of a large amount of blood. As for inactive parts, such as digestive organs, they can only receive a small supply of blood, so the blood vessels in that area contract. This expansion and contraction of blood vessels can make the function of the circulatory system normal and active. (1) (Replacing oxygen with O)

### On Movie Songs

— Han Bo

Movie songs in China have only a short history of a few years, but the influence they have given to society is already extremely widespread.

The most significant gain is that movie songs have replaced dance songs in popularity among the people.

The songs we hear today in streets, schools, or organizations are no longer tunes like "Drizzling Rain" or "Peach Blossom River," but purely screen songs that emerge from sound films. In the sales statistics of record companies, dance song records are also far less numerous than movie song records. People not only love to sing movie songs, but also enjoy listening to their soundtracks. Even general song and dance troupes are largely abandoning outdated old dance tunes and using movie songs as performance scripts. Dance halls and broadcasting stations are even more strongholds of movie songs. All these facts demonstrate the remarkable position and profound influence of movie songs in Chinese society in recent years. Therefore, we place great expectations on current movie songs.

Because movie songs not only reflect the general social conditions but also sufficiently change individual thoughts and ideas. Music can indeed cultivate people, but it also depends on whether it is good music or bad music. Movie songs cultivate individuals and, from thousands of individuals, reflect a society's life consciousness. Her importance is also evident here. Thank you, Mr. Er, for laying the foundation for movie songs (and also the foundation of the entire music scene), leaving behind countless excellent songs. Those who inherit his artistic legacy have worked very hard and achieved great success, making the movie song industry shine brightly. However, since the Shanghai and Hong Kong film industries adopted a plan to mass-produce outdated films, this brilliance has been obscured by a group of people. Toxic films cannot keep up with progressive songs, and they need songs without the meaning of the times to match them. These songs influence individuals and, consequently, reflect a society without the symbols of the times. In this way, unconscious movie songs infiltrate people's hearts.

Music is a member of the cultural and artistic departments, and its power is by no means inferior to any other member. There are illiterate people in the world, but there is no one who cannot hum a tune. In the past, when we talked about culture and resistance, and strengthening the cultural front, we mostly focused on writing, neglecting music! Especially the importance of movie songs, which should be corrected. We demand that movie song writers, at a minimum, enrich the national consciousness of movie songs and consider the great role of movie songs. Within the scope allowed by the current situation, they should use metaphors, displays, or exciting and majestic sound forms to grasp the current reality, so as to effectively influence countless individuals and cultivate the entire society at the forefront of the times. Decadent music is absolutely unacceptable now. Current movie songs cannot be produced in small rooms alone; they also require a combination of subjective consciousness and objective environment. Movie song writers cannot despise their own position and the importance of the songs. Distorting the content and consciousness of the songs is no different from poisoning the masses, which is absolutely not what we expect.

### The Unknown Hero of Spain

— Translated by Lü Jue Liang

You unknown hero,

Vanishing upon Spanish soil,

In that valley of blood,

You faithfully worked,

And bravely fought victorious battles,

For the wishes of all the people.

The commemorative beer that arose,

Has its head high, writing in the azure sky.

But now destruction rules everywhere,

And the sound of cannons is heard;

It will inscribe for you,

The words unknown hero.

Because of the suffering of mankind,

Your heart was shaken,

But for the attainment of freedom,

No one should be surprised and flustered,

Naturally, you rose up,

Stepping forward to face danger on the battlefield.

Ah, the life-taking gun,

Towards your steel-like chest;

The ruthless bullet teaches you to pick up,

Helpless fate,

Then, you are abandoned in the valley of blood,

Just when blood is being shed for war.

### Guessing Germany's "New Books"

— Wang Yin

According to a report by the Haitong News Agency: Germany published the most new books in the world last year, totaling 25,400 volumes.

This is truly worthy of our envy, but it also makes us wonder: Since Germany became Hitler's world, we have only heard of the continuous burning of books, and the "number" of books destroyed is "the highest in the world." How can it suddenly produce so many books?

Naturally, the news clearly stated that they are "new books." If old ones are burned, new ones must be produced. That's right, very correct. But we can't help but ask again: What exactly are these 'new books' published in a year?

Although we live far away, we have roughly learned from telegrams what kind of books Germany burned in the past. Although the 'new books' published this time have not yet been described in terms of their categories, it is not difficult for us to guess a general idea.

Now, let me guess and try to give a statistical table of the categories of these 25,400 volumes of 'new books' as follows:

Praising Hitler and the National Socialist Party 13,000 volumes

Scolding Socialism and the Soviet Union 5,000 volumes

Telling Women to Return to the Kitchen 2,000 volumes

Talking about Austria being Germany 3,000 volumes

Saying that the Czech Republic must be protected by Germany 3,000 volumes

Pointing out that Jews are all bad guys 3,000 volumes

Discussing that Ukraine has 500,000 Germans 400 volumes

Total: 25,400 volumes

I dare say that my table is quite accurate.

But if you still want to ask: What is the "number" of readers of these books? That has become a difficult question to answer. However, we can guess a general idea. That is: When the "number" of readers is compared with the "number" of books, the phenomenon must also be "the highest in the world".

### Mountain Dwelling

— Tang Yingwei

After running to a lonely island in the South, the past memories of my mountain dwelling always lingered in my mind.

The majestic peaks of the Great Kunlun Mountain stood high, overlooking the entire mountain city. What a small city! Who would have thought that I would live in this small city for a year.

It was the summer season, and the fields were filled with lush green rice seedlings. Diligent farmers bent their backs and worked under the sun. What a beautiful pastoral picture it was when I first stepped into the threshold of this mountain city. I thought so with praise.

After settling my luggage, I began my mountain dwelling life.

With a leisurely mood, I often wanted to explore this wilderness.

The morning light brought the crisp sound of mountain songs, the mooing of cows, and the shouts of farmers urging their cattle. All these sounds formed a rural symphony. In my drowsy sleep, I smiled.

Leaving the bird's nest-like lodging, I stepped on the footprints of cattle and slowly walked towards the fields.

"Sir, you must be from the provincial capital! The Japanese ×× planes haven't come again, have they?"

"Why wouldn't the ×× planes come? But we are not afraid of its bombs!"

The women working in the fields, seeing me, a stranger, slowly approaching, asked me questions out of concern for current affairs, not afraid of strangers, not afraid of Japanese bombs finding them. For the sake of life, they also had to come to this interior under the whip of life. But my answer was so contradictory!

—We should say that we are bringing culture to the countryside!

Thinking of this, I felt the responsibility of cultural people coming to the countryside. But my first meeting with the farmers paid out a contradictory blank check.

A silent mountain dwelling, like a pool of stagnant water, as quiet as a grain of rice.

Sometimes, sitting in the house, I would occasionally feel lonely.

Let's throw a small stone into this stagnant water, perhaps it will stir up a ripple of excitement.

Because I am not a person who can shout before the masses, I have to use my hands and my thoughts to create pictures one after another, displayed before the public, as a tool for my advocacy. I thought: Utilizing the barren slopes of the mountains can increase agricultural production during the war. Holding an anti-war propaganda art exhibition in this quiet rural area can serve as a prelude to the literacy movement. It shouldn't be considered a waste of work!

Ideals often cannot provide people with the realization of reality. Farmers need quiet work and do not need floating struggles. They know that ×× is hateful, but they are happy if ×× doesn't come to trample on their hometowns—their wishes belong to the ideal, and when I use them as propaganda objects, I can't help but feel the indifference of the rural people's anti-war emotions.

A mountain city that has lost its soul!

A stagnant pool that cannot stir up ripples.

The distant north is filled with the smoke of war. The soldiers, braving the artillery fire of the × people, advance, treading on the bloodstains of the martyrs. We, a group living in the rear, in this atmosphere of stagnant water, have to relax our iron-tense mood. Let's pick up our guns and go to the mountains! Practice guerrilla warfare. Take the flying birds in the sky as × planes, and the sparrows on the branches as × people, surround, attack, and capture. In the twilight, we return singing the victory song of the guerrillas.

Such a quiet mountain dwelling spent a year of my quiet life.

However, less than a few months after I left this mountain city, the × people had already invaded the threshold of this earthen city. Boom, boom, the sound of huge bombs awakened this group of people who loved peace. This mountain area is no longer a pool of stagnant water, but has long become a raging wave.

The farmers in the mountain city finally roared.

### The King of Chu

— Li Zhiyi

Historical films are not a replication of history, so slight adaptations are permissible, and sometimes even necessary. However, this "permissible" or "necessary" should be based on a new historical perspective, using it selectively and critically. Otherwise, it would be like putting a cow's head on a horse's body, adding legs to a snake, or drawing a tiger and resembling a dog, which would be a joke.

Therefore, the difficulty of historical films (so-called "costume dramas") lies not only in the verification of costumes and props and the grandeur of the scenes, but also in the author's viewpoint. There will inevitably be the producer's subjectivity, and therefore it cannot be ambiguous. The editor who compiles news should be the most "objective." However, in the size of the headlines and the prominence of the position, he still cannot escape his likes and dislikes and the reflection of his awareness of certain news. As a work of art, can a film transcend worldly affairs and become a "third person"?

Therefore, our basic attitude towards the adaptation of historical films is not about how faithful to historical facts, but about how to use the standpoint of modern Chinese people to critically accept the lessons of history.

Regarding the theme of "The King of Chu," director Wang Cilong stated very clearly: "Because we want to make the story conform to modern trends, taking Xiang Yu and Liu Bang as examples, one advocates exhausting military force and reading military books, while the other advocates benevolence, righteousness, and peace. As a result, the former failed and the latter succeeded. This is the tragic theme of 'The King of Chu.'"

"Exhausting military force" and "benevolence, righteousness, and peace" are aimed at the current situation in China and the current situation in the world. "The benevolent prosper, and the hegemon perishes." This is originally an unchanging truth, but we still need to add a precise annotation to "advocating war" and "advocating peace." Otherwise, Yue Fei, who "advocated war," would become a sinner for thousands of years, while Qin Hui, who "advocated peace," would become a meritorious official for all ages. At a time when traitors like Wang Jingwei use selling out the country as an excuse for "peace," and Eastern fascists with mouths full of "kingly way" cannot step down from advocating war, and when everyone desperately seeks peace to protect their stolen goods, simply talking about "advocating war" and "advocating peace" in words is really in danger of becoming the "tail" of the aggressors. I think the original intention of the film's producers would not be like this.

Therefore, regarding "peace" and "war," we should really look at it further.

After failing in "punishment" and despairing of "purification," the Eastern fascists' new policy implemented in the Jiangnan region is a policy of appeasement, which is also to buy people's hearts. The so-called policy of appeasement, when exposed, is really worthless. On the one hand, it instigates traitors to collect grain and other things through extortion and deception. Then, they come forward to transport a portion of the grain from area A to area B for disaster relief, pretending to be the "army of the king." On the surface, they are the masters of "benevolence, righteousness, and peace," but in reality? —Anyway, very few people know this trick.

And is such "benevolence, righteousness, and peace" truly "benevolence, righteousness, and peace"?

"The King of Chu" uses the victory of "benevolence, righteousness, and peace" and the failure of "exhausting military force" as its "dramatic theme." This is originally very good, but the pity lies precisely here. It only writes the surface and does not dissect it further, and this is not enough.

We sympathize with the producers' painstaking efforts, and we admire such a solemn dramatic theme. At the same time, precisely because of this time and place, we cannot but demand perfection to prevent abuses. —In case such a play flows into the occupied area for public performance, then such defects should be prevented even more.

Regarding this point, I would like to give an example to discuss it:

"After Xiang Yu advanced his army to Xianyang, he did not listen to the advice of the crowd, killed the Qin Prince Ziying, and slaughtered tens of thousands of people in Xianyang." Later, there was a scene on the screen of a woman attempting to assassinate the King in his tent. This scene is very important, and the woman's words are even more worthy of our attention. She said: "After the people overthrew the King of Qin, what they hoped for was an army of benevolence, righteousness, and peace. Who knew that as soon as the King arrived in Xianyang, he killed countless people... So the families of those who were killed formed an alliance, made into bayonets, and she entered the tent to attempt the assassination, in order to avenge the killed people..." (The general idea is like this). From the perspective of the dramatic theme, it does conform to the "dramatic theme" and shows that the people cannot be lightly humiliated. However, in our view, we feel that such a "dramatic theme" still needs to be given a clear indication. First, we should correctly and clearly indicate who the × people of the people are. Second, we must fix the × people. In this way, we will not mistakenly regard the violent and cruel × people as an army of benevolence, righteousness, and peace, and place hopes of appeasement on them. In this place, we can only emphasize the "dramatic theme" from the standpoint of today's Chinese people to warn the wavering, complacent, and backward people. If such a theme is not expressed clearly, it may lead to many misunderstandings.

Unfortunately, "The King of Chu" did not clearly and 100% achieve this.

In other respects, in the compilation of the script, it seems that because too much emphasis was placed on several key scenes, the transitional scenes were neglected, so that people had the feeling of watching a Peking Opera like "The Complete Chu-Han Contention," forming a continuous feeling of old plays. This is indeed because there is too much historical material, which is not easy to handle, but it is also because the playwright placed too much emphasis on the heroism of the King. History is not made by individuals. It is also a dangerous thing to overemphasize the individual and ignore his environment and evolution.

This may be because the playwright was influenced by Peking Opera (shooting costume dramas is difficult; how to jump out of the influence of Peking Opera is one of them), so in the division of scenes, he unconsciously created this. The same is true for the compilation of dialogues, the actors' movements, and the recitations.

Wang Yuanlong's King of Chu has his merits in his roughness, but his aura of strength to uproot mountains is not enough. Especially his posture on horseback, because of his insufficient physique, is even less able to depict this one-time hero. Jin Suqin's Yu Ji has few scenes, and perhaps because it is her first time on camera, she is not amazing. In terms of temperament, there also seem to be places for discussion among the other actors.

The most commendable aspect of this play is the grandeur of the scenes. From this point of view, it can be seen that no expense was spared. However, because the × people are not written clearly enough, although a great deal of money was spent, we still cannot feel completely satisfied.

Shooting costume dramas has its special advantages, which lie in alluding to the present through the past. From the perspective of the Chinese people in this time and place, "The King of Chu" is not satisfying enough.
