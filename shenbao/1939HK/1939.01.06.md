### Xiangyou Dian Travel Diary (3)

— Chen Zhixiong

Huangping - Guiyang: I got up at 6:00 AM on the 21st of last month because the car was scheduled to leave at 7:30 AM. I quickly bought coffee, meat, and rice wine at the gate to satisfy my hunger. The prices were cheap and the quality was good. This was the only food available for sale in the early morning. If you wanted to buy other kinds of breakfast, there was nowhere to buy them. Soon after departure, we ascended a high mountain. Looking down, people looked like ants. The car arrived at Chongnv and crossed over again. The mountain road was rugged, and the jolts were severe, causing headaches. The car arrived at Mafang and then Huangsi Town. This place is still 99 kilometers away from Guiyang. When the car approached Shaping, the mountain road turned silver-gray. The car crossed Wengcheng Bridge, Gouling, and then climbed the mountain again, passing Longyitang, Mazhipu, Longligu Street, Malu, Nierguan, Huangnishao, Longlibao, and finally reached Tulongguan, only 9 kilometers away from Guiyang. When the car crossed Yugao Bridge, we had reached the outskirts of Guiyang. The scenery outside the city was serene and free from worldly dust. Along the Zhuh River, the mountains were clear and the water was beautiful. The car had just passed Zhongshan Park and arrived at the station. It was already past 3:00 PM. The military police at the station checked very strictly. Even showing a pass was ignored. It was said that they were under orders to open the luggage for inspection before allowing passage. So, I ordered the driver to carry the luggage to the hotel. The daily accommodation cost was $1.20, meals were separate. I had to use a kerosene lamp at night. The owner was from Zhejiang, and the food he prepared was very poor. After a short rest, I went out for a walk. During this extraordinary period, the streets were filled with soldiers. Besides cars, small horses were mostly used to carry goods. The horses seemed to understand human intentions and knew their way. The Zhongshan Road area was the most prosperous. The management of the Guiyang Electric Plant was probably inadequate. The streetlights were dim and lackluster at night. Because of the poor inland transportation, goods were expensive, especially imported goods and daily necessities, which were three or four times more expensive than in Shanghai.

The weather today was quite hot. Around 10:00 AM, Mr. Zhang and I went to Yuegong Restaurant for lunch. Then we went to the Commercial Press and the Chung Hwa Book Company to buy books. After that, we went to Datongmen Yumen Road, Gong Road, and reached Guangfo Temple. In front of the temple is Jiaxiu Immortal Pavilion. The four characters were written by a certain Taoist priest. The calligraphy was elegant and leisurely, suspected to be written by an immortal. We sat on the stones in front of the pavilion to rest. Looking far at the mountains, the pavilions and towers were clearly visible, making people linger and reluctant to leave. Then we passed Yu Fu Bridge. There are pavilions on the bridge, with many famous inscriptions.

(1) Water emerges from a jade ring, people walk in a lotus petal.

(2) Misty rain pavilions outside the mountains, books and paintings on the city walls reflected in the water.

(3) The Milky Way floats with clouds, stars cross the water, jade halberds drag rain, geese cross the autumn. (4) Taking a short rest and becoming an immortal, listening to the sound of pearls and orioles, turtle reefs, fish singing, general's pillars, rain pattering.

Arriving suddenly in the city, the dust and noise far away, copper cliffs flanking the reeds and sheng pipes, ancestral halls in the clouds, dew.

After crossing Yufu Bridge and passing through the North Gate, we returned. In the evening, we had dinner at Zhuguang Restaurant and then watched a military movie.

A Trip to Qianling Mountain

The weather today was still very hot. In the afternoon, Mr. Zhang and I took a trip to Qianling Mountain. The mountain is two or three miles west of the city. The mountain road is steep, and it was quite strenuous to climb. After about an hour, we reached the foot of the mountain, as if we had encountered peach blossoms, as the dense shade was distributed, the green leaves were whirling, interspersed with red and purple, which was very pleasing to the eye. We slowly climbed to its peak, and the higher we went, the cooler our mood became, and we could no longer see the sun. First, we went to the Guan Temple and the Washing Bowl Pond, and then we reached the Great Hall of the Great Hero, the atmosphere was gloomy, there were several Buddha statues, tall and majestic, gorgeous and extraordinary, then the mountain road was inclined. When we reached the top of the mountain, we felt exhausted. Then we went down the mountain, walked along the slope, to the ancient Buddha Qilin Cave. There were stalactites at the entrance of the cave, hanging down like a Qilin, hence the name. Due to time constraints, we hurried out and took a car back, and then the lamp was all over the city.

Guiyang - Yongning, I got up at about 5:00 AM on the 26th of last month, because the car left very early. After 11 kilometers, we reached Er. From Guiyang to here, the road was half flat. After that, we reached Goufang, Haozhitang, Xiagaocun, Shoulishan, and Qingzhen. Because the car was moving very fast, there was no time to appreciate the scenery, which was a pity.

The car entered the city, passed through Zhongzheng Road, and then left the city. What we saw along the way was all poor people's areas. After about 42 kilometers, the car arrived at Yalongfeng, which is the place where General Li Zikang, the commander of the 38th Division, died. Soon after, the car arrived at Buyunguan and Pingba County, and then entered the city. There is a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the city, which is very magnificent. There are few people in the city, only a few dozen families. The car continued to move forward, passing Xiatoupu, Shazishao, Shibanwu, and then to Dashuiqiao. The water under the bridge is very shallow, I don't know where the name Dashui (Big Water) comes from. After 75 kilometers, the car arrived at Daizijie, after 88 kilometers, we arrived at Liangsuosheng, after 95 kilometers, we arrived at Anshun Station. The city is very clean. All guests who want to go to Yongning must prepare food such as head cakes in advance here. There should be enough food prepared on the road, lest the car be delayed on the road. After lunch, the car left Anshun, passed Dashanshao, and arrived at Ning, then entered the city. The car stopped for about ten minutes and then started again. There were many Miao people along the way, with peculiar costumes. After a long time, the car arrived at Guanling and saw a large waterfall, like a large silver pillar pouring into the valley, the sound shaking the mountains. Soon we arrived at Dapotop, Baling, and after the car arrived at Yazi Village, the water in the car tank was exhausted, so the car stopped on the road, and the driver went up the mountain to fetch water. After filling it up, we continued to drive, to Guanlingfang, along the way there were large mountains, and the car was not easy to drive. When we arrived at Shuiningmou, it was already dusk, so we stayed in a traveler's inn. The inn was dirty and unbearable, so we slept with our clothes on.

Yongning - Panxian I got up at dawn on the 27th of last month, because the car was scheduled to leave at 8:05 AM. There were many stones along the mountain, and it was very difficult for the car to drive. Soon we arrived at Xinpu Street, the streets were very stable, there were only twenty or so poor families. After that, it was barren wilderness, and there were no people. Soon we arrived at Panjiang, the color was turbid like mud, and it was poisonous. When the car arrived at the Iron Chain Bridge, all the passengers got off the car. There is a female stone statue next to the bridge, the carving is very exquisite, supported by six iron chains, so it is called Iron Chain Bridge. People walking over it are cautious. Looking at the front of the bridge, the two mountains are thousands of feet high, facing each other, with rivers running through the middle, the scenery is amazing. The car crossed Shanjiang, the terrain was steep and difficult to climb. Looking down at the famous mountain valley from the car, it was unfathomably deep. The car circled continuously on the mountain, and the head was dizzy. After the car traveled two thousand li, we arrived at Shenshuiying. From here we went to Hataizhuang, the characters were written by Mr. Zeng Yangfu, vigorous and powerful. When the car was 233 kilometers away from Guiyang, the situation was extremely dangerous, turning twenty-four times on the high mountain. Or left, or right, or up, or down, circulating back and forth, making people dizzy and frightened. If the driver accidentally turned the corner, he would fall into the abyss. It is said that several accidents have happened to cars in front of them. Now passing by, I am still a little scared in my heart. When we arrived at Shaziling, the water in the car was boiling and could not go forward. The car stopped again, and after adding cold water, it was able to drive again. The car traveled through Bazhu for about three hours before going up the mountain. It can be imagined how high the mountain is. The mountains are rich in coal deposits, and the soil is dark red, suspected to be oxidized or iron. It is a pity that the place is remote and no one is mining. It is a great source of profit, hidden underground, which is a pity. The car traveled about 300 kilometers, arrived at Anpu Peak Temple and reached Sanban Bridge. A clear stream under the bridge, crossed the bridge and went up the mountain, the color of the mountain was like vermilion. The car passed through here, the scenery of Sanbamen was exceptionally elegant, looking at the mountains on the opposite side, or red or green, competing with each other for glory, it was very spectacular. The magnificence of the mountains and rivers is nowhere to be found here. Although there was no danger on the car ride today, climbing this mountain allowed us to appreciate the mountain scenery, and our mood suddenly felt cooler. However, recalling the steepness of today's car ride, it was almost soul-stirring. From Guizhou to Yunnan, this section of the road is the most difficult to drive, because the cars are traveling on cliffs and precipices thousands of feet high. Those who read my book, if they ever find themselves in this situation, will know that my words are not false.

Panxian - Banyi I arrived at Panxian at about 4 or 5 PM yesterday, and immediately ordered the porters to carry the luggage into the city. Passing through Zhongshan County Road, the streets were very dirty. Every time I passed, I covered my nose. Fortunately, we found a hotel on the hill, which was exceptionally dark and cluttered with objects, and the room was full of smoke. But there was no better hotel to be found, so we had to stay here for one night. The same was true of Tongxing Warehouse, just as bad. However, the accommodation and meals were very cheap, only 50 cents for one night and two meals. At night, the citizens came and went endlessly. The mountains were lit up with lights and stalls selling goods, mainly cloth, towels, and odds and ends. The people simply did not know what hygiene was, and their intellectual level was extremely low. They acted without order, far from the New Life Movement. I hope the authorities will pay attention to this. The owner was very kind to the guests. There were still many people smoking opium here. The government should ban it. The car left Panxian at 8:15 AM. Although the road was high in the mountains, it was very flat and not tiring. After the car passed Pingyisuo, the mountain scenery was magnificent and the scenery was pleasant. When we arrived at Jingsheng Pass, the mountain was dangerous. Fortunately, the car was safe and arrived at Banyi at 3:00 PM. After staying in Banyi for three days, we took a car to Yunnan. The road was flat along the way. Because I was tired, I didn't record anything along the way. The car was driving very fast, reaching 60 kilometers per hour. The car was shaking very badly. When we arrived at Huguo Street in Kunming, it was already afternoon. If I have time in the future, I will make a trip to Yunnan to share with my readers.

Chinese men and women returning to their homeland and planning to retreat south in the near future must obtain a passport from the Chinese Consulate General before leaving. The passport fee is $4.56 in Straits currency, plus a Chinese Overseas Registration Certificate for $0.12 in Straits currency. Each person should submit six 4-inch half-length photos. Spouses and children under the age of sixteen can be photographed together on one photo. The passport should be submitted to the local photo bureau (in the Chinese Affairs Department building of the Civil Affairs Secretary Office) for visa endorsement, which costs $6 in Straits currency.

Those who do not have an entry permit can apply for an entry permit from the Immigration Department (in the Chinese Affairs Department building of the Civil Affairs Secretary Office), which costs $5 in Straits currency and also requires two 4-inch photos, to avoid the procedures for new immigrants when coming south in the future. If traveling in the steerage class, a passport and visa are not required, but an entry permit must still be obtained in advance.

When women apply for an entry permit, they must be guaranteed by their father, husband, or senior relatives. Professional women and school teachers should be guaranteed by the employer's store and the school principal.

### Special Shipping Information

The Jeliss铎加苏 (Jeliss铎加苏) liner, represented by the Tianxiang 洋行 (Tianxiang Trading Company), departed from Luzon on November 25th of last year, bound for the United States. After several days at sea, it strayed due to heavy fog and ran aground on Huadi Island. Subsequently, a tugboat was dispatched from Hong Kong to rescue it and towed it back to the Kowloon Shipyard for repairs. After half a month, this reporter visited the Kowloon Docks yesterday and saw that the bottom of the ship, cargo hold, engine room, reverse gear, and other parts were still under repair and were expected to be completed by the end of this month.

The Italian Postal Ship Company's Gandrosu (干德羅素) departed from Shanghai yesterday for Hong Kong. It is expected to arrive at the Kowloon Warehouse Pier around 6:00 AM this morning and will depart at noon on the same day for Singapore, Mumbai, Colombo, Geneva, and Italy.

The Feidaren (非打倫) liner, represented by the Meizuishi 洋行 (Meizuishi Trading Company), was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Yabao today, but according to the company, the liner will be delayed until the 12th of this month.

### Dominating China's Textile Industry

Furthermore, Japan's trade control today has practically implemented the so-called "import-export chain system". Anyone wishing to import raw materials must have an export of manufactured goods of equivalent value. Since the outbreak of the war, wheat production in "North China" has plummeted. Coupled with the severe famine in the Northeast and Japan itself, the recent surge in rice prices is particularly indicative of the food panic within the country. Therefore, the export of Japanese flour is invisibly further restricted.

There is an even more significant reason: the large-scale activities of Japanese flour industry capital in China. Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese flour mills have almost entirely shut down or been destroyed by artillery fire. Japanese merchants, backed by their military, have either directly seized undamaged flour mills in the war zone and started operations themselves, or, through threats and inducements, have forced Chinese merchants to start operations under joint management. Some Japanese merchants, also seeking to monopolize the Chinese market, have come to China one after another to establish factories or expand their existing factories in China, greatly increasing production. Therefore, the Chinese-Japanese flour mills in the occupied areas today have almost all been revived in the hands of the Japanese, and are under the control of the three major Japanese flour cartels: "Nippon Flour Milling", "Nissin Flour Milling", and "Nitto Flour Milling", forming such a monopolistic front.

Nippon Flour Milling Co., Ltd. The company currently has 11 flour mills in "North China", with a daily production capacity of 12,000 bags. If combined with the newly established factory in Shanghai, the daily production capacity reaches a huge 14,000 bags. Among them, the sub-company "Sankichi Flour Mill" has three mills. The company directly operates only one mill in Tianjin with a capacity of 1,250 bags. In addition, the other seven mills are Chinese-owned flour mills that are now operated by the company. Therefore, the company's flour mills are densely distributed in Qingdao, Jinan, Tianjin, Jining, Xuzhou, and other places. Recently, Fuxin No. 3 Mill in Shanghai has also fallen into the hands of the company, indicating that the company's power is now extending into the Yangtze River basin.

Nissin Flour Milling Co., Ltd. Currently, the company only has two mills in Jinan and Beiping. The mill in Jinan was forcibly seized from a Chinese-owned flour mill by the Japanese army and is being operated under the so-called "military occupation". The mill in Beiping was acquired from a Chinese-owned flour mill that was in debt. The company is currently looking for factory sites, attempting to participate in the competition to monopolize the Chinese flour market.

Nitto Flour Milling Co., Ltd. The company entered "North China" earlier, but its power is not as great as that of Nippon Flour Milling Co., Ltd. However, recently three Chinese-owned flour mills in the Kaifeng area have been revived under the company's banner. According to the company's plan, it intends to establish its exclusive territory in the flour market along the Pinghan Railway and Shanxi areas.

Judging from the current actions of these three major flour cartels, the Chinese flour market seems to have been properly divided. The Jinpu Railway area and the Yangtze River basin are controlled by Nippon Flour Milling Co., Ltd. The Pinghan Railway area and the west are the operational territory of Nitto Flour Milling Co., Ltd. Nissin Flour Milling Co., Ltd. has a tendency to operate in the Pingsui Railway and Beining Railway areas and to the north.

### An Overview of Overseas Chinese Relief Efforts in the Year Since the Start of the War: Notable Achievements in Mobilizing Human and Financial Resources; Hong Kong Chinese Rank Only Fourth or Fifth in Donations

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government recently released a report on overseas Chinese affairs in the year since the start of the war. It provided detailed information on the achievements of overseas Chinese communities in various ports in their patriotic movements, including contributions of manpower, material resources, and financial support. Excerpts are provided below for the reference of the Hong Kong Chinese community, to encourage them to work even harder:

Outbreak of War Fuels Enthusiastic Donations

After the Lugouqiao Incident, before the government organized fundraising and before the issuance of national bonds, overseas Chinese already began donating to the war effort. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received its first donation on July 22. From then until August 13, it received 18 donations totaling over 80,000 yuan. Many donations received after August 13 were actually remitted before then. These included 35,200 yuan from Chinese in Vancouver and 71,186 yuan from Chinese in Seattle, all donated between July 7 and August 13. This shows that overseas Chinese donations were not only the most substantial but also the earliest. Their spirit of initiative is commendable, and their foresight is unmatched.

Reaching 80 Million in One Year

Overseas Chinese donations were remitted through various channels. Due to local circumstances, some could only raise relief funds, not direct war donations, and these relief funds were often sent to the Chinese Red Cross. Others were sent through fundraising organizations, such as those affiliated with Kuomintang headquarters or branches, which remitted funds to the central party headquarters. Donations collected by consulates were sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some donations were earmarked for specific purposes, such as aid for wounded soldiers and refugees, which were sent to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Funds for purchasing military supplies were sent to the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of War, or the Aviation Commission. Some donations were sent based on hometown ties, such as Guangdong Chinese remitting funds to the Guangdong provincial government. Funds for national salvation bonds were sent to the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee or designated banks, as stipulated. Many donations were also sent directly to the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is now investigating donations through various fundraising channels. A detailed report of the total amount is expected in the near future. Current estimates suggest that overseas Chinese donations have reached approximately 80 million yuan. While this is an approximate figure, it is likely close to the actual amount. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received donations totaling over 313,000 yuan in various currencies. Additionally, 754,294.97 yuan was originally remitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was intercepted by the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee. 290,990.76 yuan was originally remitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was transferred to the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee by the Central Bank. 44,140.17 yuan was originally remitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was transferred to the Ministry of Finance by the Bank of China. In total, approximately 1.4 million yuan was handled this way.

Hong Kong Ranks Fourth or Fifth

As of May of this year, donations and bond purchases from British Malaya totaled over 24 million yuan, ranking first. However, based on population proportion, the approximately 110,000 Chinese in the Philippines donated and purchased bonds totaling 8 million Philippine pesos, an average of about 80 pesos per person, making them the top donors in the initial stage. Chinese in Australia, the Americas, and elsewhere were also very enthusiastic. (Note: Hong Kong Chinese donations rank only fourth or fifth.) This shows that overseas Chinese everywhere are enthusiastic, with any differences due to varying circumstances. Regular, systematic, and planned donations are now being conducted everywhere, with impressive results. Singapore's regular monthly donation method is based on existing hometown organizations, dividing donors into six groups: Hokkien, Cantonese, Chaozhou, Hakka, Hainanese, and Ningbo, each responsible for fundraising. Additionally, a percentage is levied on each unit of production of Chinese-run businesses, generating over 1.5 million yuan monthly. The Philippines' regular monthly donation program was initiated and managed by the Philippine Chinese Aid to Resist × Committee in March of this year.

Economic Sanctions: Hitting the × People

The foundation for a sustained war of resistance lies in a sound and solid economic foundation. The active aspect of implementation lies in economic construction, while the passive aspect lies in inflicting economic blows on the × people. Overseas Chinese are particularly well-suited for this special task, as they are spread throughout the world and mostly operate as retailers. If they unite to boycott × goods, Japan's international trade will suffer a major blow. The effectiveness of overseas Chinese economic sanctions against Japan over the past year has been significant. Reports on Japanese imports in the Nanyang region (where most Chinese reside) and statistics on exports from the × Ministry of Finance to Nanyang demonstrate the impact of overseas Chinese economic sanctions. In addition to boycotting goods, blocking raw materials to Japan is also a key task. The × people rely heavily on raw materials from Nanyang, with iron ore from Malaya being particularly important. Before the war, × × annually obtained over 1.5 million tons of iron ore from Malaya. After the start of the war, Chinese workers at × × mines in various parts of Johor went on strike, followed by workers in other regions like Kuantan and Johor Bahru. As a result, almost all × × mines shut down, reducing monthly iron ore shipments to Japan by over 90%.

Mobilization of Manpower and Resources

The mobilization of manpower and resources is a complex issue that cannot be fully described. At the beginning of the war, thousands of overseas Chinese clamored to return to China to fight against the ×. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recognized and praised their patriotic aspirations, but also considered the potential drawbacks. It believed that overseas Chinese could best contribute by providing financial support. Instead of abandoning their hard-earned jobs to engage in unskilled military service, they should focus on their strengths. It communicated this policy to overseas Chinese communities, urging them to prioritize production and take on the dual responsibility of providing funds and resources. As a result, the number of overseas Chinese returning to China has gradually decreased, but the supply of skilled personnel continues uninterrupted. For example, Chinese in Vietnam and the Americas have supported aviation development. In addition to sending trained personnel back to China, they are also sponsoring local aviation training at public expense. Recently, Chinese in the United States established the "Overseas Chinese Aviation School" to train aviation personnel. Other regions are providing a steady stream of specialists in aviation, machinery, air defense, chemical defense, communications, engineering, medicine, and rescue. (Remainder omitted)

### Residents' Association to be Established Within the Month: Actively Safeguarding Residents' Interests

In recent years, Hong Kong's population has surged, leading to a housing shortage. In this extraordinary situation, residents' interests are often affected. Those concerned about social welfare have formed the "Hong Kong Li Long Residents' Association" to safeguard residents' interests.

Fundraising Concludes

As a result, it has gained sympathy from all walks of life, with many joining. According to a statement by an executive of the association, fundraising concluded last night. Mr. Liao Jiongquan won the overall silver award and the highest number of people, raising a total of 4,359.4 yuan. Other teams also achieved good results. The association has scheduled the inauguration ceremony within this month, inviting prominent figures from all walks of life to participate.

### Conflict over Old Debt Leads to Shooting in Lok Ma Chau Late at Night: Refugee Father and Son Wounded, Wife Killed; Two Assailants at Large, Police Issue Arrest Warrant

Around 11 PM the night before last, a shooting occurred in the Chiau Mei area of Lok Ma Chau in the New Territories, resulting in the death of one woman and injuries to a man and a child. The victims were refugees from Bao'an who had fled to Hong Kong. Unable to escape the ravages of war, they fell victim to criminals. This is a tragedy within a tragedy. The following is a detailed account: (Originally refugees from Bao'an who fled to Hong Kong)

The victim in this case was Huang Zhong, a female refugee from Bao'an, 41 years old. Her husband was Wang, and they had three children: a 17-year-old eldest daughter, an 11-year-old second son, and an 8-year-old youngest son. They originally lived in Jiada Village, Bao'an. A month ago, × × invaded Bao'an, causing devastation. Huang and her family fled to Hong Kong, crossing the border at Lok Ma Chau, built a thatched hut in Chiau Mei, and temporarily eked out a living. Recently, Bao'an has been recovered by our army, but Huang and her family remained in the New Territories due to the large number of children and the difficulty of moving. They intended to return home after the situation stabilized.

(Conflict Leads to Gun Violence)

Suddenly, Huang's brothers, Huang Jinwen and Huang Hai, came to visit. That afternoon, Huang Zhong kept the two at the hut for dinner, and they were very happy and sociable. One of them even told Huang that they recently acquired two handguns. Huang Zhong then brought up the issue of repaying an old debt. He explained that the two owed him money back home, and since they now had money to buy guns, they should repay the debt. They refused, leading to a dispute. After they left, they returned around midnight and called Huang Zhong and his wife out of the hut. It is unknown what happened, but they began arguing again. Huang Zhong's wife also came out of the hut, and the two assailants opened fire, killing the wife and wounding Huang Zhong and his 11-year-old son, Huang Ri. They then fled. It was late at night, and there was no way to call for help. Only at dawn did someone nearby help them inform the police, who sent the two injured to the hospital for treatment and the deceased to the mortuary. The police are now searching for the assailants to bring them to justice.

### Iron-Willed Diplomat Chen Youren to Resume Foreign Affairs; Will Cable Central Government with Observations on the Current Situation

After Wang Jingwei violated discipline, endangered the party and the country, deserted his post, and issued a telegram advocating peace, the central government authorities have already imposed strict sanctions. At the same time, to strengthen the administrative structure and the strength of the war effort, there have been some adjustments in personnel. The president of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, has decided to accept the post of vice president of the Kuomintang. Chen Youren, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has been in Hong Kong for a long time and has not been involved in politics, is also rumored to be resuming his post. A reporter visited Mr. Chen yesterday to inquire about his views on the current situation and his opinions on resuming his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He made the following remarks: According to Chen, he will submit his views on the current situation to the Central Government by telegram, which will be sent out after revision in the coming days. Regarding the matter of resuming the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen said that he only learned about it from the newspapers and has not yet received any telegram from the Central Government. If the Central Government authorities appoint him, he will do his best to serve the country.

### Hong Kong Women Can Hardly Represent Chinese Women; Guang Yinyuan Abandons "Miss China"

Ms. Kuang Guangyin, an overseas Chinese from the United States, came to Hong Kong via the Pan American Clipper to seek a standard beauty as Miss China to attend the Golden Gate International Exposition. Now, Ms. Kuang has found her goal difficult to achieve and has abandoned the plan. According to Ms. Kuang, Hong Kong women can hardly represent all Chinese women. Ms. Li has scheduled to return to the United States on the Philippine Clipper today.

It is requested that Hong Kong women's groups raise 40,000 yuan to purchase all medical equipment, supplies, and vehicles and transport them as soon as possible for use. The telegram was immediately sent to various Hong Kong groups, urging them to donate generously and to submit the quantity of donated goods or funds to the association as soon as possible for reporting and implementation.

### Big View Film Company Gambling Case: Police Strongly Testify; Gamblers Gathering to Gamble on Pai Gow and Poker; Deputy Attorney General Wei Yi Personally Prosecutes; Defendant Pleads Not Guilty, Hearing Adjourned

Chao Shurong, director and manager of the Big View Film Company, and Chen Chengjia were charged with running a gambling den. Huang Chong, Zhao Gang, Shang Fei, Li Liang, Chen Ruiquan, Li Hua, Li Tai, and Kuang Fu were charged with gambling. The case was formally brought before the Kowloon Magistracy for trial yesterday morning at 11:30 AM.

Qian Si Presides

The case was prosecuted by Government Deputy Attorney General Xiong Yi. The defendants hired Barrister Mike Carin to defend them. After the court opened, the barrister representing the defendants pleaded not guilty. Officer He Sheng, Badge Number 112, took the stand to testify. He stated that on the morning of the 24th of last month, he received information and reported it to Officer Yi Hua. At 12:20 AM, Yi Hua led him, Detective Hu Jin, and several other police officers to the address. As he approached the intersection of Ma Tau Wai Road and Pak Tai Street, he left the group and proceeded to the Big View Film Company at 83 Pak Tai Street. Although there was someone guarding the door, he did not stop him from entering. He pushed open the door and entered the main hall, which was the film studio. As he went to the left, he saw 30 people surrounding a large table. As he approached, he saw a gambler in front of him

With four pai gow tiles in front of him and two pink chips. The gambler then opened the tiles, the first pair being 'one seven one earth' and the second pair being 'one day one person'. At this time, he saw the second defendant, Chen Chengjia, saying to the gambler, 'The two pink chips are worth a yuan. Now that you have won, you have to pay a five-cent rake-off.' The gambler listened and gave three silver coins and two white chips, which he handed to the second defendant, who put them into a white iron box. About a foot away from the pai gow table, there was also a poker game. He only saw two people gambling. At this time, Officer Yi rushed in, and he told everyone not to move, but the gamblers still ran around, trying to escape. Later, they

Arrested them. Yi Hua, an intelligence officer from the Hung Hom Police Station, then took the stand to testify. He said that after he and others arrested the defendants that night, he asked who was in charge. About three feet away from the gambling table, there was a bar. The first defendant, Zhao Gang, was standing beside the bar, in a place where his eyes could reach the gamblers. He asked who the manager was, and someone pointed out that Zhao was the manager there, and Zhao also

Admitted to it. He arrested him and returned to the station to file charges. This concludes the prosecution's testimony. The first defendant, Zhao Shurong, then took the stand to present counter-evidence. He claimed that that night, the company's affiliated sports association held a party. The proceeds were all used for refugee relief. Tourists who entered that night were given red, green, and white chips in exchange for cash, so they could spend them at various events, using the chips instead of cash. He did not stop them from gambling on pai gow because they were all doing it for fun, without real money. The hearing continued until around 1:00 PM, and the magistrate then ordered the case to be adjourned to 11:30 AM on the 9th of this month.

A Special Feature from this Newspaper

### Street Sleeper

— Zhang Min

The Hong Kong night, truly a beautiful Hong Kong—if you arrive in Hong Kong from the interior of China or Europe and America by night ship: if you arrive in Hong Kong from Kowloon by night ship, following the ship's progress, a night city like a flower lantern gradually pushes itself before you. The three-colored neon lights are the adornments of this fiery crown; the lights on the mountains resemble a string of horizontal pearls. Imagine yourself on a Star Ferry crossing the sea, following the ship's advance, a wonderland gradually unfolds before your eyes.

As the ship approaches the land, the neat asphalt roads clearly line up before you. Once the ship docks, the dazzling advertisements provide clear proof of this "commercial center of the Far East." On the street—are you following my description?—layers of skyscrapers line up before you, both sides filled with private and commercial cars. The traffic police maintaining order turn on the red light, and all car horns cease, allowing you to hurry across.

Please continue to follow me, and immediately you will find yourself on Pedder Street. In front of the Swire House Hotel, turn right along the densely parked cars. You may wonder if every resident of Hong Kong owns a car. Before your doubts are resolved, you will immediately arrive at the foot of one of Hong Kong's most magnificent buildings—Gloucester Tower. A large, luminous clock on the top of the building indicates that it is 10 p.m., the golden hour when the night is just beginning to unfold.

However, you have only seen a part of the orderly and clean facade of the entire Victoria City. I advise you to stop. But if you insist on continuing this comically short journey, then please continue west—are you following me?—After passing the post office, we will be on the tram tracks, right in the heart of the commercial district.

Be careful of the cars and stay safe. Please walk on the sidewalk under the arcades. Just as you are cautiously enjoying the scenery, your foot unexpectedly stumbles over some obstacles. Be careful, you are stepping on someone and almost fell.

Oh my god! In the cold early winter, shivering in torn cotton and worn-out rags, are these piles arranged on the sidewalk people? Yes, they are. They are people sleeping in the open, just like you and me. Isn't this the most amazing of all miracles? Ten feet away, countless cars flow by, carrying countless gentlemen and ladies returning from banquets. Within one foot, the street is full of homeless people sleeping in the open. On one hand, there are warm coats and light furs, and drunkenness and satiety. On the other hand, there are hunger, cold, and pain.

Sleeping in the open! It is a serious problem every winter in Hong Kong. There are people sleeping in the open on the side streets, and the main streets are also full of them. In the past, you could only see single men, but now entire families, old and young, men and women, are present. Especially after the [omitted due to sensitivity] invasion of the south, residents of Guangzhou and surrounding villages have come to Hong Kong one after another. With the demand for housing in Hong Kong far exceeding the supply, landlords who only care about profit evict existing tenants and rent to wealthy tenants from elsewhere. As a result, these homeless refugees and those evicted by landlords have all come to the streets! A torn mat, a tattered blanket, and a close look at the painful heads resting on mud bricks. An entire family, men, women, old and young, take this as their home, huddling together to keep warm with body heat. Each of these people has a tragic story behind them, especially these families who have fled to a foreign land. In the past, each of them had a happy family, but everything was plundered by [omitted due to sensitivity]. Most of the homeless are unemployed, and they mostly live by begging. Occasionally, they work as coolies, but the meager sum of one or two dimes earned each day is simply not enough to feed several mouths. During the day, they roll up their bedding, which they depend on for survival, carry it on their backs, and hide in the shadows of other people's eaves, like a [unclear], going everywhere to try their luck, begging for scraps of cold rice and leftover soup. Night falls. After 11 p.m. or later, the stores close, and everyone competes for a place where they are less likely to be disturbed by store owners. They then lie down to sleep, praying every night for mild weather, having to rely on luck even when they sleep. Injuries are commonplace. They only hope not to get seriously ill, and even more so not to catch a cold. If that happens, it's really bad luck!

On Christmas Eve, it was reported that three people had frozen to death. However, this is just the beginning. The cold weather will continue for three more months. There will be more frozen corpses on the road in the future. Although there is a homeless relief society, the number of homeless people is truly too many, and the relief society is truly too small, just like the refugee camps in the New Territories a few days ago, which could not accommodate many refugees despite having facilities. This is truly a blemish.

The poor people sleeping in the open in Hong Kong and Kowloon range from eighty-year-old men to eight-day-old babies. Except for the mountain areas and foreign residential areas, there is no place without them. Wait until midnight to hear the sobs of these hungry and cold people, and you will experience the bitter tune of this unseen world. There is no more ironic contrast than this: on Tan Kung Road in Kowloon, there are doghouses as beautiful as villas, while on Tan Kung Road [unclear] there are groups of people sleeping in the open. Their good dreams are often awakened by the barking of dogs [omitted due to sensitivity]!

### Travels in Macau

— Luoxia

Due to the war of resistance, many merchants and people in Hong Kong and China have suffered greatly. At the same time, precisely because of the war of resistance, the businesses that cater to pleasure consumption have flourished. This is naturally an irregular and abnormal development. Macau has also developed in this state. Taking advantage of the annual leave, the reporter ran to Macau, this Oriental Monte Carlo, to observe the lively situation there. Having only made a brief tour, I will roughly describe what I saw and heard.

Macau's Impression

Taking the steamer to Macau, in less than three hours, Macau's [unclear] silhouette appears before my eyes. The rushing water flows continuously. Small boats shuttle back and forth, calling for passengers and selling goods. The embankment stretches long, and people walk like [unclear]. At first glance, all the [unclear] figures vaguely resemble the Bund in Guangzhou in the past. But now, the cultural relics of Guangzhou are suffering shame, and the prosperous Bund has been reduced to ashes. Thinking about the past and the present, it arouses the indignation of tourists! Before long, the ship docks, the [unclear] vigorously stir, overturning rivers and seas, the mud from the seabed floats to the surface, and there are many garbage and filth [unclear] drifting with the waves, all of which seems to be [unclear] Macau!

Macau's Progress

After the ship docks, the Portuguese [unclear] stand on the pier, standing tall against the wind. Their clothes, hats, and shoes are quite pleasing to the eye. Some passengers in the main cabin, eager to return home, want to disembark as soon as they see the gangway lowered, but are pushed back by the police. It turns out that the method of disembarking passengers here is the same as in Hong Kong. Passengers in the Western-style rooms and Chinese restaurants have priority, followed by passengers in the rear cabin, and finally passengers in the [unclear] cabin. However, the 20-dollar guarantee rule has not yet been implemented at the gate!

In busy traffic areas, Macau, like other places, still has traffic posts and police on duty. The difference is that the police uniforms here are more aesthetically pleasing. On the road, the reporter saw a group of compatriots crossing the road. In order to avoid the military, they stood on the [unclear]. The traffic police officer, looking very [unclear], used a [unclear] Cantonese accent, gesticulating and shouting. This is a very vivid picture. Five years ago, the reporter traveled here and had not seen them working so conscientiously. But five years have passed, and there should be some progress!

Gamblers' Bravery

Macau during the day is still quiet. Two-wheeled trucks roll by, and some lively female students ride their bicycles, leisurely riding on the road. But as dusk fades and the electric lights begin to [unclear] sparks, the entire Macau boils. In the area around Fuk Long Street, prostitutes dress up and swagger about, or play the qin in brothels, lightly singing songs. Lights and music fill the streets, and customers walk back and forth. The mixed sounds of people, the shouting in gambling houses, and the [unclear] in hotels all mix together, creating a chaotic scene that doesn't stop until dawn. The enthusiasm [unclear] is extreme. The bravery of those gamblers placing bets and the recklessness of the patrons are somewhat similar to the situation when loyal men and generals on the front lines charge into battle, fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy [omitted due to sensitivity]. The difference is that the patrons are sacrificing themselves in the pursuit of wild pleasure, while the soldiers are fighting for the survival of the nation. The former is [unclear], is [unclear], while the latter is glorious, is great. This is where the excitement is the same but the essence is different.

Placing Bets and Buying Public Bonds

Macau is smaller than Hong Kong, and Macau does not have as many wealthy merchants as Hong Kong, but the amount of money spent there every day is not small. Although there are no accurate statistics on the spending on prostitution, gambling, and drinking, the gambling hall of a certain large restaurant earned over 200,000 [unclear] on its best days. The rest of the spending can also be imagined. These huge gifts that roll into the pockets of gambling merchants are naturally sent batch by batch from the hands of wealthy merchants and retired bureaucrats. If they could take the spirit and courage of placing bets and going to prostitutes and gamble to buy national salvation bonds, the bond sales in Hong Kong and Macau [unclear] would have been fully subscribed long ago, even exceeding the results of any other place. Why not do this? Is it because they lack a sense of nation and country, or is it in response to the old saying "goods gained dishonestly are also lost dishonestly"!

Work of National Salvation

How is the work of national salvation developing in Macau? This is something that we can all imagine. Moreover, because the Portuguese authorities pay close attention to the progress of this work, sometimes some work cannot be done. The reporter [unclear] searched for the only national salvation organization in Macau, the Women's慰勞分 [unclear], to inquire about their work, but after running around for half a day and asking many people, [unclear] found it. You know where this [unclear] is located? Originally [unclear] in an old [unclear] mansion, with a small sign hanging on the corner of the house, reading Macau Women's慰勞分会 [unclear]. If you don't have [unclear] a certain amount of effort, you will definitely not see it. Others are of course even harder to find. Talking about contact is even more obstructive, so all the work is far worse than in Hong Kong!

Strange Slogans

Along with the lack of much development in the work of national salvation, there are many strange situations there. Walking on the street, I often [unclear] certain nationals walking proudly with their heads held high, their clothes and faces [unclear] similar to our compatriots. It's just that their language and actions are a little different. The rest of the time [unclear], most of the [unclear] are passing by the so-called "楼船 of ×××."

Just as Wang Jingwei published [unclear], many slogans of "×× friendship" and "×× cooperation" were posted in the streets and alleys. Passersby all stopped to watch. Later, a zealous person tore them down, and this [unclear] event [unclear] ended. In addition, there are many, many strange people and strange things that I want to tell my friends but cannot tell, which is of course a regrettable thing!

Finally, although the reporter [unclear] only stayed in Macau for a short time, I have completely witnessed and heard about everything. This is naturally infinitely happy, and at the same time I feel [unclear] limited sadness!

### The Japanese "Literary Scene" in 1938

— Chi Huai

It is really unworthy to use the word "Literary Scene" to describe the dynamics of the Japanese literary world in 1938. Today's Japan only has the "arena" of fascist soldiers. Japanese writers, who have lost their free will, the so-called "literary scene," is at best just a scene played out in the "arena." Japanese critics have already admitted that they have been defeated in literature. But in terms of literary form, the continued production of literary form works is still a fact, such as Hino Ashihei's "Wheat and Soldiers," which is recognized as this year's greatest harvest in Japan. Moreover, they are still boasting that China's literature of resistance has not achieved such "great" results. But the author of "Wheat and Soldiers" is an ordinary soldier. If something made of Chinese blood and flesh is enough to be called "great," then all fascist celebratory literature can be regarded as "great" works. From the perspective of us Chinese, what value can we see in the book "Wheat and Soldiers"? It is that in its bones, it still exposes the [unclear] of the Japanese army to some extent, while reflecting the great spirit shown by the Chinese army and people in the War of Resistance. However, the author's motive is definitely not like this, it's just that his pen is not strong enough to completely cover up all the reality.

But in terms of the merits of the general established Japanese writers, their poverty is a particularly dark period in the history of the Japanese literary scene. First, in terms of the amount published in the seven major magazines, the writer who published the most works was Wada Den (seven articles), followed by Abe Tomoji and Tokunaga Sunao (six articles each), and then Takami Jun and Mamiya Shigeho (five articles each). The above people are the writers who published the most works on this year's Japanese "literary scene."

Among these writers, Tokunaga Sunao's name is quite familiar in China. He "turned" early on, or in other words, he fell early on. So, although he wrote six articles, two of them were about his own memories, such as "Technician Abe Chusuke" and "The First Memory." When a writer begins to write about his own memories, and the purpose is not to suggest the significance of the shift of the times, it means that the writer's literary talent has receded. Memory is his last shadow, and soon even this shadow will disappear. It is said that Tokunaga Sunao has "voluntarily" discontinued several of his past works due to the current situation.

Next is Abe Tomoji. I am afraid that he is not as famous as Tokunaga Sunao among the Chinese. He also published six works this year. According to Kubokawa Tsurujiro's comments, he is not as good as Tokunaga Sunao. Most of them are popular literary works, such as the best-selling book "Beijing," which is an example of [unclear] literature.

Takami Jun's works have probably not been introduced in China. He is a popular writer who emerged one or two years ago, but this year his works have been severely attacked. For example, "The Stage" published in the July issue of "Japan Review" was unexpectedly criticized by Kawabata Yasunari as a bad work. According to Kubokawa Tsurujiro's comments, he also believes that the works he wrote this year are really not worth looking at.

Next, Niwa Fumio and Takeda Rintaro both published only three articles. Niwa's three articles are "The Beaten Lover" (January issue of "Japan Review"), which is about protecting [unclear]. The next is "Wife's Work" (March issue of "Remodeling") and "My Own Affair" (June issue of "Japan Review"). The latter two are said to have new styles. Takeda's three articles are "Ihara Saikaku" (July issue of "Literature"), "Glasses" (January issue of "Literary World"), "Morning Grass" (June issue of "Central Review"). We don't need to examine the content of these works carefully. Just by looking at the titles of these works, we can infer a general situation. In fact, the titles of each article are nothing more than the expression of personal emotions (within the allowed range). None of them reflect the reality of Japanese life. But the whole phenomenon of this literary movement most clearly reflects the actual situation of the literary scene in Japan today—poverty, emptiness, depravity, and darkness.

The above description, although it cannot cover the entire Japanese "literary scene," since some of the more well-known writers are like this, we can get a glimpse of the whole situation. The so-called "undercurrent of the literary scene" is actually just a sewer gasping for breath under the heavy pressure of military fascism.

### In Memory of Duanren

— Du Ai

When we heard the news of your death, our friends stared blankly in shock. Irresistible sadness overwhelmed your living friends.

In silent mourning, I thought of everything you did in Hong Kong. I will never forget your small body, your reticent and calm face. You seemed to be a simple and silent person, lacking enthusiasm on the surface. However, what was hidden in your heart, in every cell, was sincere friendship and a high degree of work ethic. As long as you thought it should be done, you would do it thoroughly. Your responsibility for "work" is worthy of young people to learn. But your greatest advantage is the initiative and awareness shown in your work. Looking at your private life, it is also a model for young people: simple, unpretentious, without any bad habits. You were living, like countless young people, the most simple and energetic life of a Chinese person in the 1940s. Nothing could contaminate you, nothing could hinder you. You were constantly using calm steps to eliminate all inherited concepts and corrupt temptations, and gradually overcome them. You were never impatient in any situation, even when encountering a very troublesome matter. But you were brave to take responsibility. You were not as rash and arrogant as some people, nor were you like some people who only talk and do nothing. But you also had shortcomings, that is, when you had to speak, you said so little. Some people might see your reticent temper as arrogance. In fact, you were not at all. You had a strong sense of justice. You did not tolerate all corruption and ugliness, but you forgave the ignorant and unfortunate people, giving them deep compassion and ardent love.

On the day you set off for the West River with the service corps, we immediately felt as if something was missing. However, your departure was not for anything else, but for the liberation of the motherland. This made us not feel regretful. In early last month, we learned from your letters that your work had made great progress. You were responsible for the education of several thousand members of the self-defense corps [unclear] repeatedly wrote letters asking the Art Association to mobilize members to go back to assist in the work. However, our mobilization plan had not yet been realized, and the news of your death came. Alas! You died in an enemy air raid.

Although you died like this, you died with glory. Now you are resting in peace, but the dead are also stepping more vigorously on your unfinished road. The motherland is today making unprecedented progress, adhering to the War of Resistance, and our cause of liberation is entering a new stage. Although Wang Jingwei [unclear] changed at this time, the anti-Japanese front has become stronger. Rest in peace! Your glory is as eternal as the glory of the nation.

### The Death of Zhang Shu

— Shulun

When Nie Er died, Tao Xingzhi mourned in an article:

"Mr. Nie Er's death is the greatest loss to Chinese popular music, almost equivalent to the loss of the Northeast in the country of music. The Northeast can be recovered, but Nie Er cannot be resurrected!"

We will always remember the death of Mr. Nie Er.

Three years later, Zhang Shu, one of the popular song writers who inherited Nie Er's legacy, also died under the [omitted due to sensitivity] bomb. What we feel is a great loss, and a deep hatred for the [omitted due to sensitivity] destruction of culture is deepened in our hearts.

We acknowledge that Nie Er was the most powerful motivator and founder of Chinese new music. After Nie Er's death, a large group of new music workers supported his legacy. Among them—Xinghai, Lü Ji, Sun Shen, He Luting, Saike, Mai Xin, Sha Mei, Xue Chang, and Zhang Shu were constantly creating, producing, and honing their weapons of struggle, proclaiming, calling, educating, and arming the masses from all walks of life in China. They gave the people of China a common, living call!

In the process of developing the new music movement, everyone has a common feeling, that is, the songs created for the working masses are very poor in both quality and quantity, not strong enough, not useful enough, not popular enough, and unable to achieve colloquialization. Unable to convey the life and feelings of the working masses, this makes the new music movement permanently stay at one level, and has not yet reached widespread popularization.

The reason for this is partly because popular songs are not easy to produce, as Mr. Tao Xingzhi pointed out: "A genius who is divorced from the life of the masses will never be able to write popular songs." From this, we can see that popular songs are filtered and permeated from the life of the masses. Based on this, to produce truly popular music, there must first be countless composers who participate in and thoroughly understand the lives of the working masses.

Secondly, although the Chinese new music movement has progressed with the progress of the War of Resistance, its development is still far from mature. This is the phenomenon of overall progress, but also the fact that the composers as a whole will succeed in the fire and blood of the War of Resistance.

However, I feel great sorrow and sympathy for the death of Mr. Zhang Shu, this diligent researcher of vocal music and progressive composer. Over the years, Mr. Zhang Shu has been engaged in unremitting labor for popular songs, producing songs such as Vehicle Song, Dike Building Song, Disaster Relief Song, Life Education Song, Protect North China, and Under the Green Star Flag.

These songs are a force of torrent, a living cry, and a common resonance in the hearts of the Chinese people.

However, Zhang [unclear] died. He did not die on the front line, but died under the [omitted due to sensitivity] bombs, because half of the Chinese people are the target of the [omitted due to sensitivity] murder.

Zhang Shu died, but he did not die with any regrets. He used the music he created to attack the enemy, the [unclear] henchmen of fascism.

Countless [unclear] young musicians from the next generation will rise up.

### Literary Criticism in 1938

— Lin Huanping

Four

Regarding fundamental issues of literary theory, aside from single publications, Mr. Li Nan-zhuo expressed the most opinions this year. He successively published papers such as "On the Popularization of Literature and Art," "Broad Realism," "Further Broad Realism," "On 'Almost' and 'Far From'," and "On the Typical" in "Literary Front." Except for the first article, which is related to the issue of utilizing old forms, the rest are basic issues in literary theory.

As we have briefly analyzed above, the main reason why the creations of writers have not been very satisfactory this year is that writers do not have a deep grasp of the creative methods of realism. Therefore, their grasp of the essence of reality, the subjective ability and personality of the writers, and the characters' personalities are all very superficial. The inevitable result of this is just as Mr. Mao Dun pointed out above. Although Mr. Li's several papers still have a bit of "scholarly air," and besides criticizing Mr. Cao Yu's "Wilderness," they only expound on these basic issues of literary theory in a "purely theoretical" way, Mr. Li's statements are also aimed at current malpractices. Therefore, we believe that his contribution is very significant.

Mr. Li's "Broad Realism" is aimed at narrow realism; "On 'Almost' and 'Far From'" discusses the objective reality and subjective ability. In recent years, the literary world has been filled with debates about "Almost-ism" and "Uniformity-ism." Some people with ulterior motives even use 'almost' and uniformity to attack new literature, and some are even more ridiculous, believing that science has developed to such a high stage that it has made people's methods of understanding tend to be unified, so everyone recognizes the same objective things. Therefore, works cannot help but be "almost" the same. But we do not think so. We agree with the scientification of cognitive methods, and thus the unification of the understanding of objective phenomena. However, "people are different as their faces," and works are different as the faces of their writers. This is not a joke, this is exactly what those ridiculous superficial "theorists" have overlooked or do not understand. May I ask, has there ever been a reader who felt that the works of Mr. Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and Mao Dun are almost the same? Whether in terms of content or method. Also, no matter how writers learn from Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Balzac, Dickens, or Gorky, Sholokhov, and are influenced by them, no writer learns them perfectly. This is not only a matter of the writer's learning ability, but also a matter of the writer's personality. Tolstoy once said in his unpublished pre-death diary that the most boring thing is to read works that are not infused with the writer's own thoughts and personality. This precisely reveals this problem. Let us ask again: why are the many works with the same theme of the Eight Hundred Warriors or the Great Victory of Taierzhuang not all the same? Why are Ba Jin's works full of enthusiasm, and Mr. Lao She's works full of humor? This is because the content of a work, although in the writer's understanding, may be the "almost" objective reality, but this recognition is not directly copied like a photograph. It is through the process of the writer's artistic generalization, infiltrating the writer's own thoughts, psychology, emotions, and personality components, which becomes the fact that each writer's works has its own characteristics. Therefore, Mr. Li concluded in his article "On 'Almost' and 'Far From'":

"In literary and artistic works, there are some places that should be 'almost', that is where the truth lies, those places should be 'people have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason'."

"But the performance of the writer's personality in the work, which is opposite to this aspect, should not be 'almost', but should be 'far from'. The 'difference' is as 'much' as the difference between the writer's personalities - (see 'Wen Zhen' Volume 1, Issue 6)"

In the article "On the Typical," the author believes that the sum of the three elements of "human nature," "typicality," and "individuality," plus the element of time and the dynamic characters, deserves to be called "typical." In this article, the author quoted many of Gorky's words on typical creation. These have been translated by many people in China, so I will not discuss them here.

Finally, we would like to express our condolences to Mr. Li with 120,000 points of enthusiasm, because he passed away on October 14th (?) of this year.

There were also great gains in Lu Xun studies this year.

Mr. Lu Xun was the creator of China's new female studies and the mentor of China's revolutionary literary movement. His entire legacy shines brightly, indicating the future development of China's new literature. Carrying forward his legacy and his great spirit of research is precisely giving our anti-Japanese war literature fresh nourishment.

In the second anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, in addition to the unprecedented grand event in China's publishing industry, the Complete Works of Lu Xun, which was completed with the joint efforts of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Hu Yuzhi, Mao Dun, Ba Jin and others, "Literary Front" Volume 2, Issue 1 also published a "Commemorative Special Issue." In addition, there is a single-volume comprehensive magazine called "Lu Xun the Thinker," the first article of which is "Lu Xun the Thinker," which is tens of thousands of words long and gives a systematic study and correct interpretation of Mr. Lu Xun's thoughts—its growth, development, and maturity. It would be more beneficial to read this article together with Mr. Wang Renshu's "Mr. Lu Xun's View of Art" in the "Special Issue" of "Wen." Especially valuable is the long article "Lu Xun and the Youth" written by Lu Xun's wife, Ms. Xu Guangping, which uses the most faithful brushstrokes to express Mr. Lu Xun's life in his later years, his enthusiastic love and guidance for young people, his fierce hatred and resistance to the filth and evil of society, etc., extremely profoundly. Before a completely satisfactory biography of Lu Xun comes out, this can be regarded as a biography of Lu Xun. In addition, "The Work of Collecting Lost Works of Lu Xun" in the "Special Issue" also illustrates another aspect of Mr. Lu Xun's career and can be used for reference. Other fragmentary articles, or those that I have not seen, are omitted. (The End)

### People of Shanghai Miss the King of Football, Invite Li to Go North for a Charity Match, But Li's Trip to Shanghai is Not Yet Determined

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Li Huitang, the "Oriental Standard Football Man," has been famous in the football world for a long time. Years ago, when he lived in Shanghai, he set an example for the development of football, and Li's contribution was the greatest. Therefore, Li became famous in Guangdong during the past eighteen years, but he actually succeeded in Shanghai. Now, people in Shanghai still remember him.

Shanghai has fallen into an isolated island, and there are many refugees who urgently need relief. Now, the Shanghai National Disaster Relief Association believes that there are still more than tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Shanghai, which requires a lot of expenses. In order to supplement funds, it plans to hold a charity football match. Because Li Huitang is a famous figure in the football world and has great appeal, it specially entrusted Zhou Shouchen to invite Mr. Li to Shanghai to participate in the match to help the good cause. It is reported that Zhou has forwarded this intention to Mr. Li, but whether Li will go to Shanghai or not is still undetermined.

### Organized by the Reporters Association, Football Charity Match and Carnival Postponed to the 14th of This Month at Caroline Hill

### Pui Ching Alumni Get Excited and Form a Red and Blue Volleyball Team

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Guangzhou Lingnan (Red and Gray) and Pui Ying (Green and White) volleyball teams came to Hong Kong and held several charity matches, the volleyball movement, which had been silent for a long time here, gradually showed signs of resurgence.

There are many Pui Ching alumni in Hong Kong who are good at this sport, such as Li Lianying and Tan Jingsu, who were famous players in their early years, but they have not played this tune for a long time, and they have become rusty.

Seeing that Red Gray and Green White have been established one after another, they were excited and summoned old comrades from the school who had fled here, intending to organize a (Red and Blue) team. The progress is quite smooth, and it is believed that they will soon meet the people of Hong Kong. (Tai Sui)

### Long-Term Exercise Method

— Zhengxue Wang

Do not stop breathing during exercise, and also make breathing commensurate with or harmonious with the action. Otherwise, the body will be greatly damaged, especially the heart and lungs.

Regarding the method of deep breathing, the most important are the following five points: (1) Breathe through the nose, not through the mouth; (2) expand the abdomen as much as possible when inhaling, and shrink the abdomen as much as possible when exhaling; (3) all muscles of the body must be relaxed when inhaling, do not use force, and the posture should be natural; (4) cross your arms in front of your chest when exhaling, and compress your chest forcefully to completely expel the air in your lungs; (5) do not breathe against the wind; (6) it is best to do deep breathing for five minutes each time.

In addition, there are two kinds of breathing exercises that are particularly beneficial to the respiratory system, which are briefly described below:

(1) Tighten your lips, leaving only a small hole, similar to the mouth position when blowing a flute, but different from blowing. Then blow air in until your lungs are full of air. When inhaling, you do not need to tighten your lips, like ordinary deep breathing, or you can use your nostrils, but you must cover them with your fingers, leaving only a small hole. Pay attention to using force when inhaling, and the breathing must be deep and long.

(2) Contrary to the previous exercise, slowly exhale the air from the nostrils or the small hole left by the lips. When inhaling, it is the same as ordinary deep breathing.

It is best to do these two breathing exercises before or between exercises, and they should be done alternately with ordinary breathing methods. It is better to do this exercise three times first, and then continue to repeat it for about three or four minutes. (To be continued)

### The Date of the Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Football Match May Change, The Second Match is a Performance Match between the Philippine Team and the Chinese League

[Report from Our Newspaper] The football movement in the Philippines has made great progress in recent years, and it has a tendency to surpass Hong Kong.

I still remember that when the British Lington Teachers came to the East last spring, they won all battles except for the last one against South China in Hong Kong. When they went to the Philippines to compete, they lost once. Therefore, it can be inferred that the technical level of the Philippine football movement has indeed increased compared to four or five years ago.

The Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Game will be realized soon. As for the date of the competition, the Management Group Committee of the General Assembly decided to hold it on the 18th of next month (Lunar New Year's Eve) at the meeting the previous evening.

Committee member Huang Jiajun said to me that the date of this game has not yet been determined and may be changed, because people are busy on New Year's Eve and do not watch the game much. It would be best to hold it on the Lunar New Year. We need to wait for the Philippine side to reply and see when the team arrives in Hong Kong, and then hold a meeting to finalize the date of this game.

The competition program has also been drafted. The first game is the Inter-City Game, and the second and third games are the performance matches. The program is as follows: (Dong Lang)

February 18 (Lunar New Year's Eve) Saturday

Inter-City Game: Philippine Team vs. Hong Kong Team, Navy Ball Yang, 3:15 pm

20th, Monday

Performance Match: Philippine Team vs. Chinese League, Navy Stadium, 3:15 pm

21st, Tuesday

Performance Match: Philippine Team vs. Hong Kong League, Navy Stadium, 3:15 pm

### The Standard of Hong Kong Football: Indeed, the Present is Not as Good as the Past (Part 1)

— A Former Football Fan

I recall that when I first returned to Hong Kong from the south, before I had even unpacked, I was immediately inundated with requests concerning sports. Having been away for many years, I had not been involved in football matters for a long time. Many new players were unfamiliar to me, so how could I possibly offer any technical critique? Thus, I did not dare to act rashly. However, every time I perused the sports pages of the newspapers, I learned that the enthusiasm had not diminished from the past. Compared to when I left for the north, it seemed even greater, which made me yearn for it. Therefore, I went to the stadium as an observer. Unexpectedly, what I saw made me feel that the current football players' skills were far inferior to those of the past. At the time, without any official duty to comment on football, I kept my private opinions to myself and did not tell anyone.

On one occasion, while watching a Chinese opera, I happened to sit next to my old friend, Mr. Kwok Yan-bo. (Mr. Kwok assisted the South China Athletic Association, dedicating his efforts to sports to the point of almost bankrupting himself. The flourishing state of Hong Kong Chinese football today is largely due to his tireless efforts. I will write about his contributions in detail later, simply expressing my admiration for now.) Sitting behind us were a famous football figure and a few sports enthusiasts. During a particularly frustrating moment in the match, Mr. Kwok suddenly turned to me and said, "In your opinion, how do our football players' skills today compare to those of the past? Is there a sign of decline?" I gave a knowing smile and nodded in agreement.

Unexpectedly, the person behind us heard this and angrily said, "Are you saying our current football players are declining? The facts show that our achievements are far better than in the past! Just look at the speed and sharpness of the players in the 'Junior Shield' matches. Would the predecessors have ever seen that?" He then cited award-winning performances as evidence. (At that time, South China Athletic Association was invincible, and the Chinese team was exceptionally brave.) The people sitting next to him largely agreed with his words. Mr. Kwok and I felt that we were singing a different tune and should not argue, so we simply exchanged knowing, bitter smiles and remained silent.

Since then, South China Athletic Association has enjoyed smooth sailing, winning the league championship. In the Special Silver Shield competition, the South China brothers swept all the teams and won the finals. Not only that, but of the six Hong Kong First Division football championships, the Chinese team won five. They also reached the final of the Lai Wah Cup, but lost due to not fielding their best players, finishing as runners-up. I was misled by the facts and almost thought that my eyesight was failing, leading me to doubt the accuracy of my observations.

Driven by the need to make a living, I reluctantly returned to being a football commentator. I had to observe the football scene more closely. I felt that the Chinese team's ability to win multiple championships was not due to improved skills, but rather the decline in the talent of the Western teams. When I saw the Corinthian and South China Sea football teams competing, both of whom almost swept Hong Kong, I became more certain that my views were correct. However, the people of Hong Kong said that the Corinthian was a strong team from their country and that the South China Sea team had also made significant progress, no longer being the "Amoy of Wu." I had never witnessed the true level of British football skill, and I only knew that the Corinthian was a famous British team by hearsay. I also had not seen the South China Sea team's past achievements. Therefore, I could not provide concrete evidence that Hong Kong's football skills had declined, rather than the visiting teams being particularly strong. As a result, I simply echoed what others said. Indeed, the visiting teams were strong. As a result, even the strongest Chinese team could only manage one win and one draw against the Corinthian, and only one draw and one narrow victory against the South China Sea team.

However, after watching Hong Kong football for a long time, I still felt that it was not as good as when the national team returned from their second tour of Australia. Nor could it match the football skills of the South China team when a part of the players split to form the Chinese Athletic Association. But where was the evidence? Although I wanted to say something to awaken the football players, I still hesitated. I was left with something stuck in my throat, which was very painful. Therefore, I tried hard to find facts to support my argument in order to publish my humble opinion one day.

On the evening of the South China Athletic Association's banquet for the Corinthian team, I was fortunate enough to be at the end of the table and had a chat with a certain naval officer. I asked him what his critique of the Corinthian's skills was. He said that their skills were good, but not up to the level of their country's strength. He added that their country's naval team was often crushed. I felt that his words had some substance because they were both naval teams. Why was the British team so strong? He said that the British army and navy had football competitions every year, so the soldiers who were best at football were kept in the country for service and not easily transferred abroad. That was why they were so strong. The army and navy teams that came to Hong Kong now were not only far weaker than those stationed in Britain, but even weaker than the players from a mere company or battalion in Hong Kong in the past. The army and navy had no motivation to retain football talent in the country. Hearing this, I suddenly understood and became more certain that this was evidence of the declining standard of Hong Kong football. However, this was just hearsay, and it might not be enough to calm the current football players' arrogance. If I could not calm their arrogance and encourage them to improve, then my words would only hurt their feelings and would be of no help. So I remained silent.

Now that Lee Wai-tong, Ko Siu-nu, Beltroa (some translate it as Bi Lu Du based on the English pronunciation, but translating it from Portuguese would be closer to Bias), Remedios (some translate it as Lei Mi Di based on the Shanghai pronunciation; this was a famous halfback in Hong Kong in his prime, who was selected to represent the Interport team. Back then, when he was famous in the Western football teams, I used to translate his name using the Cantonese pronunciation; I wonder if anyone still remembers it.) and others have returned to the field, I believe I have solid evidence of the declining standard of Hong Kong football and should publish my article.

Lee Wai-tong and Ko Siu-nu are indeed considered by us to be the most outstanding football forwards in Hong Kong during a certain period. However, even during their prime, they were not always guaranteed to score in every game. Now, although these two gentlemen cannot be said to be old, they have passed their golden age of football. If you observe their performance now, their running and dribbling are inferior to their prime. Even though they often failed to score in every game in the past, they are now able to seize opportunities and score frequently, often scoring multiple times in a single game. Taking this as an example, isn't it clear that the current defenders are less skilled than their predecessors?

Beltroa (Bi Lu Du) was indeed a famous forward, but he was not as good as Lin Yuk-ying and Liang Yuk-tong of the Chinese team, Huang Mei-shun of the South China team, or Fox and Makgilovi of the Kowloon team. He was not outstanding even in his prime. Now, after retiring for a long time and getting older, he can still surpass his peers as soon as he comes out. How can he be so skilled? Isn't it simply that the current football players are far worse than in the past? Comparing the two makes it seem like an old man who has returned to the field is extraordinary.

As for Remedios (Lei Mi Di), he was just a halfback during his prime. I remember once when the Western Athletic Club was short of players due to injuries, they used him as an inside back and were defeated. At that time, Remedios was not as good as even an average Western Athletic Club inside back when playing as an inside back, let alone compared to Shashi, Chen Wai, Wu Kam-chuen, and Lai Yuk-tat. However, now, at an older age, he is playing as a right inside back and has the potential to be outstanding. How could he have suddenly learned the skills of an inside back? Isn't it simply that there are few good halfbacks now, so he seems exceptional in comparison?

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment... Three Sisters

Sally, Irene And

Mary

This is a musical featuring singers, musicians, old-time stars, and famous screen actors all in one. The story is scattered, but as a musical, it doesn't necessarily need a perfect story. It succeeds as an entertaining "musical film" simply by relying on gorgeous staging and the humorously interspersed songs and dances.

Alice Faye and Tony Martin have excellent singing and acting skills. Jimmy Durante, with his big nose, is as humorous as ever and is also an outstanding character in the film.

Queen... The Rat

The Rat

This film offers a bold and profound depiction of life in the lower echelons of Parisian society, interwoven with a twisted love triangle. A thief nicknamed "The Rat" is naturally charming and carefree, committing countless thefts, and the police are helpless against him. Later, because he loves both his friend's adopted daughter and is infatuated with another wealthy woman, he accidentally commits murder and is brought to court. The story is very convoluted, but the handling is somewhat vague and lacks plausibility. The lead actors, Ivor Novello and Isabel Jeans, also have mediocre acting skills.

Peace... Panhandle

Panhandle

A film depicting the American West. The plot lacks development, and the first half is somewhat obscure. The second half has some thrilling action scenes and feels more lively and tense. The story tells of the development of a tungsten mine, disputes over land rights, the schemes and sabotage of villains, and the mine owner's efforts to struggle and ultimately achieve success.

George O'Brien gives a satisfying performance in this film.

East... Beloved Enemy

Beloved Enemy

A film about the Irish Revolution. Merle Oberon plays the daughter of a British Governor-General in Ireland, who sympathizes with the Irish Revolution and falls in love with their leader (Brian Aherne).

The director handles the film quite successfully. Several scenes of searching for the Party are also very tense and capture the climax of the drama. The male and female leads are well-matched.

Great China... Lancer Spy

Lancer Spy

The story depicts a British officer who, because of his resemblance to a German officer, is used to impersonate him after the German officer is captured by the British. He goes back to spy on the enemy. However, the German officer has a lover who works as a counter-spy for Germany. Unexpectedly, they genuinely fall in love, reveal their true feelings, and let the fake German officer go back.

Similar spy stories have been told many times in the past, so this film is not particularly innovative. The overall handling is very loose, especially the first half, which is dull. The two leads, George Sanders and Dolores del Río, also give unremarkable performances.

Bright Star... Wells Fargo

Central... The Prisoner of Zenda

The Prisoner of Zenda

A story of a hero and a beauty. The male lead, Ronald Colman, plays two roles, delivering a brilliant performance. The female lead, Madeleine Carroll, and supporting actors such as Raymond Massey, all give excellent performances.

### US President's Speech: Defending International Faith, Actively Conducting Democratic Work, Preparing for Defense, and Preventing Aggression

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt, in his State of the Union address to Congress today, recalled his previous declarations to the Congress regarding the situation of foreign disturbances and the necessity of the United States preparing to deal with the situation. His speech stated: "As this seventy-sixth Congress opens, we must once again issue a warning. The war threat that now hangs over the entire world, though it has been averted, peace is clearly still not guaranteed. Foreign trends have directly threatened three essential institutions of the United States. The first is religion, the second is democracy, and the third is international faith. In terms of modern culture, these three are interrelated. If religious freedom is attacked, then democracy also suffers. If a democratic government is overthrown, then we cannot see the spirit of freedom of belief. If religion and democracy are diminished, then international faith will retreat to allow the brutal ambition and cruel force. If mankind does not pay attention to religious freedom of belief, democracy and international faith, there is no hope of obtaining peace. The United States is determined to adhere to its previous beliefs and defend these three good institutions. Mankind is encountering a period in which it must not only prepare to defend its family, but also to defend the human faith that establishes churches, governments and cultures. Defending religion, democracy, and international faith is the same thing. If we want to save one of these three, we must decide to save the other two as well. We deeply know what the situation will be if force invades our country. We have resolved to protect the democratic governments and peace-loving people of this hemisphere. But this does not mean that the American republics will not cooperate with countries on other continents, nor does it mean that the United States opposes other countries in the world. The United States is willing to see with other countries the elimination of international aggression, the cessation of the arms race, and the restoration of commerce. Countries with democratic governments can never watch their fellow countries with the same government being invaded without resistance. We have learned an ancient lesson that only defense that is always prepared can reduce the threat of foreign force. In a few days, I will submit to Congress the appropriate steps for defense. If a certain type of government can form a united front to attack democratic governments, it will encounter the resistance of united democratic governments. This kind of democratic government can exist in the United States, and the United States must also have this kind of democratic government. The expansion of the scale of military equipment in the United States in the past six years is unprecedented in previous history. But this kind of work does not use the orders of dictatorial power, does not force labor, does not confiscate capital, does not affect freedom of speech and publication, and all natural human rights. We are now actively conducting democratic work, so we must obtain peace and self-defense. We can use labor and funds to compete with dictatorship. If we want to increase production and consumption, the government should not consider reducing investment. The industrial, commercial, and financial circles of the United States require Congress to take all necessary steps to increase the national income to 8 million million yuan per year. Solving this problem also requires maintaining our freedom at the same time." When Roosevelt walked into Congress, the people in the entire venue responded with warm cheers and applause. Especially when the President's speech reached a highlight, it was met with cheers from the audience, especially when he mentioned the method of the United States preparing to resist foreign threats. The German Chargé d'Affaires to the United States, Thomson, listened quietly to the US President's speech in the auditorium. Other audience members included the French Ambassador, the Spanish Ambassador, and the Portuguese Minister. The President's mother and wife were also in the crowded auditorium. [Reuters, Washington, 4th] Senator Pittman criticized Roosevelt's speech, saying that he believed that the government already knew that it was necessary to use moral, commercial, and financial sanctions to deal with those who violated treaties.

British and French Comments

[Associated Press, London, 4th] US President Roosevelt's expression that the United States is determined to adopt a firm position to resist aggressor countries is attracting considerable attention from the British people, as Britain is also preparing to deal with new crises in 1939. Some people believe that in addition to Roosevelt's warning, other similar warnings have been obtained through diplomatic channels. The result has triggered Britain's efforts to rearm. The summary of the speech has been transmitted to Britain. After several cabinet members and other government officials learned about it, one of them expressed an opinion: If we have experience in publishing, this opinion is exactly what we have also published. British wireless stations are all receiving Roosevelt's broadcast. Roosevelt's voice is extremely loud and clear. Those listening to the radio can even hear the sound of Roosevelt turning the pages of the speech. At the same time, crowds on the streets are rushing to read the speech with eight-character headlines published in the evening newspapers. All parties in the government feel that Roosevelt's three points are noteworthy. These three points may produce concrete results for international politics. First, the Neutrality Act should be revised so that it is no longer beneficial to aggressors. Second, the words stated that democratic countries can obstruct without war. Third, this is a statement that the United States is willing to consult with other countries on sanctions against aggression, resume talks with other countries on limiting armaments, and revitalize commerce.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] French newspapers criticized the speech of US President Roosevelt, believing that the speech will affect Chamberlain's attitude towards Italy. The famous political commentator Madame Tabouis said in the 'Labor Daily,' 'The American President's declaration will definitely have an impact on the policies of dictators.' The 'Rothschild Report' stated that President Roosevelt's speech will have an immediate echo.

[Reuters, New York, 5th] Wall Street unanimously stated that President Roosevelt's speech was moderate in tone regarding the American treasure industry. The main purpose of the speech was to lay the groundwork for a large-scale expansion. In the past, governments often proposed plans in advance for this type of major political power, but this time it was uniquely lacking. Observers speculated that the government's move was to induce critics of the "New Deal" to come forward and each propose their own separate plans. At that time, the government would make the plan public again. Mr. also blamed the unemployment case on the country. He implied to the country that if the country's various expenditures were reduced, causing the people to suffer, then the country would have to be judged by the voters, because the voters still admire the self-governing agenda. Washington officials are all very concerned about this, saying that Mr. Luo's skills are high.

### Britain Intensifies Shipbuilding: 150 Vessels Under Construction, US Warships Depart to Participate in Exercises

[United News Agency, London, 5th] The News Agency reported that the British Navy's various fleets will add more than 100 new vessels according to this year's plan, including 10,000-ton cruisers, and even larger warships. Those currently under construction must be completed by 1940. In addition to the 35,000-ton warships that have already begun construction, the five aircraft carriers under construction will have two completed this year. Of the 22 cruisers planned, three 10,000-ton vessels will be ready for service this year. Of the 23 destroyers, 20 will be completed. Of the 25 submarines, 13 will be built. This year, there will also be three auxiliary ships, four torpedo boats, three reconnaissance ships, one submarine mother ship, two river gunboats, and 30 light vessels ready. According to the 1939-40 naval shipbuilding schedule, seven new cruisers should be ready for service this year. Of the five 35,000-ton warships currently under construction, two should be completed next year, and the remaining three must be completed in 1941. There are also two large warships whose plans have been reviewed, but construction has not yet begun. It is said that each will reach 40,000 tons. The report also said that, according to current estimates, there are approximately 150 British warships under construction.

[Central News Agency, Los Angeles, 5th] The US fleet here sailed out yesterday morning in the dim light. There were only a few green lights in the port, sometimes bright and sometimes dim. Everything showed a wartime secret operation. The warships were lined up in front, and aircraft flew in formation overhead. This exercise is scheduled to be held on February 1. The "White Fleet" of attackers is commanded by Carl Vinson, and the "Black Fleet" of defenders is commanded by Andrew. All US warships will participate. This day and night offensive and defensive battle, submarines, and various aircraft will also participate. The soldiers participating in the exercise will reach 50,000, and the officers will reach 3,000. The exercise is expected to be completed in early June.

### Moscow Daily Attacks the Czech Government, Soviet Ambassador Sends Letters to Newspapers, Czech Government Will Lodge a Protest

[Reuters, Prague, 5th] Soviet Ambassador to the Czech Republic, Alexander Alexandrovsky, sent a letter to the editors of Czech newspapers, enclosing a copy of the Moscow Daily, which contained harsh attacks on the government. With the letter, Mr. A also attached a business card. This is the first time in diplomatic circles that something like this has occurred. It is understood that the Czech government will lodge a protest.

### Norman Arrives in Germany

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th] The Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, arrived here at 8:28 this morning. The Governor of the German National Bank, Hjalmar Schacht, along with his daughter and son-in-law, welcomed him at the station.

### Roosevelt's Message to Congress: Firmly Requesting Amendment of the Neutrality Act, Aggressive Actions Cannot Be Ignored, Vigorously Criticizing the Dictatorial System

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] The Senate and the House of Representatives held a joint meeting in the House of Representatives this afternoon. President Roosevelt arrived at the venue at 1:00 PM (local time) and immediately personally announced the message, stating that the Neutrality Act, in its current form, is sufficient to facilitate aggressive countries and is not conducive to countries that are being invaded. It must be amended. Aggressive actions, no matter where they occur, should not be ignored by the United States without lodging a protest. At this time, the three things that are indispensable to the American people, namely religious democracy and international sincerity, are being threatened and must be defended. We should also strengthen our military and prevent various aggressions before war breaks out. He then vigorously criticized the dictatorial system. Finally, when talking about domestic affairs, he said that the federal government's expenditure on various projects should continue to be promoted until the total annual income of the country returns to its original amount of 8 million million US dollars.

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] When US President Roosevelt read a message to his country's Congress today, advocating for an amendment to the current Neutrality Act, diplomatic and political figures here were deeply impressed. They believed that President Roosevelt's actions were to further guide American public opinion to understand that countries with the same ideals must establish a common defense line. However, it is not yet known whether the Neutrality Act amendment will be proposed immediately. In addition, President Roosevelt also denounced the dictatorial countries in his message, and his wording was almost equal to the speech given by US Secretary of the Interior Ickes on the 18th of last month.

### Soviet Red Army: 21st Anniversary Day, All Members Take an Oath

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 4th] According to the Soviet official news agency, February 23rd is the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Red Army. All members of the Red Army are scheduled to take an oath on this day. The full text of the oath will be published in various newspapers. In the past, the Soviet Red Army took oaths in a collective manner, making verbal oaths. However, this new oath will be read by every Red Army soldier and signed on the oath. The content of the new oath is roughly as follows: Every Soviet soldier vows to be an honest and law-abiding combatant. The Red Army is willing to abide by the orders of the workers' and peasants' government and defend the motherland. There is a sentence in the oath that says, "I, standing as a combatant of the workers' and peasants' army, vow to use courage, ingenuity, seriousness, and glorious actions, regardless of my own life, to defend the motherland and to complete the victory over our enemies."

### US-Italian Relations May Worsen

[Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] After US President Roosevelt read the message to his country's Congress yesterday, Italian political figures were deeply impressed. They all said that the policies promoted by the United States may become increasingly unfavorable to dictatorial countries in the future, which is a cause for concern. Relations between the United States and Italy were originally not very good, and may become increasingly worse in the future.

### England and the United States Urge the Government to Act in Concert, Cabinet Members Discuss Strong Measures to Deal with Japan's Discriminatory Trade

[Reuters, London, 5th] 'Financial News' published a lengthy unsigned article today, stating, "The increasingly fascist nature of the Japanese government is by no means a good omen for British trade interests in China." After detailing the significant losses suffered by British trade in China due to the Sino-Japanese war, the article stated, "These reasons and the dissatisfaction of the Japanese military authorities make it clear to us that Japan will not be satisfied unless it completely controls China's trade and resources, eliminates the interests of other countries, and permanently abolishes the 'Open Door' policy. If Japan succeeds, it will establish a powerful government in the style of 'Manchukuo' (the current puppet provisional government in Peiping is powerless because it cannot gain the people's trust). We can resolutely state that British interests will prevent this outcome at any cost. If Britain waits for Japan to achieve its aims, a British-Japanese conflict will be inevitable. Providing economic aid to China through credit loans is very effective, and it costs far less than directly engaging in war with Japanese imperialism." The author also suggested that the government take steps to prevent British automotive products and essential materials from being transported to Japan, and to prohibit Japanese goods from being imported into England.

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The Yorkshire Post (known as the mouthpiece of former Foreign Secretary Eden) recently reported that cabinet members will discuss countermeasures against Japan's policies towards China before the resumption of Parliament on January 31st. At that time, a more forceful attitude may be adopted to deal with Japan's discrimination against British trade. All actions taken by England should be consistent with the attitude of the United States.

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Regarding the matter of upholding the Nine-Power Treaty concerning China, the second note presented by the US government to Japan was recently published in an editorial by the Yorkshire Post. The editorial stated that the note presented by the US government to Japan on October 6th of last year firmly refuted Japan's claim that after establishing a so-called new order in the Far East through military action, it could unilaterally revise existing treaties and other conditions. Other governments should regard this as an invitation to the British government to follow the US and demand that Japan accept the US proposal to convene an international conference and the suggestions that will be put forward. The British government has no reason to refuse to publicly declare its willingness to act in concert with the US. Furthermore, the editorial recalled that in January 1932, former US Secretary of State Stimson presented a note to the British government, advocating that the US and the UK adopt a coordinated policy to deal with the September 18th Incident. Because the British government failed to do so, it was criticized by public opinion in both countries and others. Now, how can we not take this as a warning from the past?

### Ambassador Guo's Speech: Our Determination to Resist Until the End

[Reuters, London, 4th] The Chinese Ambassador to England, Quo Tai-chi, stated in a speech this evening that the Chinese people are determined to resist until the end, their strength has greatly increased, and they are sure to persevere until a just and lasting peace is achieved. He stated that the entire nation firmly supports Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's determination to resist, and unless Japan fundamentally changes its policy towards China, China has no other path to follow but to continue resisting.

### British Prime Minister Returns to London Early; Italian-Spanish Issue; Rebel Offensive Closely Related to Italy; Reorganize External Affairs, Merge Handling

[Haitong News Agency, London, 5th] Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax were originally scheduled to return to London at the end of this week, but they suddenly returned to the capital yesterday. Although officials and the Prime Minister's spokesmen strenuously denied that their early return was due to a cabinet meeting being held this week, observers believe that the two men's journey must be of great importance. London is paying close attention to the recent fierce offensive by Spanish rebels, so the British government's attitude towards the Spanish and Mediterranean issues has become firmer in recent days, hence Chamberlain and Halifax returned to London early.

[Haihun News Agency, London, 5th] According to the diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Herald", the British Foreign Office is currently undergoing reorganization. The Spanish issue, previously handled by the "Western" division, has now been transferred to the "Southern" division, which handles Italian affairs. The British government, recognizing the close relationship between the Spanish and Italian issues, felt the need to consider reorganizing external affairs. It is also rumored that the British representative in Burgos, Rotton Braid, is currently under surveillance by rebel police, but this has not been confirmed.

[Reuters, Barcelona, 4th] Tarragona was bombed twice yesterday, resulting in at least forty deaths and thirty injuries. Twelve rebel planes destroyed two passenger cars full of refugees. When rescue teams were burying the bodies of the buried refugees, twenty-five rebel planes came to bomb, dropping many bombs.

Brief Commentary

### Formation of the New Japanese Cabinet

The Japanese cabinet was formally formed yesterday (the 5th). Today's questions are: Why did the Konoe Cabinet finally collapse? What is the significance of the formation of this new Hiranuma Cabinet? Where will Japan go from here? What impact will it have on China and the world?

The Konoe Cabinet was originally a cabinet of military cliques and financial groups, whose mission was to launch and support a large-scale invasion of China, laying the foundation for the distant hegemony of fascist aggressors. However, this cabinet met with resistance in the face of China's persistent war of resistance. Its "quick victory" strategy could not be realized, the domestic financial crisis was intensifying, and international isolation was deepening, making it impossible for the Konoe Cabinet to complete its mission. It勉强supported撐 until today because, on the one hand, China became more and more brave in the war and refused to compromise, and the policy of 注精的投降capitulation was completely破breaked; on the other hand, the attitude of the Central America反日Anti-Japanese援華Aid China became more and more active, and Japan felt more and more立isolated in the international形琳situation. In addition, the intensification of Japan's own difficulties, such as the difficulty in passing the Total Mobilization Act and the庞人huge budget案, exposed the inability of the Konoe Cabinet to accomplish its mission.

The emergence of the new Hiranuma Cabinet is an attempt to use a more robust政權regime to alleviate its internal difficulties and to save Japan's fate of falling into末路the end of the road in the international arena with a "new situation"招牌signboard. A perusal of the new Hiranuma cabinet阵容lineup reveals two characteristics that support the above arguments: First, from Prime Minister Hiranuma downwards, all cabinet members are closer to fascist軍military　 or衹為only for軍military　　策figures, which is 使so that軍事military財政finance外交diplomacy更加更團called稱, that is, to使so that這三者these three are更緊密more closely控制controlled in法西斯fascist軍military　　的手中hands of,以便進so that to有邃無前途的war war. Second, the下合union of 内相末次interior minister Sue, the民政党總裁civil administration party president町与田 and the 政友会分子seiyuukai elements前日拉阁, and the　連connection of 外相有田,the　正justification of 藏次石原, fully表露exposes their intention to緩和appease internal不安unrest and國際孤立international isolation.

However, Japan's rulers　“更引”will still be in vain, because the main task of the Hiranuma坐阁cabinet is still to complete the “conquest of China” and “establish the East Asian order”. In order to complete this task, they must continue to strengthen their勾結collusion with Germany and Italy, which will inevitably使使其with Central America衝突conflict will be even more serious. Internally, they cannot　violence through庞a huge,budget案 and實施the implementation of總動員total mobilization法all, so will again加深deepen its財政financial crisis and激化激化 the人民人民anti-war運動movement, let alone China's抵抗resistance力　power is日日development and國勢the country's situation益見對日不利becomes more unfavorable to Japan! However, this renewal by the Japanese rulers is顯為显然a狂妄presumptuous威脅threat to world和平peace and民主democracy. It will使make the Japanese people受undergo更大的更大的 hardships, and it will使make China and all countries of peace and democracy益堅益堅 their反侵略反侵略决心determination.

### × Brief Biographies of New Cabinet Members

The current Japanese cabinet has two major features. First, there are many concurrent appointments, indicating the haste of its formation. Second, many cabinet members are second-rate or lower figures, and it must be called a "weak cabinet." Here are brief biographies of Hiranuma and others:

Prime Minister Hiranuma

From Okayama Prefecture, currently 73 years old, a夫. After graduating from the English and French Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1889, he immediately joined the Ministry of Justice. In 1911, he became the Vice Minister of Justice, and subsequently served as Prosecutor General and President of the Supreme Court. In 1923, he served as the Minister of Justice in the second Yumoto Cabinet. In 1924, he became a Privy Councilor. In 1925, he became the Vice Chairman of the Privy Council and concurrently served as a member of the Imperial Family System Review Committee, and was awarded the title of Baron. In 1936, he was promoted to Chairman of the Privy Council until today. Hiranuma was originally the leader of the famous Japanese fascist group Kokuhonsha, as is well known. Kokuhonsha originated from the Tokyo Imperial University anti-foreign group, the Kyokoku Doshikai. This association was established in 1920, and Hiranuma was immediately appointed as an advisor the following year. In 1924, after Hiranuma resigned as Minister of Justice, he organized this so-called "spiritual education group" called Kokuhonsha. Hiranuma once自declared自己 that he did not believe in fascism, but Kokuhonsha was a important fascist group in Japan, which is an iron fact. At that time, those related to Kokuhonsha included important figures from the military, bureaucracy, and financial circles, such as Togo Heihachiro, Saito Makoto, Ugaki Kazushige, Kato Kanju, Osumi Mineo, Araki Sadao, Masaki Jinzaburo, Koiso Kuniaki, Hata Shunroku, Matsui Iwane, Mizuta Tessei, Fujiwara Ginjuro, Tanabe Harumichi, Ikeda Seihin, and Yuki Toyotaro all supported it, so Hiranuma's potential勢力power was 當large, and次there have been calls for cabinet reshuffles, but precisely because the relationships were too complicated, he often offended many parties, so Hiranuma could not take office several times. After the February 26th Incident, when the Japanese political situation changed drastically, Hiranuma, after obtaining the position of member of the Privy Council, immediately resigned from the position of President of Kokuhonsha, and immediately announced the dissolution of Kokuhonsha. Due to his position, Hiranuma's fascist activities have been slightly沉前silenced in recent times.

This time, Hiranuma was able to take the stage amidst the contradictions and oppositions of various factions. It can be said that he enjoys the addiction of being Prime Minister, but the future is difficult to be optimistic, and his life will be short. The old and cunning Hiranuma has connections in all aspects, but all factions do not have—good feelings towards him. Currently, they are using him as a temporary過波transition, because the military fascist considers Hiranuma difficult to be a old-fashioned fascist household, but he is not a pure activist. In recent years, he has been too closely associated with 元老重臣elder statesmen, senior officials, and bureaucrats, and has become deeply infected with bureaucratic tendencies himself, which is not favored by young fascist elements. At the same time, political parties and financial groups consider Hiranuma to be a fascist leader and quite hate him. Let's see how Hiranuma handles such a complicated Japanese political situation.

Iron Minister Maeda

From Wakayama Prefecture, 58 years old. Graduated from Tokyo Law School and worked as a lawyer. In 1931, he served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Inukai Cabinet. In 1936, he served as Minister of Railways in the Hirota Cabinet. In 1937, he served as a cabinet councillor until now. This is the second time he has served as Minister of Railways. Maeda is a heavyweight figure in the Seiyukai and has served as the party's Chief of General Affairs and Secretary-General. He is currently one of the acting members. He has considerable political skills, is not a said party, but is close to the military fascist, and is very active in the new party movement. He advocates abandoning established political parties. In the recent struggle between the Nakajima and Hatoyama factions in the political party, Maeda tends towards Nakajima and is actually a tool of fascism.

Agriculture Minister Machida

From Akita Prefecture, 77 years old, a veteran politician. In 1915, he served as a Parliamentary Councilor in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. In 1925, in the first Wakatsuki Cabinet, in 1929, in the Hamaguchi Cabinet, and in 1931, in the second Wakatsuki Cabinet, Machida served as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. In 1934, he served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Okada Cabinet. After Takahashi was killed in the February 26th Incident, he temporarily served as Minister of Finance for a few days. In the autumn of 1937, the Cabinet Counselor system was established, and he took office as a Cabinet Councillor until now. This is the fourth time he has served as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. Machida is the leader of the Minseito Party and has served as the party's president for many years. He is still in office. He also has financial skills and was originally a key member of the Yama. financial group.

Finance Minister Ishiwatari

From Tokyo, currently 48 years old. Graduated from the English and French Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University. He has served as an investigator in the Bureau of Decorations within the Cabinet, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and Vice Minister of Finance. During the tenures of former Finance Minister Kaya and the recently resigned Finance Minister Ikeda, Ishibayashi served as Vice Minister of Finance for both terms. He has special abilities in budget preparation. He participated in the preparation of all budgets. In recent years, he has belonged to all those responsible for compiling the huge military budget and is a financial technician similar to Kaya. He originally did not have any power in the financial and economic circles, but is a pro-military young financial bureaucrat, so he was able to serve as a key position as Finance Minister this time.

Editorial

### Local Officials in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction

The success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction is inextricably linked to the soundness of local political institutions. It is frequently heard that local governments in various provinces and regions will undergo some changes, and this is likely the reason. Recently, what has been seen as fact one after another: the transformation of the Xikang Special District into a province, with Liu Wenhui as the chairman of the provincial government; Li Hanhun succeeded Wu Tiecheng as the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government; in addition, there are rumors about a certain person in a certain province, which may not be without cause.

In any national institution, the temporary transfer of local officials is a normal administrative process and does not necessarily require special reasons or unexpected changes. However, in China, the general public still pays excessive attention to such matters, probably because the promotion, demotion, advancement and retreat of local officials at all levels have not entered a normal track. Changes in officials have often evolved into subtle waves in the officialdom, and their impact has spread widely. Moreover, when the state of separatism in the early years has not yet been eradicated, governing provinces and regions is like feudalism, and the gains and losses of their power and position are the ebb and flow of power. Even though the unification of national politics has been completed now, there are still people in the folk who are blindly committed to traditional concepts without being aware of it. For this reason, all personnel matters of this kind are the focus of general interest and attention, and people are happy to talk about them: is this not what is meant by being able to stop but not stopping? Although, those who bear the responsibility for one aspect are indeed the pivot between the central and local governments. Whether or not the national laws and policies are carried out smoothly? Whether or not the meritorious orders are effective? Whether or not it is appropriate to govern the province independently and adapt measures to local conditions? As for national politics and provincial politics, there will inevitably be benefits and drawbacks, and gains and losses will be mutually visible. The division of benefits and drawbacks, gains and losses has a direct impact on the people, and the components that turn out to be disasters or blessings are completely different. This is especially tied to whether or not the provincial government obtains the right people? Whether or not the method is appropriate? It is the same in peacetime, and even more so in the extraordinary period of war of resistance and national reconstruction. I have heard that half a year ago, the National Government repeatedly instructed various provinces and regions in various ways, saying that party politics and the military must be one: and that all aspects of wartime must be dominated by military affairs; moreover, it internally determined the principles for the selection of local officials, saying that in the war zones, military personnel must be appointed. Adapting measures to local conditions, this should naturally be the case. Therefore, provinces that did not meet the principles of personnel selection at that time were all rectified, except for Guizhou and Guangdong, which were relatively far from the front lines; now, with the war in Lingnan, Li Hanhun has been given important responsibilities, and Li is indeed a talented and outstanding general.

At this time, when several provincial governments have been reorganized and it is rumored that several provincial governments will also be reorganized, I would like to offer a suggestion to our central government: The war of resistance and national reconstruction are of course led by the central government, which coordinates and plans the overall situation, but morale, popular support, manpower, and material resources must originate from the local level. Therefore, the local level should be regarded as the foundation of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and the achievements of local government should be the main object of reviewing national politics. It is good that national politics and military affairs can only have partial perfection and not overall perfection. There is absolutely no overall perfection and local imperfection. In recent years, China has made extremely many and rapid advances; however, the greatest of these is due to the sincere efforts of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the program of goodness of the whole and the partial cannot make a reasonable balance and progress, not only forming a畸unnatural shape, but also having an倒置inverted view; the Qingmingclear air, the laborious expressions, and the efficiency of work are almost all directly proportional to the distance from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; those who are not like this are only exceptions. Such an unbalanced state, on the one hand, can be celebrated for the Chinese nation's acquisition of a leader who surpasses the crowd, and on the other hand, it must spur each level of politics after the leader, starting from the responsibility of morality and office, to have a keen self-awareness and strive for goodness. The civil servants of the central government, assisting the leader, of course have their solemn responsibilities; but local officials are solely responsible for one aspect, and their responsibilities are even heavier. Therefore, the central government's selection of local officials should not only seek their ability to be loyal and obedient to the central government, but must also seek their ability and talent to achieve practical results to follow the central government. This is how we can cultivate a far-reaching fundamental source for the war of resistance and national reconstruction and determine a deep and solid foundation for the whole. Having obtained the right people, it is especially necessary to thoroughly correct the past failures to divide the power of certain provinces and entrust them separately; and to fundamentally recognize the absolute necessity of the party, politics, and military so that they can be a part of a whole, giving that person full responsibility and full power, so that they can fully exert their ability and talent; if not, the reorganization is useless: it must be so, so that they can be held responsible for completing the entire task.

### Overview of the Week's War Situation (From December 26th to January 1st)

— Minister of Political Affairs, Chen Cheng

(Guangdong Area)

Since our fierce counter-offensive in Guangdong, giving a 重重重创heavy blow to the ×army, the ×army谋plans to shorten the defense line,整理reorganize and await援aid. Also, in Zengcheng, Huangpu, Shunde, Jiujiang, Foshan, Sanshui and other areas around Guangzhou, they are actively building工事constructions as a plan for retreating and attacking. Recently, the ×army in Zengcheng and 上下罗冈Shangxia Luogang have been袭击attacked by our certain troops' assault team, causing great恐慌panic, 发炮firing artillery at night, and 消称claiming there are a lot of弹药ammunition. The ×army in Shilong was袭击attacked by our certain assault team on the night of the 28th. They battled each other in the巷巷 streets for a few hours, killing over a hundred people. At the break of dawn, our troops still safely retreated back to the original阵地position. Around one thousand people of a part of the Foshan ×army were调官dispatched, and around one连队regiment was调回transferred back from someplace to 填补fill.　　　　调adjustments, The Sanshui ×army of around one division seems to be actively preparing. Rumor has it that there is still a subsequent troop continuously transporting. They have an active intention toward the West River. The North Sea and Hainan Island Sea×warships have not been seen active.

(Hunan-Jiangxi Area)

On the Yuehan Northern Section and　浔Xun Areas, In the Yuehan Northern Section, the war area has been quite沉寂silent in recent days. Our×army is still対峙confronting on the 新墙河Xinqiang River　岭街Lingjie Line. Our troops夜袭night assaulted the　林Lin of Lingxiang on the night of the first, killing many ×armies. The 残×remnants fled to the north in a panic. On the 南　方面South Side, ×army and our are still対峙confronting on both banks of the 修河Xiu River. Except for a small contact occasionally with ×army by the guerrilla troops, there has been no fierce war yet on the正面front. Our military took advantage of the ×army's lack of防备readiness on the dawn of the first day and violently攻战engaged the ×army at each main point between Yongxiu and Dean, killing many ×armies. The 残×remnants all溃退collapsed and retreated, and we are sending teams to pursue in.

(Hubei-Henan Area)

In the Northern Hubei Area, the ×armies at Yingshan, Taolin River,　河舖He Pu, etc. have all退退 retreated to Zhe River after our掃蕩suppression. The Guan Temple ×army also retreated to Yingshan. The Anlu ×army was袭击attacked by our certain troop, and took Qinglongtan. The ×army retreated to Yandundian. The 皂市Zaoshi ×army of around 2000 is very戒严vigilant, and looks very恐慌panicked. In the Southern Henan Area, there has been no war situation recently, but the ×army has been quite active in the Eastern Henan Area. The ×armies near Shang對对Kaifeng have increased to 5000-6000 people. A part of a few hundreds of people are invading Tuocheng County, and are now in fierce engagement with our守城defending troops. Although Tongxu has been occupied by ×army, it is not　invaded to the west due to the牽制restraint of our guerrilla troops. In the Northern Henan Area, the Newxiang ×army headquarters was袭击attacked by our plainclothes team. The fire burned all day. The Newxiang North, the Luwangfen Station was　attacked, and the ×army did not支support and溃退collapsed and retreated north.

(Shanxi-Suiyuan Area)

The Shanxi ×army is recently planning to aggressively攻打attack our military, to prepare to cross the river and invade westward. Beginning in the late December, they began attacking in路routes. One from Hejin attacking north, after being severely stricken by us near Mount Yumen, has already crawled back to Hejin. One from Linfen attacking westward, with the ×army south from Fenyang,窜crawled to the 大窘 大窘 on the 29th.　使make some parts disturb Jixian and Xiangning. It is now in intense battle with us. One from Fenyang crossing Jiuyu attacking south, met our troop 裁击裁击, and did not succeed. One from Lishi attacking, was 邀击intercepted by us near Liulin, and a part has already crawled back. Other parts are still planning to invade west. Our military is駆逐driving them out in different routes. In summary, between Jixian and Xiangning, is our predetermined戰战, and has been planned with strict. Expect that the ×army on this side will suffer a great blow in days. In the Guyuan area of Suiyuan, ×army continued to add, and looks like西犯　樣 invading west. Because they fear our guerrilla troops襲attack, recently demolished the houses inside Guyuan City and　園園Zhoulili, and the refugees without homes have群起risen to join the guerrilla troops, giving　a serious戚胁threat, At the same time, the偽軍puppet troops of the land are互相互相 内鬨内讧, and the more powerful troop is　酝酿plotting 反正counter-attack.

(Hebei Area)

There are a lot of駐駐 troops stationed in each main point on the North Section of the Pinghan Line. There are over ten thousands of ×armies near Shijiazhuang. Around seven thousands of that part have gradually shifted westward, seemingly to增援aid Shanxi. In summary,

(This Week's War Situation)

There has been no special man war in each side. In the Southern China Area, the Guangdong ×army seems to hold the main point in the vicinity of Guangzhou and the据据base of Humen and Dongguan. With the main force invading Zhao　 from Sanshui,　after our each line simultaneously attacked, giving the ×army no time to consider both ends, and repeatedly受under重创重创, forcing them to retreat back to the original阵地陣地.　Only the little contacts are间间 in华中the middle lines, it seems the ×army concentrates the 武演武演 to 整理整理. We are waiting for the opportunity to 围　围　. In华北Northern China　, the Shanxi 察绥察绥 ×army seems比较active, and曾曾 attacked晋西western Shanxi in different ways. However, after迎头被head on attack , its 损失损失頗頗. It is still in 对对抗 confrontation near 河津河津, 离石离石. Our army are strictly防范vigilant and the forces are雄雄, and it is痴人作梦foolish dreams if the ×army want to break波波 west. At the start of the second明抗战Ming resistance, it is actually good for us for the ×armies to penetrate into mountains. No matter in the 政政 strategic and 战卫战卫 each side, it has shown　心心 tired and daily　. We often utilize the new战战 strategy and tactics and implement a complete打击打击×people to make them tired to run and迫迫 make them lose their position and to make a serious break to collapse. That is the wish that we can预祝anticipate at the start of the the renewing season of the year of 28.

### A Foreigner Arrives in Shanghai and Talks About the Current Situation in Japan; Foreign Magazines Become Rare Items; Kobe and Yokohama Have Become

[Shanghai Correspondent] According to a foreigner who came to Shanghai from Japan, the Japanese people's concern and anxiety about the crisis in relations between Japan and the Soviet Union can be seen everywhere. Japanese people, who are accustomed to talking with foreigners, secretly declare that the situation is tense and the tragic result for Japan can hardly be avoided. The police are extremely active and their surveillance of the Japanese people is even greater than that of foreigners. Therefore, conversations almost prohibit mentioning international events. News is, of course, censored, and exchange restrictions are strictly enforced. Even for foreigners subscribing to foreign newspapers, they must gather many foreigners to pool foreign exchange to pay for the newspapers. Apart from government figures, foreign magazines have become rare luxury items. The traveler used to see Kobe and Yokohama as bustling commercial cities, but now they are like dead cities. Commerce in both places seems to be at a standstill. Docks and transport terminals are guarded by soldiers. The docks in Osaka are occupied by loading and unloading military supplies, and the ships used for transportation are all military vessels, so the ships there are　and cannot engage in freight. A certain ship inspector from the police station talked about this war, which is a rare move by Japanese officials. It is said that Japan was wrong not to engage in a war as large as today's in 1932.

### The Intense Battle in Jiangbei, The Situation in Haimen Eases

[Shanghai Correspondence] Starting from the 22nd of this month, the Japanese side has gathered a large force and launched attacks along the river from both land and water, resulting in fierce battles with our forces. Currently, the situation in Haimen has eased somewhat, and the center of the fighting has shifted to Sanhe Port in Qidong. Foreign merchant ships have temporarily suspended operations since December 28th. Details are as follows:

Japanese Troops Advance

The guerrilla forces in Haimen, Qidong, Tongzhou, and other areas of Jiangsu Province have been reorganized into regular troops by the provincial authorities and are under the command of Li Mingyang. The military strength of each county has been increasing day by day. Most of the soldiers are veterans with sharp weapons, stationed along the river, constantly attacking the Japanese army, which has become a thorn in the side of the Japanese. They have long wanted to launch a large-scale attack to eliminate them. Therefore, on December 22nd, they mobilized more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers, along with puppet Manchukuo troops and local puppet police, totaling about 5,000 to 6,000 people, from Nantong, Haimen, Qinglong Port Dasheng Third Factory, and several gunboats, advancing in five directions, guided by traitors and forcibly recruited civilians.

We Inflict Heavy Damage

The Tongzhou, Haimen, and Qidong forces had long prepared for the Japanese's ambition to attack. This time, under the unified command of Sun Xuechao, the magistrate of Haimen County and commander of the 5th Brigade of the 4th District of the 24th Group Army, and with the cooperation of generals Ding Jutang, Zhang Nengren, Chen Caiyun, Lu Zhoupei, and Sun Xuechao from northern Jiangsu, they launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese army. They had previously moved the riverine troops inland to avoid the danger of attacks from both land and water. The Japanese army launched an all-out offensive, and except for heavier losses by Sun Xuechao's troops, the other units remained intact. However, when the Japanese troops invaded Songjigang and Lao Honggang, they suffered about 100 casualties, and the puppet police also suffered casualties.

Shift to Qidong

According to people from Haimen, the fighting has continued for a week since it began on December 22nd and has not yet stopped. The situation in Haimen has eased, but the center of the fighting has shifted to Sanhe Port and Dongyihao Port in Qidong. This time, the Japanese army harassed various ports in Haimen but suffered heavy losses due to the combined counterattacks of the Chinese army. All the occupied ports were retaken by the Chinese army after the thin Japanese forces were driven back, and defenses were restored. However, dozens of gunboats and speedboats frequently patrolled and harassed the coast. The Chinese army has taken strict precautions, and the Japanese army has not dared to cross the river easily. The Japanese army in Qinglong Port Dasheng Third Factory is also under siege.

All Ships Suspend Service

Since the outbreak of war at various ports in Beisha, local residents feared large-scale burning and killing by the Japanese army and fled to seek refuge. All commercial activities have also completely stopped. Although the situation at Haimen, Songjigang, Niuhonggang, Shujigang, Lao Honggang, Xingang, and Lingdiangang has become orderly and stable, commerce has not yet recovered. Therefore, the foreign merchant ships Winton, Changde, Deyi, Fulu, Libei, and Paide, which operate on the Beisha line, have temporarily suspended service since December 28th. However, foreign ships with lighter loads, such as St. Louis, are still operating and calling as usual.

### × English and American Goods Excluded Due to Monopoly of Occupied Area Market, Foreign Merchants Gather to Discuss Countermeasures

[Shanghai Correspondence] To retaliate against the active support of China by Britain and the United States, the Japanese side plans to increase tariffs in North China and monopolize the market for British and American goods. This is now brewing for implementation, and it is said that the exclusion of foreign goods in the guerrilla areas of Central China is particularly severe. According to news from customs officials and import and export companies in Shanghai, in the past month, British and American goods shipped to various lines of the Yangtze River for sale have been frequently inspected and detained by the local Japanese garrison, citing that they are not products of Japan and are not allowed to be sold, resulting in heavy losses for the companies. Those who refuse to unload the goods and return them to their place of origin must pay double the freight, resulting in considerable losses. As the Sino-American loan is about to be established, the Japanese army in various areas of Central China hates Britain and the United States even more, so the exclusion of foreign goods has become even more intense. In the past week, the shipment of British and American goods to various ports along the Yangtze River has become almost non-existent. Import and export companies and customs brokers are all wary and dare not easily declare goods. The Japanese ambition to monopolize the Far East trade market is increasingly exposed. It is heard that British and American merchants are now gathering to discuss effective countermeasures to maintain their economic interests in the Far East.

The Influx of Japanese Currency into Occupied Ports is Alarming

[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the Japanese war of aggression against China, the domestic economic situation in Japan has fallen into extreme difficulties and is difficult to sustain. Therefore, the Japanese militarists and financial groups are implementing currency inflation domestically and actively engaging in economic aggression in the occupied areas of China, excluding third countries such as Britain and the United States from trading with China. At that time, a large amount of inflated Japanese currency and non-convertible Japanese military scrip were used to purchase agricultural products such as food and cotton, and an attempt was made to allow Japanese yen forces to invade the Chinese market. The entry of these Japanese yen scrips, which were declared to customs at occupied ports, amounted to 4.35 million yen in November of this year, and a total of 14.4314 million yen in the eleven months of this year, not including those transported by special ships.

### Military and Political Figures Discuss the War Situation, Continued on Page 8

"However, we are in a period of transition in this war situation. The rebirth of the symbolized China and the liberation of the nation is like the birth of a fetus, which must feel some necessary difficulties. In other words, the ×× robbers cannot destroy our country in one battle, but we also cannot quickly turn weakness into strength and immediately drive the ×× robbers out of the country. We can only adhere to a protracted war of resistance and strengthen domestic unity. This is the basic policy to overcome difficulties and truly enter the stage of victory..."

"Report: A guest is requesting to see the Minister—" Mr. Zhou's only attendant adjutant suddenly knocked on the door and said this, while handing over two business cards. Mr. Zhou invited the guest in. He wore the rank of captain and said that he had been educated by Mr. Zhou when he was studying at the ×× Military Academy. He is now serving in a certain unit and is preparing to go to the front, but unfortunately Guangzhou fell, and his family fled to Guilin. They have no food to eat, so he has come to ask Mr. Zhou for help. Mr. Zhou taught at the ×× Military Academy a long time ago, so he certainly could not remember this high-achieving disciple for a while. However, based on the spirit of "treating all people as brothers" and "teaching without discrimination," he first took a few refugee certificates from the begging disciple to look at and then sincerely said to the man: "Seeking help from others is not a fundamental solution. You should ask so-and-so three people to work, and someone to do a little business, to jointly support the remaining old woman and two children." After saying this, he generously opened his purse and gave him thirty yuan, telling him to let the designated person do a little business and not sit idle and squander the money.

We know that the salaries of the soldiers and officers of the Eighth Route Army, excluding food, are only two yuan for pocket money for soldiers and five yuan for officers per month. Mr. Zhou's money does not come easily, and there are many proper uses for it, which can be imagined from his earnest exhortations. However, the most important meaning is that whether a person is in normal or changing circumstances, it is important to have a spirit of self-reliance and self-help. If that officer and his family can thoroughly understand and put it into practice, the actual benefits they will receive will be inexhaustible for the rest of their lives.

After that, Mr. Hu Yuzhi, a strong figure in the literary world, came to visit, and Mr. Chen Mingshu also sent someone to invite him to talk, so I had to say goodbye. Shaking hands before leaving, he suddenly asked me for a copy of "Inspection Notes on Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei." I was surprised that he would remember this booklet that I published five years ago, and at that time, I could only promise to mail it to him later for his review.

His only attendant adjutant was only fifteen or sixteen years old and was very polite to people. According to a friend, although he is young, he has been in battle for a long time and has learned a good marksmanship from practical experience. For example, if he wants to shoot you in the eye with a gun, the bullet will never slant into your eyebrow or bridge of your nose. If his marksmanship can be so accurate, it can truly be called a superb skill!

Guo Moruo on the New Stage

Mr. Guo Moruo's remarks echoed those of Mr. Bai Chongxi and Mr. Zhou Enlai, as if they came from the same source. Regarding his observation of the overall war situation, his views are as follows:

"As the war enters a new stage, our military and political authorities have made appropriate arrangements to maintain all the advantages of the previous stage as much as possible and to strictly correct the shortcomings. It is undeniable that there are many difficulties in the new stage, but there are ways to overcome them. All our citizens should reduce their standard of living. Whether participating in the war of resistance or not, whether in the front or the rear, whether in group life or private life, everyone should try their best to be frugal and serve the public. This is the most practical initial step to overcome difficulties and also the minimum salvation work that everyone should do and can do.

"In the new stage, the difficulties that the × side is increasing are even greater than ours. In the previous stage of the war of resistance, the × side had the advantage, which led to our loss of some land and people. However, we shattered the × people's dream of a 'quick victory' in the Battle of Shanghai, and even more ruthlessly shattered the × people's attempt to 'use Chinese to control Chinese' in the Battle of Xuzhou. By the Battle of Wuhan, the × people poured their naval, land, and air forces, and advanced along multiple routes, vainly hoping to achieve annihilation and suppression. However, we supported them with great fanfare for four or five months, so that after the × people's naval, land, and air forces were greatly depleted, we made a planned withdrawal from Wuhan and maintained our main force like a flawless jade box, so that the × people's dream of attacking Wuhan—the annihilation battle—was actually equal to an empty catch.

"In the previous stage of the war of resistance, we not only perfectly maintained our main force, so that we can expect to support the war, but on the other hand, we also safely moved many national factories in the north and south of the Yangtze River in Central China to the southwest hinterland, and established the economic sector in the whole anti-Japanese nation-building cause, and the government-run basic industries cooperated with each other, so that the anti-Japanese resources in the future can be produced by ourselves and can be obtained inexhaustibly and used inexhaustibly."

"In addition, objectively, the inconvenience of the × people's operations in the new stage, first, the larger the occupied area, the longer the battle line. The × people's forces are not enough to be allocated. On the contrary, the opportunities for us to take advantage of the weaknesses will gradually increase. Second, in the hinterland of our two major regions in the Northwest and Southwest, the use of the × people's naval, land, and air forces is restricted by the terrain, and it is absolutely impossible to get the convenience of smooth transportation as before in the coastal areas. And it will be difficult to find a central place like Xuzhou and Wuhan to give him a large-scale battle. If there is one, it will not be possible for him to have a chance to get annihilation results. As for our strength, whether in the front line or behind the × people, it is scattered everywhere and can operate individually. The × people want to defeat us one by one, and we can also fight independently and solve the × people individually. According to this stalemate situation, we can strengthen our struggle for a period of time, so that we can make full use of the characteristics of terrain, products, economy, and politics to increase our unlimited strength and advantages in the anti-Japanese war, and we can victoriously turn into the third stage. 　That is, the counterattack of the × people!"

After that, Mr. Guo also talked about some of the hidden dangers lurking in Japan and the unfavorable situation of the international community for Japan. 　Mr. 　　is a star in the modern cultural world and the leader of anti-Japanese literature. He now suddenly bears high-level political responsibilities, but he is still very concerned about cultural undertakings. He inquired in detail about the process of the resumption of publication of Shen Bao in Shanghai and the expansion of its Hong Kong version, expressing his pleasure. At the request of the reporter, he decided to write some articles and send them to Shen Bao for publication as soon as he had time from his official duties. I remember that at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Guo published a great work "Coming and Going in Bombing" in Shen Bao. Perhaps when the time comes to sweep away the × people. Maybe it's a good idea to write another article about "Recovering Lost Land in Bombing"?

The × people often spread rumors in Hong Kong and Shanghai, saying how our internal parties are rubbing against each other. When Mr. Guo heard this, he had a very relaxed answer at the time; he said: "Even loving couples will sometimes quarrel. What does it matter if the parties have a little friction? 　　In fact, because of Mr. Jiang's wise leadership, there has never been any friction between the parties after the Anti-Japanese War. In the future, because of the extension of the Anti-Japanese War and the increase of the responsibilities of the Anti-Japanese War, the united cooperation needed by all parties will inevitably increase its degree of sincerity."

In addition, I also heard from a friend in one of the three halls that a certain authority announced the political policy of the new stage of the Anti-Japanese War, which is to further unite the people's strength and cherish the material resources under the major premise of "military in politics," "matter in spirit," and "the people are more important than the soldiers," and to resettle the refugees. The political object is in the front, and the work is developed below. The shortcomings of the past, where the head was heavy and the bottom was light, must be corrected. At the same time, we must also train political cadres and talents, and train × 10,000 talents within a limited period of 　 years to be used as a solid foundation for the new stage of political work.

In short, our military and political authorities do have a new plan for the cause of anti-Japanese nation-building in the new stage, so that it can smoothly reach the realm of inevitable victory.

——The general passengers who were displaced to Hunan and Guangxi because of the Anti-Japanese War, especially the five or six car 　　from the lost areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and North China, are of course very concerned about the war situation related to the survival of the country and the nation. I was moved by the patriotism of the 　　and the enthusiasm of Mr. Bai Chongxi's speech, so I returned the courtesy and told them about the talks of Mr. Zhou Enlai and Guo Moruo as described in the previous article. Everyone listened in silence, and some even gave knowing smiles, so that the cold 　　dining car was filled with excitement and optimism in an instant!

The next morning (the third day after departing from Guilin), the car arrived at Santang, only one or two kilometers away from the junction with the Guangdong 　 Road—Hengyang. I don't know what it was thinking, but it stopped at Santang for a long time and didn't leave. I wanted to change my taste, so I got off the car to take a bus from Southwest Transportation Company. The car was transporting gasoline from Hengyang Jiang 　to this place, and it was transferred from the train to other places. 　Dozens of cars shuttled back and forth for several days, and it has not been completed yet. Although it is said that one drop of oil in wartime is better than one drop of blood, we can see a glimpse of our full preparation for this stuff. The driver's name is Huang. He is an overseas Chinese from Guangdong in Nanyang. He has prepared cars in Nanyang and learned driving technology. He started to serve in the Anti-Japanese Army. He agreed with a group of overseas Chinese patriotic comrades to find ways to return to China to serve, and each did what he could. He has been a driver for more than a year. It is said that he and other comrades used to get monthly salaries of about 100 yuan when they were doing business in Nanyang. After returning to China, each person only gets a salary of 36 to 42 yuan, but because it is the work of saving the country, they feel particularly happy in spirit.

The trees planted on both sides of the Hunan highway adopt the method of the Su Causeway of West Lake, and add the meaning of production, that is, "planted willows and cypresses alternately 　". At this time, the leaves of the paulownia tree fall, and the leaves of the willow tree turn yellow. Occasionally, a few trees of 　maple are dotted nearby, just like a beautiful natural autumn scene. The car drives through it, and it is really pleasing to the eye. However, the flowers of wartime have already bloomed among the branches and trees, that is, the signs and arrows of "No. × Automobile Field", "No. × Wounded Soldiers Hospital", and "Marching Rest Place", which will sometimes secretly jump 　into your eyes and pull your otherworldly fantasy back to "reality".

After a while, I saw Hengyang and stayed temporarily in Xinghua Village outside the city.

### The Battle on the Yellow River Line Intensifies, Our Troops in Southwestern Shanxi Block the × Crossing, More Than Half of the Taniguchi Division Killed or Wounded

[Electric from Xingshi, Central News Agency, 4th] On the third, fierce battles raged on the Yellow River line between the × and us. Our artillery exerted its power, firing at the south bank. The × in Wencheng, 　　, and Zhongshi suffered numerous casualties. The × near Xiaochuanwo were fiercely intercepted by our machine guns and fled eastward. Our troops launched fierce attacks on Yifu and Mount Renzu, Mount Guantou, and other places. The × west of Xiaochuanwo, except for a small part, mostly retreated to 〇 County. The 2,000 × troops in Daning moved towards Pingdu Pass. The × in 〇 County planned to merge with the × forces in Daning to seek other crossing points.

[Electric from Xingshi, Central News Agency, 4th] At the beginning of last month, the × forces on the Tongpu Railway crossed the Fen River and invaded Fensi. Because our railway sided with the flanking attacks, the × took a defensive posture, waiting for reinforcements to act again. Until the next 　, Xixi 　　just stopped. The × successively gathered about 6,000 to 7,000 in Fenshui, 3,000 in Hongdong Zhaocheng, 6,000 in Linfen, 3,000 in Quhou Xingan, and more than 2,000 in Hejin Jishan. Since the 25th, they have launched a large-scale westward invasion. The first route took Fenxiao as its base, passed through Duijiugu, Damaojiao, and Shikou, and headed north to Shishou and south to Zuji. The trail of × was found along the Xinguandu River west of Shi. The second route took Linfen as its base, passed through Tumen Heilongguan, and invaded Puxian, Daning Yangkou Honglianggou Nanwanli, and other places. There were fierce battles in all places. The third route headed west from Nangling, occupied the front and back Guojiazhuang, and fled north after being met by our attack. A bloody battle was launched west of Chengnan Slope Pond. The × then converged with the × of Qinyuling and Heilongguan. In this battle, our regimental commander Wei Wu and battalion commander Gao Qu died in battle, and Zhao De 　regiment was defeated. The fourth route Quhou Xingan × north 　Quan Zhang San 　Zhao Kang and other places, our regiment marched from Kouping to Jiwang Mountain, attacking from north and south, the × troops hesitated and found it difficult to advance, our battalion commander Yuan Sandao died in battle. The fifth route took Hejin as its base, passed through Fancun, Guzhen, West 　Kou, Xipozhen, and Maozijin, and advanced north, attacking Yumen with its main force. 　Our general recovered Yumen, and the × fled to 　Shishi 　Tan, and occupied Niangniang Temple to the east, invading Xiangning Jixian, and then divided into 　to attack our Xiaochuanwo crossing. It was found that the × who invaded this time were the Taniguchi Mototsurao unit of the 118th Division. Most of the division was composed of old and weak soldiers. It suffered the greatest losses in Jiangxian Henglingguan Hengshui and other places in southern Shanxi. The entire 115th Regiment was annihilated by our Peng Division. In total, the entire division lost more than two-thirds of its strength. The former division commander and brigadier commander Nakano were also 　dismissed for their defeat in the Yuanqu battle. In this operation, in addition to 　new recruits, many 　Emperor's Cooperative Army such as Wang Ying and Zhang Renjie were also equipped. Now our army has recovered Hualezhen, Daning, Chuanzhuang, and other places west of Heilongguan. The × rear road has been cut off, and both sides are often attacked. After being frustrated in Xiaochuanwo, although they tried to find another crossing point in 　Du Guan or Xinguandu, they were afraid that they would not be able to do so.

[Mingge News Agency Xingshi 5th] This time, the number of × attacking Mount Lüliang was about 7,000 to 8,000. They began to move on the 25th, 26th, and 20th of last month. One route invaded Tumen Heilongguan from Linfen, and one route fled Guojiazhuang from Xiangling. The two routes were about 4,000 to 5,000 people. One route invaded Xiangning from Jishan, and one route invaded Yaoxi Gukou from Hejin. The two routes numbered about 4,000 to 5,000 people. The × attacking Guojiazhuang turned north after being severely attacked by our army and joined with the × in Linfen, invading Puxian Daning. Our Chen army attacked them from time to time along the way, suffering heavy casualties. In addition, Tumen Heilongguan were successively 　recovered by our army, and the × rear road was cut off, which was very Panic. The × in Jishan Beifan joined the × in Xigushan and successively invaded Xiangningji 　, and invaded the Yellow River to the west. After three days of fierce fighting, the × 　suffered a great defeat. The remnants of the × fled north, and there was a look of attacking Ping 　Guan with the × in Daning. At the same time, the × in Fenyang also increased by more than 5,000 last month. One part of 　supported Lishi Shiyang, and one part supported the × in Duijiugu, Xixian, and Zhongyang. On the 29th, they fled from Shijiazhuang to Shangguan and invaded Shishou. After being severely attacked by our army in Jinluozhen, the × in Lishi has not yet moved. It is said that a part of the × in Shishou fled to Xiguan 　, which is currently fighting with our unit.

### Our Army Fiercely Attacks Zengcheng, The × Continue to Reinforce and Still Plan to Defend to the Death, Our Second Attack Kills Many ×

[Awakening Society Shenzhen Express News] Our Eastern Route Army, led by Huang Xun, Wen Shuhai, Wu Daonan, and others, has been fiercely attacking Zengcheng in recent days, and has twice rushed into Zengcheng Street (county seat), breaking through the main force of the ×. However, the × continue to 　reinforce in an attempt to defend to the death. However, the troops reinforced by the × are all remnants of defeated soldiers from various battlefields. The soldiers have no fighting spirit, and their combat strength is extremely weak. It is really unbearable to attack. Therefore, since the 29th of last month, our army on the east bank of the Zeng River has once again launched an attack on the ×. There have been great gains in consecutive days, especially in the battles of Dayigang and Shetouling on one day, and the street fighting between our × and the northeast gate of Zengcheng. The battles were the fiercest. Our officers and soldiers were all extremely brave, and they only advanced and never retreated, so they killed × extremely 　. Now the Zengcheng × army has reported a total collapse, with thousands of casualties in the past ten days. Knowing that the general situation has passed, on the second 　they withdrew to Yiyao Taihe and Shitan on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Now there are no traces of × in the Zengcheng Zhucun Fuhe and Xietan areas. Our army has sent vanguard troops to search for the remaining × in the city, and the large army is advancing forward in a steady stream, continuing to contact our electricity on the left wing of Beitou and fiercely attacking Xizhou. At the same time, our army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is also determined to take advantage of the victory in Zengcheng, and urgently attack Shilong and Shitan, along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway straight to Guangzhou. Now the × army in Shit 　Shitan, because the outer defense line of Zengcheng was broken by us, and there is a large army of ours pressing down on the East River and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, will automatically abandon Shilong and Shitan, shorten the defense line, and firmly defend the northeastern suburbs of Guangzhou, Chepo Shipai Jijengkeng, and other areas, as an inner line war.

The Henan-Hubei × Army is at a Loss

[Central News Agency Luoyang 4th] There are less than 20,000 × puppet troops in northern Henan, mainly based on the 14th Division. Most of them are concentrated in the western section of Daoyan, Huojia Xiuwu, and Qinyang, attempting to threaten Zhengzhou Gongxian and Luoyang, eyeing western Henan. The eastern section of Daoqing and Xinxiang are all along the Beijing-Hankou line, and the × army is extremely scarce 　. The × army adopts a conservative policy on military affairs in northern Henan, so each is based on 　, and solid forts are built to prevent our attacks. In addition, several teams of infantry, cavalry, and artillery are combined to carry out guerrilla warfare in all directions. However, the × army is currently unable to invade the west.

[Every News Agency, Shanghai, Every 5th] According to Japanese reports, there are still a large number of Chinese troops active in the rear of the Japanese army. After the Japanese army carried out aerial reconnaissance, it was found that there were still many Chinese regular troops occupying various villages north of Yingkou and in the Dabie Mountains in the northeast. Therefore, the Japanese army will 　"clean up" this area, and it is impossible to avoid a major battle. Also, the Japanese front line north of Hankou is not long enough to prevent the Chinese army from taking advantage of the gaps.

### Kawashima Yoshiko Assassinated in Tianjin, Suffered Multiple Axe Wounds; Younger Sister Simultaneously Shot Dead

### We Recover Yangzhong County; Changzhou Once Attacked

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 4th] Yangzhong County fell last spring. The traitor Gu Xianzhi took office as the puppet county magistrate and established various puppet organizations. Since the retreat of the enemy, Yangzhong has been manipulated by the puppet organization. The Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army entered and surrounded the puppet government last month, capturing more than 20 Chinese traitors and seizing more than 70 firearms. Yangzhong was thus recovered. However, Gu Xianzhi escaped. It is known that the Jiangnan Guerrilla Force attacked Changzhou on the 18th of last month and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy for several hours before safely withdrawing.

### Enemy Aircraft Dropped Leaflets over Shanghai Concessions

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] Japanese aircraft flew over the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession this morning, dropping countless Chinese leaflets. These leaflets contained absurd remarks signed by leaders of various Chinese circles, stating that they were all willing to seek peace according to Wang Jingwei's proposal but were obstructed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It also claimed that Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi, and Ambassador to the US Hu Shi had telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting him to accept Wang's proposal.

### Observers from Various Countries Comment on the Political Turmoil in Japan, Saying Fascism Overthrowing Konoe, Military Setbacks Are the Real Cause

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Soviet officials believe that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet is actually a victory for Japanese fascism. The Japanese military believes that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek cannot be defeated, and Konoe is responsible for this. Therefore, the military is the main driving force behind the collapse of the Konoe cabinet.

England

[Reuters, London, 4th] The Evening Standard used a headline like "Fascists Overthrow Japanese Prime Minister" to report the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, but did not publish an editorial. Japanese people in London expressed regret over the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, saying that Konoe was very able to maintain a balance between all parties and resisted the demands of the extremists, especially those made after the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou. Many believe that Konoe was confident in his recent peace proposals to China, but he was actually greatly disappointed. This is probably the most recent reason for his resignation. As for Hiranuma, who succeeded him as Prime Minister, he is "the most extreme and untrustworthy nationalist." The resignation of Ikeda as Minister of Finance is considered a pity because he is considered by many to be the most competent member. These Japanese people are very concerned about the choice of successor. Many expect that Japan's two political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, will follow the events of the autumn of 1936 and the spring of 1937 and fiercely oppose the Japanese military's attempts to organize a new party and move towards fascism. If the military's plan is realized, the Japanese parliament will be reduced to a mere formality. Observers here believe that the new Japanese cabinet cannot last long. Chinese people here expressed their opinions to Reuters, saying that whoever takes power in Tokyo has little to do with us, because we must continue to resist. A government of extremists is actually beneficial to us because it will more easily incite internal rebellion in Japan.

United States

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] After the Japanese Konoe cabinet resigned en masse and Privy Council President Hiranuma was ordered to form a new cabinet, American officials commented, saying that Hiranuma is representative of the Japanese fascist faction. His succession as Prime Minister is intended to form a cabinet indispensable for continuing the war against China and conquering land. If economic sanctions were imposed on Japan at this time, the effect would be the greatest. As for the interests that the United States maintains in China, Japan has adopted various discriminatory measures and cut off traffic between Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and the Chinese mainland. Sino-American commerce has virtually come to a standstill. The US government may recall Ambassador Grew to Japan to report on the policies advocated by President Roosevelt in his message, namely, to deal with aggressive countries with strong measures, and discuss the implementation methods, which may not be avoided.

Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Germany is paying close attention to the resignation of the Japanese cabinet and the formation of a new cabinet and believes that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet will strengthen Japan's foreign policy. However, officials do not want to comment on anything before the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet. The Berliner Tageblatt stated, "Konoe's resignation is enough to make people understand what the Japanese newspapers said last year, that Japan's foreign policy in 1939 will be unified, and that military, economic, and diplomatic policies will be adjusted." The newspaper reviewed Konoe's cabinet in the past, believing that the demand for the unification of Japanese foreign policy has not yet been realized.

### Policy of Aggression Against China Remains Unchanged

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] After an emergency meeting of various officials, Army Minister Itagaki planned to submit seven demands to the government: 1. The policy towards the China Incident must be fully implemented in accordance with the Imperial Conference and the declaration of December 22nd. 2. Due to the deterioration of the situation in the Far East, military preparations must be expanded and supplemented. 3. Strengthen the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis. 4.

### Military and Political Figures Avoid Discussing War

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya

Still on the train in Hunan and Guangxi. The rain continues to fall, sometimes mixed with hail the size of rice grains and beans, making a clanging sound against the train car.

Upon reaching Dong'an Station, we entered Hunan Province. Looking around, the mountains are gentle, and there are many paddy fields, a landscape very different from Guangxi. Lengshuitan is a large town in Lingling County and also a large station on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway. Electric wires crisscross like a web, and the houses are clustered together in a large area. Since this is an important town, there are traitors active here. A few minutes before the train arrived at the station, the railway police arrested a blatant traitor. He was wearing a fake Hunan-Guangxi Railway employee badge, and hiding symbols of other units, and also carrying a check from a certain bank. He was suspected of inquiring about various situations at the station and was arrested. He confessed immediately, a case of walking right into the net.

Also, in a certain place not far from here, which was previously attacked by enemy aircraft, someone first waved a white towel and then used the towel to cover his mouth. He was captured by the stationed troops and had both ears cut off. However, during interrogation, he stubbornly denied being a traitor. He said he covered his mouth with a white towel because he saw enemy aircraft being hit by bullets and emitting smoke, mistakenly believing that it was releasing poison gas, so he covered his mouth to prevent poisoning. The interrogating officer believed him and apologized to him, also compensating him for medical expenses, and released him. Who knew that he was deeply poisoned by the enemy's temptation. Later, he went to do this again and was arrested again. Since he had his ears cut off as a mark last time, and this time the enemy aircraft was not hit by bullets and did not emit smoke, he could not use the old excuse. Of course, he had to submit to the law.

On the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, a group of traitors was also captured. They were a large-scale northern-style acrobatic troupe, with more than ten men and women in total. They thought to come to South China to spy on military intelligence. The local authorities had obtained intelligence early on, but they could not grasp their conclusive evidence. Later, they spent a lot of effort to examine the tire of the unicycle that they used to ride on the tightrope when they performed, and found secret documents, which satisfactorily solved the case.

In short, all those who are traitors will not have a good end. Small traitors who send signals for three or five cents at a time are certainly not worth it. Even those big traitors who can get an official position will eventually lose out. Because the capital, their head, is in danger of being lost, what profit is there to be made? Moreover, "the cunning rabbit dies, the hound is cooked." If the masters are unhappy, they will also put you to death. At this point, it is even more difficult to rest in peace even as a ghost!

At night, the express train stopped again at a station. Everything was very quiet, and we seemed to be staying in a long, narrow hotel. The reporter and the passengers casually chatted again. There were five or six car attendants in the dining car. They were all educated in elementary school or junior high school, and were now reading books and talking after finishing work. One of them was smarter and was transferred from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He said he had met me on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi train before. He asked me: Did you go to hear Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Headquarters give a speech to the students in Guilin yesterday? He said that he had gone to listen himself, and then he took out his diary and looked at it, recounting the speech that Mr. Bai gave on it, from beginning to end.

The outline of Mr. Bai's speech first explained comprehensive tactics, saying that everyone, regardless of gender or age, should enthusiastically rush to the battlefield. No matter the location, east, west, north, or south, whether it is the front or the rear, they must be fully mobilized to directly and indirectly strike at the enemy. On the battlefield, we do not compete for "points" and "lines," but compete for "surfaces." He then pointed out the strategic stages of this war of resistance. The period before the fall of Yueyang was the first stage, and after that was the second stage. In the second stage of the war, we must defeat the enemy's puppet organizations in the occupied areas, establish strong governments, and strive for full control. We must make the enemy unable to advance or retreat, and suffer the failure of Napoleon's attack on Moscow.

It is a pity not to listen to Mr. Bai's correct and important speech (Editor's note: This newspaper has already published the full text). However, the reason why I did not go to listen was because I had another appointment beforehand, which was to visit Mr. Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department, and Mr. Guo Moruo, Director of the Third Department of the Political Department. Secondly, I had to pack my luggage, so he missed the opportunity. Of course, the talks of Mr. Zhou and Mr. Guo also need to be published for reference.

A Meeting with Zhou Enlai

As everyone knows, Mr. Zhou Enlai is a meritorious official who single-handedly created the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan together. At the same time, he is also a world-renowned contemporary statesman. The reporter had visited him once before, and Mr. Ye Jianying was also present on one occasion. Unfortunately, there were too many people visiting him, so we did not have the chance to talk freely for five minutes. Of the several questions I prepared to ask him, he only answered part of the topic of "the current situation of the war of resistance."

He said: "Our current situation in the war of resistance is indeed as Chairman Chiang said: 'We have already entered the second stage.' This method of staging is viewed from a strategic point of view. In the past, the stages of the war of resistance were divided as the first stage from the beginning of the war to the fall of Nanjing, the second stage to the fall of Xuzhou, and the third stage to the fall of Wuhan. This was divided from a tactical perspective, but it is better to divide it from a strategic point of view for application. Previously, the enemy adopted a strategy of quick war and quick resolution, hoping to make us surrender in one battle, accept the alliance under the city, and embark on the road to national subjugation. However, our achievements in the war of resistance for sixteen months have shattered this strategy and political strategy of theirs completely.

"The enemy has repeatedly tried to lure our forces, concentrating dozens of divisions on one point, such as the major battles in Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Wuhan. The enemy did not hesitate to pay a heavy price and wanted to annihilate our main force. However, the result of each major battle was that because we were able to flexibly deploy strategic and tactical resources, exchange space for time, and create a foundation for long-term resistance. Not only was our main force not annihilated by it, but it was also full of vitality, flourishing, and growing rapidly. We must ensure that the frontline defense has troops to continue fighting, and at the same time, the rear can quickly step up the establishment of a new modernized national defense force, especially in the enemy's rear in the war zone, dispatching capable troops to develop large-scale guerrilla warfare. For example, in the five provinces of North China, until now, more than two-thirds of the cities are still in the hands of our troops and people. The people of Guangdong have been organized to participate in guerrilla warfare. Many traitor maintenance societies have been destroyed, many traitor leaders and puppet county chiefs have been assassinated, and many puppet army security teams have revolted. If this situation continues to develop, turning the enemy's rear into the front line and launching a full-scale general counter-offensive, wouldn't we be stepping into the door of victory?"
