### The Crisis of War and the Soviet Union

Since the successful revolution and the establishment of the 'Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,' the great nation of Russia has broken away from the old world of capitalism. Though subjected to united blockade and attacks by capitalist countries, it was eventually repelled by the young and vigorous revolutionary Red Army. They were able to devote themselves to the construction of a new world of socialist nation and the ideal of happiness, outwardly forming a state of 'isolation from the world.' In a short span of twenty-one years, they overcame all the nation's inherent poverty and hardship. They vanquished all the remnants of Imperial Russia, reactionary elements; they conquered traitors and spies on the revolutionary front, and left and right-leaning factions. They also overcame the various forms of agitation and attacks by international imperialism and fascist bandits. Furthermore, amidst continuous and arduous battles, they completed the first and second five-year plans. They eliminated the system of human oppression and exploitation of man, along with its roots. They completed the construction of a classless socialist society and smoothly began the third five-year plan to develop the national economy and realize a happy life. In these twenty-one years of arduous struggle, they created a powerful nation that has caught up with all capitalist countries, proving to the people of the old world that abandoning capitalism and imperialism and relying on the power of hardworking people can build a more solid and radically happy nation! It is particularly noteworthy that they use the weapons of fighting against nature. They have inexhaustible resources to develop. They do not need to compete for colonies or invade other countries. They only need to strive for construction in an environment of mutual peace among nations. Therefore, they firmly advocate a policy of defending world peace, opposing fascist aggression, and opposing imperialist wars that seize colonies and redistribute the world. At the same time, they adopt the liberation movement of aiding oppressed nations against wars of aggression. The Soviet Union's great success in the past twenty-one years, breaking historical precedents, has aroused the jealousy of a small number of stubborn elements and capitalist leaders. However, the Soviet Union's policy and actions of protecting peace and opposing fascist aggression are not only supported by freedom-loving and peace-loving people around the world, but also have to be trusted by all capitalist countries that demand the maintenance of democracy and peace. Therefore, whenever the international situation becomes slightly calmer, the anti-Soviet work of capitalist countries becomes active. When the world war situation is tense, the countries that demand democracy and peace cannot help but pay attention to the dynamics of the Soviet Union, and even rely on the dynamics of the Soviet Union to some extent. Therefore, at the critical moment of world war and peace, the Soviet Union has a pivotal, and even decisive, position.

Recently, Hitler brazenly destroyed the Munich Agreement he had signed, annexed Czechoslovakia with two cannons, occupied Memel with light cavalry, and seized Romania with a single agreement, creating an unprecedented crisis of European and even world war. On the one hand, it ruthlessly exposed the ugliness and scourge of the past hypocritical, cowardly, and compromising policies of democratic and peaceful countries. On the other hand, it proved the correctness and urgent need for the Soviet Union's policy of implementing a collective security system and defending peace by force. As a result, the people of the world, especially those in Britain and France who are suffering from the flames of fascism, are unanimously and enthusiastically demanding immediate union with the Soviet Union to implement the solidarity of democratic and peaceful countries. Establish a collective security system to jointly oppose and sanction fascist aggressors. Because only in this way can democratic politics be defended and world peace be maintained. The authorities of Britain, France, and the United States, in this extremely urgent situation and amidst the surging tide of anger, have also had to begin to change their attitude towards the Soviet Union. For example, Britain's recent economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, followed by negotiations for political cooperation (British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson et al. are currently in Moscow for negotiations), and the consultation among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on the German annexation of Czechoslovakia, are preliminary manifestations of the pro-Soviet policy of democratic and peaceful countries. It is particularly noteworthy that a Washington dispatch yesterday (25th) claimed that American diplomatic and commercial experts observed that Britain and France have definitely abandoned their policy of suppressing Soviet labor, giving the Four-Power Declaration to stop Hitler a greater hope of success. They also emphasized: "The strength of Soviet Russia is more than enough to stop Germany from advancing eastward. As for the position of Soviet Russia in the Far East, considering Japan's inability to cope in China, the strength of Soviet Russia is more than enough to cope with the joint attack of Japan and Germany without feeling ashamed. Even more important is that, in addition to the Siberian Railway, an important transportation line recently completed in secret, is connected to the Outer Mongolia Highway. This transportation line is extremely important for wartime transportation. Moreover, during the Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet authorities have continuously strengthened their strength in the Far East, and their momentum cannot be underestimated." Although this observation is somewhat empty, it also shows the importance that capitalist countries attach to the Soviet Union's role in determining the fate of the world today. However, this new understanding and expectation alone is not enough. Countries around the world that demand the maintenance of democracy and peace, as the threat of a new world war gradually becomes widespread and serious, should not only quickly abandon the misguided policies of suppressing the Soviet Union in the past, but also unite with the Soviet Union and all forces that support the policy of peace in the world in a practical and down-to-earth manner. Complete the great unity of democratic and peaceful countries, consolidate and expand the democratic and peaceful front, and quickly and widely launch an anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement. If the countries can quickly and resolutely implement this step, given the seriousness of the internal difficulties and crises of the fascist aggressors and the sharpness of the contradictions between them, it can be asserted that they will be able to stop the expanding and serious crisis of world war, and achieve a peaceful and reasonable resolution of all international disputes. As for China, which is striving for liberation in its heroic resistance, it should, based on this understanding, intensify the close cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, strengthen various ties with the Soviet Union, promote the consolidation and expansion of the democratic and peaceful front, and resolutely oppose all × people's poisonous schemes and Han traitors' conspiracies that are concealed by smoke screens such as 'anti-communism' and 'peace.'

### A Fervent Hope for the Guangdong Provincial Assembly

— Sun Dehua

In its declaration at the Provisional National Congress in April of last year, the Chinese Kuomintang very clearly stated: "The victory or defeat of the War of Resistance depends not only on military strength, but also on the strength of the people." Subsequently, the convocation of the National Political Council concentrated outstanding elements from across the country, with representatives from various anti-Japanese parties contributing to national affairs. Undoubtedly, since its convocation, the National Political Council has taken a significant step forward in promoting democratic politics and has also achieved considerable success. However, the needs of the War of Resistance necessitate greater progress in democratic politics in order to shoulder the current tasks and more smoothly mobilize the strength of the entire nation to overcome difficulties and strive for victory in the War of Resistance. This requires more rapid and large-scale organization and training of people from all walks of life, as well as further advancement in the organization of representative bodies and the promotion of the spirit of the National Political Council. The establishment of representative bodies at the provincial, municipal, and county levels is an urgent task.

The Second National Political Council resolved and the government decided to convene provincial, municipal, and county-level assemblies. The Third National Political Council passed several proposals to promote democratic politics. Chairman Chiang also stated in his closing remarks: "The historical mission of this council is to lay the foundation for democratic politics, to lay the foundation for permanent and genuine democratic politics." If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is, if the people cannot actively participate in political life, they cannot form a strong nation. Therefore, the most powerful and solid politics in the world must be built on the will of the people, and must take the interests and concerns of the people as its own. The convocation of provincial, municipal, and county-level assemblies is precisely in line with the interests of the Chinese nation, meets the urgent needs of the War of Resistance, and is an execution of Chairman Chiang's instruction.

Now, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly has decided to convene in early April, and the authorities have already selected some candidates. This is good news for the promotion of democratic politics during the War of Resistance, and it is something that every compatriot in Guangdong deeply anticipates, rejoices in, and enthusiastically supports.

In order for the Provincial Assembly to shoulder its great mission, for Guangdong's politics to be "built on the will of the people, and must take the interests and concerns of the people as its own," and under the leadership of the National Government and the Supreme Leader, to strengthen the close relationship between the government and the people, to mobilize the power of the masses, to overcome the difficulties in the War of Resistance, to drive the × troops out of the country, to promote the glorious tradition of the birthplace of the revolution, to recover all lost territories, and to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, the following fervent hopes are presented to the upcoming Guangdong Provincial Assembly.

First, it is hoped that the Guangdong Provincial Assembly will become a true representative body of the people's will, truly able to represent the opinions of the people throughout the province, and sincerely realize Chairman Chiang's instruction to "take the interests and concerns of the people as its own." The Provincial Assembly must inherit and promote the spirit of the National Political Council, which necessarily requires:

(1) Including representatives from various anti-Japanese parties, not only the leading Kuomintang and Communist parties in the War of Resistance, but also representatives from all anti-Japanese parties, such as the Third Party, the Youth Party, and the National Socialist Party. This is because the various anti-Japanese parties are the most politically conscious and outstanding organizations among the people of all classes, and are able to most keenly and appropriately present the interests and concerns of the people of all classes. At the same time, they can appropriately and concretely resolve them in the assembly under the premise of "nation first," concentrate their will, and work together for national liberation and victory in the War of Resistance.

(2) Including representatives and outstanding elements from various classes, vocational groups, and fields. The National Political Council has included some outstanding elements from cultural and economic groups, and outstanding elements who have a good reputation and are supported by the people in social undertakings. However, in order for the Provincial Assembly to better represent and reflect the interests and concerns of the people, it is also necessary to select representatives from workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants to work together.

(3) Absorbing as much as possible people with ability and prestige in the anti-Japanese movement, selecting as much as possible representatives of young students, and increasing as much as possible the number of women representatives. Mr. Sun Yat-sen always attached importance to the great role of young students and women in the revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen often said in his speeches that students should participate in the National Assembly, that the Republic of China is everyone's family, and that women are also masters of the family. Therefore, the Provincial Assembly must uphold Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will and select as many representatives of young students and women as possible, especially those with ability and prestige in the anti-Japanese movement. To this end, it is best to implement a certain degree of reduction in the age restriction on the qualifications of provincial assembly members, so that young outstanding members of the nation can devote themselves to the country and the nation.

(4) Increasing the number of overseas Chinese representatives as assembly members. There are a large number of overseas Chinese from Guangdong Province, especially in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the Americas, who are particularly enthusiastic about the cause of national liberation and the War of Resistance, whether in terms of spirit, material resources, manpower, or international propaganda. It is necessary to select representatives of overseas Chinese from various regions to the Provincial Assembly.

Second, it is hoped that the Provincial Assembly can become a sound general organ for reflecting the opinions of the people throughout the province. The Provincial Assembly is only an important link in the initial promotion of democratic politics, and it is only a preliminary and necessary step and institution for reflecting the opinions of the people throughout the province. Chairman Chiang said: "To achieve victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction, we must never rely solely on military strength, but must mobilize the spirit of the people and organize the people's already mobilized spirit. With the sum of the national spirit, will, and strength, we can serve as the backing for the soldiers at the front and as the driving force for development in the rear." Therefore, following the National Political Council, the convocation of the Provincial Assembly is intended to ensure that the Provincial Assembly can truly and fully reflect the opinions of the people throughout the province. To do this, we must quickly convene municipal and county assemblies, and even district and township assemblies, following the Provincial Assembly.

Third, it is hoped that a political participation movement will be launched throughout the province before the establishment of the Provincial Assembly, and that the establishment of the Provincial Assembly will be used as widespread and in-depth education and mobilization for the people's political participation movement, so that the people can fully understand the meaning of the establishment of the assembly, understand that the assembly is a representative body of their own opinions, understand what the Principle of People's Rights is, and actively provide their opinions to make the assembly's discussions and construction more substantial, and to enable the government to better understand the people's intentions and demands. At the same time, it is best for the candidates for assembly members to go deep into the people before participating in the assembly, understand the emotions and desires of the people, reflect them to the government, and it is best to do their utmost to achieve popular elections for the election of assembly members.

Guangdong is the birthplace of the revolution, the hometown of the great revolutionary Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and the holy land of the National Revolution. It should make the greatest efforts for the War of Resistance and national construction, and should play the most exemplary role in promoting democratic politics. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, Commander Zhang, and Chairman Li, and with the efforts of the compatriots throughout the province, the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly can promote the progress of democratic politics throughout the country, and at the same time, it will definitely be able to quickly determine ways to mobilize the strength of the people throughout Guangdong to strive for victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction!

### Overseas Chinese Education in the Philippines

— Jing Tong

Three years ago, several young people overseas who were willing to engage in new education work, unafraid of material difficulties and undeterred by environmental obstacles, resolutely founded Hongguang School. This may not be considered a great undertaking, but in this materialistic overseas Chinese society, without any economic support, daring to start a school can already be considered an innovation. Although they may not have the same spirit of hard work as some pioneers of life education in "Ancient Temple Living Bodhisattva" and "The Book of Life," in this rigid, conservative overseas Chinese society and corrupt educational atmosphere, they dared to loudly call for improving the long-standing abuses and harsh environment of overseas Chinese education, engaging in relentless struggle and continuous introduction.

Tao Xingzhi's theory of life education came to Southeast Asia. And under extremely difficult material conditions, they were not just talking, but doing. They were able to put it into practice and establish this new educational institution. In this school, they taught the children to use their brains and hands, to see if the principle of "laboring with the body and laboring with the mind" is correct. In the entire work, they also tried their best to apply the theory of the unity of teaching and doing. In practical action, they educated others and also educated themselves.

Around the time of the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the school had just been established for nine months. They responded to the National Education Association's National Crisis Education Program and promoted cultural propaganda for national salvation. Since the "July 7th" Incident, after the sacred national War of Resistance began, the colleagues and students of the entire school, for a long period of twenty-one months, participated in various donation activities under the condition of frugality. Whether it was purchasing national salvation bonds, donating war funds, collecting comfort items, collecting winter clothes, making first aid kits, writing comfort letters, donating to aviation construction, donating money to help refugee children, participating in charity sales, or even the recent one-dollar debt repayment campaign, they exhausted their meager strength. Many students, in addition to practicing frugality and saving their daily spending money of a few cents to carry out regular national salvation savings, also used Sundays, Saturdays (no afternoon classes), and public holidays to shine shoes for the overseas Chinese community, using the income as donations for the purchase of the "Philippine Overseas Chinese Students" airplane. Their work is still immature and lacks experience, but their enthusiasm for participating in all social national salvation work is the same as that of the children in the motherland.

However, in the overseas Chinese society where culture has always been backward, most people believe that overseas Chinese only need to contribute money for national salvation work, and other work seems unimportant. Therefore, in this environment, it is particularly difficult to promote any kind of work for the overseas Chinese community, or even cultural propaganda work for friendly countries. Because these works are not noticed by the general public. Although some of us may even think that if cultural work is done more actively, it will make the donation results better, the general society is ignoring it.

Speaking of the educational situation here, there are also such shortcomings. People who usually do not value education will not link education with the current War of Resistance work at all, and educators themselves, because they are conservative and believe that it is better to do less than to do more, although no one dares to openly oppose War of Resistance education in principle, they are confused and may as well do what they are good at, follow the old method, order class schedule two allocate work hours, ring the bell, attend class, take attendance, give lessons, dismiss class, grade papers, record scores, calculate scores, eat, sleep, and receive salary. It is easier, does not require much thought, and does not cause any trouble. If you say that he is teaching dead books, teaching books to death, what's the point of teaching books? He just lets you say it.

The reason why the culture and education of Southeast Asia are backward can mostly be said to be a problem of personnel, which cannot be solved properly.

In their school, they also felt the same difficulty. That is the lack of good teachers and the lack of guiding talents. Although there are many enthusiastic people among the colleagues, they are full of upward enthusiasm, but because they do not know how to do it, what method to use, and how to cooperate with the current environment, many jobs cannot be done. For example, if you want to implement the War of Resistance education curriculum in overseas Chinese schools, first, there are no suitable textbooks and teaching materials, second, there is not enough teaching time (this is related to the unreasonable dual school system that emphasizes both Chinese and English here), and third, because human and material resources are quite scarce, War of Resistance teaching materials cannot be widely collected, and after they are collected, they cannot be systematically compiled and distributed. The cost of living is high here, and printing materials are expensive. It is naturally impossible for a school with weak strength to compile and print its own textbooks alone; fourth, they do not have sufficient confidence themselves. To promote War of Resistance education, you must first abolish the current unreasonable school system, otherwise it will not work at all. To fundamentally transform the education system here, it will inevitably be opposed by some people who are unwilling to transform. Although they are not afraid of being regarded as heretics, or of being hungry, but because they want to promote War of Resistance education and transform the education system here, they are taken by people who are unwilling to reform as an excuse to "destroy the unity of overseas Chinese" or destroy the united front of national resistance against Japan, it would be too unjust and not worth it. To avoid friction and misunderstanding, they have thought about this problem for a long time. This is because the general public does not have a deep understanding of War of Resistance education, does not have a full understanding of the unreasonable school system here in the past, and does not have a belief in changing the original system. Perhaps these are the reasons why their work in the past three years has not been enough. The situation here is somewhat similar to the example cited by Tao Xingzhi in a recent speech in Hong Kong on "Total War of Resistance and Total Education": "I told him to implement War of Resistance education, and he said that he had not received War of Resistance education before. I told him to let others do it, but he was unwilling," (the general idea seems to be like this, because I don't have the original text and can't remember it all.) This can be used as a portrayal of education here. However, on the other hand, I am not saying that overseas Chinese education in Qing has no future or is completely impossible to transform. After all, it is not a question of subjective strength, but a question of people. If we can strengthen our subjective strength, we can currently use a gradual approach to promote this movement through efforts in all aspects under the great premise of the War of Resistance and national salvation.

To achieve this, we must earnestly hope that the pioneers in the education circles of the motherland and the colleagues who are currently engaged in education work in the war zone and the rear will constantly give us strong assistance and correct and more concrete guidance so that we can carry out the current work.

In the past, because of the lack of teachers and the unsound guiding mechanism, although they have been working continuously for three years, the work has not been very successful. Here, they once tried the "little teacher" system, but because the students' work was immature, it was not easy to find work objects, and there were often laughing stories of little teachers not finding students. At the same time, because of time constraints, colleagues and students are entangled in daily affairs, and cannot spare extra time to imitate this work (all other extracurricular work is similar). The colleagues who guide this work lack work interest, so there are too many difficulties encountered by the "little teacher", and the big teacher has no way to solve them, resulting in the work being unable to stop. However, they always believe that their understanding is correct, and the failure of the work does not discourage them. At the same time, they understand that if the unreasonable school system here is not improved, and the educational environment is not properly transformed, all work cannot be promoted. Therefore, they are now concentrating their strength to think about how to transform their environment and how to improve the current unreasonable education system.

In order to make the overseas Chinese community have a deeper understanding of War of Resistance education, and to enable educators themselves to increase their determination to transform our environment, they have requested the two groups of the Education Association and the Cultural Circle National Salvation Association here to host a summer War of Resistance education lecture for overseas Chinese teachers and staff. The time is limited to two months for four people (the summer season here starts from the end of March to the beginning of June, two months at the beginning and end), and the group jointly invited Mr. Tao Xingzhi to give lectures in the Philippines to guide them on how to carry out War of Resistance education work. It is believed that if the staff can realize this work, it will not only be a ray of dawn for the future of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines, but also increase a new force for the work of War of Resistance and national salvation of overseas Chinese in the Philippines.

### How Japan is Destroying North China's Finances

[Shanghai Correspondence] Our city's foreign dispatches: The mainland newspaper reports that it has been a week since North China nominally abolished Chinese legal tender (fapi) and implemented a partial controlled export of foreign exchange. Judging from all the news coming from North China, these measures have encountered the same results as similar developments in the past. On the monetary front, the ban on fapi has clearly failed. Not only has fapi not depreciated or disappeared from the market, but its premium for exchanging for puppet regime currency in Beiping has continued to increase this week. In other respects, this new method of striking at Western commerce in North China has been temporarily successful. European and American export trade at the ports of Bohai and Qingdao has temporarily come to a standstill. The Japanese puppet authorities even forbid Western firms from fulfilling prior agreements in violation of the new control system. According to a Reuters dispatch from Otsu, this new economic measure in North China is backed by the Japanese military. Japanese soldiers search Chinese and foreign individuals for fapi at the entrance to the former German concession. This is a rude action by the barbaric military, completely violating the treaty rights enjoyed by Westerners. Consular jurisdiction should protect foreign property not only in law but also in fact. Whether the Japanese side likes it or not, the Chinese currency is also part of foreign property. Many Western merchants in China deeply regret that their governments have not confronted the Japanese military in North China. Most of them want to know what would happen if Western troops protected foreign cargo for export on foreign ships outside Tianjin, regardless of the orders of the Beiping puppet regime, and foreign gunboats escorted them. Of course, the whole matter is not yet over. The British House of Commons has issued sharp words and, along with the United States, has lodged a formal protest with the Tokyo government. According to Japanese press reports, the Japanese side will not pay attention to these protests. Furthermore, constitutional countries will not remain silent when their protests are rejected, and they are expected to take some form of retaliation. However, it is generally hoped that retaliation will not be directed at North China itself, as this would harm foreign interests in the area and could be indirectly manipulated by the Japanese. Therefore, retaliation must be directed directly at Japan. The new measures in North China are being implemented by the Japanese side, and Western countries must make the Japanese feel that these measures are reckless and destructive. Whether or not the Japanese puppet economic and monetary legislation in North China will ultimately succeed depends not only on the attitude of Western countries but also largely on the Chinese people. The Chinese people in the cities of North China controlled by the Japanese military do not use direct methods of force but continue to offer passive resistance through non-cooperation, making the Japanese efforts ineffective. If the Chinese side cooperates, the premium for exchanging fapi for puppet regime currency would not increase. If the Chinese continue to be consistently firm, the special institutions of the Chinese banking industry and its numerous exchange shops can be used to continue to destroy the Beiping puppet regime currency. A friend who recently returned to Shanghai from North China repeatedly urged reporters to pay attention to the price issue. He emphatically stated that the Japanese promotion and implementation of the currency measures has clearly overlooked the seriousness of the price equalization issue. It must be understood that the price of one yuan of composite currency equivalent to two shillings and two pence must be greatly reduced. In short, the foreign exchange rate currently posted by the Beiping puppet bank is about 60% higher than it should be. The Japanese hope that they will be able to lower the price and equalize it, but there is no sign of price reduction; on the contrary, it continues to rise. Even in Beiping itself, the puppet authorities have enacted numerous official price regulations, but they cannot stop the continued rise in prices. At the beginning of this week, the price of Saigon rice in Beiping jumped to an average of 25.5 yuan per bag. The prices of North China export products have also increased sharply in proportion to the expansion of currency circulation. The prices of various imported goods have also increased, as the new currency measures create new obstacles to imports and make the shortage of imported goods even more severe. The Beiping puppet bank announced the sale of foreign exchange to pay for imported goods, but no foreign merchant has sought to buy foreign exchange from it for private transactions. The puppet bank also established a so-called list of imported goods with priority, giving priority in foreign exchange supply to the goods on the list and then handling foreign exchange for other goods. The majority of the items listed are Japanese military supplies. In this situation, the first week after the implementation of the new measures in North China did not inspire confidence. This move failed to solve the major economic and financial problems; instead, it made these problems even more unstable than before.

(2) All members, in addition to earnestly practicing themselves, will discuss in detail in small group meetings how to promote and apply these principles to the general public. (3) To persuade schools, factories, businesses, and the general public to organize National Spiritual Mobilization monthly meetings, swear the National Covenant oath, and provide regular guidance. Furthermore, in order to actively promote and create a trend, the alliance will hold a National Spiritual Mobilization Youth Action Week on the "March 18" anniversary to begin the spiritual mobilization. The alliance's enthusiasm for the country is truly commendable and worthy of emulation by other organizations.

### Unprecedented Fierce Battle in Northwest Nanchang; Extremely Heavy Casualties, Reinforcements Being Continuously Deployed; Our Counterattacking Troops Advance Beyond De'an

[Special Dispatch from Guilin, This Newspaper, 26th] Northern Jiangxi is now the center of a major battle. The invading enemy troops are mostly elite forces drawn from various locations, and there are also newly added reinforcements, so the battle situation is fierce and unprecedented since the second phase of the War of Resistance. The enemy launched a general offensive against us starting on the 20th. Their main force crossed the river between Yongxiu and Qiujin and later encountered a severe blow from us in the Daijiashan, Mantoushan, and Fozushan areas, with over a thousand casualties. On the 23rd, the enemy cavalry invaded Anyi and reached near Fengxin. Later, we fought a bloody battle with the enemy east of Wanjiabu and northeast of Lehua Xinxing. On the 24th, fierce fighting also broke out on both sides of Wanjiabu and continued through the 25th. Enemy troops who landed on the west bank of Poyang Lake and advanced toward us were annihilated by us at Shizishan, with over 300 killed and three enemy ships sunk in the lake, along with eight others destroyed. There have been several days of bloody battles near Wucheng and Tujiapu. The enemy launched three fierce attacks on Wucheng and bombarded it heavily with aircraft. Wucheng has become a scorched earth. Enemy troops crossing the river south of Jinpu between Xi and Wuning in the west fought a bloody battle with us in Caijiashan, Huangtuling, Luopanshan, and other places. After being severely attacked by us, they suffered heavy casualties. As of the 25th, they were still engaged in a bloody battle in Yangzhou Street, Luoping area.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 26th] All battlefields are quiet, except for the major battle still raging in northern Jiangxi.

Our troops are still engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy north of Wanjiabu, Lehua Street, and Qiandian Street (18 kilometers northwest of Nanchang). Currently, northern Nanchang Gao'an, up to Fengxin Anyi, is entirely under our control. Our counterattacking troops are advancing rapidly.

### Maintaining Our Country's Debt Creditworthiness - Minister of Finance Kung Issues Statement - Customs and Salt Taxes Guarantee Various Public Debts - Government is Exerting Efforts to Maintain

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Minister of Finance Kung formally issued a statement today, stating that regarding debts secured by customs and salt taxes, the government has begun negotiations with relevant parties. Before the negotiations are completed, public debts guaranteed by customs and salt taxes should be implemented in accordance with the announcement of January 15th. The same treatment should be given to public debt measures secured by customs duties. (Note: On January 15th of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that because of the arbitrary detention of customs duties by a certain military unit, the Chinese government would designate special funds at the Central Bank for repayment and interest payment. This special fund has now been allocated as announced.) However, for British and French loans, because the personnel who handled them in advance had already allocated funds from the Ministry of Finance sufficient for payment, the portion due on April 15th will still be paid on time. As for the Crisp Loan, the government has also designated funds from salt tax revenues to repay the principal and interest due to bondholders on March 30th. In general, the Chinese government, in order to fulfill its debts and safeguard the interests of bondholders, despite facing unprecedented difficulties due to Japan's invasion, is still extremely concerned about maintaining its creditworthiness. The current measures taken for various public debts secured by customs and salt taxes are temporary measures that have to be adopted due to environmental circumstances. The government absolutely does not want this to be the case and will definitely find a suitable and practical solution under the principle of adapting to the current long-term war of resistance and stabilizing China's financial and economic situation, in order to maintain China's creditworthiness.

### Japanese Politicians Dream - Of Resisting Britain and France - Joint Petition to Prime Minister Hiranuma - To Conclude Military Alliance with Germany and Italy

[Reuters, Tokyo, 25th] Representatives of four minor Japanese parties have jointly petitioned the Japanese Prime Minister, arguing that the Japanese government should immediately form a military alliance with Germany and Italy to resist Britain and France. The petition states that the goal of Japan's "holy war" against China is being obstructed by Britain.

[Tokyo, 25th] External news reports that Japanese statesman Saionji advised the Japanese government not to enter into a military alliance with Germany and Italy, saying that it was not because Japan did not sympathize with the goals of Germany and Italy, but because "Japan does not dare to join the losing side of the world struggle."

### Remodeling Inferior Goods - Massive Shipments to the Philippines - Philippine Officials and Merchants Seek Effective Resistance - Special Commissioners Dispatched to Hong Kong for Investigation

[Local News] Because its invasion of China cannot be sustained for long, and to attempt to salvage its economic collapse, [Japan] has had to intensify its policy of economic plunder, underselling and seizing markets. As a result, in recent months, the Hong Kong market has seen a surge in Japanese goods, jumping from a monthly low of 600,000-700,000 yuan to over 700,000 yuan. The number of Japanese goods going to British, French, and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia, as well as the American possessions of the Philippines and Tianjin, is even more alarming. Among them, the Philippines has the largest market for Japanese goods, and most of the goods being dumped into the Philippines are remodeled in Hong Kong before shipment. Two years ago, the Philippine authorities ordered customs to earnestly prevent the transit of these remodeled Japanese goods, and the diplomatic authorities protested to Japan, but to no avail.

Investigations reveal that the remodeling of Japanese goods in Hong Kong for shipment to the Philippines is continuing. Evolving to the present day, in order to adapt to the strategy of underselling and seizing markets, the practice is gradually intensifying. The Philippine commodity market is under great pressure, and local industries are directly hit hard. Both the American and Philippine authorities cannot but pay more attention. Because Japanese actions have shattered the Gentlemen's Agreement between America and Japan, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to effectively respond. According to sources from a certain Chinese trading house in Hong Kong, it is estimated that the total value of Japanese goods remodeled and shipped to the Philippines via Hong Kong each month is approximately 200,000-300,000 yuan, both overtly and covertly. Generally, after Japanese goods pass through Hong Kong, they are forwarded to the Philippines through certain Hong Kong trading houses and foreign firms, or secretly shipped via various routes. It is estimated that in the past six months, the amount of these remodeled Japanese goods being shipped to the Philippines has been increasing daily.

Under these circumstances, American goods are being crowded out in the Philippine market, and the development of Philippine industry is dealt a fatal blow. Therefore, the American and Philippine authorities are currently considering taking strong measures to protect the Philippine commodity market and the development of local large and small industries. In addition to the Philippine customs conducting serious and strict inspections of imported goods, they also want to obtain information from Hong Kong about the remodeling and shipment of goods to the Philippines in order to formulate effective response strategies. Recently, two special commissioners have been dispatched to Hong Kong by the Philippine authorities to undertake this investigation. After arriving in Hong Kong, the two commissioners have been conducting investigations with relevant parties and are expected to leave Hong Kong and return to the Philippines in the near future to report their findings.

### Evolution of Political Work

- Zhang Fakui, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Area

And the Qualities Political Workers Should Possess

- Instructions to the Fifth Political Work Brigade of the Political Department -

Your Brigade, due to the needs of the work, will soon be assigned to the front lines. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all health and success. The opinions I want to offer you today are what I, standing in the position of a representative commander, expect from all of you political instructors. I hope you will pay special attention and earnestly implement them!

Before formally offering my opinions, I would like to systematically review the role that political workers have played in the process of the National Revolution in the past, in order to illustrate the importance of political work and the position and efforts that political workers should have in the National Revolution.

First, we must ask, why before the Northern Expedition, could the Three Principles of the People not gain the belief and protection of the broad masses of the people? Why could the National Revolution not be rapidly promoted and successful? Why in the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], were we able to overthrow the Northern Warlords in a very short period and completely unify the North and South? The crux of the matter is that before the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], our headquarters failed to pay the greatest attention to the establishment and promotion of political work in the army and among the people.

In view of this, the Premier ordered the leader to establish the Whampoa Military Academy, to intensify the training of military and political cadres to shoulder this arduous task. In the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], during the Northern Expedition, I served as a division commander. I personally witnessed the vigorous activity of political workers in the army and among the people. In a short period of time, they were able to change the traditional warlord thinking in the army into the revolutionary thinking of the Three Principles of the People, and transform the scattered, fatalistic people into an organized and united, heroic and fighting people. They transformed the phenomenon of opposition between the army and the people into a phenomenon of close cooperation between the army and the people. Under these circumstances, the Northern Expeditionary Army was able to advance victoriously without hindrance. This was a great success of political work, and this period was also the most smooth and prestigious period for political workers.

Unfortunately, since then, political work has been rejected, and the position of political workers has plummeted. The political training office has become nothing more than a decorative ornament in the troops. The officers in charge of the troops did not understand the importance of political work and adopted an arrogant or contemptuous attitude towards the political workers, and the political workers only looked to the officers in charge for guidance, not daring to say anything. Even army-people joint events were not dared to be held, let alone political education and guidance for officers and soldiers. Therefore, since the outbreak of the "August 13th" War of Resistance [Battle of Shanghai, 1937], all weaknesses have been fully exposed, which affected the initial military setbacks of the War of Resistance. This simple army and government's war of resistance is a concrete manifestation of the slackening of political work, and this period is also the most difficult and painful period for political workers.

Due to the attention of the supreme leader and Minister Chen, and the military and political leaders of various war zones, and in view of the fact that the difficulties in the initial stages of the war were not due to inferior equipment, but to insufficient political mobilization, in order to advance political and military affairs simultaneously and strive for final victory, the central government finally formally established the Political Department on August 1st of last year [1938], re-establishing political training work in the troops and among the people. At the same time, the position and prestige of political workers gradually increased with the improvement of the entire political situation. This period is a period of revival for political work.

War is a continuation of politics. Especially in the Sino-Japanese War, we must pay more attention to political mobilization and improvement to compensate for our military deficiencies. Therefore, the leader clearly instructed us at the Hengshan Conference: "Politics is more important than military affairs," and this is the reason.

Now that you are also being assigned to the front lines, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the necessary qualifications that I hope political workers will possess. I believe that the qualifications that a political worker must possess are as important as the qualifications that a military worker must possess. A military worker must know how to lead troops, train troops, and use troops to be worthy of being a commander; and a political worker must also possess the necessary qualifications to be worthy of being a political worker.

What are the necessary qualifications for a political worker?

First, you must have a great personality and noble morality. This means that your life must be serious, your behavior must be upright, your beliefs must be determined, you must value integrity, be ashamed of wrongdoing, be brave in the face of righteousness, not be intimidated by difficulties, not yield to violence, not be swayed by greed, and be responsible for your work. You must be tolerant to your comrades, be strict with yourself, lenient with others, have no competition for power, and have no sectarian views. Only in this way can you gain the trust of officers, soldiers, and the people, and be worthy of being a role model for officers, soldiers, and the people.

Second, you must have a spirit of hard work, endurance, and courageous sacrifice. This means that you must go deep into the lower levels, truly share the joys and sorrows with the soldiers, and integrate with the people. You must train the troops, educate, and organize the people in a down-to-earth manner. You receive less pay than others, but you must endure more hardships and do more work than others. You are not afraid of difficulties, and you do not succumb to difficulties. On the contrary, you should use greater perseverance and more methods to deal with difficulties and overcome difficulties. You must always stand at the forefront of the struggle, be determined to succeed or die, and never hesitate or waver. Only in this way can you influence others, inspire others, and motivate others to move forward.

Third, you must have a kind and approachable attitude. Because the cultural level of Chinese soldiers and the people is very low, to make them accept your training and leadership, you must first have a very sincere attitude to accept them, help them solve difficulties, and patiently carry out persuasion, education, and guidance, so that they feel that you are as kind as their own family members. Only in this way can your work be effective.

Fourth, you must be able to earnestly abide by and promote all wartime laws and regulations of the government. This means that political workers must fully understand all wartime laws and regulations issued by the government, such as the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction, the Regulations on Conscription of Strong Laborers, and the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers of the War of Resistance, and must carry out and promote work based on the government's wartime laws and regulations. Because if we violate the government's laws and regulations, it will inevitably cause friction and reduce our own strength to resist the invasion. If we are perfunctory and neglectful, and fail to earnestly supervise the implementation, then the so-called mobilization of the people is just empty talk.

Fifth, you must be able to meet military requirements. Because most political workers are intellectuals with a strong tendency towards romanticism, liberalism, and individualism, but you have all received military training, and I think you can all abide by military requirements. However, what we mean by militarization here is not just neat clothing and attention to etiquette, but also a spirit of vigor, unity of will, simple and collective life, and swift and decisive work. Only in this way can you improve the efficiency of your work and adapt to the needs of wartime.

Sixth, you must have high scholarship and rich experience. This means that you must pay attention to the issue of self-training. On the one hand, you must continuously learn in practical work, encourage each other, review each other, and criticize each other. On the other hand, you must explore, research, and help each other in the Three Principles of the People, the Premier's instructions, the leader's speeches on the War of Resistance, and other valuable books and newspapers. In this way, you can enrich yourselves and strengthen yourselves. I believe that the best national salvation worker should possess various skills. He is not only a propagandist, but also a theorist, organizer, and practitioner. In the past, political workers were rejected and ridiculed as peddlers of panaceas because they only engaged in empty talk and did not attend to practical matters. Now you should pay special attention to your own cultivation and training, and show people your true skills and real goods. You must make sure that your panacea is not a fake panacea, but a real medicine that can cure diseases and be effective. In this way, people will naturally trust you, welcome you, respect you, and wash away the slander, ridicule, and all the bad phenomena of the past regarding political workers.

Brothers, my knowledge of political affairs is very shallow, but before you leave, I want to share some of my past experiences and insights with you, hoping that everyone can do your best based on what I have said. I believe that everyone will have even more brilliant and glorious achievements in the second phase of the War of Resistance. (Special article from the National Salvation Society)

### Tensions Rise Between Poland and Germany: Clashes Near Teschen, Poland Reinforces Border Defenses and Conducts Air Defense Exercises

【Warsaw, 25th】Foreign Dispatch: The Polish government, considering that the country is surrounded by Germany and German residents in the Polish Corridor are secretly carrying out armaments, will decide on the course of action to be taken within 24 hours. Polish President Mościcki has convened an important meeting of the cabinet and military leaders to make important decisions. General Rydz-Śmigły, the current Inspector General of the Polish Army, has had lengthy discussions with staff officers, and it is expected that military considerations will play a significant role in the discussions.

【Reuters, Warsaw, 25th】Polish troops guarding the border with Germany are currently being reinforced. Air defense exercises are being held in various parts of Poland, and patriotic propaganda is very enthusiastic.

【London, 25th】Foreign Dispatch: A "Times" correspondent in Warsaw reports that Poland is still unwilling to join the anti-German bloc proposed by Britain, but is prepared to join a union based on genuine collective security. The people of Poland are currently shaken. In the town of Teschen (which Poland seized from Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement), clashes have occurred between Poles and Germans. Approximately 800 German troops arrived near Teschen but retreated after being confronted by Polish regular troops. The Daily Telegraph reports that Poland has the capacity to mobilize four million people nationwide and is currently planning to mobilize one million.

【Reuters, Warsaw, 25th】Over the past three days, there have been repeated reports of clashes between Polish and German troops in the vicinity of Pukemin, on the border between Slovakia and Poland. However, these reports have not yet been confirmed. It is rumored that German troops retreated after fierce fighting with Polish border guards, and it is expected that this will not lead to serious consequences.

【Reuters, Warsaw, 25th】Today, the Polish army's official newspaper published an article stating, "We are prepared to fight any strong × people. We intend to sort out all matters clearly. Poland is in no way inferior to any great power. As for the number of × people divisions, their technical equipment, and their exaggerated claims, the Polish people have no fear whatsoever. On the contrary, our military strength, the technical equipment of our army, and the fighting spirit of our entire nation are sufficient to guarantee a solid victory. We are certain that the bayonets of the Polish army will secure victory, therefore we are arrayed and waiting."

【Central News Agency, Berlin, 26th】The Foreign Communications newspaper recently published an officially authorized article stating that a strong Poland is an indispensable force for maintaining order in Eastern Europe, and there is a political need for this. Germany has no intention of aggression against Poland.

Four-Power Declaration Seems to Have Faded, Soviet and French Advocate a Hard Line Against Germany

【Reuters, London, 26th】A diplomatic correspondent for the "Observer" recently stated, "The originally planned Four-Power Declaration has now faded away because Poland has no intention of participating in this demonstration of action to deal with German aggression, as the purpose of this demonstration can only be achieved through an international conference. On the other hand, the Soviet Union suggests that when Germany invades or poses a threat, it should be met immediately with fully cooperative military action. This point is also difficult for Poland to agree to, because Poland maintains a neutral stance between Germany and the Soviet Union as a principle, which remains unchanged. Therefore, it does not welcome Soviet troops entering Poland, regardless of their mission. It is believed that the French government is not particularly upset about the failure of this Four-Power Declaration plan, and is instead focused on the belief that the British and French governments should quickly concentrate their efforts to cooperate in preventing German westward aggression. As for the Soviet government, setting aside the situation in the Far East, it believes that only close cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, taking military action against Germany, can stop German aggression. Soviet sources explained that this military cooperation should apply to both German eastward and westward aggression, and its scope should include countries in both eastern and western Europe, with the aim, as the British see it, of at least immediately declaring war on Germany and using the British fleet to blockade Germany."

【London, 25th】Foreign Dispatch: Discussions among interested countries regarding a joint guarantee declaration are still progressing. The visit of the French President and Foreign Minister Bonnet to London has resulted in satisfaction on both the British and French sides. These two countries are now engaged in discussing more practical new methods. The Soviet Ambassador has visited the Foreign Office several times in the past few days. Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczyński, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax last night, reiterating Poland's position. Hudson will return to England next week, bringing with him what he has learned in Warsaw and Moscow regarding the European situation, for the Polish Foreign Minister Beck to consider when he discusses matters with England on April 4.

【Central News Agency, London, 25th】Foreign Secretary Halifax has decided to remain in London this weekend to observe the development of the European situation. Prime Minister Chamberlain, who was resting in Chequers, is expected to return here tomorrow evening.

【Reuters, Paris, 15th】Today, "Le Figaro" stated that in view of Germany's insatiable aggression, Poland, in order to devise countermeasures, should "consider itself the protector of Eastern Europe." The press here welcomes the establishment of a peace front, but believes that stronger and more agile actions must be taken. "L'Ordre" stated that only a policy of confrontation can separate Italy from the "Axis." The Communist Party's newspaper stated, "In order to prevent sudden aggression, peace-loving democratic countries must arm themselves in addition to diplomatic notes."

Small Countries Uneasy, British and French Military Cooperation, French Foreign Minister Expresses Optimism

【Central News Agency, Paris, 26th】Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Daladier yesterday to report on his visit to England, expressing a very optimistic attitude, stating that British Prime Minister Chamberlain still believes that Poland can participate in the joint declaration on jointly defending Romania to issue a warning to Hitler. Britain has decided to implement a conscription system similar to military service in the short term. As a result of the London talks, both parties have agreed that if either Britain or France is invaded anywhere, the naval, land, and air forces of both countries can immediately act in concert.

【Central News Agency, Paris, 25th】Political figures here recently stated that the difficulties encountered in forming an international front against German aggression have been due to the British government's hesitation in implementing a conscription system. When President Lebrun visits Britain, British and French cabinet members will take the opportunity to hold talks. The results of these talks show that the British authorities have a more progressive view on the implementation of a conscription system. British cabinet members have provided assurances to the French authorities, stating that preparatory measures will be taken in the short term. It is not yet known whether these preparatory measures refer to a genuine conscription system. Therefore, it is questionable whether small countries can rest easy and provide guarantees. The country has already rejected this, and is also unwilling to participate in the formation of a joint front between Britain and France for the same reason. Switzerland has a similar attitude. As for Latvia, it is also unwilling to incur Germany's displeasure by appearing to encourage anti-German movements. However, although small countries are reluctant to participate in international actions, they are in fact feeling uneasy and are taking appropriate military measures separately, and have decided to defend their independence and sovereignty when necessary. Based on this, if Britain can implement a conscription system and provide direct military guarantees to these small countries, the current situation will definitely change completely. It is hoped that the British government, on the one hand, can improve relations with the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, can guide its own parliament to pass a conscription law, which will greatly contribute to maintaining peace in Europe.

【Reuters, Budapest, 25th】Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky issued a statement yesterday, urging Romania not to misunderstand the purpose of Hungarian military activities on the Hungarian-Romanian border. Csáky said that Yugoslavia's attitude towards recent events was very correct, but Romania had failed to show the same attitude, so he had to inform the Romanian authorities that, under any circumstances, Hungary would definitely occupy Ruthenia. Although Hungarian troops have been active on the border, they have no intentions towards Romania. However, if Romania does not understand and resorts to coercion, war will inevitably result. Csáky also stated affirmatively, "Romania has expressed surprise at our occupation of Little Russia and insists that a corner of the east belongs to them and is not willing to let us have it. We can hardly agree." Hungary is prepared to hold talks with Romania, but Romania must first restore its original state.

### Italian Prime Minister's Speech to Address Demands on France, Hitler and Göring Express Support for Italy

【Central News Agency, Rome, 26th】According to authoritative sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech today will address Italy's demands on France and the Spanish war. At the same time, the Italian Prime Minister intends to defend the policy of a totalitarian state in response to the recent speeches by French Prime Minister Daladier in the Chamber of Deputies. As for Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Memel, Italy will indirectly defend it, and the various trends of democratic countries confronting totalitarian states will be condemned. According to senior officials of the Fascist Party, if the Italian Prime Minister mentions the demands on France, it will definitely not be in a provocative manner.

【Associated Press, Berlin, 26th】On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Italian Fascist Party, Hitler sent a telegram to Mussolini, stating that Germany is willing to work hand in hand with Italy, helping each other and standing watch. It is a pity for the outside world's misunderstandings and hostile attitudes, but for the sake of their own interests, the two countries do not need to pay attention to the outside world's rumors. It is also understood that it is rumored that Germany has a "large part of satisfaction" in its own demands because of the recent acquisition of vast lands and other economic benefits in the Czech Republic and other places. Therefore, it is not as enthusiastic about the German-Italian axis as before. However, according to sources in Berlin, the German authorities are sincerely afraid that this kind of rumor will harm the good friendship between the two countries, so they have notified the Italian authorities that the close ties of the German-Italian axis are as close as before.

【Associated Press, Rome, 26th】Göring published an article in the Messaggero newspaper yesterday, guaranteeing that Germany is determined to work closely with Italy at all costs. The unity of the German-Italian axis remains extremely solid. Göring also quoted the English proverb "Barking dogs seldom bite" to attack Britain. Göring's remarks have attracted general attention, and it is believed that the rumors of the weakening of the German-Italian axis after the German annexation of the Czech Republic are incredible, and that Mussolini will satisfy his desires to France without spending a single soldier or a single weapon.

【Haitong News Agency, Rome, 26th】Both Rome and Paris denied foreign newspaper reports that the relations between France and Italy were being smoothed by the dispatch of personnel from the French side. According to French sources, Lagardelle has a good impression of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but has not met with the Italian Prime Minister for two years.

### Death of British Veteran Politician

【Haitong News Agency, London, 16th】British Member of the House of Lords, Earl Sanderson, passed away yesterday afternoon at the age of seventy. The Earl was the only blind Member of Parliament and was highly regarded in British political circles. He was greatly supported when MacDonald, the leader of the Labour Party, formed his second cabinet in 1930. He was granted noble title in the same year. In March 1938, he withdrew from the Labour Party because he believed that the Labour Party's policies affected peace. He authored many books and enjoyed a reputation as an economic expert.

### American People Demand Construction of Air-Raid Shelters

【Reuters, Washington, 25th】The US Army Department announced today that the American people are now demanding that the government build air-raid shelters. The European crisis in September of last year and the recent tension in Central Europe have intensified this demand. Among them, some have requested instructions on building air-raid shelters similar to those in Europe. Some requests come from as far away as Arkansas. Military engineers said that there is no reason for the American people to fear air raids as the British and French people do. Even if the United States is involved in the war, it will not be subjected to air raids. However, in view of the increasing range of aircraft, the government is also planning to build air-raid shelters and so on to protect the people.

Short Comments

### Improving the Lives of Female Workers

Yesterday, local newspapers reported that the Labor Group of the YWCA has been working hard to improve the lives of female workers since its establishment, such as establishing schools, organizing friendship groups, and establishing labor centers, etc. It can be said that it has done its best to improve the moral, intellectual, physical, and communal aspects and the actual lives of female workers.

The hardships of the lives of working-class compatriots are of course not unique to Hong Kong, and the plight of female workers is even more unimaginable by the general middle class and above. How to improve the lives of female workers is certainly not a simple problem, and the so-called improvement is not a thorough solution. However, if everyone can pay attention to this problem and everyone is enthusiastic about finding ways to improve it, it will not only help female workers but also benefit society. Therefore, the work of the YWCA Labor Group should arouse attention. We hope that this improvement work can be extended to all walks of life and that the improvement situation will be published at any time. At the same time, we hope that those engaged in improvement work will use Christ's sacrificial heart of saving the world and firm belief to promote and persuade hard, so that the factory owners will improve the treatment of female workers, at least to obtain the guarantee of food, clothing, warmth, and health, to obtain the right to read, learn about national affairs, and participate in community activities.

### Congratulating the First Anniversary of the Writers' Association

Today is the first anniversary of the establishment of the China National Association of Literary and Art Circles. Wuhan, the location of the founding conference last year, has now fallen under the iron hooves of the × people, which is something that no Chinese literary and art worker can fail to feel. However, the National Association of Literary and Art Circles is an organization established by Chinese literary and art workers in the common demand of resisting the Japanese and building the nation in the midst of the × people's artillery fire. At this time when the War of Resistance has entered an emergency phase and the success of the revolution is still very far away, the tasks of this organization and all its members are also particularly arduous. Therefore, we cannot but expect it to progress, and we cannot but expect literary and art workers across the country to take the Writers' Association as the center, consolidate unity, concentrate their efforts, and serve the War of Resistance and national construction.

The members of the Writers' Association who are staying in Hong Kong have established the Hong Kong Liaison Office yesterday. Given Hong Kong's current cultural status and its significant impact on domestic and international culture, we cannot but be pleased with its establishment, and we cannot but hope that it will make greater efforts to reconcile the relationship between literary and art workers in Hong Kong, transport international literary and art works, contact international literary and art writers, treat domestic and foreign writers with hospitality, and transmit domestic and foreign literary and art information, etc., in order to fulfill its task as a "literary and art transportation station."

### The Future Trend of British Far East Policy?

— Translated by Shi Chang

Idealists of a purely idealistic persuasion have been deeply perplexed and confused by the intricate and complex trends in British policy in recent years. Britain's recognition of Italy's conquest of Abyssinia; British Prime Minister Chamberlain's compromise with Hitler, partitioning Czechoslovakia; and most recently, the British recognition of Franco's government in Spain, have all shocked them.

Observers of the Far East situation have expressed sympathy for China's heroic resistance against aggression. Britain also sympathizes with China's resistance, yet it seems to maintain a cautious distance, as if tacitly permitting Japan to ravage large swathes of Chinese territory. How can this be explained?

When material interests determine policy, indifference is merely a superficial disguise. In reality, it still follows the direction of self-interest. The future development of British Far East policy is likely to be shocking. Those who wish to avoid such shocks, especially the Chinese people, should remember Lord Palmerston's maxim: Britain has no permanent ideals, only permanent interests.

Britain recognized Italy's conquest of Abyssinia because it wanted to discuss with Mussolini safeguarding British interests. Mussolini's military actions threatened Britain's huge cotton industry interests in Sudan. Lake Tana in Abyssinia is the source of the Nile River, which is the lifeblood of Britain's cotton industry in Sudan. Without water, there would be no cotton. Therefore, Britain compromised with Mussolini and recognized Italy's aggression, because this was far better than entering a war unprepared.

The partitioning of Czechoslovakia was the same: because, if it had not been done that way, Britain might have been drawn into a European war. But Britain was not prepared for war, it could not fight!

The Spanish issue was more complicated. Britain certainly hoped that Spain would establish a democratic government and maintain friendly relations with Britain. However, since the collapse of the Spanish monarchy in April 1931, it has been clear that the Spanish Civil War was not a conflict between democracy and fascism, but a struggle between fascism and social revolution. Britain preferred Spain to be fascist rather than a successful social revolution, because, although fascism would damage British interests on the Iberian Peninsula, a successful social revolution would completely destroy British interests there.

Britain's policy of non-intervention only benefited Franco, shocking the general public. Did democratic Britain really want to aid Franco? Yes, this is an undeniable fact. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain saw that Franco was about to achieve final victory, he recognized the new fascist government. Did he have a special fondness for Franco? No, all of Britain's actions followed its own interests. Spain, in any case, would become a third-rate country subordinate to others. If Britain did not recognize Franco's regime, Hitler and Mussolini would use Franco, under the guise of restoring Spain, to begin building a new Spain and developing their own power. Therefore, Chamberlain's reputation as a realist is not without reason.

Will Chamberlain's "realism" produce a Munich in the Far East? This question is difficult to predict. Some fear that the British government's realistic means will be repeated in the Far East. However, on January 15 of this year, the British government sent a note to Japan, no longer remaining silent on Japan's "New Order in East Asia" plan, and at the same time, providing substantial aid to China with a large loan.

Britain once strongly condemned Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, even adopting economic sanctions against Italy. When Czechoslovakia's independence was threatened, Britain was the first to respond. When Franco's air force bombed undefended cities of the Spanish Republican government and sank British ships, Britain repeatedly protested. Japan's atrocities in China repeatedly damaged British interests, and Britain has also repeatedly protested. This situation is clearly in people's memory. The current question is whether Britain's response to China's anti-aggression resistance can be like its response to Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, and Spain. Will Britain's "sympathy" for China and its protests to the aggressor turn into a compromise with the aggressor?

According to general estimates, British investment in China is worth about £240 million, six times larger than that of the United States. Britain's trade interests in China are also very large. Britain bases its Far East policy on protecting this huge interest, not on any abstract ideals.

Currently, the Chamberlain government's policy is to aid China so that China can continue to resist and resist aggression. If China surrenders to Japan, British interests in China will suffer a serious blow. At that time, the only way for Britain to restore its inherent interests would be to wage war against Japan. London estimates that if China can continue to resist, Japan will reach a state of exhaustion and welcome the arrival of peace. Britain hopes to be able to mediate and obtain a peace that protects British interests. This is the true meaning of Britain's note to Japan on January 15 and the large loan to China.

British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated in the House of Lords on the 1st of this month that Britain is willing to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. This is not accidental. He said: "When the appropriate time arrives, the British government will not hesitate to take all necessary steps to mediate the war." The so-called "appropriate time" refers to Britain, not China.

It is difficult to predict what impact the recent Slovakian event will have on Britain's activities. However, the leaders of the British Conservative Party, when considering protecting British interests in China, have undoubtedly increased their anxiety. If war breaks out in Europe, Britain will have no time to focus on the Far East, and its interests in East Asia will be greatly damaged by Japan.

The United States' military expansion and its tendency toward isolationism also have a significant impact on British policy. The activities of the United States have a considerable influence on Britain's dominions—Canada, Australia, New Zealand—and even India. Recently, the United States is proposing to convene another Washington Conference, to be held in Brussels (the capital of Belgium) or Washington. It is said that China's leaders agree to such an international conference. However, if China wants to achieve victory at the conference table, it must first achieve victory on the battlefield. This is the lesson of history. China's most reliable friends are its own weapons and the people's firm spirit of resistance. Everything else is unnecessary to consider. (Translated from the Miller Review Weekly, March 18)

### Demand After the War of Resistance: The Flourishing Development of Overseas Chinese Industry in Hong Kong. There are now nearly 2,000 Factories of All Sizes in Hong Kong. Products from Overseas Chinese are Crowded Out by National Goods and Sales are Brisk.

In recent years, the industry of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong has progressed unusually rapidly. Since the War of Resistance, it has become increasingly prosperous, and its future is very optimistic. The establishment of overseas Chinese factories in Hong Kong began only in the last decade. As a commercial port, Hong Kong rarely attracted attention for its industrial development in the past. Later, as the environment changed, Hong Kong's industry gradually developed from its infancy, and the establishment of various factories increased with the times. The Hong Kong government also recognized the need to develop industry and made every effort to facilitate or assist the establishment of various factories. After the War of Resistance, due to the demands of the times, overseas Chinese and mainland businessmen invested in and established various industries in Hong Kong, which greatly increased the number. Therefore, in a short period of time, Hong Kong's industry has achieved vigorous development.

Huge Production and Sales, Especially Smooth in Overseas Markets

According to unofficial statistics, there are currently nearly 1,000 factories of various sizes in Hong Kong that manufacture various industrial products, and there are about 700 to 800 other small factories and cottage industries. Weaving is the most developed of the various industries, such as coarse cloth, shirts, thread, and other woven products. The monthly output is extremely large, especially after the Anti-Japanese War, the production and sales of local woven cloth and dyed goods have increased significantly. The sales markets for the products of various factories now cover the Malay Archipelago, British and Dutch possessions, North and South America, Borneo, and places where overseas Chinese reside. Especially the British colonies such as Singapore, which have the advantage of preferential taxes, the sales market is particularly large. After the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, vigorously promoted national goods. In the past, goods from Hong Kong have replaced goods from foreign countries in sales markets. Therefore, in the last two years, national industrial products from Hong Kong have become more popular in overseas markets, which has made Hong Kong manufacturers even more excited. This is truly a unique opportunity to develop Hong Kong's industry.

Factories in Occupied Areas Mostly Relocate to Hong Kong

Since the fall of Shanghai the year before last, the original factories in Shanghai have also moved to Hong Kong one after another. Within a year last year, about 15 to 20 large and small factories from Shanghai moved to Hong Kong. The total amount of investment by Shanghai businessmen in Hong Kong reached tens of millions. When Xiamen and Guangzhou in South China were successively abandoned, many factories in the two places also moved to Hong Kong. More than a dozen factories have moved to Hong Kong from Guangzhou alone, and about 20 factories have moved from Xiamen. The types of products are roughly ironware, hardware, silk, weaving, and glass utensils. The above-mentioned foreign manufacturers have considerable connections with local manufacturers in Hong Kong. Regarding the future development direction, it is hoped that various domestic products should use more domestic raw materials and strive to improve products to strengthen the position of domestic goods. Regarding cooperation between manufacturers and the banking industry in providing loans, many foreign manufacturers have adopted this method. Although many manufacturers in Hong Kong have ample capital, in order to further develop industry and establish great industries, cooperation with the banking industry is still extremely necessary.

### The Special Committee of the Relief Federation Held a Meeting Yesterday to Prepare for the Charity Performance of "Huanghuagang". It Was Decided to Divide the Work into Four Groups: General Affairs, Ticket Sales, and Publicity.

The Hong Kong Relief Federation decided the other day to allocate funds to assist the Hong Kong Drama Academy in performing Huangchoubei, and all preparations have been reported in the previous report. The special committee held its first meeting at the Chung Sing Charitable Society at 8:00 p.m. yesterday, with more than ten attendees including Chen Lanfang, Lu Guomian, Chen Shaotang, Lu Fu, and Lin Ciming. The meeting was chaired by Chen Lanfang. It was decided to divide the work and assign responsibilities. The Ji Sheng Charitable Needle was responsible for the general affairs group, and the Women's and Guanglian Chambers of Commerce were responsible for the personnel group. In addition to each member organization of the Relief Federation being responsible for a certain number of tickets, a sales team was formed to sell tickets externally. The ticket prices were set at 10 yuan for special charity seats, 5 yuan for honorary seats, and 3 yuan, 2 yuan, 1 yuan, and 5 jiao and 2 jiao. The venue is planned to be the Taiping Theater, and the performance date can only be determined after soliciting the opinions of the Taiping Theater, so it has not been resolved yet.

### The China Youth Singing Games Were Held Yesterday. 1,500 Young People Swore to Abide by the Covenant, Vowing Not to Violate National Interests and to Serve the Country Wholeheartedly.

The Hong Kong Chinese Christian Youth Association Singing Class convened its six major teams of singing comrades, a total of 1,500 people, at the Blake Garden at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. In addition to holding a national salvation singing movement conference, they also conducted a solemn spiritual training. Those who attended the meeting that day included the president of the conference, Lin Zifeng, pastors Fang Yuehan, Huang Dunhan, Peng Zhidong, and several thousand guests. The atmosphere was extremely solemn, especially when everyone raised the flag, sang the national anthem, and swore to abide by the "National Covenant," the atmosphere was particularly tense. Then, the president of the conference, Lin Zifeng, delivered a speech, saying that in today's flag-raising ceremony, I look up at the brilliance of the national flag, which makes me even more determined to protect the country. Although the weather has not been good in recent days, you have all enthusiastically participated. Such strong emotions are enough to swallow mountains and rivers and be invincible. Therefore, I feel even more that China's War of Resistance has entered a new stage, and the future is becoming clearer and clearer. Finally, I sincerely hope that all singing comrades will emit angry and clear songs to enhance the anti-war power of the heroic soldiers in the front and rear. The National Covenant of the conference is divided as follows: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association Federation will hold the fifth Children's Day. This year's event focuses on encouraging children in Hong Kong to rescue Chinese refugee children. Starting from April 1, students from various schools will be responsible for donating flags, and all income will be used to protect Chinese war-zone refugee children. It is heard that the association will convene a joint school meeting at 7:00 p.m. today to discuss the progress of the work. The Hong Kong school is at the Overseas Chinese Middle School in Hong Kong, and the Wanlong School is at the Lingdong Middle School. It is heard that the participants in this session are unusually enthusiastic. The venues have been determined to be Entertainment, Queen's, Lee Theatre, Peace, and Dongle, etc., and Lee Theatre and Dongle Theatre have agreed to loan them for free. Other theaters are also expected to reduce rental fees. Hong Kong and Kowloon buses will also add more vehicles and reduce fares according to last year's practice to facilitate elementary school students to attend the meeting. The person in charge of the association has also requested the Central Traffic Police Department to send traffic police on the morning of April 4 to protect students from various schools along the way. The association's declaration, opening remarks, and various speeches will also be submitted for review tonight. The lyrics of the Children's Day song are as follows: (1) Today is a grand festival, the singing is warm and supply, singing to celebrate children, although young, their ambitions are not small, I am the master of the world, Children's Day, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, Children's Day, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, (2) A pair of small hands can work, a small brain thinks intelligently, working and working, not relying on people, thinking and thinking can succeed, Children's Day, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, (3) Don't look down on me, children, I have an axe and a knife in my hand, to create a new world, the scene is different from before, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, students from various schools who want to get this song, can get it from the association, now someone intends to ask the conference to invite Chinese war-zone refugee children to Hong Kong to attend the meeting, so that children in Hong Kong and Kowloon can sit together with the refugee children and celebrate together. If this case can be passed, then the children's day will be more meaningful.

### Min Paper Sales Increase Greatly in Hong Kong, Reaching More Than 200,000 Yuan per Month.

After the shift in the situation in Huafu, cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou has gradually increased, and many local products from Guangdong and Fujian are sold through Lian Harbor. Among the agricultural products of Min Province, in addition to tea, bamboo products, and miscellaneous grains, local paper is the largest category. The local paper produced in Min, such as "grass paper" and "Yu Kou paper," as well as various store ledgers and stationery, have long been known at home and abroad. In the past, local paper from Min Province was sold a lot in Guangdong and other places, and it was also widely sold in Hong Kong and various ports in Nanyang. It is estimated that the monthly exports from Min Province reach one million yuan, saving a lot of outward profits. Recently, Min paper has become more active in the Hong Kong market. The population has increased by hundreds of thousands, and the daily consumption of grass paper alone is not small. It is understood that the current sales of Min paper in Hong Kong reach more than 200,000 Hong Kong dollars per month, and the amount shipped from Hong Kong to various parts of Nanyang is more than double this amount. It is estimated that the total value of Min paper shipped overseas through Hong Kong in recent times is more than 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per month, and the number shipped to various provinces in the country, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan, is also very large.

### The Housing Problem is Still Very Serious. The Tenant Protection Ordinance Will Be Extended for Another Year. This Ordinance Was Implemented in June Last Year for a Period of One Year. The Hong Kong Government is Now Considering Extending the Effective Period for One Year.

Since the outbreak of the National War of Resistance, people from all over the country have flocked to Hong Kong, causing a housing panic. Landlords seized the opportunity to oppress and make profits, and the trend of rent increases and forced evictions became increasingly serious. The Hong Kong government, in order to protect tenants, issued an order in June last year to implement the eviction of tenants and prevent rent increases. The ordinance is valid for one year, and it will expire in June this year, which is more than two months away. Whether to extend the implementation period or abolish it after the expiration date is of utmost importance and importance to the vital interests of tens of thousands of residents in Hong Kong. According to semi-official sources, the war zones in China are still raging, and those who have fled to Hong Kong will not be able to leave Hong Kong for the time being. During this extraordinary period, the seriousness of the housing problem in Hong Kong will continue to exist. Therefore, the Hong Kong government is now considering extending the validity of the ordinance to banish evicted servants and prevent rent increases for another year, so as to prevent disputes between tenants and landlords from becoming serious again. For the sake of the legitimate interests of tens of thousands of tenants, it is hoped that the Hong Kong government will extend the ordinance at the time.

### The Hong Kong Literary and Art Circles Celebrated the First Anniversary of the National Literary Association Yesterday

— Qi Zhuo

And the Establishment of a Liaison Office for Members Remaining in Hong Kong

It was exactly a year ago today that the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles was established in Wuhan with a brand new outlook. All "preconceived notions," "factions," and "friction"... were also under the urgent demand of the "united front." Like scattered wind and clouds, like melted spring snow. This unprecedented great unity is sufficient to show that cultural figures have shouldered the tasks assigned by the great era and stood on the sacred position to exert the great role of the pen.

Although happy to stay, the work of the National Literary Association accompanying the new capital has become more active; the branches or liaison offices in various places have also been more widely developed due to the development of the current anti-Japanese situation. Yesterday, the members of the Literary Association remaining in Hong Kong and the literary and art circles in Hong Kong specially held a meeting to celebrate the anniversary of the National Literary Association, and at the same time established a liaison office for members remaining in Hong Kong. There is no need to set it as a glorious historical record of a member with a profound meaning of the electricity bill before matching the objective environment.

At two o'clock yesterday afternoon, it was a sunny day with a spring feeling after the overcast. Mr. Liang Gongchuo, Xu Dishan, Ma Jian, Fei Mu, Chen Hengzhe, Ye Lingfeng, Liu Simu, Ma Guoliang... all attended the meeting. Mr. Xu Shiying, Jian Youwen, Ouyang Yuqian, Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin and other gentlemen were unable to attend due to obstruction, but they also sent representatives to attend. A gathering of talents, sincere and supportive, this is the first time that cultural people have come to Hong Kong.

Although it was because there were too many attendees, the chairman did not have time to introduce them, but everyone quietly flipped through the sign-in book, secretly talking about who this is and who that is.

After the meeting ended, there were three or five groups of greetings and reminiscing. After silently reading, Mr. Xu Dishan delivered a speech. Mr. Xu's enthusiasm is deeply admired by colleagues.

Next, Chairman Ye Gongchuo, with the demeanor of an elder, calmly elaborated on a series of high-level discussions. He encouraged everyone to work hard to meet the needs of the times by "replacing dead literature with living literature" and "replacing static literature with dynamic literature."

When the master of ceremonies shouted "Report on the preparations," Mr. Lou Shiyi used his Mandarin, which had a quite northern flavor, to report on the preparations for the Hong Kong Literary Association liaison office, and incidentally reported on the work dynamics of the General Association in the front and rear in the past year. Men of letters are also fighters; the pen and the gun are equally important. The naked facts have already given us a concrete explanation. Finally, he also said: Although the format of the venue does not have slogans, national flags, or the Prime Minister's portrait, the motherland we remember and the work we will practice in the future are deeply engraved in the minds of each of us.

After the presidium reported the telegram from the Chongqing General Association, Wang Dashui gave a speech on behalf of Mr. Xu Shiying. Then, Mr. Xu Dishan invited Ms. Chen Hengzhe to the stage, which particularly attracted the attention of the audience. Mr. Chen, who had been admired for a long time in the "Independent Review" in Peking for "Save the Middle School Students," originally had a "antique" large lace border inlaid on her black long coat, which was quite special. After criticizing anti-Japanese literature and non-anti-Japanese literature, she also put forward the proposition that literature should be authentic.

Mr. Liu Simu said: The progress of the Hong Kong literary and art circles is a gratifying phenomenon. In the future, we must make good use of our pens to fight against the capitulation theory of traitors and defeatists. I hope that after the establishment of this association: (1) improve the level of anti-Japanese literature; (2) literary work should be closely related to the masses; (3) Hong Kong, as a transportation hub, should communicate with Chinese and foreign cultural circles and introduce each other.

Due to time constraints, the speech program was turned over. After passing the declaration and congratulatory telegram to the General Association, the proposal was discussed.

First, the organization of the executive committee was discussed, which took a lot of time. As a result, a fellow member suggested a concrete method to be handled by the new board of directors, which was very neat. Regarding the case of holding a newsletter; the case of organizing a literary and art transportation station to expand international propaganda; the case of holding a literary and art evening party and the case of regularly holding external literary and art evening parties; all have been carefully discussed.

After the discussion, the necessary article was the election. As a result, the following people were selected as directors: Xu Dishan, Ouyang Yuqian, Lou Shiyi, Cai Chusheng, Dai Wangshu, Ye Junfeng, Chen Hengzhe, Liu Simu. Lu and Lin and other nine people. The alternate directors are Wu Jingsong and Jian Youwen. Needless to say, we have unlimited hopes for the new directors.

Finally, the presidium invited everyone to drink "tea" but there was no "dim sum", which was quite interesting. It is right to reduce life for the sake of resisting Japan; in the current society, mental workers who are exploited are not worthy of enjoyment. It is thought-provoking for poor men of letters to drink a cup of clear tea!

The inaugural meeting is over. May everyone work closely together, under the literary and artistic united front, so that the work that has been called for for a long time can be turned over lesson by lesson, until Hong Kong bears the fruits of new culture, and we can meet our partners in the restored motherland.

### The Street Newspaper Vendor Wandering on the Streets Lives by Begging for a Living in the Cold Wind and Bitter Rain

There is still so much morning light before dawn. Young masters and young ladies who are pampered, at this time, although they will wake up from their dreams, but after a while, seeing that it is still dark outside the window, and the cold wind is desperately trying to drill in from the window cracks, they will realize that they should look for a good dream again, and drill deeper into the quilt, and soon fall asleep again. However, at this time, the time is about four o'clock in the morning, the tea house has just opened for business, and the crisp cries of selling newspapers have been intermittently hitting our eardrums! That's right, if you are not familiar with the things here, follow the crisp cries and look over, and you will see a group of children selling newspapers—the oldest is no more than fourteen or fifteen years old, and the youngest is only seven or eight years old—their appearance will cause your surprise: they have not reached the age of work, so early, so cold, ah, poor children!

From four o'clock in the morning to nine or ten o'clock, it is the tense time for this group of children to peddle morning newspapers. Between two and six o'clock in the afternoon, they have to find customers for the evening newspapers. After six o'clock, they still don't have leisure, but they still have to put the remaining morning and evening newspapers, several copies together, and do the work of devaluing and selling them, and only after nine o'clock can they have a chance to rest.

From four o'clock in the morning to six o'clock in the afternoon, the footprints of these children are all over every corner of Hong Kong. Because all the newspaper offices are concentrated in the central district, around two o'clock in the morning, they ran from every corner of Hong Kong to the central district, waiting patiently for the publication of the newspaper, so they are not afraid of missing the early market. The cold wind will not pity these poor children. On the calm streets, it still roars like a tiger. Therefore, the panting that the newspaper-selling children are running to send out is all covered by the roaring wind, and cannot be heard. Run, run, they are rushing urgently!

Although in the embrace of the cold wind, the body wrapped in ragged clothes still has the smell of sweat. The road is long and running is stubborn. Maybe they will take off that ill-fitting coat—just that tattered Western coat—and continue to run to their destination. They are in groups of three or five. Although there is no formal contact, they are all very familiar partners. On the way, they chatted intermittently, talking about yesterday's business. When they were proud, they would also laugh loudly, breaking through the silence of the quiet, ice-like morning. When they arrived at the central location for newspaper distribution, if it was a little early, they would lie on the ground for a while. The older ones would take advantage of this free time to gamble, and it was not uncommon for them to lose all the money for buying newspapers.

From four o'clock to seven o'clock in the morning, they are relatively free to peddle around. At this time, they will not be suddenly caught by the police and taken to the police station, nor do they have to guard against those vehicles without eyes, and customers are more numerous and orderly than at other times.

Recently, new newspapers often appear in Hong Kong. In the first few days of publication, the price of distribution is very cheap. When they encounter such an opportunity, the newspaper-selling children are particularly excited. They will use various skilled methods to arouse the interest of the general public in this new publication. Because the cost is low, their income will also increase accordingly. As for ordinary old newspapers, they also have 30% to 40% of the profit to be made. However, the number of newspaper-selling children is increasing day by day, so their daily income is really very small. Although it is so difficult, they still have to continue to do it. Otherwise, even this small profit will not be available, which is terrible!

If we slip through the streets, we can often see them being caught by the police, with tears on their faces begging bitterly to release them, which always makes you feel sad and resentful. These poor children, driven by life, regardless of the roaring cold wind, torrential rain, and scorching sun, always tirelessly do what they can. If they should abide by the law, then society should be responsible for giving them the opportunity to abide by the law. It is not possible to fundamentally solve the problem by sending them to the police station and giving them "punishment"!

As mentioned above, their age is between seven and fifteen years old, so they are all children who have reached school age. Shouldn't society also be responsible for giving them the opportunity to be educated? (New)

### The Northern Road is Under the Control of Our Army, Communication from Huajian × is Cut Off, × Urgently Seeks to Advance North to Disturb and Intensify Preparations for Coercion, Our Guerrilla Teams Go Out Day and Night to Attack × and Destroy Engineering Works

[Beijiang Express News] According to Yue × Army, recently, they have been transferred north to increase defense on the front lines of Conghua, Zengcheng, and Huaxian, and are actively deploying to plot a northern invasion. The strength of our northern road defense army has greatly increased since the military authorities transferred the mechanized new army to the south for combat. It has a considerable grasp of monitoring and controlling the northern line. The following is a record of recent military information.

Conghua Front Line × Military Movements

According to front-line military information, × troops stationed in Shengang Taipingchang on the Conghua front line have been dispatching infantry and cavalry to invade our warning line in recent days, and have also been disturbing villages in the nearby area, forcing the people to search for cedar, bamboo, and wood to build pontoon bridges and make wooden rafts in preparation for crossing the river, and forcibly requisitioning dozens of civilian ships, which are docked at Shengang and Taipingchang on the Luotan River surface, with intentions. At the airport opened by Dapu ×, several miles away from Taipingchang, there are currently seven or eight × planes stationed, which fly to Conghua, Huaxian, Longmen, Zengcheng and other places every day for reconnaissance. Looking at the overall military movements of ×, there will be plots.

Guerrilla Teams Expand Attacks on ×

It is found that Wu Guandian, commander of the Second Guerrilla Column, ordered the various departments of the team to expand their activities and cut off the connection between × troops in Cong (hua) and Hua (xian) in order to contain the activities of the × troops and assist our army in the attack. Therefore, our guerrillas have been going out day and night to attack × and destroy × affairs, which is very successful. × feels difficult to cope with. On the 22nd of this month, a certain part of our guerrillas lurking in Honghe Yue attacked the × battalion near Taipingchang, and once advanced into the × formation, bombing the × fortifications and killing a dozen × sentries. × is now in a state of panic and is stepping up vigilance in various villages.

Anti-Army Two Routes Counterattack Shengang

According to military news, our new-style mechanized troops have consolidated their defense and boosted their morale since they opened up Beijiang to increase defense. The Liang Division troops of the 12th Army Group, which is responsible for fighting on the Conghua front, have repelled the × troops who have repeatedly attacked the troops and have taken advantage of the situation to advance to Shengang in two routes from Dagang Ridge Zuihe Market. The vanguard team has had a front-line encounter with ×, and the war is likely to continue to unfold. Therefore, the military affairs of the northern road, which have been silent for many days, will have a new development.

### × Increases Troops to Sanjiang, Intending to Spy on Lubao, Our Suppression of the Activity of × Boats in Xiaobeijiang, × Artillery Bombards Mafang in Langang, We Suffer No Losses

[Zhaoqing Express News] Our × in Xijiang is still confronting each other in the original positions. Although × has repeatedly increased reinforcements to the Sanshui front line and sent troops to cross the river to occupy Ge Wei and spy on our alert positions, they are only probing in nature. In the past week, the entire Xijiang war situation, except for intermittent cross-river artillery battles and small encounters in the front posts, has been without major battles. However, in the past two days, × has increased troops to the Luxi Highway, the 43 Highway, and the Tan Highway, seemingly with new intentions. The following is a record of the situation.

× Still Increases Troops, Trying to Spy on Lubao

In the past ten days, in the various strongholds on the Sanshui front line, the × army has made no other changes except for actively deploying defenses. Only on the two highways of Lubao) Xi (nan) and Si (hui) San (shui) have × military transports been very busy in recent days. × troops increased defense to Sanjiang, Guanyao, Fengyong, and Yangmei along these highways from Southwest and Hekou. According to intelligence, × seems to have the intention of spying on Fanhu and Lubao. On the 23rd, in Langang, × artillery fired remotely on our Mafang position, reaching more than 30 rounds. However, most of the shells fell into the wilderness, and the defending troops of our position ignored them, and only waited in formation.

We Strictly Seal off Xiaobeijiang

According to intelligence received by the military authorities, × on the Xijiang River intended to spy on Lubao along Xiaobeijiang and by land and water from the highway to coordinate the × army's advance on the front of the Xijiang River. Furthermore, now is the spring season and the river water is rising sharply, fearing that × boats will take the opportunity to go north along the river. In order to strictly prevent and control, the front-line corps was ordered to choose a location to strictly lock Xiaobeijiang. It was found that the river surface near Shijiao, Qingyuan County, was sealed off by the authorities when Sanshui was first captured. Later, due to the sharp increase in refugees in the lower reaches of Lubao, the river was sealed off, which affected the water transportation of commercial goods for relief. A small road was opened in the blockade line to facilitate the passage of ships. In order to prevent × military ships from being active along the river, it was decided to strengthen the blockade line, and strictly set the time for opening and allowing ships to pass, to prevent × people from rushing in. The General Tax Department and the headquarters of the Second Guerrilla Column each sent troops to defend and guard the Mei Cai and Mei Ling areas along the river and the Shi Yi area to meet × Kou.

Our Troops in Mafang Are Waiting for Orders to Attack

It was also found that Mafang (belonging to Sihui) and Lubao (belonging to Sanshui) in the lower reaches of Xiaobeijiang have become the foremost front lines of the Northwest River, and have been guarded by the regular army of the Tax Police Corps and ×× and other departments. Since Deng Longguang, commander of the 64th Army, patrolled the front line yesterday, he has been more actively deploying and strengthening military affairs in that area. A strong formation has now been deployed to smash ×'s conspiracy to spy, and to seize the opportunity to counterattack ×. It was found that our troops in Lubao Mafang had crossed the river several times to attack the × army in Langang Mumian and other places. Later, due to the overall strategic relationship, they did not obtain close contact with the main army of each department, and still retreated to the original defense. According to military news, General Deng Longguang, who is in charge of the military affairs of the western road, has ordered the front-line corps to make strict preparations and wait for orders to attack, as ×'s ambition to invade the west is still urgent.

### Four × Planes Bombarded Shantou Madly the Day Before Yesterday, the Station and Yongtai Shengping Roads Were Hit, Yaoming Village Was Destroyed, More Than 200 Civilians Were Killed or Injured

Yesterday afternoon, Shantou merchants in Hong Kong received telegrams one after another, saying that × planes bombed Shantou on a large scale yesterday morning, and the losses were quite heavy. The reporter then asked a Chaozhou merchant, who said that this time × plotted to invade the south, following the landing at Jinmen. Later, on July 3 and 11 last year, × planes were repeatedly sent to bomb Shantou wildly, and the disaster was heavy. Later, they landed in Nan'ao, and after our guerrillas and regular army jointly attacked, they recovered the lost land. × was frightened, and dared not invade since then. Shantou has been peaceful for several months. Unexpectedly, this afternoon (25th), this firm received a telegram from Shantou saying that × planes bombed the train and Shengping Road. It was found that the purpose of this bombing of Shantou by × planes was to bomb the Chaoshan Road car, because the bombing time happened to be the time when the Chaoan car arrived in Shantou. It is said that four × planes invaded the most prosperous area of Shantou and bombed it at 9:00 yesterday morning. Many bombs were dropped at the intersection of Yongtai Road and Shengping Road, and bombs were also dropped near the seaside. The area where the boats gather is the hub of Shantou's land and water transportation. The place is extremely prosperous. Although the loss of property and life in this bombing has not been accurately statistically, it is estimated that it is extremely tragic.

Bombing Yaoming, Losses in the Millions

According to news, on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd of this month, × planes bombed various villages and markets in Gaoyao and Gaoming on a large scale. More than 10 × planes bombed various villages on a large scale from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm every day. It is estimated that the villages in the 9th District of Gaoyao that were bombed include Luoan, Aowei, Bian, Dongzhai, Chagang, Hegang, and more than ten other villages. More than 70 or 80 bombs were dropped one after another. Hundreds of houses and buildings were destroyed, and more than 100 people were killed or injured. The villages in the 6th District of Gaoming that were bombed include Li, Luojun, Guandang, Shiqi, Xincun, Sucun, Xindun, Tiegang, Ni Jiao, Lunyong, Tiezhao. Qingtai, Kongtang, Dongkeng and other more than ten villages, a hundred bombs were dropped, destroying more than a hundred houses, and more than 200 people were killed or injured. In addition, the two market places of Sanzhou Market and Yangmei Market were also leveled to the ground, with losses of more than one million.

### Proclamation by the Guangdong-Min-Gan Border District Commissioner's Office: Banning Impersonating Guerrilla Teams

[Chaoan Express News] Wu Qiwai, Commander-in-Chief of the 9th Army Group, was recently appointed as the Director of the Gan-Yue-Min Border District, responsible for commanding the troops in the border areas of the three provinces, pacifying the war of resistance, and stabilizing the anti-Japanese situation. Wu recently issued a proclamation to ban the border areas of Guangdong, Min, and Gan, where bandits and bandits often impersonated anti-Japanese self-defense organizations and guerrilla teams, disturbing and plundering the villagers, which has a great impact on wartime defense and public security. The original text is as follows: In view of the war of resistance against Japan, which is related to the survival of the nation, all soldiers and civilians should know how to unite as one and overcome difficulties together. Although the people in the rear cannot all go to the battlefield to defend the country with weapons, they should also be united in mind and one in virtue, and hate the enemy with the same hatred, so that the front line has no worries and the war of resistance has the hope of winning. However, it is found that in the borders of Gan, Yue, and Min, there are still those who do not understand righteousness. They take advantage of the name of guerrilla warfare to resist Japan, and secretly engage in the practice of planting parties and seeking private interests, gathering disciples to fish and meat the villagers, stripping taxes and donations, covering up smoke and gambling, and the thorny road is painful to say. If they are not strictly investigated, how can we maintain public security and revitalize discipline? Only thinking that there are those who have the heart to resist Japan, and there is no way to ask for help, and there are those who are forced to take risks due to different opinions with the authorities, and the general public is moved by the wrong propaganda, does not understand the illegality of the organization, and covets temporary convenience to avoid the ease of military service. All these kinds of things, although the traces are unforgivable, but the feelings are worthy of pity. This Acting Director returned from Nantao, and was about to feed his horses and sharpen his soldiers to return to the front line, but he had to make a sincere persuasion out of the desire to solve the problem of public security in the north. All the people in the border areas of the three provinces, those who have armed organizations and claim to be heroes, unless they are approved by the county government, should be canceled regardless of their name, and should be submitted to the office for self-renewal within days after the proclamation to wait for compilation and transformation, and to protect vitality. If they are obsessed with ignorance, disobey orders, and violate them secretly, they will be severely suppressed once they are investigated. This Acting Director speaks the law, and I hope that enlightened people know where to go, whether to be guilty or meritorious, it is a matter of time, and I sincerely tell you to come back early, and there are great hopes.

### × Is Trapped in the Mire in Xijiang and Has No Ability to Invade. Building Defensive Works Only to Conserve, Forcing Villagers to Relocate and Build Forts

[Zhaoqing Special News] It has been almost a month since the commander of the × army in Xijiang was replaced. They have repeatedly claimed to attack, but they have never dared to cross the Leichi Pool. Therefore, in fact, they have no ability to invade and are deeply trapped in the mire and cannot extricate themselves. The following is a record of the recent × situation.

Intensifying the Construction of Defensive Works

After the × chief Zhongyuan commander arrived in Sanshui, he transferred the troops along the line of Sanshui, Hekou, Southwest, and Jiujiang, and outsiders who did not know it thought that the × army was increasing its troops to Xijiang. In fact, the × army in Xijiang was already in the deepest mire. Because our regular main force is strengthening its defensive power in the upper reaches of West Port, and is preparing to counterattack, and the × in the lower reaches are also attacked by our guerrillas everywhere. Not only can they not be extended, but they are also afraid of our army's attack. Therefore, the × in Sanshui intensified the establishment of various defensive works. It was found that the × being planned was to build a pontoon bridge on Laoya Island in Hekou. The east bank of the bridge is bounded by the Beijiang Estuary, and two additional three-in-one earth bunkers are built to defend with small steel cannons and machine guns. On the left flank, × in Makou Gang Genjiaowei and Mumian, as well as the Ni River, were equipped with a total of more than 600 people of various arms to confront Jinli I across the river. On the 20th of this month, more than 300 villagers were seized in Xinxu and a military road was built from Ganggenxu to Dalu Xu, which was prepared to connect to the Jiujiang Highway, and its left was prepared to connect to the Southwest Highway. About 100 × in Ganggen had two cannons. The × battalion commander Lin Mao, stationed there, ordered the villagers' residences in Chaowan and Ganggen to be demolished within ten days, otherwise they would be set on fire. They also forced the villagers of the two villages to move to Saikeng and Qinkeng, and prepared to build military barracks and forts in the roots of Chaowan, and open them as small military ports on the banks of the two villages. Therefore, the engineering is unusually busy there.

Bolting Wood and Horse Mouth, a Military Road Is Built

Also, the military road from Baimu Market to Makou was opened to traffic on the 23rd of this month, and will be connected to Jiujiang in the future to connect in one go. On that day, three × transport vehicles transported a lot of grain and military supplies from Baimu to Makou. There are also several rubber boats that have sailed to Makou, the dynamics are unknown. On the right wing, ×, from the old Sanshui Xinxu along the east bank of the river, has added four or five bunkers and built machine gun bunkers along the coast, adding a lot of barbed wire, fearing our army's river crossing counterattack. The above view of × army strengthening its defensive power in this way shows that it only intends to conserve strongholds and has no ability to invade Xijiang.

### Using the Rear as the Front: The Number of Our Guerrillas in Guangzhou is Astonishing; Warning to Pro-*** Restaurants and Teahouses; *** Can't Get Started on Census Taking

[Guangzhou Correspondence] The current state of Guangzhou's public security is worsening recently. On the one hand, it is because ***'s puppet regime is unable to govern effectively. On the other hand, it is due to our guerrillas spreading in and out of the urban area, leaving the *** people at a loss. According to reliable sources, from the city to the suburbs, the number of our guerrillas hiding is indeed astonishing, estimated to be no less than 50,000. Among them, in addition to the strong men from the suburbs and various villages in Nanhai and Panyu counties, many from as far as Zhongshan, Shunde, Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Conghua counties have also been dispatched or have voluntarily entered Guangzhou to work secretly and seize opportunities to attack ***. The attack on the Zhengjin Bank last month was a manifestation of the coordinated action of guerrillas from various counties in Guangzhou. Moreover, the firearms are modern and the ammunition is sufficient, as demonstrated by the above-mentioned battle. Each attack leaves the scattered and small *** forces unable to resist, effectively using the ***'s rear as the front. They do not launch lightly in normal times, but each launch must have a major purpose, and they will not rest until it is achieved. True popular armed forces have grown under the claws of the ***, and the organization is becoming increasingly large, which is an undeniable fact.

Warning to Pro-*** Restaurants

It has been found that the restaurants that have reopened in Guangzhou include Da San Yuan, Jinlong, Qi Miao Zhai (formerly known as Ming Yuan), and Jinlun. They were forced to reopen by the *** army, otherwise they would be confiscated by the *** and operated by themselves. However, there are some unscrupulous merchants who have even opened large "China Cuisine" restaurants and loudly speak *** language, claiming to welcome the "Imperial Revolution." Inside, they employ a group of *** women as receptionists. Our guerrillas recently warned the investors of these restaurants, and the bosses were panicked and asked the *** Command Headquarters for protection. The *** dispatched plainclothes detectives from the puppet police force to go there. The restaurants are even more panicked, knowing that these secret agents are all bandits, offering more harassment than protection.

Unable to Conduct Census

The *** army is extremely anxious about the growing number of hidden guerrilla forces. They have consulted with the puppet organization and proposed conducting a census. However, they feel that the number of *** soldiers and puppets is not large enough to conduct a large-scale census at the same time. People would scatter in all directions, and they even worry that our guerrillas will strike first. There is also the matter that the *** is trying hard to attract people from all over to return to the city, using the slogan "live and work in peace." They fear that a census will cause unrest in the urban area, which would make people even more wary. All of these are concerns that the *** have but cannot resolve. This news was leaked by people from the puppet organization. The matter should be credible, otherwise the *** would not need to try so hard to cover up the Zhengjin Bank attack. In short, the strength of our guerrillas has continued to grow under these inevitable circumstances and will be brought into play sooner or later, making the *** unable to sleep peacefully. The reason is very clear.

### Our Guerrillas on the Coastal Line Launch a Surprise Attack on Xiuying Fort, Killing Dozens of *** and Destroying Two Camps

[Beihai Special Dispatch] This station received news from Haikou. After our army's counterattack on Qiongshan, last night (the 22nd), the Haikou local self-defense corps launched a large-scale offensive towards Haikou again and once attacked the Xiuying Fort. It was late at night, and the *** army did not know how many troops we had and dared not fight back. They defended their camps, but our forces set fire and burned two *** camps, killing dozens of ***. The battle continued until dawn, when our forces retreated.

### Star Publicity Tactics: A Motley Collection

Charles Boyer said, "Actors are abnormal people. If we were normal people, we would not be actors."

Actors are indeed different from ordinary people in many ways. For the convenience of publicity work, they often deliberately do some peculiar things to show their unique personality. Otherwise, it is difficult for them to find publicity materials, and it is crucial to maintain their reputation. Whether the publicity is effective or not is a big key... Look, the most beautiful women and the most handsome men in Hollywood are not famous movie stars, but extras. It is because they do not get a publicity opportunity. As long as someone publicizes him or her, it is not difficult to step onto the throne of a star.

When Hedy Lamarr first arrived in Hollywood, she had the same captivating characteristics as she does now. However, she was forgotten for several months until the newspapers started promoting her, and then she gradually rose to her current position.

Although every actor's success story does not attribute his success to the power of publicity, we all know that publicity work is to a movie actor as air is to a person. It is indispensable for a day, otherwise—maybe they admit this is true—they would not often do those special things.

For example, in mid-September, Martha Raye stated in San Francisco that she would marry Buddy West. At the same time, she said that they would hold a formal wedding, but it did not need to be a grand one. She added, "I don't need publicity, I just want to get married."

To put her words into practice, she did not marry in Hollywood but in Ensenada, where it was quieter. People believed that she was truly escaping publicity work, but few people knew one thing...

The day before she left, a Mexican-style set was set up in the Paramount studio. The new couple walked in hand-in-hand from outside the door, with new wedding smiles on their faces. At the same time, the camera rang, recording it all in the lens. This was just a rehearsal, but the publicity purpose had already been achieved. When played, it would surely attract attention.

Ordinary men and women always want to keep their marriage as secret as possible, but here it is the opposite, flaunting it, fearing that people will not know. Indeed, such a secret marriage has a greater publicity effect than holding a grand wedding.

Henry Wilcoxon and Joan Woodbury did not seem to understand this. They held a wedding in the chapel in full dress in front of relatives and friends. Their wedding only occupied one line in the newspaper the next day, which was very pitiful. If they understood a little, they would have rushed to Yuma to get married, and it would not have been so tragic. Look at Jack Oakie and Venita Varden, who got married in Yuma during the short 15-minute stop of a train. This achieved great publicity effect. At the same time, it secretly advertised part of Jack's new movie "Florida Limited", in which there is a train as the background.

Laurel is also weird enough. He is busy entertaining guests all year round, either separating from his wife Illeana or reconciling as before. He may even get married again. They have been married three times. The last time, Laurel said an immortal amazing sentence, "This is also a good excuse to entertain guests."

Once, Illeana violated the driving regulations and was detained for nine hours. Not only did the photographers take pictures of her kissing Laurel after she came out, but they also took pictures of the anxious husband sitting on the steps in front of the prison door with his eyes wide open waiting for his wife.

The newspaper revealed mercilessly the stories of their separation and reunion, which was exactly what he wanted. The funny Laurel gained interesting publicity effect.

According to Carole Lombard, her income in 1937 was $465,000, but the actual amount she could get was only $20,000. The income tax was $297,575, which accounted for a large part. Recently, when someone asked her about her feelings about income tax, did she complain? No, she made a grand speech with great enthusiasm, saying that,

"Twenty thousand dollars is already enough. It is a good thing to contribute most of my income to the government. I will definitely not spend this large sum of $465,000 a year. Why not contribute the money that I can't spend to the government? This is the most legitimate way to spend it. And if there was no such a huge income tax, maybe my income would not be so high. Salaries follow income tax, and if there was no income tax at all, maybe I would not have $20,000 a year."

These words are very beautiful, aren't they? But according to others' estimates, the amount of tax she said was a bit exaggerated. But what made her say these words? Very easy, these words can make people think of her new movie.

Publicity cannot encourage female stars to have children, but it can use her, like Dorothy Lamour. Her lawyer formally notified the company that on her 25th birthday, she would retire from the film industry for a year in order to have a child. This sentence disturbed a lot of people's hearing. Someone advised her to adopt a child. She replied,

"I want a child of my own, not someone else's. I think every married woman should have her own child. This is a responsibility, and I hope to have one before my 25th birthday. In this way, when my child grows up, I can still be very young."

Her 24th birthday passed last December 10th. She is still busy filming at Paramount. Her publicist should be a very smart person.

Marlene Dietrich was known as having the most beautiful legs in Hollywood in the past few years, but at that time she preferred to wear men's clothes and long pants, hiding them away. Later, I don't know when, she gave it up. Long pants are no longer her symbol. Only those who are not very healthy should wear them. The current Dietrich seems to be reminding fans not to forget that her legs are still healthy enough.

After Jean Harlow died, William Powell was very sad. He collected a sum of money dedicated to flowers on her grave. This affectionate move touched many people... Recently, another story came out that Antra Līdze also sends flowers to Jacques—Sonja Henie's skating partner—who died not long ago every day. This story is obviously a bit different. If she had not left a few months before he died and was not currently having a good time with her boyfriend in a nightclub, would this story not be more like the truth?

George Raft's "publicity history" is the most abundant. When he first entered the film industry, he claimed to have taught the then Prince of Wales tango. Later, the Prince ascended the throne and became Edward VIII. This made the publicity even more powerful. After Edward VIII abdicated, George invited him to Hollywood. Whether he came or not is another matter. Like last year, George invited a child—whose mother was sentenced to death for murder—to his home for Christmas—but the boy did not come. But what does it matter? Anyway, George has made enough headlines in the newspapers.

Errol Flynn's words are a bit like "dreaming with his nose pinched". When he first came to Hollywood, he talked wildly about his past adventures, which confused many people. After a while, his stomach was empty, so he changed his direction and talked about his future exploration plans. If you completely believe his words, you are a big fool.

For female stars, half-nakedness and narrow clothes are still the best publicity methods. For the former, Claudette Colbert, Merle Oberon, and Ann Sheridan are competing to show their strangeness. For the latter, after watching Norma Shearer's early movies, it is undoubtedly clear that she occupies the first place.

Even Hedda Hopper, who has always been considered the most humorous in Hollywood, is also using half-naked costumes for publicity.

### Nearly 10,000 Fans Watch the Battle: Chinese League Wins the Lai Wah Cup, Defeating the Western Civil Servants' League 4-2

[This Newspaper Special Report] Yesterday was a holiday, and the fans were all very happy. As soon as 3:00 PM arrived, the Hong Kong Football Club stadium was seen to be full of guests, "business booming". The old men of the General Association were beaming, secretly grateful to the heavens for making it so beautiful. But I don't know if they will be grateful to the 99% Chinese customers, who spare no expense and gather into a pool, thereby obtaining a huge profit.

The ticket income of $2,903, although not the highest record in this season, the fact that Hong Kong's football movement has "resumed prosperity" is a fact.

I think, the country is in great difficulty, and every ordinary person has a responsibility. We "flee into paradise", but we must not forget our motherland. Sir Zhou Shouchen once said that he has been persuading people in Hong Kong to sell $10 million in national salvation bonds, but it is still not enough. What is the reason for this? If people bought bonds as enthusiastically as they watched football games, I believe the results would be better.

Let's put aside the digressions and get back to the main topic. Speaking of this football event, it was the final of the Lai Wah Cup. Winning is very important, so it was so lively and turned the world upside down. If this final did not have a Chinese League team competing in it, and there was no "Oriental Standard Footballer Li Huitang appearing, it would not be so "popular". How prosperous, Hong Kong football!

The Chinese League lacked Song Lingsheng. This boy's ankle injury has not fully recovered. It's not because he retreated before the battle, but because Zeng Zhongyun was used to replace him, forming a lineup similar to last week's International Cup semi-final.

The Western Civil Servants' League had a lot of changes. Gao Shannu was tired of his duties. Perry, O'Neill, George, Liao Yachen, etc. were also absent due to foot injuries. Faria did not know where he went. Four reserves were temporarily used to make up for the lack of numbers, and they had to invite that nameless and clumsy Pratley to play as the right inside forward to make up a lineup. This footballer, who has no relationship with each other, seems to have very mediocre skills, like "he can't be put on the table". But I don't know what he did in his previous lives to be able to appear in this game and be on par with the generals, and he even scored a goal. I really envy him for being lucky. "Mediocre people have their own mediocre blessings". When Pratley was invited, he was first listed on the list, and then the football experience was discussed.

Di Pallo (Hong Kong)

Looking at the above two lineups, it is clear who is stronger and who is weaker. Therefore, it is right for the Chinese League to win and win the championship. But we did not expect that the Western team, whose personnel changed greatly, had many good performances, which surprised the spectators.

Yesterday I said, "Pugger plays inside defense, the most cunning, often attacking and causing the opponent's forward to be offside. Therefore, Huitang must beware of the traps set by Pugger when advancing from the middle. "Sure enough, Pugger used this trick again. Although experienced as Huitang, he was still trapped several times. Not to mention Hou Chengtang, who is accustomed to being offside.

Pugger's positional warfare is indeed skillful, and Blackburn, who is in harmony with him, is also an expert. Therefore, the two performed together, showing their skills. The Western team did not lose too much, thanks to the efforts of these two. Harrison fixed Huitang and followed every step of the way, which can be said to be responsible. However, Huitang was still able to penetrate independently and shoot from the side, winning the fourth goal and icing on the cake. The victory situation tended to stabilize, which shows that Huitang does have the ability to reach the peak, and no one can watch him closely. However, his performance yesterday was not the best, because the field was wet and muddy. Every time he ran, he felt unstable and it was not easy to find a way out. The other members also often had a "I can't get through" sigh.

The foreigners' strength is generally better than ours. Moreover, in a police ball situation, the offensive side is bound to be more strenuous than the defensive side. In yesterday's battle, the Chinese League was often in an offensive position, and the purpose of the front players was of course to complete the last kick. However, the field was slippery and the ball was heavy, making progress difficult. The Western defenders relied on danger to resist, which was easy to defend. They were also strong enough and took advantage of the slippery battle. Therefore, although the Chinese League often took the offensive, it was because the triangular short pass guard, which they were good at, did not work as well as they wanted, so it was difficult to win. However, the Chinese League finally won with better skills. Although the general situation was unfavorable, they had the advantage of harmony, and each relied on skilled skills to overcome difficulties and finally win the championship.

The Western team was soft in the front and hard in the back, which was obviously a deformed situation. Therefore, in this situation, it was fortunate for them to avoid losing too many goals. If they wanted to win, it would be impossible without an accident. Therefore, it was their success to be able to keep the goal difference not too large.

The Chinese League's cone-shaped assault line failed to succeed in yesterday's battle, but the wing attack on both sides had great effect. Therefore, activities were often seen between the inside and outside wings.

Liang Rongzhao of the forward line did the most to cover the progress of the front line. Zeng Zhongyun and Xu Jingcheng also had many good performances, but Jingcheng's ball-handling skills were still lacking. It is best to practice using the right foot more, which may make up for this shortcoming. Li Tiansheng and Hou Rongsheng, the two inside guards, were able to be skilled in their work because of the arch guard in front. Tan Junkun's second loss was quite a joke. Was it because the ball was slippery and heavy, causing him to lose his hand? Therefore, although the Chinese League won the championship, the merits and demerits must be clearly distinguished. This is also the meaning of the sages of the Spring and Autumn Period.

First half

(Eight minutes) The four players were very brave, rushing forward and attacking our position. Leonard responded in the middle and passed a wonderful pass to Di Pallo, who copied into the hinterland, raised his foot and shot. Junkun dived to save, but the ball broke out. Before Junkun could turn around, Easttrange ambushed in front of the goal and took the opportunity to break through the first pass (1-0).

(Thirteen minutes) The Chinese League attacked fiercely. Jingxiang and Zhaorong attacked the goal one after another, but unfortunately the ball fell out of bounds and they returned without success.

(Twenty-one minutes) The Western team launched a five-way attack. "Stone Boy" Yirongsheng was fierce and abnormal, driving away the uninvited guests. Zhaorong got his supply and passed it to Jingxiang. "Magic legs" dribbled the ball to the right, and Guangsen contained a coin and sprinted quickly. The "little monkey" Chengtang shot into the city like an arrow, raised his foot and dragged. Blackburn came late, and Gollos wanted to save but could not. The ball went into the net (1-1) and reached a tie.

(Twenty-seven minutes) Huitang shot at the goal in the enemy's formation, and Pugger blocked it out of bounds. Guangsen opened a corner kick, which was obtained by Chengtang. Because the door was blocked, there was no chance to shoot. He quickly passed it to Jingcheng. Jingcheng passed it to Rongzhao again. At this time, the Western team's guard paid attention to the Chinese League's front line, but did not expect Rongzhao to shoot from a distance. The poisonous arrow came straight and hit the bullseye, taking the lead with (2-1).

(Thirty-four minutes) Jingcheng saved the ball on the front line and kicked the ball diagonally. It was obtained by Morse, who fired a cannon. Junkun jumped high to catch it, but the ball fell to the ground. Pratley stepped forward and slammed into it with his waist. The ball went into the net again, making it (2-2). The viewers had complaints about Junkun's loss.

(Forty-four minutes) Huitang dribbled the ball quickly and advanced. Norf committed a foul and was penalized with a free kick. Rongzhao took the shot and passed it lightly to Chengtang. Blackburn and Chengtang entangled. The gesture was inadvertently, and he was penalized with a penalty kick. Huitang took the penalty and the ball went into the net, scoring another goal (3-2).

Second half

The generals of the Chinese League did not dare to delay because the victory was not stable. They fought desperately. Within 20 minutes, they forced five corner kicks in a row. Grass and trees were all soldiers under the Western team's city.

(Twenty-two minutes) Chengtang forced a corner kick, which was taken by Jingcheng. The ball fell in front of the goal, and Pugger headed it out with an iron head. Zhaorong followed the ball and attacked the goal quickly. Unexpectedly, he was too hasty, and the ball crossed the crossbar and fell out of bounds.

After that, taking advantage of the Chinese League's empty defense, Pugger passed the ball to Morse. Rong Sheng was knocked to the ground during the interception. Morse quickly passed it to Di Pallo, who was unguarded. Junkun saw that Tiansheng could not catch up and gave up the city to rescue him. He obtained the ball from Di Pallo's feet in time, and Jiangshan began to protect.

(Thirty-two minutes) Zhaorong lost a big chance in the counterattack. After a while, Guangsen got it on the border. He dribbled in front of him and moved forward a few steps, passing it diagonally to Huitang. In order to avoid the opponent's entanglement, Huitang went straight to the right and rushed forward. He shot a ball diagonally at the corner of the goal, which happened to be in the right place (becoming 4-2). The game ended and the Chinese League won and won the championship.

Mrs. Smith, the Financial Secretary, personally awarded the prizes. Li Huitang, the captain of the Chinese League, received the Lai Wah Cup from the two sessions on behalf of the team, shouted three times, and dispersed.

### Men's Basketball Tournament: Group A Oriental Defeats Kwongta; Group B Pui Ying, Overseas Chinese Triumph; Three Games to be Held This Evening

The public men's basketball tournament, the first match yesterday afternoon was Group B Hua Hsiung versus Pui Ying. Both teams are strong contenders in Group B, and their strengths were evenly matched, making the game intense. In the first half, Pui Ying took the lead with 19 to 11. In the second half, Hua Hsiung made a strong comeback, even leading by one point at one time. In the last fifteen minutes, the two sides were evenly matched, tying three times at 26-26, 28-28, and 30-30. Three minutes before the end of the game, Pui Ying scored consecutively, thus winning 38-30. In the second match, Group A Oriental versus Kwongta, the former had shown its brilliance many times in the Hong Kong basketball scene, and the strength of its lineup was admired by all. The latter also had many good players from Guangdong and Hong Kong, and its strength was also considerable. In this match, although Kwongta suffered a major defeat with 71 to 44, it had only lost by a narrow margin of 19 to 20 in the preliminary round. Until the end of the first half, it was still closely following with 19 to 24. However, after the start of the second half, it suffered a complete collapse, resulting in a one-sided situation. The reason for the disastrous defeat was purely due to the ineffective defense of the two guards, repeatedly falling into the opponent's trap. Every time Oriental's Fung Nim-wah, Tsui Hang, and Wong Ting-fan attacked, they formed a triangular formation, using their fast passing and flexible positioning, and winning with the feint of attacking from the east and striking from the west, making Kwongta's Leung and Ng guards fall into their trap, busy with defense. Unexpectedly, Oriental had already flown in from the sky and rushed straight to the basket, calmly shooting in. Kwongta's players' inaccurate shooting and lack of composure were also fatal flaws. Later, adopting long-range shooting methods was even more of a miscalculation. Regarding Oriental's victory, Fung Nim-wah deserves the most credit, scoring 14 goals himself, with excellent shooting and interception. Tsui Hang's overall performance was also brilliant. The other players all fulfilled their duties. As for Kwongta's forwards and guards, although they had considerable talent, they had not yet reached the stage of perfection, resulting in the entire team failing to launch a surprising and victorious strategy, undoubtedly losing due to inferior skills. However, the strategic failure is also undeniable.

In this match, apart from Kwongta's Leung Kit-fu opening the scoring with the first goal, Oriental dominated afterwards. Tsui Hang, Nim-wah, and Wong Ting-fan scored successively, making the score 10 to 7. It was not until Leung Kit-fu, Leung Kong-keung, and Lo Tung broke through the defenses that the score was forced into a situation of 10 to 10 and 19 to 14. Afterwards, the two sides competed fiercely. Until the end of the first half, Oriental only led by 24 to 19. Switching sides and fighting again, Kwongta's defense was in urgent need. Tsui Hang took advantage of a counterattack, making the score 32 to 23. When Yuen Yi-chiu fouled out, Kwongta's defense became even more vulnerable. Oriental successively broke through Kwongta's entire formation with 41 to 35 and 57 to 37. Although Kwongta's Leung and Cheng forwards occasionally shot, Oriental's Tsui also responded in kind. However, until the end of the game, Oriental won by a large margin of 73 to 44. In the last match, Group B Overseas Chinese versus Hung Chi, the strength of the two teams was disparate, and the outcome was predictable. The battle gradually became one-sided, and as a result, Overseas Chinese won by a large margin of 70 to 16.

### Semi-Stagnation, Transportation Difficulties, High Timber Prices, Export Trade Reduced by 40%

The Hong Kong camphor wood industry has always been stable and its business has been quite developed. In terms of Hong Kong's foreign trade, this industry also occupies an important position. The average annual export value is approximately over 770,000. According to a survey, there are no less than 50 camphor wood shops of various sizes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The main source of camphor wood is the Kwangsi, Kweichow, and Yunnan area, followed by Canton and Chaochow. The price of camphor wood before the war was about 15 or 16 dollars per hundred feet. However, due to the war, transportation in various parts of the mainland has become difficult, so the price of wood has slightly increased, estimated to be about 15% per hundred feet. After the increase in wood prices, the production costs of the shops in the industry have increased. At the same time, because the price of goods cannot be increased, the business of the shops on the Hong Kong side is in a state of semi-stagnation, with an estimated reduction of about 20%. Export trade has decreased by more than 40%. The export of camphor wood is mainly to the territories of the United Kingdom and the United States, with an average of over one million dollars per year. The French and Dutch territories also account for tens of thousands of dollars.

### The Two Laws for Appreciating Spectator Sports

— Lo Hsia

Dr. Thorndike is a modern educational psychologist. Since he invented the "Three Laws of Learning," many people have used these three laws of learning to deduce many theorems and various matters. As a result, those who applied this method have achieved considerable success. Now I will use these three laws of learning to talk about the three laws of watching sports. I will let everyone know what kind of mindset one should have when watching various sports competitions.

(1) Law of Readiness—Whenever a game has not yet started, we should have a kind of readiness in our minds to appreciate this game. That is to say, we are not watching this game as "joining in the fun" or as "entertainment," but with a mindset of researching and testing our own observation and critical abilities. First, we should think about which team will win this game, which team will lose, and what the score difference between the winner and loser will be. We should have a preparation to predict it. Secondly, we should think about whether each player's performance this time will be successful or unsuccessful, and whether the team's passing, shooting, and communication are excellent or poor. We should also have an observation and critique. This is the law of readiness that we should have before the game starts.

(2) Law of Exercise, or Law of Use and Disuse—As an example of the general principle of natural selection, "Use it and it will advance to success, disuse it and it will become regression." That is to say, the more we practice watching games, the more we increase our own observational and critical skills. Conversely, if we watch fewer games, or if there are spectators who don't know how to watch games, they will misunderstand the referee's calls or misinterpret players' illegal actions, thus creating many disputes and conflicts caused by the audience. This problem is often found in Hong Kong. Most of these people do not understand the true purpose of watching games, so the second law of learning is saying that we should not just go to watch games, but should also practice watching games more often, so that we can truly gain accurate understanding and criticism.

(3) Law of Effect, or Law of Satisfaction and Annoyance—How do you feel after watching this game? Satisfied or annoyed? If you feel satisfied, then you will often go to watch games in the future. Just like a child gets candy for crying, then he will often cry in the future, because he will get something, which will become a habit, and with a habit, he will be satisfied. Conversely, if he doesn't get candy, he won't cry, and he will be annoyed. So, the third law of effect is the most important. We need to see good teams performing, good techniques being demonstrated, and good sportsmanship being rewarded. Only then will we produce good results and truly understand the essence of the law of effect.

### The Effectiveness of Morning Exercises (4)

— Cho Yue

(Seven)

Has the effectiveness of maintaining health and increasing lifespan

In the old society of the past, the general elderly people believed that sports belonged to play and were the business of young people. Even it was better if young people didn't do it. If grown-ups did it, it was inelegant. Where do we see that? Everyone can often see that when the elderly see adults, whether they are jumping, running, or playing with children, they will surely say with contempt, "Are you still young? You're too immature!" From this, we can know that they underestimate or do not understand sports too much, and they do not know that sports training has a lot to do with them, the elderly. "Morning exercises" is one of the most important of these. I believe everyone has the desire to "prolong life." Qin Shi Huang sought immortals, enduring countless hardships and spending countless money and manpower, until his death. This is his foolish behavior and must be a warning to us. I honestly tell everyone that there is no way to seek longevity, but there is a way to not grow old. What ordinary people call "white hair and youthful face" is what I call "not growing old." It is about everyone's "health" and "spirit." For example, although you are sixty or seventy years old this year, your health and spirit are like those of a thirty or forty year old, or even better than those of a thirty or forty year old. This is what I mean by "not growing old." I dare say that there is a guaranteed formula for seeking this kind of not growing old. Is this formula a secret? No, it is public. Now I am about to make it public to everyone. Just be patient, persistent, and constantly practice it. What exactly is this formula? I have already said it before, it is "morning exercises." Everyone who practices morning exercises can maintain health and increase lifespan. Therefore, if we want to achieve the desire of "prolonging life," we must be able to earnestly practice "morning exercises" every morning. (Eight) Has the effectiveness of increasing production

The amount of production does not necessarily depend on too much working time, but on the spirit of working at the right time, as has been proven by predecessors. As for where the spirit comes from, it naturally comes from a strong body, and it is also necessary to have adequate rest and cultivation. The so-called cultivation is to reduce fatigue on the one hand and to increase excitement on the other. From this point of view, the fundamental ability of production is a sound body and an enthusiastic spirit. Only with a sound body and so on can there be abundant productive capacity, and only when the productive capacity is strong will production increase. Since "morning exercises" have the effectiveness of maintaining health, people can recover from fatigue, etc., and indirectly, of course, they can also have the effectiveness of increasing production.

Compatriots, everyone thinks that in this time of national crisis, we should nurture healthy children to contribute to the national revival. Don't think of my words as empty talk, and every adult should practically take the burden of children's physical training on their shoulders again, and even more so, encourage others to reverse weakness. This is the great fortune of the family. (The End)

### Talking About Umbrellas

— Li Dan

After several days of continuous rain, groups of umbrellas floated on the streets, and leisurely footsteps moved under the umbrellas.

Umbrellas are a relatively popular item here. It is said that this trend came from the rainy and foggy British capital. Because people in London like to carry umbrellas, people all over Britain like to carry umbrellas, so the British here also like to carry umbrellas, so the Chinese here also like to carry umbrellas. This reason is probably quite sufficient.

The British like umbrellas very much, just as they like to raise dogs. It is true of both the government and the public, from the emperor to the common people. Among them, Chamberlain's fondness for umbrellas is the most famous. From the photos in magazines to the cartoons in newspapers, we can see that Chamberlain is inseparable from umbrellas. Although we cannot say that wherever there is an umbrella, there is Chamberlain, it is a fact that wherever there is Chamberlain, there must be an umbrella. Therefore, when we see an umbrella, we think of Chamberlain, and when we think of Chamberlain, we will not forget the umbrella.

An umbrella is a tool for rain protection. On a rainy day, a person can hide under an umbrella. Although it is cramped and dim, it is at least a temporary stroke of luck. In Europe today, which is full of storms, Chamberlain's hand is never far from his umbrella, and he has his reasons.

When Germany and Italy formed the Fascist Axis, and Hitler's executioner, General Goering, delivered a "bombing speech," roughly saying that if the great powers tried to prevent Germany's intentions, Germany would not hesitate to immediately mobilize and fight to the death. As soon as this speech came out, the whole of Europe was enveloped in an atmosphere of storm.

Just like the residents of Hong Kong in these rainy days, they carried their umbrellas and ran back and forth.

However, in that cramped and dim life under the umbrella, although he himself was not drenched, he watched others become drowned rats. He watched Austria merge into the territory of Germany, and he watched Czechoslovakia become a sacrifice for peace. Under that narrow umbrella, there is no room to shield others besides sheltering oneself. However, the storms seem to be getting fiercer and fiercer. Whether a weak umbrella can bear this important task is already a question, even if it is only used to shield one person.

This is not the time to be stubborn. The continuous wind and rain not only shook Europe, but also long ago, crazily, ravaged our country. Many soldiers have already abandoned their umbrellas, steel helmets have replaced umbrella covers, and bayonets have replaced umbrella handles. They brave the storms of the brutish enemy, stand up and advance bravely, until the clear and warm sky renews our land——the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth.

### About Alexei Tolstoy By Konstantin Paustovsky

— Translated by Chiu

Besides being one of the greatest writers of the new century, A. Tolstoy is the inheritor of the glorious tradition left by Pushkin, Gogol, Chekhov, and Gorky.

The first impression when reading his works - the touch of a keen and powerful talent - is indelible. It will immediately firmly grasp people's imagination.

A. Tolstoy has keen eyes, sharp ears, a lively and extraordinary language, and a rare understanding of the people.

Tolstoy reveals a vast world, a world full of color, freshness, and ideals, a world belonging to people of many eras, from Peter the Great to the socialist era. He opens our eyes to an extremely rich array of characters - often vivid, often touching our heartstrings, often inspiring our emotions, evoking laughter and joy, sorrow and indignation.

Tolstoy's writing career is complete and multifaceted, with entirely unique characteristics. This career is a living and keen heart, coupled with that successful, fearless, and determined effort to find the best way of expression; sometimes there are unavoidable mistakes, the mistakes of a great talent, which slightly diminish the glory of victory. This is a glorious and arduous literary undertaking for the people.

Tolstoy's writing range is so broad, he uses his pen so richly, as if nothing has been left out. Few writers can touch on such broad topics and be so perfect. His works include history ("Peter the Great", "The Days of Peter", "The Book of Love"), imagination ("Aelita", "The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin"), civil war ("The Road to Calvary", "The Coward", "Nikita's Childhood"), children's stories ("Buratino"), powerful and stern stories about the resistance of the Tsarists ("Grain"), the painful fate of self-sacrificing Russian women ("Masyaa", "Under the Old Linden Tree"), Western stories ("Ancient Road", "Black Gold"), and countless other interesting stories, permeated with the atmosphere of wheat fields, gardens, and deep rivers.

Scholars, within a certain range, often become poets. They have keen emotions, which are based on their idealistic courage, their thinking, and their discoveries. Scientific laws are often deduced by the strong and creative imagination of mutually separate and unconnected things. This imagination succeeds in both scientists and writers. Moreover - looking deeply, there is a great common ground between the two. For example, Kepler, who discovered the great laws of celestial mechanics, and Goethe, who created "Faust," have the same creative imagination.

True scientists and writers are blood brothers. They show the beauty of life in science and art, and they both have good knowledge of both.

Tolstoy's language is very clear and close to the people, full of simple strength and deep meaning. Today, there is probably no other writer who has such an organic feeling for the Russian language as Tolstoy. He uses his language as naturally and easily as the people use their fingers and voices.

Tolstoy learned language from the purest and richest source - from the ordinary people.

Therefore, he loves folk art and folk traditions. Therefore, he recently engaged in the work of collecting Soviet folk tales, which has real scientific value.

### The Battle of Huai De

— By Du Wenyi

——A Record of a Night Attack on the Imperial Army——

Night had fallen. The stars in the darkness kept watch. In this dense lychee orchard, the darkness and silence seemed even more profound. It was time for us to move out. The brothers were rolling up their bedding and putting it into a deeply dug hole. Everyone re-formed into a small circle. A solemn, deathly atmosphere enveloped the surroundings, shining on the dark faces of each brother. In these ten-odd days of night fighting, we had become accustomed to identifying everything without lights, especially since this was our hometown. Although everyone's body was very thin, after this day's rest, we had recovered. Especially since today's attack was because our ammunition and food were almost exhausted, everyone looked a little excited and cheerful.

Battalion Commander Chen was the leader of this guerrilla detachment. He was the commander of the Self-Defense Corps and had previously served as a battalion commander. He had suppressed the Communists on the Jiangxi border and had experienced many large and small civil wars. He was quite experienced in combat. Although he was nearly fifty years old, his physique was still as strong as a young man. He had always been a righteous and courageous person. Therefore, after the enemy entered Dongguan City, he led a company of brothers to fight the enemy until only thirty-two men remained in their ranks, then reluctantly retreated to the countryside to replenish their forces. However, the people had all fled. Everything was searched and plundered by the enemy. But Battalion Commander Chen's will was so firm that he inspired this detachment with his spirit. He was unwilling to leave his homeland, so he led this detachment to be active in the villages near the Wan Tai Highway.

He stood up solemnly and said: "Brothers! Are you feeling refreshed?" The comrades said excitedly: "Yes, Commander Chen."

He continued: "I believe you all understand the mission of our attack tonight. Our ammunition is running out! Our food is running out! Our supply depends entirely on whether we can defeat the enemy! Whether we can seize the enemy's bullets and food... Today I received a report that the enemy now has only a small team stationed in Huai De Township, and there is a lot of food and bullets. We already have the head of that township as an inside agent. When we see the oil lamp on the township office flicker, you will launch an attack in three directions. The × army is stationed in the Huang Family Ancestral Hall. We will divide into several small groups and sneak into nearby civilian houses via small paths, first killing his sentries——"

Our detachment began to move in the dark lychee orchard. There was not a single human sound, only the rustling sound of leaves brushing against guns and bodies. We ran out of the lychee orchard, passed a few rugged mountain slopes. We dropped onto the Wan Tai Highway. We walked along the roadside with our bodies crouched. The stars in the night sky, like ghostly spirits, kept shining in our eyes, as if welcoming our column of darkness.

After half an hour, we arrived at Huai De. In the darkness, we could vaguely see the shadows of countless dark old houses surrounded by a belt of orchards. We split into three small teams and crawled into the village on our knees along every small path beside the orchards. We quietly climbed up some lychee trees and hid in the attics of some deserted houses.

The village was deathly silent. After the × army was stationed here, the corpses of those who had been raped and murdered floated in the shining ponds, decaying and stinking on the roadsides and in the houses. The smell of rotting flesh made us feel a little nauseous. Rats moved around the village, chewing on the bones and scraps of dead dogs on the stone slabs of the streets. Some corpses, unwilling to be humiliated, hung from ancient wells and lychee trees. The village was completely filled with the marks of death, a gloomy and desolate scene, as if it were a bombed cemetery and a battlefield after a robbery.

The night was getting deeper. The Huang Family Ancestral Hall was completely plunged into darkness and silence. Suddenly, there was a light on the township office opposite; it kept flickering intermittently. It was time to attack. We prepared our guns and untied the grenades. We aimed at the Huang Family Ancestral Hall. Another corner of the village was burning. A clear whistle broke through the deathly silence of the village. This was our attack signal.

The imperial army peered out from the gate of the Huang Family Ancestral Hall, and our guns fired at them. One after another, they fell to the ground. We surrounded them on all sides. They hid in the house and stubbornly resisted. Machine guns fired from the windows. We threw the hand grenades. "Boom boom boom——" After a burst of explosions, white smoke billowed into the night sky. Dust and shredded meat flew around. Fire was burning here and there.

Battalion Commander Chen's assembly whistle sounded. Our team gathered again. He counted the number of people and found that only one comrade had a slight injury to his hand. He ordered us to disperse.

Half an hour later, we moved ten boxes of bullets, seven bags of rice, and five boxes of canned food, countless banknotes, military coupons, and clothes taken from the enemy soldiers. Shoes, and several small steel cannons, rifles, machine guns, horses, etc. Everyone was very excited, because this victory had provided us with so many treasures!

The villagers had all run away, and even the township head who was our inside agent had disappeared. Some of us put the spoils on the horses and returned to our earthen cave in the lychee orchard.

We set the village on fire. Before dawn, our team left the village. On the small slope on the way back, we looked back at Huai De Township and saw only a bright red tongue of fire flashing and jumping in the darkness. Its brilliance not only illuminated the darkness of the night sky and the dawn, but also illuminated the future of the Chinese nation's liberation. The light of this spark will be like the golden morning sun; illuminating every corner of China, and driving away the darkness of the whole world!

### Snow in Manchuria

— By Shu Qun

After accepting this gratitude, he did everything possible to comfort her. So, he covered her collar, covering her cheeks, and he sent her scattered strands of hair inside her collar, and then he prepared to guide her on a journey to an unknown destination.

Before leaving, he shone the flashlight on the maid at his feet—as peaceful as if she were asleep; only her breathing was uneven, and only her hands kept moving in the space, as if searching for her soul that had been scattered by the shock. He gently touched her twice with his foot, to bid her farewell, and to wish her well after the separation; because he left her with a lot of material for conversation.

He and she walked out of the house door and the room door calmly, and quickly walked to the end of the small path in the courtyard. This small path was not as long as when he came, as if there was only the distance of one step when he left. When he and she passed the courtyard gate, the gatekeeper became suspicious and asked her:

"Miss, it's dark, are you still going out?"

He didn't let her answer, he immediately said:

"Not going out, just walking to the gate?"

After hearing this, the gatekeeper recognized that the person who answered was the noble and arrogant guest who had just arrived, so he did not dare to ask any more questions. He did his best to ease the guest's inexplicable anger, and he smiled:

"I mean, why walk if you're going out!"

"Why crawl if you're not walking?"

"Sir, I mean, the mansion has a car; doesn't the young lady always ride in a car?"

"Why have legs if you're riding in a car?"

The gatekeeper always yielded to rude guests, he had no choice but to be rude. His rudeness was only for guests who yielded. Because he remembered that rude guests were often independent of the master and had other dependencies; conversely, they often had other intentions and were waiting for the master's attention.

"Sir, please go!"

Afterwards, he bowed, indicating that he was willing to be polite to the rude person; so as not to be rudely scolded by the master. (19)
