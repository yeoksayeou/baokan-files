### United Anglo-American-French Front Against Japan

That the United States, Great Britain, and France should unite to confront Japan, the common enemy, is today an objective reality, an unavoidable necessity.

Several illusions of the Japanese aggressors in their war of aggression against China have now been shattered one by one. First, a "quick victory" is absolutely impossible; second, the complete conquest of China has become a complete fantasy; third, begging third countries to mediate has completely become a thing of the past; and fourth, the poisonous scheme of enticing Chinese traitors has not made much progress.

The Japanese aggressors, being in such a dilemma, naturally want to try again a military adventure to break this deadlock. They cannot end the Sino-Japanese War and conquer China soon, but they resent the assistance of third countries such as Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to China's resistance against Japan. In particular, they believe that Great Britain, the United States, and France no longer have the obligation to protect their interests in China, and under the pretext that Great Britain, the United States, and France continue to aid China, they openly declare that it is necessary to expel the rights and interests and influence of Great Britain, the United States, and France from the Far East. Japan particularly emphasizes that the concession areas of Great Britain, the United States, and France are bases for resisting Japan and opposing Japan. Although this is only an excuse, the fact is that they want to expel the political power of Great Britain, the United States, and France from China. This is an inevitable trend following the trampling of the economic power of Great Britain, the United States, and France in China.

But at present, Japan's expulsion of the political power of Great Britain, the United States, and France in China is only the first step, still a tentative attitude. In this tentative probing lies a great crisis. If Great Britain, the United States, and France ignore this point and allow Japan to act recklessly again, the aggressors will become more and more demanding. If Great Britain, the United States, and France relax slightly on the occupation of Gulangyu, the safety of concessions such as Shanghai and Tianjin cannot be guaranteed. The Gulangyu issue is indeed an important touchstone for whether Great Britain, the United States, and France can maintain their interests in China. The best way to deal with Japan's occupation of Gulangyu is for Great Britain, the United States, and France to unite to confront it. The Japanese army landed on Gulangyu and acted recklessly. It has been over a week, and as of yesterday, the United States, Great Britain and France have lacked practical action other than empty protests. This is very disappointing to us. But according to today's announcement from the British Admiralty, British, American and French warships have each sent 42 sailors to land on Gulangyu, and their total number is evenly matched with the Japanese soldiers who landed there. The British side has also issued a serious warning to Japan by Admiral Noble, the naval commander. This is the first step in the concrete manifestation of Great Britain, the United States, and France defending their interests in China. I believe that Great Britain, the United States, and France can continue to do this, and their political rights and interests in China can be maintained.

Japan's several disturbances to the concessions of Great Britain, the United States, and France were originally intended to intimidate and probe, so if Great Britain, the United States, and France can resist strongly and pay attention to practical and effective methods to deal with it, they can force Japan to retreat without much effort. Today's Reuters Gulangyu telegram said: "Most of the Japanese Marines who landed on Gulangyu withdrew last night." Needless to say, this is the result of the joint adoption of effective measures by Great Britain, the United States, and France. The only way to deal with crazy aggressors is through tough measures, because aggressors are mostly fierce on the outside but weak on the inside, especially Eastern aggressors, because of their internal contradictions—such as the opposition of elders, senior officials, steady military personnel, and some financial groups to excessive risks and separation from Great Britain, the United States, and France, while only young military personnel and representatives of the media strongly advocate being tough and reckless against third countries—they naturally cannot be reckless to the end. Cheng Yaojin's three axes can only scare the weak, but if he encounters a strong opponent, he only needs to parry a little, and he will abandon his armor and run away.

However, the Anglo-American-French united front against Japan cannot be temporary, it must be sustainable, because the occupation of Gulangyu is not just a local problem, but a problem related to the overall situation.

### Review of the Strength of the Aggressors

— Zhao Mei

Germany's Economy Cannot Sustain Long-Term Warfare

The famous American economic magazine "The Analyst" published an article analyzing in detail the economy of Fascist Germany. The magazine said:

"Foreign trade is a relatively weak link in the entire German economy. In 1938, Germany's imports exceeded exports by 432.4 million marks. Germany does not have sufficient gold and foreign currency reserves, and import surpluses are indeed a serious problem for Germany."

The magazine went on to say that acquiring Austria and the Sudetenland not only did not alleviate Germany's difficulties in foreign trade, but on the contrary, strengthened them. "It should be remembered that in 1936, Austria consumed half of its raw materials imported from abroad, while Germany only imported one-fifth of its raw materials at that time. The dependence on imported raw materials in the Sudetenland is no less than that of Austria. After acquiring Austria and the Sudetenland, Germany's food problem has become increasingly acute. Austria's agriculture can only meet 73-74 percent of the country's food consumption, while Germany's agriculture only meets 82 percent. Austria has to import 40 percent of its wheat consumption, most of its meat and other important foods. The Sudetenland is an industrial area that requires more food imports. At the same time, exports from Austria and the Sudetenland have decreased since these areas were seized by Germany." The magazine continued: "It is quite obvious that Germany cannot sustain this steady loss of trade for long." After carefully calculating Germany's gold and foreign currency reserves, the magazine concluded: "On the surface, it seems that Germany also has some slight savings, but in fact, the amount is very small and cannot compensate for the loss in foreign trade as in 1938. Germany is trying to reduce the difference between exports and imports by either reducing imports, increasing exports, or adjusting both."

Discussing whether Germany can reduce imports, the magazine said that if this is possible, then the main goal is to further reduce food imports, especially fats and oils. As for industrial raw materials, since the establishment of the Fascist regime, although the Fascists have shouted the so-called "Four-Year Plan," Germany's dependence on imported industrial raw materials has not only not decreased, but has also increased sharply. The magazine published an interesting statistical table showing the changes in raw material imports in Germany in the years since the establishment of the Fascist policy. If the import index in 1933 is set at 100 percent, then in 1938, Germany's imports of raw iron increased to 418 percent, non-ferrous metals increased to 154 percent, cotton increased to 83 percent, wool increased to 88 percent, leather increased to 86 percent, kerosene increased to 185 percent, flax increased to 117 percent, and rubber increased to 181 percent. "Even if it is possible to reduce the amount of imports to a certain extent, its expenditure will not decrease due to the increase in the value of raw materials in the world market."

"The Analyst" commented on Germany's exports, saying that the future is absolutely bleak. First, the movement to boycott German goods has intensified, especially after Germany excluded Jews. Second, competition from other countries has intensified, forcing Germany to sell its goods at low prices. Germany's trade methods have led other countries to take countermeasures. For example, the United States plans to take countermeasures against Germany's exports to South American countries. The increase in the British export fund proves that Britain intends to intensify competition. The conclusion of a new trade agreement between Britain and the United States and the fall in the market price of the pound sterling also prove to be unfavorable to German trade.

The magazine concluded: "Although trying to solve the difficulties may change Germany's trade, there is no doubt that the trade future will not give the Fascist German authorities comfort. The difference between Germany's exports and imports is undoubtedly a more serious threat to Germany's plan to carry out military and national defense plans with the previous level of industrial production in the future. This also explains that Germany cannot expect to fight a smooth war or conduct long-term resistance if it is subjected to economic pressure.

German People's Anti-Fascist Movement

German capital is now launching a new and unprecedented attack on the living standards and basic rights of the working class. The Fascists are preparing for war like madmen, placing the entire burden on the shoulders of the laborers, especially the workers.

New laws have been implemented in Germany, extending working hours in various industrial sectors to ten hours, and even to fourteen hours in "particularly important" (i.e., military and military-related industrial sectors). Of course, most industrial sectors now belong to this category. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently even demanded the implementation of an eighteen-hour work system.

Under the slogan of "rationalization," the Fascists are attacking the workers, who are waging a stubborn struggle. The Fascists are trying to extinguish this struggle with cruel terror. Strikes are prohibited, and workers who participate in strikes are severely punished. But the workers still find practical ways to oppose Fascist "rationalization," which is to reduce the speed of work. This is a secret method of striking, which is quite effective in the struggle to improve treatment.

Anti-Fascist newspapers published abroad are full of successes in Germany using this method. For example, a miner wrote: "In Upper Silesia, workers are actively implementing the slogan of slow work. Every kilogram of extra coal, every hour of extra work, is beneficial to the war. We don't want war."

The situation of workers building military defense projects is particularly difficult. Tens of thousands of workers are building fortresses on the western border of Germany. Their lives are very hard, simply terrible. Unemployed workers in Germany are well aware of the hardships of fortress work, so they refuse to work. Usually, they are forced to go. This is how it is done! The labor market notifies unemployed workers that they must report to the station at the designated time. When they arrive at the station, they are loaded onto special trains, guarded by heavy soldiers, and driven to the border. If the workers do not arrive, the police will go to his house that day, tie him up, and force him to the border.

Trains carrying unemployed workers to the west are called "trains for the condemned." The scene of those who are sent off saying goodbye to their relatives at the station is very tragic. Anti-Fascist demonstrations often form. Later, the Fascist stormtroopers prohibited relatives from seeing them off on the platform.

Many workers engaged in the construction of defense works cannot bear the harsh conditions and have fled to foreign countries or back to the interior. If they do not escape and fall into the hands of the police, then they will be押往forced into a concentration camp or shot. The prisons of Trier and Aachen are already overcrowded. Aachen is currently building a large prison.

Working hours for fortress engineering are no less than fourteen hours a day, and wages do not exceed the relief money for unemployed workers.

Dissatisfaction with the Fascist regime is growing among all levels of the German people. The Anti-Fascist movement is surging. A large number of Anti-Fascist leaflets are being distributed in major German cities. One leaflet in Berlin wrote: "The German people do not want war. Industry should always manufacture useful goods. Raise wages! Down with Goering's food substitutes!" It is signed "German People's Front." Another leaflet distributed in Dortmund wrote: "Citizens of Dortmund! Now everyone understands: Hitler wants war. If a world war breaks out, Hitler will be the culprit. Long live the German Democratic People's Republic," signed: "Dortmund Anti-Fascists"

In many coal mines in Upper Silesia, a large number of such leaflets have recently been distributed: "Demand a raise in wages, don't dig a pound of coal or cast a pound of copper for war arsonists"!

A large number of leaflets called for aid to the Spanish people. Recently, there was also the following fact: Not long ago, Hitler went to Saarbrücken. On the night before he arrived, red slogans appeared on the windows of the local theater where Hitler would speak: "The time for reckoning has come." The police were unable to catch the person who wrote the slogans.

The fighting spirit of the German workers has not been destroyed. The Anti-Fascist movement is unfolding in Germany, and this movement is increasingly including more and more broad masses of workers.

Economic Crisis in Japan, Germany and Italy

The recent development of the world economic crisis in the fascist aggressor countries is adapting to the war by transforming their economies. The strong demand for military raw materials, the wars being waged in China, Spain, and Abyssinia, these situations have considerably prevented the outbreak of general overproduction. However, due to the difficulty of selling their commodities in the world market, and due to their lack of cash to purchase sufficient raw materials, the production of these countries, especially the production of non-military industries, has also been greatly reduced recently!

Germany

In Germany, Hitler's bandits have always been shouting that the economy under the fascist system will not suffer a crisis. Although Germany's war economy has prevented overproduction to some extent, the development of the German economy has finally reached the point where Hitler's bandits are about to be engulfed in the world economic crisis. This is first manifested in the financial crisis. The market prices of stocks in the stock exchange have been greatly reduced. Due to the renewed increase in the inheritance tax, various stocks have been sold off in large quantities. The price of the mark has been greatly reduced abroad, and Germany has embarked on the road of inflation. According to the statistics of the "New World Forum" weekly, we see the following situation: Statistics of German currency circulation (in millions of marks)

Circulation of Paper Money  Circulation of Coins  Total

December 1932  4141  1501  5642

December 1937  5884  1615  7499

June 1938  6830  1636  8466

This shows that the amount of currency in circulation has increased by 2824 million marks compared with before Hitler's dictatorship. Inflation inevitably reduces the purchasing power of the mark, coupled with the sharp reduction in Germany's national income, which has a serious impact on the German economy. What about Germany's foreign trade? The competition from Britain, the United States, and other countries in the world market has made it increasingly difficult to sell German goods. Just in the seven months of 1938, Germany's foreign trade had a deficit of 167 million marks. This cannot but cause overproduction of German exports. At the same time, the phenomenon of import surpluses makes Germany unable to obtain sufficient foreign currency to purchase the foreign raw materials it needs. In order to barely cope with the purchase of foreign raw materials, Germany's cash is flowing out in large quantities, so that the treasury is becoming increasingly empty.

It is true that the fascist madmen are boasting about their self-sufficient economy, and have set out and are carrying out their "Four-Year Plan." But what is the effect? Hitler boasted in March about the self-sufficiency of kerosene, but the amount of kerosene imports is higher than ever before. The production of artificial rubber has not reduced the import of natural rubber. The only thing that has been somewhat successful in the Four-Year Plan is the manufacture of textiles, but it can only supplement a small part of textiles. Many of the tasks in the Four-Year Plan had to be stopped due to the lack of raw materials and labor. Even the once-sensational renovation plans in Berlin and Munich had long since disappeared.

What about the lives of the German people? Due to the expansion of the army and military industry, and due to the hundreds of thousands of workers being held in concentration camps and prisons, the number of unemployed has "decreased," but they are trapped in a life more miserable than unemployment. Farmers' agricultural products are forcibly purchased by the government at low prices, throwing the farmers into a state of distress where they cannot survive or die. The German people under fascist rule are trapped in the hell of the Middle Ages. Hitler is frantically waging war, using such a poor economy and a people harboring strong resistance to support the war of aggression. The result will easily promote the death of fascism!

Italy

Another fascist country—Italy is suffering even more difficult hardships than Germany. Italian capitalism is weak. It lacks important raw materials for modern industry, such as coal, iron, oil, non-ferrous metals, etc. Strong feudal remnants still exist in the country, and agriculture is relatively backward. Labor productivity is low, the general national income is low, and the domestic market is narrow. This forces Italian industry to find a way out abroad, similar to Japan. Due to the above reasons, Italian industry is already in a disadvantageous position in the world economy. In the new economic crisis, it has encountered strong competitors in the world market. In addition, its ever-expanding military industry urgently needs foreign raw materials. This has put Italy's foreign trade in a position of import surpluses. In 1937, the foreign trade deficit reached as much as 562.9 million lira. Although Italy is frantically expanding its armaments, and the expansion of the military industry accounts for a considerable proportion of Italy's industrial development, the total amount of industrial production has still decreased. Industrial production in 1937 was 117 (assuming 1928 as 100), while in 1938 it decreased to 105. Production in some industrial sectors (such as the non-ferrous metal industry) decreased by 25 percent (see International Communication Issue 42). The Italian currency, the lira, is also trending towards devaluation. In October 1936, under Mussolini's decree to "restore the old value ratio with the US dollar," the lira was devalued by another 42 percent!

Perhaps Mussolini boasts that he occupied Abyssinia without hindrance, but the occupation of Abyssinia not only did not solve the problem of lack of sales and raw materials, not only did not strengthen the situation of Italian capitalists, but on the contrary, weakened and complicated it. In order to suppress the persistent resistance of the Abyssinian people, and in order to develop the resources there, Italy still has to spend a lot of money up to now. The funds for developing Abyssinia in 1937, according to a speech by the Italian Minister of Finance on May 18, 1938, totaled 175 million lira. According to calculations by the British "New Finance" magazine, Italy still has to pay 400 million lira in military expenses every month after "ending" the Abyssinian war, reducing Italy's cash and endangering the stability of the lira. In addition to the huge expenditure on Abyssinia, the war of aggression against Spain also greatly consumed the Italian economy, yielding nothing in return. Mussolini has never announced his expenses for the invasion of Spain. According to calculations by the "New Finance" magazine, in addition to the expenses for supplying Franco, Italy also has to spend about 150 million military expenses every month in the Spanish war, which is also a loss that cannot be compensated. Italy's frantic military expansion, the heroic resistance of Spain, and the persistent guerrilla warfare in Abyssinia will exhaust the Italian economy. Although Mussolini arrogantly boasts that Italy is a first-class military power, and although he seeks a way out in the war of aggression, this can only intimidate some ignorant weaklings, attempting to divert the Italian people's attention to foreign countries in order to alleviate the anti-fascist struggle. Italy's increasingly weak economy cannot sustain a long-term large-scale war.

Japan

Japan: Japan is the most barbaric and at the same time the poorest of the aggressor camp. Japan's industrial production was stimulated by a strong armament expansion, increasing from 91 in 1931 (assuming 1929 as 100) to 171 in 1937, which has reached its peak. In February 1938, its industrial production had already been reduced by 16 percent. Due to our country's persistent resistance and due to the widespread outrage caused by Japan's brutality in the world, a general boycott of Japanese goods broke out everywhere. Therefore, foreign trade, which is one of the main sources of Japan's income, was greatly hit and turned into a state of import surpluses. According to the statistics of the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun," Japan's foreign trade deficit from January to July 1937 was 720 million yen, and the deficit in the same period in 1938 was 188.6 million. The reason for the decrease in the deficit in 1938 was that Japan lacked foreign currency, so it had to strongly control the import and use of foreign raw materials. This exposed Japan's financial exhaustion and its greater economic difficulties. The extreme lack of raw materials has made the production of non-military industries more severely reduced. In industrial sectors such as textiles, silk weaving, rayon, and paper making, 55 percent of the machines have been shut down. Imported raw materials are only allowed to be used in the manufacture of exports and in military industries. The war of aggression against our country and the foreign trade deficit have forced Japan's cash to flow out in large quantities, thereby reducing Japan's treasury cash and also affecting the sharp drop in the Japanese yen.

The Japanese imperialist war of aggression against our country has greatly consumed Japan's finances. The special budget for the war against China in 1938-39 was 4.85 billion yen, and the budget for the war against China in 1939-40 was 5 billion yen. But this only refers to the announced budget. The unannounced and indirect expenses for the war must also be an alarming number. In the process of our people's persistent resistance until the final victory, this huge war expenditure will make Japan's finances even poorer and even collapse. This huge expenditure can only be raised through two channels. One is to issue foreign debt. Borrow from its allies—the German and Italian fascists? The dictators of these two countries are racking their brains to seek foreign debt and cannot get it, and they can only feel "helpless" to Japan. Borrow from the wealthy United States and Britain? The interests of these two countries in China, especially Britain's interests in South China, have been ravaged by Japanese imperialism. In this way, the United States and Britain certainly have no great interest in lending money to Japan and helping it to promote its infringement on its own interests. On the contrary, it also forces capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain to provide assistance to our resistance. The loans from the United States and Britain to us not long ago are just the beginning of assistance. The second is to issue domestic debt and increase taxes, but this will inevitably lead to greater impoverishment of the Japanese people and greater exhaustion of Japanese finances, causing the Japanese people to fight against the Japanese warlords. Seventeen months of the war of aggression have trapped the Japanese people in great suffering. Once this heavy burden exceeds the saturation point that the Japanese people can tolerate, under the leadership of the Japanese People's Front, the Japanese people and soldiers will one day overthrow the reactionary government and establish a Japanese People's Democratic Republic. Japan's internal difficulties will increase with the increasing persistence of our resistance, as Mr. Mao Zedong said, it is one of the elements of our country's final victory.

### Our Nation's New Wartime Inventions

(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the start of the War of Resistance, our compatriots in the rear have redoubled their efforts in production and construction, resulting in a series of new industrial products. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a Committee for the Review of Industrial Technology Awards, which began registering inventions last year. To date, at least twenty new inventions have been reviewed and approved, each granted a three-year patent to encourage diligence. With the exception of those related to military affairs, which will be omitted, the various inventions are listed below:

Literacy Machine: Invented by Zhou Yin, this machine consists of mechanisms such as a handle, gears, and rollers. Its purpose is to facilitate literacy, greatly benefiting literacy efforts and popular education. It also includes a rotating literacy record table and an incentive savings box, which can stimulate children's interest in saving and increase literacy effectiveness.

Active Fountain Pen Brush: Invented by Li Yiren, its external appearance is similar to an ordinary fountain pen. Its internal structure includes a spiral water channel, an ink-adjusting needle, and a hollow double-layered pen tip, which are absent in general fountain pen brushes on the market.

Elliptical Dual-Purpose Compass: Invented by Nie Shuxiang, this compass has three legs: A, B, and C. Legs B and C are the same as the two legs of an ordinary compass. However, leg A is above leg B and can move up and down and rotate left and right to draw circles. This is constructed using the principle of a cylinder intersecting a plane at an angle.

Type Case: Invented by Mr. Chen, the case is a sloping surface constructed with multi-layered sloping type trays. The sliding, upright types utilize the tilting sliding force of lightweight objects, causing each ready-to-use type to automatically appear in front of the typesetter, increasing work efficiency, reducing labor, and reducing the space occupied by printing houses, benefiting cultural and journalistic endeavors.

Calendar Clock: Invented by Shi Yongen, in addition to the function of an ordinary clock displaying the time, it also automatically displays the day, week, month, and year. The leap years and the varying lengths of months are automatically adjusted, providing accurate indications, and its structure is different from those invented by predecessors.

Open-Suction Electromagnetic Control Switch: Invented by the Hua Sheng Electric Factory, it uses the principle of electromagnetic attraction to turn lights on and off. Although the principle and general structure have many applications, the switch's latch, jumper, and moving contact parts have a particularly novel and practical design.

Fan: Invented by Shu Minghai, after careful comparison, the fan blades are indeed different from the structure of ordinary electric fans, providing another tool for escaping the summer heat.

Self-Feeding Solder Iron: Invented by Li Ganmin, it consists of an iron cylinder with a circular solder-melting container. The outside of the cylinder is wrapped with a coil. When current is passed through, the cylinder's surroundings heat up, and the solder melts and accumulates inside the cylinder, making it more convenient than ordinary soldering irons.

Sitting Tricycle: Invented by Huang Shidian, in addition to an ordinary tricycle, it has a steel-framed canvas bed surface. If the tricycle is disassembled, its parts can be used to convert it into a bed frame, and the canvas bed surface can be installed, forming a bed that can be used for sleeping, rescue, and other purposes.

Rickshaw Fare Calculator: Invented by Cai Shunfu, this automatic device has four parts: mileage, fare record, rotation control, and lighting. It uses a combination of various mechanisms to calculate the rickshaw's mileage and fare, which is quite convenient. (Guoxin News Agency)

### Japanese Confessions Reveal Heavy Losses in Bombing of Chongqing

During the frenzied bombing of Chongqing's urban areas by Japanese aircraft on May 3rd and 4th, the wanton slaughter resulted in significant losses for the Japanese side as well. According to confessions from the Japanese air force in China, two planes were shot down, one piloted by Kihachi Ishii and the other by Masago Kanei. Fifteen pilots died, listed as follows:

Kihachi Ishii (Airman First Class) Masago Kanei (Airman First Class)

Masao Wata (Airman First Class) Hiroshi Takahashi (Airman Second Class)

Tadashi Yoshi (Airman Second Class) Masami Nakano (Airman Second Class)

Kaoru Kumagai (Airman Third Class) Seiichi Takahashi (Airman Third Class)

Hideo Kitajima (Airman Third Class) Souichi Mizuno (Airman Third Class)

Takeo Kawashima (Airman Third Class) Noboru Ishiwada (Maintenance Airman Third Class)

Katsu Shimasaki (Maintenance Airman Third Class) Tadashi Uchida (Maintenance Airman Third Class)

Satoshi Harai (Maintenance Airman Third Class)

The above is only the Japanese's own announcement; the actual number of planes shot down and pilots killed must be higher.

Furthermore, according to an official announcement by the Japanese Ministry of the Army on May 4th, the Fujita plane, which took off from a certain location on January 30th, suddenly disappeared. An investigation revealed that the plane and its crew were all killed by Chinese forces near Shayangzhen on February 1st. The crew consisted of six airmen who held important positions in the Japanese air force and were mostly known as "war gods." The list is as follows:

Yuzo Fujita - Army Air Force Major, pilot, fought in the Heilongjiang incident, broke international long-distance flight records twice, known as the "Hero of the Sky."

Hirotaro Watanabe - Army Air Force Colonel, commander, studied the air war tactics of Lehmann, Germany.

Fukubumi Takahashi - Army Air Force Warrant Officer, co-pilot, Fujita's right-hand man.

Nobuo Izumisawa - Key member of the Army Aeronautical Technology Research Institute, radio operator.

Shigejiro Niimura - Member of the Army Aeronautical Technology Research Institute.

Sasuke Kasuya - Army Air Force. (Guoxin News Agency Special)

### Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan; Zhongxiang in Central Hubei Now Under Our Control; Successful Gains from Attacks in Jiangxi and Guangdong

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 8th Dispatch] The Japanese suffered heavy losses in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan. Reinforcements are now arriving from various locations. Our forces are still engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese in Southern Henan. On the 15th, one of our units in Central Hubei attacked Luojiaji in eastern Zhongxiang, killing Lin Zhou, a Japanese transport commander, and over a hundred Japanese soldiers, destroying 37 Japanese vehicles, and capturing a large quantity of arms and ammunition. One of our brigades attacked the Japanese at [redacted]dian. Zhongxiang is now under our control. Near Nanchang and between Zengcheng and Conghua in Guangdong Province, we are still constantly attacking the Japanese, with considerable success.

[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 16th] Tanghe has been recovered. Over four hundred Japanese corpses were found in the city, along with over a hundred captured horses and over seventy heavy machine guns. Over two hundred large carts were used to transport the Japanese wounded. The severely wounded were burned to death. During the Japanese retreat, they were surrounded by the military and civilians, and five to six hundred were annihilated. They have now fled to the Huyangzhen area. Local militias are rising up to kill the Japanese.

[Central News Agency, Shashi, 17th] After Yuekou was recovered by our forces, the remaining Japanese troops retreated towards Tianmen. Our main force is now advancing towards Tianmen and has already approached the city. The Japanese troops entrenched in the city are in extreme panic. On the 17th, they used thirteen vehicles and three cannons to transport a large amount of heavy equipment to Zaoshi, in order to prevent our attack, appearing to be retreating.

Japanese Troops Increase in Eastern Henan

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 17th] On the 10th, 1,300 Japanese troops arrived in Qi County, Eastern Henan, from Kaifeng and other places. Traces of Japanese troops have been discovered in the Huiji River area northeast of the city. We have dispatched teams to monitor them.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 17th] On the morning of the 13th, 800 Japanese troops from Bo'ai, along with four mountain guns each, harassed the vicinity of Wanshan Village. One of our units met them head-on and engaged them fiercely. After intense back-and-forth fighting, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and fled, abandoning over three hundred corpses. At dawn on the 14th, the Japanese reinforced and counterattacked. We used the terrain to our advantage, setting up ambushes along the way and attacking from both sides, leaving corpses scattered everywhere. Over a hundred remaining Japanese troops fled in a panic towards Chuan'ai. Our army, riding on the momentum of victory, advanced towards Bo'ai and are currently besieging it.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th] Over a thousand soldiers of the Exit Unit of the Japanese Army's Edayu Brigade, carrying many military supplies and equipment, traveled by Jinpu Railway military train from Tianjin to Jinan on the afternoon of the 2nd. One of our units learned of this in advance and laid a large number of landmines in the area south of Dongguang. When the train reached the location, it triggered the landmines and exploded, destroying the entire train. Japanese officers and soldiers were killed and injured extensively, and all the military supplies were destroyed.

### Japanese Prisoners of War Receive Preferential Treatment; Voluntarily Offer Services to Our Cause; Deeply Regret Being Deceived and Helping the Japanese in China; Willing to Promote an Early End to the War of Aggression

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Today, local and foreign reporters in the city interviewed 22 prisoners of war recently brought from the [number redacted]th War Zone. The prisoners were all dressed in gray uniforms, sitting on mats as if they were in their own country. After greeting the reporters, a medium-sized man stood up. After inquiry, he was identified as a Captain, named Susumu Ue, from Hiroshima City, 33 years old, of a Japanese army transport unit. Although this Captain and the other 21 men belonged to different units, they all regarded him as their leader because of his higher rank and longer association with them. He introduced to the reporters that some were infantry, and some were artillery. Among them, Kazuo Takaki, a 21-year-old mechanic, was the most innocent and sincere. According to him, he was from Hyogo Prefecture and worked as a worker in an engine assembly plant before enlisting, earning 3 yuan and 33 cents a day. His parents are still alive, and he has no siblings. He was ordered by the factory owner to enlist, which was slightly different from ordinary soldiers. After being captured, he received preferential treatment from our army and had nothing but gratitude to express. In addition, Tatsumatsu Morikawa and Nagashi Takahashi, both 35 years old, belonged to the 104th Regiment of the 13th Division and were both of peasant origin. Their speech was straightforward. However, the more educated one was still Captain Ue. He recently wrote a reflection, which stated that when he was ordered to come to China, he was deceived by the warlords who claimed that China had become communist and that their arrival was to fight the communists. It was only after arriving in China that he learned that the actual situation was different from what the warlords had said. After being captured, Chinese officers, soldiers, and intellectuals all showed sympathy, which moved him to tears of gratitude. In the future, he deeply desires to dedicate his skills to China in order to repay this kindness and promote an early end to the war so that all can share the joy of equality and happiness.

### US Fleet Commander to Take Office in Shanghai

### Naval Landings by Britain, America, and France on Gulangyu; Express Determination to Uphold Far East Interests; Japanese Marines Retreat in Disappointment

[Reuters, Gulangyu, 18th] Two hundred Japanese naval personnel landed on Gulangyu last week. Only forty-two remain on the island. At 6 PM on Tuesday, approximately 150 British, American, and French naval personnel landed on Gulangyu. This action followed an ultimatum issued to the Japanese by British Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Admiral Noble, which stated that if the Japanese did not withdraw from Gulangyu, the British, American, and French navies would conduct a landing. Noble also stated that the administrative organization of Gulangyu could not be changed. Currently, many warships from various countries are concentrated here, including the British cruiser HMS Birmingham, destroyers HMS Duncan, HMS Protector, and HMS Scout, the US cruiser USS Marblehead, destroyer USS Barker, and the French cruiser HMS Borde.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The Navy Department issued a public announcement today stating that after the Japanese Navy Marines landed on Gulangyu in China, marines from the British, French, and American navies also landed at the same location today. The number of personnel is equal to that of the Japanese troops, it said.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied to Britain regarding the protest against the Japanese Navy landing on Gulangyu. This reply was delivered to the British Embassy here last night. However, the content has not been disclosed.

[Haitong News Agency, New York, 18th] Various newspapers commented that the landing of US sailors in Xiamen is the United States' first level of attention to its Far East policy. They also said that the sending of sailors to Gulangyu by Britain and America proves the joint expression of Britain and America to safeguard their interests in the Far East.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 18th] On Wednesday afternoon, 42 British and 42 American sailors landed on Gulangyu. British Naval Far East Commander Noble has arrived in the concession. It is heard that the landing of British and American sailors is an attempt to prevent the Japanese army from interfering with the administration of the concession again. According to the Thursday's agricultural report, the sailors of the British cruiser Birmingham waited until the US warship USS Marblehead arrived from Qingdao before landing together. A French warship also sent 42 sailors ashore, united in protecting the interests of Britain, America, and France in Xiamen.

### Japanese Navy Spokesperson's Contradictory Remarks; Japanese Residents Need Self-Defense Even Without Suffering Damage; Dispatching Troops Ashore Is Merely a Japanese Necessity

[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] When the Japanese Navy spokesperson answered questions about the situation in Gulangyu, he acknowledged that before the Japanese Navy landed, there had been no attacks on Japanese residents, nor had any Japanese property been damaged. However, he said that the Japanese Navy authorities considered the landing of marines on Gulangyu to be "a necessary emergency self-defense measure." He also said that the development of the situation did not require the British, American, and French naval authorities to take the same action. He said he could not understand why the Japanese Navy's actions in Gulangyu had caused so much disturbance to foreign countries.

### National Production Conference, Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Instructions (4)

Sixth, labor and capital must cooperate to improve production discipline. Today, both entrepreneurs and workers are producing and laboring for the country. At this time of national crisis, both labor and capital must cooperate in spirit, help each other, and cooperate in division of labor, which is the basic principle of modern undertakings. Not only should there be absolute cooperation between labor and capital, but all people, whether officials or entrepreneurs, whether technicians or workers, should advance in different ways under strict self-consciousness, each doing their best to give full play to the spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance. At the same time, in production undertakings, we must establish a spirit of discipline and the rule of law. We must thoroughly break with the evils of favoritism, nepotism, monopolization, and corruption. We must appoint capable, talented, responsible, and hardworking individuals to establish a spirit of rapid, accurate, capable, and long-term service, and a pure spirit of enterprise that is selfless, meticulous, unplayful, and untiring. This spirit must permeate every state-owned or privately-owned enterprise, demonstrating a strict discipline and a good atmosphere. The above six points can be summarized in eight words: increase production and reduce consumption. This is the fundamental principle of livelihood during the war. We must base ourselves on these two major principles to meet the military needs of the War of Resistance and establish a foundation for an equitable livelihood. By advancing from this, we will be able to achieve a balanced and rational development of public and private industries after the war and obtain national prosperity and happiness, completing the great mission of building the country based on the Three Principles of the People. The bright future of our country is already in sight. However, the success of all great undertakings depends on our extraordinary efforts. We must drive out the brutal Japanese and achieve national prosperity. We must always remember two words: "diligence and thrift." Diligence and thrift are inherent virtues of our nation and the fundamental basis of modern prosperity. The ancients said, "Livelihood lies in encouragement, and diligence will not lead to scarcity." Diligence means hard work. Entrepreneurs, workers, and technicians must not be afraid of hardship, constantly strive, and constantly create. Thrift means hard work and frugality. The ancients said, "Those who produce are many, those who consume are few, those who work are quick, and those who use are slow, then wealth is always sufficient." A few people creating wealth, and many people sharing it, with the latest consumption on the oldest production, is the root of national poverty and popular hardship, and it is also a disgrace to our spirit. The danger the country faces today is due to our past insufficient promotion of diligence and thrift. We have thousands of years of education, and the current national crisis is also a time of war of survival, we must endure hardships beyond the ordinary in order to preserve the heritage of our ancestors and to build a strong foundation for our descendants. Prosperity is the goal of our material construction, and diligence and thrift are the foundation of our spiritual mobilization. With spirit and matter complementing each other, we can resist the war, build the country, and continue the past and open up the future, completing the great mission of building the country based on the Three Principles of the People. I wish you all efforts and success. (The end)

### Refuse the Japanese's Unreasonable Demands in Shanghai; The US Reply Has a Firm Attitude; Revising the Shanghai Land Regulations Is Not Timely; Return the Forcibly Occupied Area North of the Suzhou Creek Immediately

[Reuters, Shanghai, 18th] According to Reuters reporters, the United States' reply to Japan's request to revise the "Land Regulations" is a blunt refusal. The reply even demands that the Japanese return the concession north of the Suzhou Creek, which they occupy, to the management of the Public Works Department. This reply was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry by US Ambassador to Japan Grew yesterday. The reply states that the proposal to revise the "Land Regulations" cannot be discussed until the situation is completely stable. Under the current special circumstances caused by Japan's invasion of China, it is difficult to reach a satisfactory agreement. The letter warns Japan not to abuse this special situation caused by the general situation and to infiltrate the disputes in the concession, saying that the US government is willing to conduct friendly and reasonable negotiations to revise the "Land Regulations," but the current situation is special and certainly not the time. The letter also points out that the Public Works Department's performance of its duties is greatly hindered by illegal activities in the neighboring concession area, and the Japanese refusal to return Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Huishan to the management of the Public Works Department is an even more difficult knot. Finally, the letter states that Shanghai is a large city, and any attempt to change its status quo will involve many countries.

### Close Cooperation Between Britain, America, and France

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] According to informed sources, the US government is now closely maintaining contact with Britain and France regarding Japan's request to increase its representation in the Public Works Department.

### Traitorous Leaflets Distributed in the Shanghai International Settlement; The Content Provokes Chinese-British Relations; The Five People Arrested Have Not Been Released

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai External News, according to the North China Daily News, yesterday some Japanese residents were in the International Settlement by car, distributing leaflets, which criticised the authorities of the Public Concession, and ordered the Chinese people not to deposit savings into British banks. There is another kind of drawn leaflet, which depicts the pain suffered by the Chinese people in the hands of the British. The readers are all workers, and then the patrolmen swept the road one by one, and all kinds of leaflets were taken back to the Bureau of Industry and Translation.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai External News, although the Japanese spokesman claimed that the five Chinese arrested by the Japanese Gendarmerie in the Public Concession a few days ago have been released, the results of investigations by various newspapers here are purely inaccurate. Reporters interviewed the families of those arrested, claiming that since the disappearance of the arrested, there had been no news.

### British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Departs Chongqing for Shanghai

[Local News] British Ambassador to China, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, went to Chongqing from Shanghai a month ago to meet with our country's authorities. After staying for about a month, he has now completed his official duties and is scheduled to take a flight from Chongqing to Hong Kong today, and then transfer to Shanghai.

### A British Warship in Shanghai Rushes to Hong Kong

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai External News, the British warship HMS Dorsetshire, was ordered to sail to Hong Kong this afternoon. The timing of the warship's order was extremely short, so the sailors on the shore did not have time to board.

### What a Virtuous Woman, Mrs. Khan; She Donates All Funeral Gifts According to Her Will; Never Forgetting the War of Resistance Until Death

### Preventing Enemy Aircraft Bombing: Various Locations Intensify Evacuations; Chairman's Stern Words Strictly Implemented; Chongqing Rises from the Ashes

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech the day before yesterday, stating that in view of the Japanese aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing and major cities across the country, large-scale and strict population evacuations should be initiated to strengthen the spirit of resistance and increase rural production, Chongqing's new mayor, He Guoguang, has drafted the following plans to comply with the leader's instructions to cope with the future:

(1) Survey Chongqing's population;

(2) Build firebreak alleys;

(3) Conduct resident registration to determine who should be evacuated;

(4) Reorganize various service teams and cooperate uniformly with the Garrison Headquarters. It is reported that, except for resident registration, which will take a long time, other plans can be completed immediately. In addition to actively evacuating the population, the municipal government is also cooperating with the Chamber of Commerce to limit the prices of daily necessities because prices have been rising since the Japanese aircraft bombings. Food prices are to be determined by a committee, and those who intentionally speculate and sabotage will be severely punished. Furthermore, Chongqing's air defense capabilities have been greatly enhanced, and many air raid shelters and anti-aircraft gun emplacements have been added. Government agencies, schools, and hospitals have almost all moved to the suburbs. Major financial institutions and banks have also established offices outside the city. In the bombed areas, businesses have not yet resumed operations and mostly want to find land outside the city to operate. According to reports from various locations, major cities in Sichuan Province have also been ordered to evacuate, and more than half of the residents of densely populated cities have experienced relocation, so the villages near the cities are extremely crowded. Local governments are now focusing on maintaining transportation, stabilizing prices, and relocating handicrafts and various factories from dangerous areas within the bombed cities. Therefore, rural areas occupy an important position in wartime production. According to police reports, order is well-maintained everywhere, and the prosperity of the villages within a hundred miles around Chongqing is unprecedented.

### Declaration of the Production Conference

Agricultural and Industrial Cooperation

Next, let's talk about industry. The previous article discussed agricultural policies, and the coordination of agriculture and industry will be the main focus of our country's agricultural policies in the future. To increase the supply of raw materials, the industrial sector should assist in the improvement and marketing of agricultural products. To easily sell products at good prices, the agricultural sector should adapt to the needs of the industrial sector. If the production and needs of agriculture and industry can be closely linked, then neither side will lack usable raw materials nor suffer from product stagnation. The two industries will complement each other, and all undertakings will prosper. The victory or defeat of modern warfare depends on the competition of sustained human, material, and financial resources. Under today's circumstances, to develop industry and achieve the established policies, we must consider the actual situation to determine the order of priority and urgency. We must also correct past shortcomings to reduce development resistance, and then we can strengthen the resistance and lay the foundation for national reconstruction.

Speaking of China's industrial construction today, it must aim to accelerate wartime production. To achieve this goal, there should be a sound and strict control mechanism in terms of organization. In terms of management, we should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the central government's policies. Heavy and basic industries related to national defense should be state-owned in principle, while other industries, large and small, should be privately owned in principle, and the government should supervise, encourage, and assist them. Only in this way can we develop in an orderly manner to promote wartime industrial production and establish the foundation for post-war industry. To encourage production and protect private businesses, the government should adopt a fairly lenient policy unless absolutely necessary. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are extremely rich in agricultural and mineral resources, which are inexhaustible. The conditions for industrial construction are naturally available. To build China's new industry, we should first pay attention to the development of these vast natural resources to increase the supply of raw materials, so that national defense and people's livelihood industries can both advance at an accelerated pace. In a relatively short period of time, we can establish a strong new industry.

Future Direction

Building industry is not just about developing resources. We must also build various industrial centers according to the regional distribution of various natural resources, implement regional specialization, and advance simultaneously to achieve the effect of adapting to local conditions. The establishment of each industrial center must consider its transportation conditions, investigate its resource abundance, study its needs, and weigh the three to serve as the standard for construction. The allocation and planning of various industrial products can also be based on this to make reasonable and reliable decisions. Building industry is not just about focusing on heavy industry and large industry. The construction of national industry must take self-sufficiency as its ultimate goal. China's industrial foundation is weak, and national reconstruction should have comprehensive and long-term plans without biased and negligent mistakes. Not only should light industry and small industry not be neglected, but also rural side occupations and family handicrafts should be vigorously promoted, hoping to accumulate little by little to make up for the shortcomings of heavy industry and large industry. Moreover, most large industries cannot be completed in a short period of time, and the trend of modern industry is to emphasize decentralization to avoid wartime damage. China's original rural industry should not be allowed to wither but should be supported and improved. In addition to major industrial construction, the links between various industries and the industries between various industries should also be constructed to achieve the effect of coordination and maneuverability. Industrial experiments and industrial surveys must also be carried out with attention to achieve the effect of continuous improvement. (To be continued)

### Women and Children in Shanxi Province Being Mobilized

— Mu Xin

[People's Revolutionary Society, Fenxi Correspondence] This is one of the most culturally backward and transportationally isolated areas. In the past, the vast majority of women were mired in a miserable and enslaved life. They were treated as commodities to be sold. The systems of child brides and infanticide meant that women were treated inhumanely from a young age. From cities to villages, women suffered the "torment" of foot-binding from a young age. They never had the opportunity to receive education, and they themselves never even had the thought of studying. They were tied down all day by their husbands, children, and trivial matters, until they fell ill, grew old, and died. Children also faced the most tragic fate. Most poor children had no opportunity to study at all. From a very young age, they did the same heavy work and labor as adults.

However, since the flames of the war of resistance began to burn in the East, in the West, and throughout the war zone, this backward situation has changed under the new circumstances. Just as all young and middle-aged people began to mobilize for the war of resistance, women and children also began to be widely organized and received general education and training. Women's National Salvation Associations and Children's National Salvation Associations appeared in every extremely remote and isolated corner. The clear banner of striving for national liberation was raised high everywhere by them. Their tragic and solemn songs of national salvation echoed in every corner, rippling through the vast countryside and mountains.

According to statistics from the Shanxi Public Relief Hongzhao Central District, in October of last year, 830 Women's National Salvation Associations had been established in this anti-Japanese base area in western Shanxi, with 36,228 members. The total number of Children's National Salvation Associations established was 1,142, with a total of 28,521 innocent children united around it. Moreover, the organization of these groups is expanding day by day. Since being organized, most of them have received organizational training, and they are divided into small groups, living a regular collective life.

In general, the work of the Women's National Salvation Association often includes the following: 1. Educating and organizing women, publicizing the harms of foot-binding, and pulling them from their homes to the meeting place to participate in this sacred war; 2. Persuading their children to go to the front line, writing letters of comfort, etc., to encourage the soldiers on the front line. They also often call on and sew and wash clothes for the soldiers on the front line; 3. Expanding production in the rear, strengthening the power of resistance, raising livestock, and helping with the harvesting and cultivation of fields; 4. Organizing women's self-defense teams. In many areas, women's self-defense teams have been organized. They not only receive training like male self-defense teams but also stand guard and watch the fields like men, checking passersby. When people pass by, the female self-defense team members holding large knives will ask you to show your "road pass." During the busy farming season, they shout the slogan "Husbands go to plow, wives watch for them." Unfortunately, due to the difficulty in quickly changing feudal ideas and the lack of female work cadres, women's self-defense teams have not yet been widely developed. 5. Establishing administrative conferences at all levels in various districts to give the people freedom to participate in politics. In the elections in various places, the Women's National Salvation Association also actively participated in electing their representatives. This work also reflects the weaknesses above and cannot become more enthusiastic.

Friends holding the torch of resistance are also enthusiastically doing the work they can do. Even very young children can sing many anti-Japanese songs. "Japan is our ×××" "The final victory is ours!" are deeply imprinted on children's minds. I once asked a twelve-year-old child, "What is a united front?" He naturally said, "Chinese people, regardless of party affiliation, rich or poor, men or women, old or young, unite to defeat ×××××." They often stand at the village entrance with broadswords, responsible for guarding. Walking around western Shanxi, you can see the traces of these little heroes everywhere. Their very serious attitude is very moving. Many children only ten years old have used rifles for target practice. Once, a reporter asked a "little soldier" guarding Nuanquantou in Fenxi: "If a big traitor comes, you can't kill him with a knife, what will you do?" He innocently said, "Let a child go to report to the army. I'll cut off his legs first. When his legs are broken, he has to lie down, and then I'll cut off his ××××." Later, I asked him, and he was only eleven years old.

Many heroic women and children resolutely joined the ranks of the regular army. The Cao Cheng Brigade, which belongs to the Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps, originally had an army that was entirely "female soldiers," and they were all armed rural women. Later, because of the inconvenience of marching, they were persuaded to be dispersed into the Shanxi Political Security Team. Children accounted for several hundred of the number. In other troops, there were also "little soldiers" of fourteen or fifteen years old who had been fighting for a long time. The Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps headquarters also has a women and children's team.

In the Dare-to-Die Corps, there are four or five drama troupes, and children account for a considerable proportion of them. In Zhao City, Hongdong, Puxian, Fenxi, and other counties, there is a "Women and Children's Work Team." They everywhere raise tragic songs and perform vernacular dramas for the common people to watch, doing in-depth propaganda and mobilization work, pulling thousands of people from a state of chaos to the path of resolute war of resistance.

The great anti-Japanese force accumulated among women and children has begun to be widely mobilized. Although this mobilization still has many weaknesses today, it has already exerted a great force and has given many persecutions to Japanese invaders and traitors!

### League of Nations to Discuss Sanctions Against Japan; Our Government Requests Inclusion on Agenda; Cecil and Others Request Concrete Aid to China

[Reuters, London, 18th] Sir John Snell, Lord Cecil, and Lord Listowel, representatives of local figures, will visit Lord Halifax tomorrow, requesting the British government to make its best efforts in Geneva to urge the League of Nations to take concrete action to assist China. A Reuters reporter learned that at the League of Nations meeting, China will actively work to organize the necessary mechanisms to exert effective pressure on Japan. This pressure will be more effective than the current League of Nations proposal for each country to freely assist China. The Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, will go to Geneva tomorrow with the Soviet Ambassador, Maisky, in the same car. Guo will meet Gu Weijun in Paris. Guo and Gu will jointly represent China at the League of Nations meeting. Gu will still be responsible for the task of making proposals.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] It is announced here that British Foreign Secretary Halifax will arrive in Paris at 4 pm on the 20th and will immediately visit the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.

The British Foreign Secretary and the French Foreign Minister will travel together to Geneva at 9 pm on the 20th.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Labour MP Leslie asked in the House of Commons today that, in view of the government's declared policy of resisting aggression, will the British representative attending the League of Nations meeting propose an embargo and ban the sale of all minerals and gasoline to Japan that Japan relies on to invade China? Undersecretary Butler replied that the Chinese government's request had been included in the agenda of the current League of Nations Council meeting. The issue will be discussed by the Council as a whole. It is not possible to make predictions at this time. Leslie also asked, "What instructions will the British government give to the British representative attending the League of Nations?" Butler refused to announce, only saying that Foreign Secretary Halifax would personally attend the meeting. Leslie also asked, "Has the Undersecretary noticed that a large amount of tungsten is currently being shipped from Canada to Japan? Is this not the time when action needs to be taken?" Butler said that the government would undoubtedly consider it.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] At the House of Commons meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, Liberal MP Mendel asked whether the Prime Minister intends to ask the League of Nations to negotiate with the Japanese government regarding the repeated bombing of Chongqing City and other places in China by Japanese aircraft, which has resulted in the tragic massacre of ordinary people. Undersecretary Butler replied that the League of Nations General Assembly had passed a resolution condemning this bombing method, saying that it was contrary to human conscience and various principles of international law. The British government has also made serious representations to Japan yesterday.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Labour MP Macmillan asked whether the government had accepted Japan's proposal to conclude a long-term non-aggression pact. Undersecretary Butler replied that the UK and Japan are both signatories to the Paris Peace Pact, so it seems unnecessary.

### Opium Poppies Discovered in Chile; League of Nations Advisory Committee Discusses Opium Problems

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 17th] At a meeting of the League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium Problems yesterday, Canadian representative Colonel Sherman and Egyptian representative Sir Russell presented reports on the problem of subcutaneous injection of opium, both denouncing this as another factor that makes the opium scourge even deeper.

### Nordic Countries Strictly Maintain Neutrality; Only Denmark Accepts Hitler's Proposal

[Reuters, Finnish Capital, 17th] It is reported that Finland has rejected the non-aggression pact offered by Hitler on the grounds that the Nordic countries have unanimously agreed to strictly maintain neutrality.

### Soviet Pavilion Opens at World's Fair; Oumansky Delivers Speech; Willing to Maintain Peace with All Countries

[Reuters, New York, 17th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Soviet Pavilion at the World's Fair today, saying, "The Soviet Union is prepared to maintain peace with any country on the principles of absolute reciprocity and equal responsibility, but the Soviet people will never be moved by force and will not seek alliances by coercion."

### British Prime Minister States in House of Commons That He Is Prepared to Cooperate With All Countries; To Jointly Maintain Peace in the Eastern Mediterranean; British Cabinet Passes New Reply to USSR

[Reuters, London, 17th] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question that the Anglo-Turkish Declaration established on the 20th of this month did not change the Montreux Convention regarding Turkish protection of the Dardanelles. Besides the UK and Turkey, other countries participated in the treaty. The content of the Anglo-Turkish Declaration did not prevent the two governments from cooperating with other Mediterranean countries in the event of an aggressive war in the Mediterranean.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the British government is prepared to cooperate not only with Turkey but also with other countries related to the Mediterranean to jointly maintain peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. The British Cabinet has passed a new reply to the Soviet Union, which will become the basis for the Soviet Union to join the anti-aggression front. It is said that after the cabinet meeting, the British Prime Minister informed the Soviet Ambassador of the content of the British reply. After some diplomatic formalities with the Soviet Embassy, the UK will send the reply immediately.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th] The center of political interest in London is now focused on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The British government's decision to promptly submit a reply to the Soviet Union is sufficient to prove its desire to establish some kind of concrete agreement. British foreign policy is based on the system of concluding agreements and providing guarantees. If the Anglo-Soviet negotiations fail to succeed, the impact can be known. Even the Anglo-Turkish agreement will lose its meaning if the Soviet Union does not join. The opposition in the government is eagerly hoping that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will be successfully concluded, otherwise, the British political authorities will be further attacked by the opposition. Even the opinions of the Conservative Party believe that the key to Chamberlain's future lies in the development of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th] Chamberlain's future is now tied to the success or failure of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The government's supporters are fully aware of the importance of these negotiations. If these negotiations fail, the opposition will be able to obtain the best opportunity to attack, and Chamberlain's position is in deep danger. It is generally believed that Chamberlain's unwillingness to conclude a military agreement with the Soviet Union is not out of fear of the disagreement of small countries, but out of his traditional unwillingness to leak British military secrets to the Soviet Union.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] Regarding the negotiations between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union to form an anti-aggression group, according to responsible sources here, Foreign Minister Bonnet has telegraphed Ambassador Corbin in the UK to submit new proposals to the British government.

### Soviet-Turkish Secret Agreement Established; Unified Command of Land and Air Forces

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] People from the Balkan countries here recently announced that while the UK and the Soviet Union are negotiating collective security issues, the Soviet Union and Turkey have already secretly concluded an agreement with extremely broad content, stipulating: (1) Any act of aggression that undermines the status quo in the Balkans shall be jointly resisted by the Soviet Union and Turkey; (2) In the event of war, the Soviet Union and Turkey shall merge all resources and forces in order to cope with it together. The land forces of the two countries shall be under the unified command of Turkish generals, and the air forces of the two countries shall be under the unified command of Soviet generals. The Soviet Navy is responsible for protecting the safety of the Black Sea, and the Turkish Navy shall join the British and Greek navies to protect the safety of the Eastern Mediterranean. In addition, the Soviet Union and Turkey promise to transfer the defense forces of the two countries stationed in the Caucasus Mountains to the Black Sea coast at any time when necessary, so that they can be transported to the Balkans at any time. The Soviet government also requires Turkey to restrict the passage of warships from various countries through the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. In other words, except for countries that have concluded non-aggression pacts with the Soviet Union, warships from other countries are not allowed to pass through these straits. It is reported that Arab countries have expressed their support for the agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and Turkey.

### The Palestine Question: Britain Announces New Policy – Plans to Build an Independent State Within Ten Years – Hopes Parliament Will Pass It

[Reuters, London, 17th] The British government has released a White Paper outlining its policy on Palestine. The British government plans to establish an independent Palestinian state within ten years, maintaining treaty relations with Britain to satisfy the commercial and strategic needs of both countries. In the future, Jews and Arabs in the new state government will share administrative power according to their population size. During the transitional period, the number of Jewish and Arab seats in the government will be increased. Jewish immigration will be limited to no more than one-third of the total population. In the next five years, Jewish immigration will not exceed 10,000 per year, plus 25,000 refugees. After five years, no further immigration will be allowed without the consent of the Arabs. Jewish representatives criticized the White Paper, saying, "The new policy virtually deprives Jews of the right to rebuild their homeland and transfers power to the majority of Arabs. The Jews believe that this British move is a 'breach of faith.' At this time of extreme suffering, Britain's suggestion to destroy the last hope of the Jews is a cruel blow."

[Reuters, London, 18th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent reports that various parties hold different views regarding the proposal to reorganize Palestine. The government hopes that it will be passed by a majority in the meeting, but it is also expected to be criticized by the opposition.

Britain's Aim: To Remove Anxiety

[Reuters, London, 17th] According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, the British government's purpose in issuing a declaration on the Palestine issue is to quell the anxieties and beliefs that are the major cause of the disturbances in Palestine. This policy will be criticized by both sides, but it is believed that this proposal can still be regarded as a fair solution because the obligations of sacrifice are equal for Jews and Arabs. The British government has compromised on the extreme demands of both Jews and Arabs and decided to adopt an independent state so that both sides can share governmental responsibilities while serving common interests. The establishment of this new state can be completed through consultations with the League of Nations without the need for a mandatory decision, and the unification can be achieved. The White Paper specifies a plan to protect foreign interests, especially those of American missionaries. As for the decision to allow 25,000 immigrants and refugees, including 10,000 children, this plan will be approved by the League of Nations and the Permanent Mandates Commission. It is reported that it will be discussed around June and then passed by the League of Nations. The White Paper will be discussed in the Lower House next Monday and Wednesday, and Colonial Secretary MacDonald will explain it. Arab figures here have expressed great disappointment with this plan, believing that the deadline for establishing the state should be at most within three years, arguing that this delay in independence not only violates Arab interests but also the interests of the general public, thus preventing Palestine from reaching the goal of an Arab Federation.

Rumors of a Jewish Strike Brewing

[Associated Press, London, 18th] According to reports from Jerusalem today, Jews are currently brewing a major strike to protest the British government's White Paper. Zionist activists have announced three points as an organized opposition to the White Paper, but they stated that they will never resort to force. The three points are: (1) Vow not to cooperate with the British government's policies and refuse to serve a political system in which Jews are a minority. (2) Expand political activities to influence the Lower House's debate on the White Paper, so that the League of Nations Mandate extends to the Palestine Committee. (3) Actively promote construction work within Palestine to establish Jewish rights in Palestine.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] Fifteen hundred Jewish demonstrators attacked the local government office yesterday, vandalizing its interior and setting it on fire. A Jewish policeman was seriously injured. Several bombs were placed in the upper levels of the Jerusalem government immigration department, causing a large fire. Two Jewish constables suffered minor injuries. Most Jews do not approve of the riotous behavior and advocate for the declaration of the Jewish Congress opposing the British government's White Paper. It is believed that the public may adopt a method of passive resistance similar to that of Gandhi.

### Italy Advises Germany Not to Start a War Lightly – Tension in the Danzig Corridor, Defense Measures Taken

[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] According to powerful diplomatic sources, the only condition of Mussolini's recent military agreement with Hitler was that Hitler must resolve disputes with Poland peacefully and not resort to force. Hitler also agreed at the time and expressed his conviction that the German-Polish and German-French issues could be resolved without war. Foreign diplomats have apparently received assurances that Germany and Italy have no intention of initiating conflict, so they have not expressed alarm at the conclusion of the military agreement between Germany and Italy. According to people close to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the procedures for the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance have been completed and are in the final stage of signing. Its content goes beyond the original intention of a purely defensive agreement and includes a formal military alliance sufficient to encourage and express the will of the two countries.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 16th] In view of the tension in the Free City of Danzig, the government authorities have taken various preventive measures to deal with Germany's future actions. Armored trains have been traveling back and forth on the railway from the northern end of the Polish Corridor, the city of Gdynia, to the province of Pomerania, transporting troops every day. However, there is no definite destination. The authorities intend to continue this mobilization so that Polish troops regularly pass through Danzig and stay in the city as much as possible. Sometimes, due to damage to the armored train machinery, they stop for repairs. All of this is done to prevent any eventuality and to make the residents of Danzig understand that if Germany were to send troops to occupy the city, there would be various difficulties in terms of military strategy, as the city is only connected to the German province of East Prussia by a single line that must pass through Polish territory.

### British Government Pays Attention to Chinese Refugee Children – Hong Kong and Malaya Cooperate to Prevent Trafficking Abuses

[Reuters, London, 17th] During today's meeting of the British House of Commons, Labour MP Mr. Leach asked whether the trafficking of Chinese children in Hong Kong and Malaya still exists and whether the government has paid attention to the statement by Mr. Oakley, Deputy Secretary for Chinese Affairs in Selangor, that selling children is not a crime under local law. Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied that the government has noted the remarks on the matter in a certain newspaper, stating that the trafficking of children with the intention of enslaving them as prostitutes or for other immoral and illegal acts is prohibited by the laws of Hong Kong and Malaya. The Hong Kong and Malaya Domestic Servants Committee recently conducted a thorough investigation into any system of transferring children prevalent in the two regions, but according to the report, there is no system of buying and selling under the pretext of adoption or other reasons. Recently, many Chinese children have been taken to Malaya, but it is believed that they are refugees fleeing from war zones. The government has now taken steps to ensure that the governments of Hong Kong and Malaya cooperate with each other to prevent abuses from occurring, and if the circumstances require it, special management legislation will be enacted.

### U.S. Neutrality Law – House Foreign Affairs Committee Discussing Revisions

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee held a closed-door meeting on the 16th to discuss revisions to the Neutrality Law. A representative from the Department of Commerce attended the meeting and explained the impact of the current Neutrality Law on U.S. commerce during wartime. Although the authorities are keeping it secret, according to well-informed sources, the acting chairman of the committee, Mr. Bloom, has submitted a draft of the new Neutrality Law that has been endorsed by the State Department. The content is similar to the bill previously proposed by Democratic Senator Gillette, advocating that the President be authorized to designate any country as an aggressor and designate a certain area as a danger zone in the event of international war, and that U.S. citizens and ships are not allowed to go there to engage in commerce, otherwise all risks should be borne by themselves. In this way, the United States can continue to supply arms to certain belligerent countries without the government having to compensate for accidental losses. However, when the committee discussed the case today, the debate was fierce and the meeting had to be adjourned. It is generally expected that Mr. Bloom will have to draft a compromise proposal and submit it for discussion again.

### The British King Embarks for Ottawa Yesterday – Performs Canadian Royal Duties for the First Time – Approves U.S. Ambassador to Canada

[Reuters, Quebec, 18th] The British King and Queen were warmly received at the government banquet today. The evening's welcome program included a large fireworks display, watched by thousands of people. The British King and Queen left for Montreal at 9:19 a.m. (local time) today and are expected to arrive at approximately 2:15 p.m., and will depart for Ottawa at 11:00 p.m. Newspapers in Canada, the United States, and France have criticized the welcome the British King and Queen received in Quebec. A "New York Times" correspondent stationed in Quebec said, "If the British King and Queen can receive such a warm welcome in British Canada and the United States, they will have completed the primary goal of this trip, which is to conquer North America. "The Kingston "Standard" said, "A new conquest of Canada has taken place on the Plains of Abraham."

Grand Welcome in Quebec

[Reuters, Quebec, 18th] Yesterday, the British King performed the duties of the King of Canada for the first time and formally approved the U.S. government's appointment of Mr. Roberts as the ambassador to Canada.

[Reuters, Quebec, 17th] The "Empress of Australia" has arrived here. When the British King and Queen appeared on the deck of the ship, the crowds on the shore cheered wildly. The British King wore a naval admiral's uniform, and the Queen wore a gray-white dress. Escorting warships were lined up in the middle of the river. Minutes after the "Empress of Australia" dropped anchor, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie boarded the ship to welcome them. The British King and Queen landed at 3:38 p.m. (British Standard Time), and military horns sounded loudly, and Governor-General Besborough fired a 21-gun salute to pay tribute. The escorting warships also fired salutes in return. Among the audience gathered on the riverbank, some used telescopes, and others stood on the cliffs regardless of the danger. After the British King and Queen shook hands with the welcoming dignitaries, they were led to a platform to meet with Canadian cabinet members and many celebrities, and then drove to the Legislative Assembly building, where the crowds greeted them with enthusiastic cheers. Quebec Governor Duplessis officially welcomed the British King and Queen at the Legislative Assembly, expressing "the joy, respect, loyalty, and love of the entire province of Quebec." Mr. Duplessis recalled the grand occasions of the British King George V (during the era of Prince of Wales) in 1908 and Queen Mary's visit to Canada in 1901, and said, "We are particularly pleased that the British King's visit to Canada started in Quebec, which is the cradle of Canada. We believe that the British King is the fortress of our people's democratic system and constitutional freedom." The British King and Queen then went to the Governor-General's residence, where the leader of the Senate government, Mr. Dandurand, delivered a welcome speech in French, stating that the French-Canadians are willing to sincerely support the British King. The British King also responded in French, praising the beauty of Quebec and saying that the French and British peoples live here together in harmony. The spirit of Quebec is a combination of progress and conservatism. From early morning to late at night, countless people have cheered enthusiastically for the British King. This afternoon, 20,000 schoolchildren sang "God Save the King" and "O Canada" to the British King and Queen. Later, the British King issued a decree expressing his gratitude for the welcome telegrams from the United States and various autonomous territories, but there were so many that he could not reply to each one individually.

A Short Commentary

### The Heroines Among Seven Overseas Chinese

The Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan is a war for all Chinese people to fight for independence, freedom, and happiness. If this war is compromised halfway, not only will the country be lost, but the whole people will be humiliated. Even our Chinese descendants will be trapped in eternal suffering, and the entire world peace and human culture will be trampled and poisoned by the fascist invaders beyond imagination. However, the current war of resistance is still becoming increasingly difficult, and the * people and traitors are trying their best to undermine our * solidarity and obstruct our war of resistance. Therefore, we must mobilize the dynamic strength of the entire nation to support the war of resistance and crush the * poisonous schemes. This * not only relies on our compatriots at home, but also hopes for the efforts of overseas Chinese. Here, we not only hope that every man will join the army, but also that the 22.5 million women will rise up and participate!

Mr. Guan Wensen, an overseas Chinese businessman in Kuala Lumpur, has solely funded the establishment of the Wensen Women's Home Service Team. A group of seven people returned to the country from Singapore yesterday and arrived in Hong Kong. They will set off for Dongjiang within days to serve the soldiers on the front line. First of all, we want to pay the highest respect to the seven female overseas Chinese compatriots of the Wensen team: Ou Jinzhuo, Wang Chunhong, Li Fengdi, Zhu Shaozhen, He Yulan, Ye Qingshou, and Gu Xiuying, because you are the first to respond to the call of the motherland suffering in the flames of war, and the first to return to the embrace of the motherland in the heroic posture of patriotic overseas Chinese women, fighting for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the motherland! Among the extravagant and dissolute women, how admirable and proud you are! Among the aspiring women who are eager to join but have no way, how heroic you are as vanguards! Thousands upon thousands of supporters will follow behind the banner of "Saving the Motherland" that you are holding high! Secondly, we offer our highest respect to Mr. Guan Wensen, an overseas Chinese businessman in Kuala Lumpur! Because investing in assisting overseas Chinese to return to the country to serve is not only more commendable than any *華 act, but also more significant than any local * charitable donation. This behavior can not only be an *範 for thousands of wealthy overseas Chinese businessmen, but also greatly glorify overseas Chinese internationally and strengthen the determination of international justice advocates to assist China!

Follow the heroines among the seven Huapan and march towards the motherland in the flames of war! Follow in the footsteps of Mr. Guan, an overseas Chinese businessman in Kuala Lumpur, and enthusiastically donate to the motherland in distress!

### Adapting to Extraordinary Times – Automatic Registration of Chinese People Already Implemented – Announced Starting Yesterday That Anyone with Specialized Talents Can Register – Four Chinese Representatives Issue a Proclamation to Overseas Chinese, Please Participate Enthusiastically

The Hong Kong government authorities have taken the step of registering Chinese and British residents in order to adapt to the needs of extraordinary times. The registration of British people has already exceeded 80%, and the authorities have decided to end it at the end of this month. The automatic registration of Chinese people was also announced to begin yesterday. Its nature is slightly different from the registration of British people. The registration of British people is mandatory, while the registration of Chinese people is purely voluntary. Chinese people, whether British or not, who possess the abilities and qualifications sought by the authorities can register automatically, and those who do not wish to do so may decline. The authorities have been preparing for the automatic registration of Chinese people for a long time, and it was only officially implemented yesterday. The registration form for soliciting the automatic registration of Chinese people with specialized talents has been printed. Although there is no stipulation regarding the registration deadline, the authorities have notified all registration offices to collect the forms at the end of June and send them back to the Chinese Civil Affairs Department. Chinese people aged 18 and above who are willing to serve Hong Kong voluntarily are requested to register at the designated registration offices.

The Chinese Civil Affairs Director Talks About the Beginning and End

Mr. Cary, the Director of Chinese Civil Affairs, met with reporters yesterday and announced the free registration of human resources. He stated that the Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the British Personnel Registration Ordinance in the spring of this year. This ordinance does not include Chinese people in the list of those who must register. He recalled that at a meeting of the Hong Kong Legislative Council last year, Chinese representative Mr. Zhou Junnian commented on the government's proposal to hold a personnel registration of Hong Kong residents. Mr. Zhou believed that Chinese people should not be an exception to the registration. He believed that some Chinese people were born in Hong Kong, and some had lived in Hong Kong for as long as twenty or thirty years. They have great love for Hong Kong, so the government also decided to hold free registration for Chinese people. The Civil Affairs Department is responsible for everything. Now 3,000 forms have been printed and distributed to various community organizations. Because this is a voluntary matter, it has not been possible to limit the registration period. However, it cannot be delayed repeatedly, so I have ordered all registration offices to collect the forms at the end of June and send them back to the Civil Affairs Department for sorting.

Proclamation to Overseas Chinese by Chinese Representatives

This matter is now being handled by Chinese representatives Sir Lo Yuk-ho and Mr. Tam Ya-shih, a Chinese member of the Municipal Sanitation Council, in accordance with the authorities' intentions.

### The Responsibility for National Rise and Fall Lies With Every Citizen; Overseas Female Compatriots Form Teams to Return and Serve the Country; Nanyang Huiqiao Relief Association Welcomes the "Vincent Team" Yesterday; A Group of Seven Will Return to Dongguan, Bao'an, and Zengcheng to Serve in Various Locations

The Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps "Vincent Team," comprising seven individuals (female), led by team leader Ms. Ou Jinxiong, arrived in Hong Kong from Nanyang the day before yesterday. They are scheduled to depart during the day to serve in Dongguan, Bao'an, and Zengcheng. This situation has been reported in previous issues. The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief Association's Hong Kong Relief Office, to encourage them, held a tea party at the Huichang Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon to welcome the team leader Ou Jinxiong, recorder Wang Chunjiang, team members Zhu Shaozhen, Gu Xiuying, He Yulan, Ye Qingxiu, Li Fengdi, and former deputy commander of the Boluo Guerrilla Team, Chen Jie, Ke Xiaotang, Chen Chengkuan, Lin Lisan, and dozens of others. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The meeting started on time, and after performing the rituals,

All Seven Members Are Female

Chairman Ke Xiao announced the reason for the meeting, stating that today, our office welcomes the Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps "Vincent Team." We are honored and grateful to have everyone present to offer guidance. Since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese in Nanyang have continuously contributed money and effort to help the motherland and have shown enthusiastic sympathy, which is deeply admired. The Nanyang Huiqiao Relief Association previously organized two teams to return to the country to serve. Now, Mr. Vincent Huan has independently organized the "Vincent Team" to return home to serve wounded soldiers and refugees at the front lines. This shows that the saying "overseas Chinese are the mother of revolution" is very accurate. All the members of the "Vincent Team" are female, which is particularly commendable. It shows that for our country to achieve final victory, not only men must rise up, but women must also rise up. With men and women united, striving for victory in the War of Resistance, the strength of the nation's resistance will be greater, and victory will come sooner. Finally, he hoped that all members of the "Vincent Team" would return to the countryside, mobilize thousands upon thousands of rural women to contribute to the country, and achieve the final victory of national liberation. End of speech.

Departing During the Day to Serve in Dongbao

Subsequently, Ms. Zhu Shaozhen, representing the team, gave a brief report on the organization's progress. First, she expressed her gratitude for the welcoming meeting and expressed her deep humility. She stated that since the War of Resistance, overseas compatriots have been organizing teams to return to the country to serve. Among the overseas compatriots who were unable to return to the country to serve, their enthusiasm for the work of saving the country was exceptionally strong. The team was established on the 21st of last month, with training scheduled from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and in the afternoon, they engaged in the work of collecting medicines. On the 2nd, the training and fundraising concluded simultaneously. At that time, they raised over a thousand yuan. By the 5th of this month, they started their journey to Hong Kong. On the ship, enthusiastic individuals donated over 140 yuan, which will be used to purchase medicines to comfort the soldiers at the front. With such enthusiasm from our compatriots, the final victory of our country can be secured. Ms. Zhu continued, stating that the team will depart to serve in Dongguan, Bao'an, Zengcheng, and other places. Today, they received a warm welcome, expressing their willingness to serve the country with loyalty. Finally, Ms. Zhu, on behalf of the entire team, extended the most respectful greetings to everyone. After the speech, Mr. Zhong Xiunan delivered a speech, expressing his respect for the "Vincent Team" for coming from afar and sacrificing their home-saving work. He also expressed his admiration for the fact that the team was entirely composed of women. Finally, Chen and others delivered words of encouragement. The tea party concluded around 4:00 PM.

### Hong Kong Deputy Supervisor Goes to Chongqing to Discuss Sino-British Cultural Cooperation; Domestic Universities and Hong Kong Exchange Professors; Sino-British Cultural Association to Establish Branch

Sino-British cultural cooperation has become increasingly close in recent years. Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote recently appointed a special committee to study the cooperation between the University of Hong Kong and Chinese higher education, which is a further manifestation of Sino-British cultural cooperation. The Deputy Supervisor of the University of Hong Kong, Mr. Sloss, recently visited Chongqing for this matter to meet with our education authorities and cultural leaders, and to seek their opinions. Mr. Sloss will return to Hong Kong in the coming days. The Sino-British Gengkuan Management Committee has allocated 10,000 yuan to establish a quota for selecting domestic students to study at the University of Hong Kong. The University of Hong Kong and domestic universities have also decided to exchange professors. Furthermore, the Sino-British Cultural Association will establish a branch in Hong Kong in the near future.

### China National Salvation Drama Troupe to Host Guests Tomorrow Afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Gloucester Hotel; Inviting Celebrities to Seek Advice

The China National Salvation Drama Troupe has achieved remarkable results in its propaganda work on the front lines and in rural areas. A month ago, in order to enhance the national salvation sentiment of overseas compatriots and expand the international aid-China movement, it came to Hong Kong from the mainland to prepare for propaganda activities in Nanyang, the Philippines, and the United States. Since arriving in Hong Kong, it has been warmly welcomed by various groups. This situation has been reported in previous issues. The Federation of Various Circles in Hong Kong, admiring the troupe's theatrical art, has invited it to give a large-scale charity performance for the Federation before its departure abroad, in order to raise funds for disaster relief and national salvation propaganda. The troupe has now decided to stage great plays such as "Defend the Motherland," "Long Live the Nation," and "The Spring of Taierzhuang" at the Lee Theatre for three consecutive nights starting on the 25th of this month. At that time, there will surely be a grand and enthusiastic occasion. It is reported that after the performance, the troupe will immediately go to Nanyang to comfort overseas compatriots and complete even greater tasks. In order to seek advice and thank the various groups for their kindness, the troupe has specifically scheduled a tea party tomorrow (the 20th) at 3:00 PM on the second floor of the Gloucester Hotel, inviting celebrities from all walks of life in Hong Kong to attend and provide guidance. It has already invited He Xiaosheng, Luo Xuhhe, Luo Wenjin, Soong Ching-ling, He Xiangning, Wang Zhengting, Wu Zhongcheng, Zhou Qigang, San Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, He Shili, and others, as well as leaders from the cultural, journalistic, educational, and various other fields, to attend.

### "Every Inch of Land is Precious," "Making the Most of Every Piece of Land!" Small Shops Under the Stairs

— Yu Wan

Areas with Foreign Buildings Filling Hong Kong and Kowloon After the War of Resistance

"The boat moves, one feels the bank shifting." There are not "few" foreign buildings in Hong Kong; it is just that too "many" people have come—refugees driven away by [omission] people, drifting like a tide to the edge of the sea. At this time, the large island of Hong Kong is just right for the refugees to "land together on the other shore."

During calm and peaceful times, one or even an entire building on the island would be available for rent. Even if a sign was posted, it would take at least one or two days, or even a week, for someone to inquire. The rent and terms would have to be discussed repeatedly. However, nowadays, not to mention an entire floor or building, even a small room or corner requires three times the rent or even demands for "extra fees" or "commissions." When a house becomes available for rent, there is simply no need to post a sign. Even if one is posted, it will never tell people the house number... Whether it's monopoly or control, finding a house requires one to "lower one's head and bow one's heart"!

"Demand exceeds supply, prices will be high." This is a natural phenomenon. When people are crowded together, rents are raised higher. Many refugees want to do business, scraping together some money to make a living, but how can so many refugees find a way in a capitalist society?

Using the space under the stairs to open a shop is truly "making the most of every piece of land"! A hungry crowd, they do not have the ability to open large stores, so they have to seek a way out under the stairs.

This is not just an accidental glimpse, but a common phenomenon. Over the past six months, when we walk down the street, as long as we pay a little attention, we can see small shops under the stairs everywhere. Whether in Hong Kong or Kowloon, in every residential area, such as Caine Road, Wong Nai Chung Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, etc., at the entrances of stone, cement, or Italian plaster stairs, we almost always see these cramped small shops. Here, there is a doorway decorated in a grand style. There are small spaces with glass cabinets and shelves arranged haphazardly, filled with Western magazines, and others piled with stationery. The so-called modern, new-style window decorations are unexpectedly applied to the corners under the stairs. They, struggling, are they not just as miserably managed? Look, the sparkling electric lights illuminate their groceries brightly, and the charming potted flowers adorn their facades with red and green colors.

Some use a hundred or so dollars as their capital, some use two hundred dollars to unfold their "beautiful dreams," and there are quite a few who are struggling hard with only ten or twenty dollars. What do they sell? They do not have warehouses or storage, they are simply "hawkers" under the capitalist system. In terms of supplies, they have Western-style stationery and envelopes, scarves and ties; snow creams, lipsticks, and nail polishes, as long as they are cheap and easy to sell, they have everything; in terms of food, they contain everything imaginable. There are biscuits, pastries, and the rest are olives, preserved plums, Chia Ying Zi, walnut cakes, fish skin peanuts, iron-essence beef, kiwi candies, Saqima... Is there anything they don't have? As for things to play with, they are even more comprehensive. Model paper is the most popular item recently; even clay figurines, wooden rabbits, and paper frogs are arranged in a variety of ways to cater to customers as much as possible.

In the small shops, one cannot see pot-bellied managers full of the smell of money, nor can one see bosses in long gowns and short jackets. What one sees are the fate-resistors who are clenching their teeth and struggling for a living. The middle-aged ones may even be small businessmen fleeing from the occupied areas, and the elderly ones are even more trying to prolong their lives with dwindling energy! Among them, the most noteworthy and the most serious issue is the many young girls. They are at the age of youth and vitality, could it be that they have no home to return to, or no books to read? This group, this group, are they taking the opportunity to make money, or are they forced to do this? — Where do they live? Ah! — In a prismatic corner under the stairs, they seek a place to settle down, just like silkworms making nests.

I heard that even a staircase entrance like this costs ten or eight dollars to rent. This is how the so-called "every inch of land is precious" is formed. When the night falls, the neon lights intoxicate the ladies; the young women in the small shops also put on thicker rouge. We see her smiling at the moon-like tips of her eyebrows; she understands, this one dollar and eight cents of income is enough to make a living! But is this the real way out? Where is the real way out? Let smart readers answer for themselves.

In the home of Mrs. Tan Shifan, the chairman of the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, her old lady is painstakingly supervising the servants and receiving guests during the rehearsal of the drama. She also personally takes care of the makeup and costumes, ensuring that each actor wears the correct attire. She does not delegate this task to others, but respectfully provides for them. I understand the old lady's intentions, because the actors are taking on the important responsibility of saving the nation through charity performances, and they are very busy. If she can take care of their clothes, it will surely bring them mental pleasure. If they can gain mental pleasure, the appeal to the audience will naturally be stronger.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Determines Measures to Handle Accumulated Cases in Various Counties, Dealing with Them Leniently to Expedite the Resolution of Outstanding Cases

(Special Dispatch from Shaoguan) Since Li Han-hun took office as the chairman of Guangdong Province, his aim has been to eliminate corruption and promote benefits. Considering that various counties in the province have suffered from successive incidents, and county magistrates have been frequently replaced, cases have often remained unsettled, with some cases dating back dozens of terms of office. These cases have been repeatedly shirked and deferred, leading to a daily increase in accumulated cases. It is estimated that from the third year of the Republic of China (1914) to the end of July of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), there were more than 1,200 accumulated cases that had not been resolved. Repeated urging for supplementary handling has been ineffective. Although the provincial government had passed measures for clearing accumulated cases in August of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), only a few have complied with them to this day. This is partly due to the lack of vigorous implementation by county magistrates, but also because many cases are difficult to clear due to the remoteness of the years, changes in personnel, unknown addresses, or the death of the persons involved, and other reasons. Rather than leaving the debts uncleared and facing endless entanglements, it is better to set a deadline and deal with them leniently to expedite the resolution of outstanding cases. Therefore, the Department of Finance has been instructed to revise the clearing measures, which have been submitted to the 25th provincial affairs meeting for approval and implementation. The main points are as follows: (1) All unsettled cases of former county and city bureau chiefs or magistrates from January of the 3rd year of the Republic of China (1914) to the end of July of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) shall be cleared in accordance with the following measures. (2) If a former county or city bureau chief or magistrate, whether or not they have completed handover procedures, falls under any of the following categories, the case shall be closed upon approval by the Department of Finance based on a truthful report from the successor, and the closure shall be reported to the provincial government for record-keeping: 1. The person has passed away and has no heirs. 2. The person served for less than three months, did not complete handover procedures, and there are no investigations of arrears in public funds. 3. A register has already been created and reported, but the case has not been closed due to incomplete procedures. After investigation and reporting by the successor, with no arrears in public funds, the case shall be closed upon approval by the Department of Finance, and the closure shall be reported to the provincial government for record-keeping. (3) For cases where handover procedures have been completed and registers have been submitted to the county or city bureau but have not yet been closed, the current officeholder shall handle them in accordance with the following provisions: 1. If the managed funds have been cleared and there are no arrears, regardless of whether the original submitted forms are complete or not, the matter shall be promptly investigated, reported to the Department of Finance for approval and closure, and reported to the provincial government for record-keeping. 2. If the handover procedures have been completed and submitted to the county or city bureau but have been subsequently lost and cannot be resubmitted, and after investigation, it is found that there are no arrears in public funds, the successor shall investigate, revise, and report to the Department of Finance for approval and closure, and report the closure to the provincial government for record-keeping. 3. If it is clearly determined that there are arrears in public funds, a register shall be immediately created and reported, along with the amount of arrears and a detailed list, and two copies shall be prepared and submitted to the Department of Finance for review and transfer to the Department of Civil Affairs for verification. For those who served for more than three months and have created a handover register, if there are confirmed arrears in public funds, the current officeholder shall investigate and urge repayment, and report to the Department of Finance for compilation and publication in newspapers in Hong Kong, Macau, Shaoguan, and Shantou, setting a deadline for settlement before the end of October of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). If the deadline is exceeded, the Department of Finance shall verify the facts and issue an arrest warrant for investigation and prosecution. 5. If current public officials in the province have outstanding handover matters from their previous tenure as county or city bureau chiefs or magistrates, they shall immediately send personnel to the relevant counties or city bureaus to settle them within the time limit specified in the preceding article. If the deadline is exceeded, they shall be dismissed and handled in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article. 6. If a current county or city bureau chief is ordered to hand over their duties during the period of clearing handover documents and cases, they shall specifically transfer the handled clearing records and other documents to the successor for continued processing. 7. Current county and city bureau chiefs may hire additional personnel to assist in clearing handover cases, as appropriate. The required labor costs, stationery, and other expenses shall be budgeted and submitted to the Department of Finance for approval, and paid from the county and local reserve funds for the 28th year. 8. Current county and city bureau chiefs shall complete the clearing by the end of October of the 28th year (1939). Those who exceed the deadline shall be subject to the following penalties: 1. A minor demerit for exceeding the deadline by half a month. 2. A major demerit for exceeding the deadline by one month. 3. Dismissal for exceeding the deadline by three months. The aforementioned measures will be officially announced and implemented soon.

### Ten Highest Paid People in America: MGM Chairman Receives Highest Salary: Hollywood Figures Account for Seven out of Ten

(1) Unprecedented Record According to recent news from Washington, the list of people who earned more than $15,000 per year in 1937 has been compiled. This list was compiled by the Department of Finance based on the income taxes paid by each individual. The results show that seven of the top ten highest paid people are Hollywood figures. Louis B. Mayer, Chairman of MGM, ranked first with an annual salary of $1,296,503. The annual salary is so generous that it has never been seen before in the United States, creating an unprecedented page. Among the top twenty highest paid people, fifteen are actors, actresses or film company executives. If we take the company as a unit, the table shows that the top three companies are MGM Films, DuPont, and Metropolitan Life Insurance. The annual salaries of the employees in these three companies who earn more than $15,000 are: MGM (240 people), DuPont (196 people), and Metropolitan (167 people). According to statistics, the annual salaries of wage earners increased significantly in 1937 compared to 1936.

Clark Gable: Clark's comedies are more numerous than war and historical films. The comedies have an average development, while the historical films are best known for "Mutiny on the Bounty".

Wallace Beery: Wallace Beery's "The Champ" and "Min and Bill" are immortal works, and "Viva Villa!" can be called the representative of the immortal works.

William Powell: William is good at acting in realistic dramas, and his performances are also balanced. If movie fans are not forgetful, the former "The Thin Man" and the current "The Great Detective Nick" should be the most hilarious.

Tyrone Power: Tyrone's famous works are "Lloyd's of London" and "In Old Chicago". Tyrone in "In Old Chicago" is not weak either. These two films can be called Tyrone's representative works.

Errol Flynn: Errol's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" are already known to everyone as Errol's two best films.

### Pygmalion (4) Produced by MGM Based on the Original Work by George Bernard Shaw Starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller

She thought to herself that this girl was extremely lovely. He greeted her with a smile.

Then they began to talk. Although Eliza's speech had some blurring on a certain tone, people couldn't tell after listening to it. But when it came to long conversations, she didn't know how to answer people's questions. Mrs. Higgins asked her how the weather was, and she recited the practice sentence that the professor had taught her, which made the listeners confused. Later, when they talked about health, she replied in a vulgar language. The guests were all nobles and didn't understand at all. They stared at each other. Higgins was so anxious that he was in a terrible state, and his repeated hints were ineffective. Knowing that this time she must have revealed her secrets, he himself could not avoid being used as a joke by the people of London. Furthermore, he would lose the bet with Pickering.

At the critical moment, a savior suddenly came. One of the guests, a young man named Freddie Hill, had been looking at Eliza with a fascinated look. At this time, he suddenly laughed.

"I say, Miss Doolittle," his tone was full of hot appreciation, "you have learned those new slang words so interestingly."

"New slang words, yes," Higgins had to put on a forced smile and echoed, but the eyes looking at Eliza were not happy.

When he, Pickering, and Eliza returned to the laboratory on Downing Street, he was very unhappy. Eliza, like a wronged child, sat on a chair and cried sadly.

Pickering looked at her sympathetically and said gently, "We should be ashamed, Higgins. We really shouldn't have done this."

Higgins suddenly smiled and said, "Maybe we were too hasty, but I can correct it."

Eliza sighed long, raised her lovely eyes, and looked at him eagerly.

### Hong Kong-Philippines Tennis Exhibition Match: Xu Wei-pei Bravely Defeats Philippine General: Philippine Generals Win All Other Matches

[New Asia News] Yesterday afternoon at 4 pm, the second Hong Kong-Philippines tennis exhibition match was held at the YMCA. The order was: (1) Doubles, Philippine players vs. Lam Zhen brothers, (2) Singles, Om-bang vs. Xu Run-pei, (3) Singles, San Jashi vs. Xu Wei-pei. All three programs were spectacular. The last scene can be called the "Hong Kong-Philippines International Singles Tennis Tournament", because Xu is the Hong Kong champion and San Jashi is the Philippine champion.

First battle

The Lam Zhen brothers tried their best in their first battle against the Philippine generals, but unfortunately their ball luck was not good. In the first set, they actually lost four games. They were completely unable to cope with the pair of San Jashi and Om-bang. After this threat, the Lam Zhen brothers changed their strategy and sent high balls to attack the opponent's weaknesses when they had the chance. They gradually caught up and made it a 5-5 tie. After that, San Chengshi's high pressure gradually improved, unlike yesterday's lack of confidence. He broke the Lam brothers' strategy and won 7-5. In the second set, Om-bang showed off his skills, and his attacks and defenses were commendable. The "pounce" in front of the net was even more miraculous. The Governor of Hong Kong, who was watching the game, applauded repeatedly. As a result, the Philippine generals won the second set again with 6-4. The results are as follows: Shan An - 7-5 6-4 - Lam Zhen Brothers

Second battle

Xu Runpei and Anbang competed in a singles match. Xiao Xu did his best in the first set and tied four times. The competition was quite fierce. The child Anbang was not only good at deadly attacks, but also very good at defense and rescue. Every dangerous ball sent out by Xiao Xu was hit back by his "skating-style quick steps". The audience kept cheering. Anbang's weakness was in the backhand, so Xiao Xu repeatedly sent the ball to his left. However, Anbang was agile and had many tricks to make up for his shortcomings, and finally won the first set 7-5. In the second set, Xiao Xu became more lax and lost to Anbang 1-6. Yesterday, Xiao Xu performed well in the first set. Just look at the results, and you will know that Xiao Xu had a great chance of defeating Anbang. It is a pity that Xiao Xu failed to fight calmly and was defeated.

Anbang - 7-5 6-1 - Xu Runpei

Third battle

San Jashi vs. Da Xu, San Jashi served first, with three consecutive "double faults", and then three consecutive "aces". He took advantage of the serve to take the first game. In the second game, Da Xu used two techniques to deal with the enemy: a forehand smash and a backhand slice. He won back a game and made it 1-1. After that, San Jashi served and San Jashi won, and Da Xu served and Da Xu won. They held on to each other and tied 4-4. When Da broke San Jashi's serve at 5-4, he became active and sent strong sideline balls continuously. Although San Jashi could not resist, Da won 6-4. In the second set, San Jashi managed to take a 2-0 lead, but Da reversed the defeat and won 6-2 in one go.

Looking at the two major battles, Da Xu has always displayed his personal peak skills. His weakest serving technique has been completely renewed, which is really a good work. San Jashi is not weak. The forehand "horizontal slice" is extremely sharp. Even if it is hit once, the opponent is helpless. Compared with when he came to Hong Kong last December, he has made great progress. It can be said that he is a different person. This time Xu was able to defeat this master, which can be said to be heroic.

Da Xu - 6-4 6-2 - San Jashi

### Odds and Ends from the Ballfield

...The Xuhe Cup football final, which was undecided the week before last, was replayed between the Navy and South China at Jiashan at 5 PM the day before yesterday. Although there was a Taiwan-Philippines Cup tennis exhibition match at 4 PM on the same day, football fans and enthusiasts flocked to Jiashan to watch the game. Including friends from Langyuan and Shandaoh, the crowd swelled to about 10,000 people. It was considered the last scene of the football season, a rare opportunity not to be missed. Wang Zhengting, Lu Guang, Chen Ce, and others also attended with their wives as spectators (Note: Wang, Lu, and Chen are all government officials who are very enthusiastic about supporting sports).

...Five o'clock arrived, but South China only had ten players, which alarmed the fans. Center forward Li Huitang was late. It was said that he couldn't leave his office early due to official business. The fans waited anxiously.

...Navy defender Xuan Di made an excessive move, intentionally hitting Yang Shuiyi. The referee was fair and ejected him, adding a stain to the football game.

...South China won the championship with a score of 4-1, completing the unprecedented feat of winning six major championships this year for a Chinese team.

After the game, Mrs. Jia Naixi presented the awards, and the fans were overjoyed. There will be opportunities in the future. Goodbye for now. (Xin Sheng)

### School Volleyball Tournament: Senior Baoluo Defeats Hanzhong; Junior Peiying Easily Defeats Southwest

The school volleyball tournament, organized by the Volleyball Association, held two matches yesterday, one senior and one junior. In the senior match, Baoluo played against Hanzhong. Baoluo was quite strong, with consistent attacks from the front row and meticulous defense from the middle and back rows. Hou Yueyu and Ren Zhaohui were able to attack from the sides, and the back line was also well-coordinated. Hanzhong fought hard as a team, and their defense was also mutually supportive, but their offensive power on the front line was weak, so they were repeatedly taken advantage of by Baoluo, who won 3-0. After the start of the match, Baoluo's momentum was strong. Hou Yueyu and Liao Jianfen attacked from the left and right. Hanzhong's Zheng Guancan, Yang Yongsen, Liu Binglin, and Pan Rurong also tried their best to fight back. After a fierce battle, Baoluo took the lead in the first game with 21-16. Taking advantage of their victory, Baoluo repeatedly put pressure on Hanzhong. Chen Huaquan, Hou Yueyu, Ren Zhaohui, Liao Jianfen, and Huang Yuchang attacked from five directions, and Hanzhong was in a state of chaos. Li Qihao, Yang Zhenlv, and Liu Binglin tried their best to block, and Li Yufen and Lin Qingmin advanced step by step, but Baoluo continued to apply pressure, and Hanzhong still lost with a score of 8-21. Afterwards, Hanzhong hoped to recover lost ground, but Baoluo's army was in full swing. Hou Yueyu fired from the front, Ren Zhaohui attacked from the back, and Huang Yuchang and Li Mingjie were able to support. Hanzhong launched a counterattack when they were down 8-15, but Baoluo's back row was already prepared, and ultimately it was ineffective. The third game was lost with a score of 12-21. In the junior match between Peiying and Southwest, Peiying's combat power was quite strong, and the match became one-sided. Southwest resisted, but lost 3-0. In the first game, Peiying won 21-5, in the second game 21-9, and in the third game 21-6. The lineups of the two senior teams are as follows:

### Foreign Exchange Arbitrage and Capital Flight

— Ying Yongyu

1. What is Foreign Exchange Arbitrage?

The Shanghai foreign exchange market has always distinguished between near-term and forward contracts. Due to market conditions, there is a difference between the market prices of near-term and forward contracts. Sometimes the near-term price is higher than the forward price, and sometimes the near-term price is lower than the forward price. Recently, the market has mostly been near-cheap and far-expensive, meaning that the price for this month is lower than the price for the next month. If you buy a futures contract for this month and sell a futures contract for the next month at the same time, a difference will occur. This difference is interest. The level of interest depends on the size of the difference. The method is similar to the previous arbitrage of public bonds.

Regarding the method of calculating interest rates for arbitrage, there are two types: ordinary method and simplified method. The method of calculating interest rates for English gold arbitrage will be described separately below.

(1) Ordinary algorithm,

For example, on December 24th, the opening price of the black market for foreign exchange in the morning was 8.59375 for the English gold in December, and 8.5625 for January of the 28th year. If you want to invest 10,000 pounds, what is the monthly interest rate?

National currency to be delivered in December

National currency can be received in January The difference is $1,019.24, which is $279,272.73 in monthly interest. To find the monthly interest rate,

That is, the monthly interest rate is more than three-tenths.

(2) Simplified algorithm,

Divide the difference between the market prices of the current and next months by the market price of the next month and multiply by the monthly interest rate.

According to the above example,

The difference between the market prices in December and January is 0.03125, and the market price in January is 8.5625. The calculation formula is as follows:

0.03125+8,5625×1,000＝3,64995033, which is more than three-tenths per month.

Date Market price

July 21 July 18.4375

August 18.25

August 20 August 17.25

September 16.90625

August 30 August 17.25

September 16.78215

September 22 September 17.25

October 16.90625

October 16.90625

October 21 October 15.70

November 15.5

November 21 January 16.0625

December 15.9530125

December 20 December 16.1875

January 16.125

Difference

Monthly Interest

Two eight class seven five one zero point two seven three nine seven two six

One two eight seven five one two point nine three nine zero zero one eight four

Four six eight seven five two seven point nine three two nine six zero eight nine

Three four three seven five two zero point three three two seven one seven one nine

Two five one six point one two nine zero three two two five

One zero nine three seven five six point eight five six zero two three five

Zero six two five three point eight seven five nine six eight nine nine two

The ordinary algorithm and the simplified algorithm have the same principle. The interest rates obtained are mostly the same, and the tails are slightly different due to the rounding of the English gold combined with the national currency.

Method of calculating interest rates for US dollar arbitrage:

For example, on June 23, 27th year, the black market price for June was 18 yuan,

The price for July is 17 and a half yuan, what is the monthly interest rate?

(Calculated in US$100,000)

(1) Ordinary algorithm,

National currency to be delivered in June

National currency can be received in July

The difference is $15,873.02, which is $555,555.5 in monthly interest. To find the monthly interest rate,

Multiply $15,873.02 by 1,000 (monthly interest rate) divided by $555,559.55 = 28.5714362

That is, the monthly interest rate is more than 2.8%.

(1) Simplified algorithm,

The difference between the market prices in June and July is 50, and the market price in July is 17.5. The calculation formula is as follows:, 50 17.5×1,000 28.57142857,

That is, the monthly interest rate is more than 2.8%.

The interest rates obtained by the above two methods are mostly the same, and the asterisks are slightly different due to the rounding of the US dollar combined with the national currency.

Note: The above interest rates do not deduct the funds used by the broker. According to bank practice, one twenty-second of a percent must be paid for the national currency invested in the sale of foreign exchange, and no funds are paid for the purchase of foreign exchange.

3. Comparison of High and Low US Dollar Arbitrage Interest Rates in the Last Half Year

In order to compare the high and low arbitrage interest rates in Shanghai in the past six months, we have selected the daily comparison in the most recent six months that can represent it (because the arbitrage interest rates on each day in each month vary depending on the size of the difference) and listed them separately below to observe the general trend. 』The company's profits were as high as 700 yuan. There were two reasons for such a harvest:

(1) Sales in Europe and the United States have improved, and silk prices have soared as a result.

(2) The dried cocoons stored in the warehouses of Chinese manufacturers were confiscated.

Now Xidi is forced to continue invading the silk mills under its control, with a total of 14 factories and 4,852 machines. Legitimate merchants are unable to gain a foothold and have to set up factories in Shanghai. From April of last year to the present year, according to the most accurate statistics in the silk industry, there are a total of 37 factories, 20 of which are distributed in the concession area and 17 in the Shanghai West out-of-bounds area. The total number of machines is 5,835, and 70% (such as 4,084 machines) work night shifts. Therefore, there are currently about 10,000 silk machines in Shanghai, producing more than 3,100 dan of silk per month. If we calculate 4 dan of dried cocoons to produce 1 dan of raw silk, then 12,400 dan of dried cocoons are used per month. If the factory operates all year round, the raw materials that Shanghai silk factories should store must be 150,000 dan to maintain production. The above statistics are calculated based on 18 taels of silk produced per machine per day. As for the speed of work and the amount of output, it depends on the internal management of each factory. The raw silk production is now listed in the table below (the unit of measurement is catties):

### The Current Students' Necessary Reform of Physical Training (II)

— Zou Falu

In the past, students engaged in physical training mostly because of the limitations of the curriculum, the compulsion of the school, and the supervision of the teachers. They were passive and reluctant, holding the concept of doing it for the curriculum, for the school, and for the teachers. Therefore, they were perfunctory and sloppy, and as soon as they left the class, they threw physical training to the clouds. As a result of this passive and reluctant approach, school sports became the patent of a few active people, and most students had the name of physical education but not the substance of physical education. The effect of physical education was out of the question. This passive and reluctant wrong idea must be reformed, and the spirit of automatic initiative must be possessed.

In the past, students' attitudes towards sports became two phenomena: one was that they knew a little about the superficial aspects of sports and thought they were extraordinary, holding the concept of being the only one, arrogant and indulgent, and dominating the school's sports. The other was that they did not know what sports were and regarded sports as strange and ugly acts, holding the concept that it is better to hide one's clumsiness than to show it off. They regarded the sports field as a long distance and never moved throughout the year. Therefore, the phenomenon of the few strong becoming stronger and the many weak becoming weaker naturally formed. This arrogant and timid wrong idea must be reformed, and the spirit of being unashamed must be possessed.

In the past, students often held the concept that sports were for entertainment. They were willing to do sports that were entertaining, and they were willing to do them within the limits of entertainment, without having to use much effort; otherwise, they were not willing to do them. It should be known that it is acceptable to replace entertainment with sports, but it is unacceptable to think that the purpose of sports is entertainment. The more invigorated the spirit is, the more powerful the physical strength becomes, and the more outstanding the degree of endurance and hard work, the more outstanding the physical strength generated, and the more determined the physique becomes. The acquisition of a strong physique can only be obtained by exchanging effort for it. Even if it is full of money and concentrated power, it cannot be achieved. This wrong idea of regarding sports as entertainment must be eliminated, and the spirit of endurance and hard work must be possessed.

In the past, students often held the concept that sports were the only tool for fitness. When exercising, they paid attention with concentration and meticulousness. Once they left the exercise, they only wanted to wear clothes that looked good, narrow and tight; they only wanted to eat food that pleased their taste buds, devouring it; they only wanted to be warm in bed, closing the windows and covering their heads; they only loved freedom of action, romantic and corrupted. The result of this kind of exercise without hygiene is no different from hygiene without exercise; or even worse, because hygiene without exercise still has some opportunities for activity in daily work; exercise without hygiene, then the physical strength consumed by exercise and the energy consumed by not living healthy cannot be replenished, and it will inevitably lead to decline and exhaustion. This mistaken concept of emphasizing exercise must be reformed, and the spirit of equally emphasizing exercise and hygiene must be possessed.

2. Reform of Materials: There are many kinds of sports, and their nature and functions are different. It has a close relationship with the current situation and environment and the physical condition of each person. If you cannot choose the appropriate materials and use them properly, and if you do not observe the situation and do not meet the needs, and if you follow others and blindly follow suit, the results obtained are self-evident.

In the overall war of resistance, the whole country should concentrate all its strength and work hard under the goal of resisting the war. Take what is beneficial to the war of resistance, otherwise discard it. This is the unanimous position of the whole group. Therefore, I dare to arbitrarily reveal two principles for the selection of materials for students' physical training: it must be able to save the economy and enhance the war of resistance's "financial resources"; it must be applicable to military affairs and enhance the war of resistance's "human resources." Based on these two principles, we can examine the current problem of the materials used for students' physical training:

Ball games and track and field sports, especially ball games, are the sports that students like the most in the past. Throughout the country, it can be said that there are very few examples of using other sports as materials for students' physical training. Indeed, this kind of sports contains many natural movements, is free and lively, and is suitable for people's free psychology. Everyone loves it, and there is a reason for it: and the agility and flexibility of movements cannot be said to be absolutely not beneficial to military affairs. However, it is a sport that cannot be done without money, and has a completely aristocratic color, which is not suitable for the current situation in which all parties are saving money for the war of resistance; and the actions that directly or indirectly benefit the military are also insufficient.

4. The Relationship Between the Level of Interest Rates and Capital Flight

Capital flight mostly involves domestic people depositing money in foreign banks or buying foreign exchange. However, the level of arbitrage interest rates also affects capital flight. Because arbitrage interest is high, it absorbs domestic people to engage in foreign exchange arbitrage transactions. Moreover, those who do not understand what arbitrage is are also successively added to it under the promotion of newspapers on the favorable interest rates. For example, in October, because the arbitrage interest rate can be around 20% per month, arbitrage transactions were particularly active. According to the reports of the three major banks in China, the amount of money flowing directly and indirectly into foreign banks in October exceeded 10 million yuan. However, in the past two months, the interest rates offered by arbitrage have been declining, and domestic people are unwilling to engage in this kind of transaction again, and have transferred their funds back and deposited them in Chinese banks to earn interest. The amount is quite large, estimated to be several million yuan. It can be said that a part of the capital flight has been recovered. Most of the initiators of foreign exchange arbitrage are foreign banks. They determine the size of the difference due to their position, and most of them specify on the order that the foreign exchange must be deposited in the bank, without interest. Therefore, foreign arbitrage can be said to be a credit loan from foreign banks to domestic people. Based on the current market situation, if the interest rate offered by arbitrage is high, there will be more capital flight; if the interest rate is low, the capital that has escaped will naturally be recovered. The capital flight has a great impact on the market, and the rise and fall of the black market exchange rate for remittances and discounts are also related. In short, foreign exchange arbitrage and capital flight are very closely related.

### Statistics on Shanghai Silk Factory Production

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all industries have suffered huge losses. The Chinese silk industry, which was in the midst of recovery, has suffered this unprecedented catastrophe. Those who hear about it are deeply saddened. In recent years, the Chinese government has recognized silk as an important commodity for China's export, so it has spared no effort in promoting and supervising it. In addition, the efforts of our silk workers have greatly improved, so the products have been greatly refined. Shanghai is the hub of foreign trade, and the government has deliberately established a provincial inspection bureau. The Chinese silk exported must undergo strict inspection before it can be transported to Europe and the United States. Therefore, foreign firms are only willing to purchase raw silk that has passed the inspection bureau and trust it very much.

Now, the areas of cocoon production and silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have fallen one after another. The silk industry is under the control of the Japanese puppets, and all material economy is being exploited. Last year, the so-called "

### Miscellaneous Jottings from a Journey

— Lin Huanping

Two Kinds of People

During the horrific bombings of Chongqing on the third and fourth days [of the month], early on the morning of the fifth, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a sorrowful speech at the National Government Anniversary Meeting. Besides providing specific measures for emergency relief, he also urged civil and military officials to steel their resolve for sacrifice and intensify their work to counter the enemy's indiscriminate bombing. However, after the meeting, it is said that some high-ranking officials and dignitaries took their concubines and fled to safe havens in the countryside; others accompanied their wives (let's call them wives, although I bet they were mistresses!) to Hong Kong for leisure. They turned a deaf ear to Chairman Chiang's instructions. For these people, it was truly "women first, escape first"!

On the other hand, the chairman of the relief committee, the octogenarian Mr. Xu Shiying, the "father of refugees," (I won't even mention Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, who personally inspected the disaster areas and comforted the refugees.) bravely flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing, a city considered too dangerous by the cowardly, to personally oversee all emergency relief matters. He even personally inspected every refugee shelter and disaster area, supervising the distribution of aid, excavation, burial, and other work.

In addition to our utmost admiration for this fearless work ethic, we must urge those gentlemen who prioritize "women first, escape first" to learn from Mr. Xu!

Two: Gift-Giving

The poverty in the northwestern provinces truly surpasses our imagination. During my recent trip, I met many high-ranking officials from these provinces, who repeatedly sighed and told me: "Mr. Lin! Being a township head in your province is better than being a district head here; being a district head in your province is better than being a county magistrate here; being a county magistrate in your province is better than being a provincial chairman here..." I often just laughed without knowing how to respond. Later, after carefully inspecting their so-called rural and urban areas, I not only realized that their jokes contained a great deal of truth, but I was also astonished at how the people of the Northwest were able to survive!

However, even with that being said, "financial resources" are still "available." Let me give a simple example! I saw a department head buy almost two thousand dollars worth of deer antlers as gifts for his superiors. How do department heads survive in times of national crisis when they give away a year's salary in one gift? Or, where does their money come from? This humble fellow is not clever and lacks economic knowledge. I can't figure it out.

Three: Thrifty Cuisine

Article Two of the National Covenant is "not to violate government laws." The government has issued laws stating that during the national crisis, banquets should not exceed eight yuan per table for Chinese food or one yuan per person for Western food. Of course, the general "big shots," as good citizens, will abide by the National Covenant, but their method of compliance is different. For example, someone may host a dinner party, and anything less than one hundred yuan per table is considered inadequate; for Western food, anything less than five yuan per person would be embarrassing for Mr. So-and-so. Very well, so be it. When settling the bill, they simply record one Chinese meal as ten meals or one Western meal as five meals.

At the same time, all matters, large and small, public and private, must be discussed and resolved amidst the clinking of wine cups.

This is the true meaning of "thrifty cuisine."

### Quiet Chengjiang

— Qianfei

Leaving behind the lovely Shipai, I traveled a thousand miles, arriving in Chengjiang as if in a dream.

Wasn't the fragrance of eucalyptus spreading through the night in Shipai, the mountain scenery of the tea gardens, and the lake views in the bamboo forests all like a dream?

I remember how, in the moonlight, the moon shone on the green tiled roofs, reflecting silvery light, and the lake was like a mirror. Occasionally, a crow would fly across, casting a shadow on the rippling water. The evening breeze gently swayed the bamboo forests, blew through the trees, and through the trees, a myriad of lights.

Now, now everything has become a dreamlike past. The new-style buildings with red walls and green tiles have been replaced by a dilapidated ancient temple. The mud pagoda is crumbling, the cobwebs are in broken walls, and the ground is covered with dust that rises with the wind. We sat on wooden planks supported by mud bricks, and the professor stood in front of the only blackboard. Picking up the chalk eraser, I unconsciously cried out:

"It's so hard to erase." So the blackboard was rubbed roughly by the hard chalk, making a scratching sound. Knowing smiles hung on everyone's lips.

If we were happy, we would go outside to bask in the sun, sitting on the steps of the courtyard, with dry mud cracking, and small, newly sprouted flowers budding. The air was quiet, and only the professor's voice was heard. A mischievous and annoying crow would often fly by, squawking "ah...ah..."

The clock hanging on the short wooden frame chimed "dong...dong..." In our memories, it evoked the octagonal pavilion of the past. How many hearts, how many footsteps, had echoed within the clock's sound in the octagonal pavilion! Let's all rise together.

We couldn't continue in the classroom, so we had to go to the trees. The slender leaves of the eucalyptus were already a memory for us. Here, there were only sparse cypress trees, stretching straight into the sky. In the quiet night, we could no longer smell the fragrance of the eucalyptus.

The most eye-catching thing in the dormitory was the bamboo framed window, with white paper panes. Through the broken window, one could see the people inside the room, how quaint!

In Shipai, when we turned on the tap, tap water would gush out. But now, the tap was gone. No matter how the water carrier strained at the carrying pole, the pool remained dry. The Cantonese people had to take a bath only once every few days. However, sometimes, if they gave the villagers a few cents, they would bring in mountain water, even though it was dirty and might have small insects swimming in it. Still, many hands lathered soap and scrubbed clothes, while their hearts would return to lovely Guangdong, with its green hills and clear waters everywhere.

In the evening, the dim kerosene lamp emitted a faint yellow light. Black heads were bent over the wooden planks resting on mud bricks, working quietly. Only the sound of dogs barking in the night could be heard, and terrifying thoughts would slip through our minds.

Under the lamp, those who were sick wrote letters home with tears in their eyes, quietly sending their heartfelt thoughts back to their beloved hometown, to their sweet homes. But, a thousand miles away, let us pursue them in our dreams.

The small county town became lively from then on. Every day, students hurried through the only two lively streets. Every market day in Chengjiang had our participation.

Unfolding before our eyes was an unfamiliar environment. Although the transportation here was too arduous, this place was an important area in the rear.

In our lives, we gradually came to understand and recognize this new environment and unfamiliar people. The lake views, mountain scenery, and cypress forests of Chengjiang were no less than those of Shipai. However, the air here was really too suffocating, as if surrounded by high mountains pressing down on Chengjiang. We could only see people living hard and in poverty, and the affairs of the outside world seemed distant to them.

We love our hometown, but we love our motherland even more. In this remote rear area of the motherland, let us work hard to develop a new community with our Chengjiang feelings.

The roaring torrent of the Xian Lake in Chengjiang symbolizes that the quiet Chengjiang will one day roar as well.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

However, to conduct an actual investigation, one might be able to obtain some evidence. Therefore, two people were left behind to keep watch, prepared to protect Zhu Lin, while the rest went away.

At this time, Yu Wen had already gotten up and stood beside Zhu Lin. He wanted to leave, but feared leaving too abruptly and being recognized by the maidservant. If he stayed, he would face the same danger. So, he became uneasy; but he had to endure. He thought:

'Zhu Lin, this is a chance to test if you are a comrade!'

The maidservant did not pay attention to him, because she had accumulated so much to say and was pouring it all out to Zhu Lin:

"Miss, look, my hair is really white! Miss, since you left, I haven't been able to close my eyes in peace. That bandit who kidnapped you, trampled on my toes until they still hurt! That bandit was so cruel, he killed without blinking! Miss, don't you think? I say, if we could just catch that one kid, that would be enough. Let me cut him to death piece by piece. If he doesn't die, I'll make him suffer! Miss, don't you think? If I didn't want to leave some merit for the afterlife, I would really say that kid was not born of a human mother! He was born of beasts!'"

Yu Wen couldn't bear it any longer. He turned around and glared at the maidservant, signaling: "Do you recognize me? Shut up!"

### Old Tai

— Sheng Dan

——Battlefield Notes——

Eastward flows the Han River, the sunset is dim,
At the top of the building,
I get drunk and want to dispel my sorrow;
Alas, by Parrot Island, a traveler
Meeting you and then seeing you off.

Autumn had already arrived, but Hankou was still engulfed in the heat wave. Especially after lunch, the indoor thermometer often read above ninety degrees, causing one to sweat profusely. "Didn't you say you wanted to go to Parrot Island? Old Tai is waiting there!" Shi Jianxiong suddenly ran in from outside and urged me. He had just returned from a raid around Xuzhou and was planning to rest in Wuchang for a few days before heading to Xianning with his troops. Shu Yunpeng, from the Ministry of Transportation's Battlefield Service Corps, was also soon leaving Hankou for Hunan, so Old Tai had specially chosen that famous scenic spot of "fragrant grass withering and flourishing again" for a farewell meal.

Speaking of Old Tai, one immediately felt unspeakable joy. After returning from France, he taught at Jinan University. He was just like his brother, Shuangqiu, always wearing a blue worker's uniform. He was tall and walked somewhat like Charlie Chaplin. From the outbreak of the Shanghai War until the National Army's withdrawal, he was determined to emulate Ban Chao. "Stop fooling around! You're just a scholar. You want to join the army!" His wife mocked, seemingly unconvinced. "Then you just watch!" Old Tai protested. Before long, he received a telegram from General Zhang Fakui, ordering him to go to Ruichang immediately, thus fulfilling his wish. When I saw them on Jianghan Road, they were already fully armed and about to depart for the battlefield.

Life on the battlefield was naturally not "easy," but realizing that one was participating in a great era and being able to participate oneself was very enjoyable. Moreover, for the sake of the motherland, any highest material enjoyment could be completely sacrificed. Old Tai resolutely rejected the offer from Shanghai University and went to serve at the front. Who says intellectuals shouldn't do this?

When we arrived at Parrot Island, everyone was covered in sweat. Old Tai and the others had already arrived. We each took out the farewell wine and delicacies we had brought and gorged ourselves upstairs in a teahouse. Jianxiong talked at length about the victories at Taierzhuang, speaking endlessly. He also solemnly took out General Li Zongren's photo for us to admire. The photo was taken on the platform of Taierzhuang Station. General Li stood before the station nameplate, full of spirit, inspiring awe.

The sun was about to set, so we bid farewell to Parrot Island. Old Tai knew that I could compose a few old-style poems and insisted that I "repay" him with one. Under the pressure of the modern-day Ban Chao, I casually hummed the first quatrain.

### Face

— Geng Zhi

Even foreigners, no, Westerners, say that Chinese people are most concerned about face. This statement can naturally be interpreted in two ways: positively, China is a land of ritual and righteousness, and everyone wants to protect their reputation, let alone their face, and is unwilling to do evil and be laughed at; negatively, it means that they only care about face and not about substance, and therefore delay many important matters.

What the Westerners say is probably mostly correct. However, the face we often see is mostly on the negative side, which is truly regrettable. Isn't it so? In the past, being able to walk around in government offices was considered having face, being able to get free tickets and ride first-class trains or luxury liners was considered having face, and driving a car and killing someone without having to go to court, just paying a few dollars, was considered having face… Nowadays, extravagant weddings and funerals that waste money and labor are considered having face… There are so many examples that I can't list them all.

Why do they want such face? In a nutshell, it is nothing more than wanting to gain some vanity and hear people praising them. Therefore, those who have no face, or whose face is not yet great, will spare no effort to strive upwards, either attaching themselves to powerful figures in the government or clinging to their coattails, in order to reach high positions, or sticking firmly to the tail of a fine horse, so as to travel thousands of miles. Even more shrewd people use the method of "puffing up their face to look fat." Fatty Dong is a prosperous man. When he walks in front of people, he looks so impressive, while those who are pale and thin cannot compare. Helplessly, he can only puff up his cheeks to make himself look fatter. Grand Tutor Yan in Prince Kai's mansion was willing to have Lord Zou beat his face black and blue so that he could file a lawsuit before the emperor and regain face. This can also be considered such a shrewd method.

Since face is so precious, those who don't have it spare no expense to get it. Then, those who already have it naturally won't easily let it go, even unto "death." Thus, under the important motivation of preserving face, many wonderful things happen:

Clearly afraid of fighting with someone, yet they roll up their sleeves and wave their arms, shouting, "Come on, come on!" As soon as the other person rushes forward, they turn around and run away, saying in a serious warning tone, "If you have the guts, don't run! Wait for me to call my brother!" This way, face is preserved.

Clearly afraid of their wife, yet they say, "Spare me the mischief." Afraid of their wife to the point of kneeling, yet they say, "Stealing a moment to practice New Year's greetings." Ren Huan of the Tang Dynasty put it even better, using a "living Bodhisattva," "nine sons and a mother," and "Kumbhanda" to explain why he had to be afraid. This way, face is preserved.

There are countless such daily trifles. Zhao Tuo, King of Yue of the Han Dynasty, said he was "merely amusing himself," and Ruan Zhongrong of the Jin Dynasty said he "couldn't avoid vulgarity, so he just went along with it." Both of these can be included in this category, showing that the need to preserve face has been around for a long time.

I think the ancients who were best at preserving face can be considered Meng Zhifan as the first. After being defeated and fleeing for his life, he left one chariot behind, indicating that he "stood alone against the enemy" and "covered the retreat." That was already wonderful. When entering the city gate, he had to "urge his horse and say, 'It's not that I dared to lag behind, but the horse wouldn't go forward,'" further indicating that he didn't need face. This made it so wonderful that even Confucius repeatedly praised him for not boasting. In fact, he was boasting and then boasting again, in my opinion.

Writing this far, some people may think that I am mocking face and not approving of it. That's not entirely true. I naturally approve of positive face, with "no room for criticism." Even for negative face, I think that before the Three Dynasties, people were afraid of being too concerned about face; after the Three Dynasties, people were afraid of not being concerned about face. Wanting face is always better than being a male thief or a female prostitute, doing anything and everything.

Today, there are really too many "shameless" people who are "burnt and battered" and insist on "standing tall." And there are also many "ghosts" who "cut off humanity" and "stir up trouble with the wind." They are all brave men who are not afraid of the stench of blood, which truly makes me miss face! Even if I know it's "fake," I think it's not much harm!
