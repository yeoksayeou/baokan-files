### Japan's New Difficulties and New Strategies

The Japanese ××ist policy is to destroy China and dominate East Asia. This is the fundamental policy of Japan ×, and it cannot be changed and will never be changed until the total collapse of Japanese ××ism. However, in order to adapt to the needs of each specific period or specific environment, they can adopt a special strategy, that is, special methods and special tricks. The new strategy of Japan × that we are talking about refers to the new methods and new tricks that Japan × has formulated to solve its current new difficulties. The ultimate goal of this new strategy is, of course, to destroy China and dominate East Asia.

What new difficulties is Japan × encountering at present? We all know that half a year ago, Japan × originally wanted to subdue us and defeat us by occupying Guangzhou and Wuhan. However, the result was not only that we did not submit and admit defeat, but on the contrary, the arrogant Japanese × authorities had to admit that the war had entered a new stage. They had to admit that the Sino-Japanese War had only begun after the occupation of Guangzhou and Wuhan. They even had to utter the lament of preparing to wage a century-long war with China! They have completely lost the courage of "conquering China in three months" at the beginning of the war! After half a year of fighting, the only gain of Japan × is the occupation of Nanchang City, while what they have lost, in terms of casualties alone, has increased from 600,000 or 700,000 to 800,000 or 900,000! Now Chinese, international people, and the Japanese themselves have clearly seen that China has laid the foundation for a long-term resistance and final victory. The attempt of Japan × to fight a quick battle has been shattered. China's crises and difficulties are decreasing day by day, while Japan's crises and difficulties are increasing day by day. At present, Japan's × difficulties are: military shortages, dangerous transportation, unfavorable terrain, difficult deployment, and empty rear; economically, poverty and declining production, declining foreign trade, and the collapse of the national economy; politically, the rising anti-war sentiment at home, the contradiction between export-oriented light industry and military heavy industry, the contradiction between warlords, financial groups, small and medium-sized property owners, and the broad masses of the people, and the conflicting contradictions of various policies of the ruling class (such as the recent conflict of joining the German-Italian military alliance). All of this is increasingly exposing the development of all the difficulties of Japanese ×× in its barbaric and regressive war, and is becoming increasingly insurmountable.

Japan × certainly will not fail to find ways to overcome these increasingly serious difficulties. Japan × certainly also knows that it is impossible to overcome these increasingly serious difficulties by relying only on Japan itself and its colonies of Taiwan and Korea. Therefore, the focus of their overcoming difficulties is not placed in their own country, but in the territory of China that has been occupied, and among the people under their rule. That is, they know that comparing their land, manpower, and production with ours will not overcome the increasingly progressive difficulties. Therefore, they attempt to add China's land, population, and production to their side in order to solve their increasingly serious crises and difficulties. This is the basic principle of Japan's × new strategy for solving new difficulties.

In order to implement this new strategy, the main feature manifested in concrete facts is that it will change from being mainly military to mainly political offensives. This does not mean that it will stop military offensives, nor does it mean that it will abandon military offensives, but mainly take political offensives as the main focus and military offensives to cooperate. That is, it attempts to rely on political forces to cooperate with military actions to rule China in the occupied areas, invade China that has not been occupied by it, and achieve its goal of annexing the whole of China and dominating East Asia. All the recent speeches and actions of Japan × traitors, such as establishing a new order in East Asia, adding the establishment of a collaborative political system of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, such as expanding the propaganda of "anti-communism," "anti-Chiang," and "negotiating peace," such as expanding the anti-base movement in the occupied areas; such as intensifying the robbery of concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin, and forcibly landing in Gulangyu, such as attacking British and French mail ships in the waters near Hong Kong, such as launching so-called large-scale encirclement and annihilation battles in northern Hubei and southern Henan and large-scale bombing of Chongqing and Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Shantou, such as doubling the funding and instigating Wang Jingwei to carry out "anti-communism" and "peace" propaganda to organize puppet central agencies, etc. All of this has only one central goal, which is to take the east of China, North China, Central China, and South China, that is, the entire area east of the Yellow River, east of the Pinghan and Yuehan railways, that is, the vast eastern area of China with the largest population, the most fertile land, and the richest products, and completely annex it to the rule of Japan × by political methods and military actions, in order to intensify the robbery and oppression, solve its current crises and difficulties, and further realize the conquest of the whole of China and the domination of East Asia!

Today, we must be especially vigilant about Japan's × conspiracy to absorb China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to fight against China and conquer China! Today, we must be especially vigilant about the speeches and actions of Wang Jingwei and others who are desperately advocating opposition to the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, slandering the central government, insulting × after the battle, and all the speeches and actions that provoke and alienate our internal unity and break our determination to resist for a long time, and all the speeches and actions that use all methods to destroy our spiritual mobilization, material mobilization, and political, military, economic, and diplomatic progress. All of this will help Japan × solve its new difficulties and realize its new strategies, and increase the difficulties of our resistance and nation-building, and increase the threat to democracy and peace in East Asia and even the whole world!

From here, it can already be clear the importance of our current development of all the battles behind the × people in the occupied areas, the importance of our current intensified attack on anti-communist and peace speeches, and the attack on all traitors, puppets, and Wang and other active puppet central party and government agencies, and we should understand more clearly the importance of intensifying national unity, intensifying people's mobilization, and intensifying the promotion of political progress today!

### The New Status of Chinese Youth in Wartime

— Speech by Feng Wenbin, Special Correspondent for Airmail from Xi'an

In these nineteen months, there have been tremendous historical changes in both the international and domestic situations. Nineteen months ago, we had just entered a period of domestic peace, and resistance was still a subject of debate among some people. Some people still doubted whether China could resist Japan, whether it could carry out a comprehensive and sustained resistance. But now, the resistance has been going on for more than a year, and all our youth, under the call and leadership of Chairman Chiang, have been in a state of war.

The changes that have taken place in China in these nineteen months have indeed exceeded the past decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years. The great national self-defense war of the Chinese nation, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, is completely unprecedented in China. The Chinese nation, which has experienced serious internal divisions, is now united for the first time regardless of party affiliation, class, or ethnicity. The Chinese nation, which has long been oppressed by imperialism, has raised its head and straightened its chest for the first time! All the changes, such as the unification and progress of the regime and the army, the increasing development of democratic politics, and the increasing activity of the mass movement, are all what we have seen with our own eyes and experienced personally. They have given our nation a completely new look. Everything in the Chinese nation is progressing, changing, and strengthening itself. All the corrupt, reactionary forces that violate the resistance, all the Huang Juns, Wang Gongdus, Zhang Mutaos, and even Li Fuyings and Han Fuqus (and even Wang Jingwei), are being eliminated day by day with the development of the war; the sprouts of the Three People's Principles of New China are growing day by day.

However, among all the changes, the most decisive one is still the resistance. Resistance is not only the driving force of our various progress, but also the only major event that determines our survival.

Resistance determines the fate of our nation and the fate of all our youth. The situation of the Chinese youth movement today is completely different from that of nineteen months ago. The youth of the whole of China today are in an extraordinary period, an unprecedented period in history.

Today, no matter who the Chinese youth is, no matter when or where, their lives are not affected and dominated by the war. The war has fundamentally changed our living conditions, and therefore the war has become the central issue of the Chinese youth movement today. The invasion of Japanese imperialism has first brought us unprecedented disasters.

Many of our prosperous cities have fallen, most of the factories have closed, and tens of thousands of laboring youth and professional youth have had to wander around hungry. Famous schools such as Nankai, Tongji, Jinan, Jiaotong, Fudan, Daxia, Guanghua, Central, Huazhong, Huda, Xiamen, Zhongshan, and Lingnan have all been subjected to fierce bombing. Schools have been constantly shrinking, merging, and moving. At least four-fifths of the students have been unable to continue their studies.

Some of the land in the countryside has been completely occupied by × people or Koreans and Taiwanese directed by × people. Some land has been prohibited from cultivation by × people. Even if crops are planted, they are forced to be destroyed, or they cannot be harvested when it comes time to harvest. Wherever × people pass, houses, livestock, and farm tools are all destroyed. Even if they escape back, life is difficult to maintain.

Why do our countless millions of compatriots lose their schooling and jobs and live in hunger and cold? Why do they wander on the road and have no home to return to? Why can't they see their fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters? This is the result of the invasion of Japanese imperialism. Who has taken away our happiness, who has taken away our land, fields, houses, property, and shattered our original hopes? This is the Japanese fascist ×× military clique.

When we think of how the Japanese warlords directly slaughtered and devastated us, we cannot help but feel our blood boiling. We don't know how many tens of thousands of old parents and handsome young people have been killed! 80,000 compatriots in Nanjing were slaughtered, and 20,000 were raped. In Guangdong Province alone, before June 7 of the 27th year, there were more than 1,400 bombings. The number of × aircraft that came successively reached a total of 5,987, dropping 12,769 bombs. 4,595 compatriots were killed and 8,555 were injured. How can we forget this blood debt!

We cannot forget that many young people in the Northeast and North China were forced to take up guns for the × people to kill their own compatriots. Last March, more than 1,000 young peasants in northern Shanxi were escorted by × people from Shuoxian to Datong. In order to prevent them from defecting, the × people actually gave them

One by one, they were given dumb needles. How many angel-like adorable children were captured to be slaves, transfused blood for the × people to death. Last spring, more than 300 women and children in Puxian County, Shandong, sought refuge in a Catholic church. ×××××××××××××. Finally, when the × people withdrew, they set fire to the Catholic church, and all the women and children who took refuge were burned to death inside. Around the same time. × people estimated that there were more than 500 children in Ningwu and Yangquan, Shanxi.

We cannot forget that our beloved youth leaders Cao Chengxian, Chen Zhutian, and Sun Shishi were bombed to death by × people. We cannot forget the brave Shi Wei, who led peasant guerrilla warfare in Guantao, Shandong, and was captured by × people and tied to a galloping horse to be dragged to death alive.

Here, we want to tell the world on behalf of the youth of the whole country that we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will never forget to avenge our victims; we will never coexist with Japanese imperialism, even if we shed the last drop of blood, we will overthrow Japanese imperialism! (The whole audience shouted: Down with Japanese imperialism!)

The invasion of Japanese imperialism has forced us to rise up to avenge and defend ourselves, to defend our motherland, to defend world peace. In order to liberate our compatriots and ourselves, a large number of young people, like a tide from all corners, have set their sights on the battlefield of resistance, the forefront of resistance.

Youths in the middle of the resistance showed the courage of a person, as if they were born to eliminate × people. Youth generals are generally loved, and youth soldiers are often the China of all elite troops. The glorious, tragic, and moving history they have left for the cause of national liberation of the Chinese nation is inexhaustible.

Yao Ziqing, the battalion commander who defended Baoshan to the death, and the entire battalion he led, and the eight hundred warriors who defended the Shanghai Sihang Warehouse under the leadership of Xie Jinyuan, the deputy regimental commander, were almost all young people. Ye Chenghuan, the regimental commander who fought hard to defeat the X army's Komeji Brigade and died for the country, was only twenty-five years old, and Chen Erlian, the leader who burned down twenty-four X army planes at Yangmingbao, was only twenty-three years old. We can introduce to you Comrade Kuang Chaode, a representative sitting here, who is one of the young representatives of the × Route Army. He has fought nine battles and fought hand-to-hand with × people three times. Once, he killed three × people alone, but he is only eighteen years old this year. (Applause)

The Chinese Air Force can be said to be a truly young air force. Yue Haiwen, the martyr who was killed heroically in the Shanghai air battle because his plane landed in the X area and killed dozens of X people. Li Guidan, the martyr who shot down more than ten X planes in the Wuhan air battle and died for the country, Shen Chonghai, the martyr who was good at destroying X planes and X ships with flesh bombs and died together, and Chen Huaimin, these national heroes who will be remembered forever, are all around twenty years old. (Applause)

Youths are even more active in the Chehua War. The youth camp led by General Yang Jingyu in the Northeast, the Pingjin Student Guerrilla Team led by Professor Yang Xiulin active in the Taihang Mountains, and the teachers and students guerrilla team of Taiyuan Chengcheng Middle School active in Guanlingshan and Daqingshan, established anti-Japanese base areas behind the X. The Tongpu Road Workers' Self-Defense Force, the Pinghan Road Ironworkers' Destruction Brigade, held uprisings and established the Tangshan Seven Thousand Miners of the Jidong Anti-Japanese Base Heap, either all youths or with youths as the backbone. There is a story that can illustrate the wisdom and bravery of youths in guerrilla warfare. A young bugler, after winning a small victory in a night raid on Linfen Station, secretly ran to the top of Linfen City with only a trumpet, a broken gun, and nine hand grenades and blew the assembly call. The × people gathered under the city, and he used hand grenades and guns to kill eighty or ninety × people. Then he himself made a glorious sacrifice. This unnamed youth is truly a good example of the new Chinese youth (applause).

Our youth not only bravely directly participate in the battle, but also bravely carry out various services to assist in the work of the war. Yang Huimin, a female soldier in Shanghai, risked sending telephone machines and national flags to the isolated army in the Sihang Warehouse. The children of the Hankou New Life Service Corps shined shoes and donated money. Many young rescuers, journalists, and railway workers entered and exited the battlefield under the gunfire, working hard, even sacrificing their own lives. The salvation song and drama work and the work of standing guard, guarding, and catching traitors by young people and children in various heap directions have achieved great results. Zhou Deyou, a banker's son of eighteen years old in the Reclamation Drama Troupe, died of overwork because he devoted himself to the work of salvation. The students of Linfen National Revolutionary University captured the famous traitor Zhang Mutao. Wang Zun, the daughter of the traitor leader Wang Kemin, advised her father not to listen, and resolutely declared that she would sever her father-daughter relationship with him, and would rather go to work in a factory in Hong Kong to maintain her own life.

All this shows the infinite courage of Chinese youth. It also proves that the Chinese youth are the pillar of the resistance and nation-building, the new force of the country, and the pioneer of national liberation.

The resistance has trained our youth, so that we simply don't know what it means to be hardship. The spirit of hard struggle shown by our youth has made many elders not only change their views on our youth, but also greatly strengthened their belief in the future of the Chinese nation and their belief that resistance will win and nation-building will succeed.

Many young people, because they want to study the theory of resistance, have left their families and ran to the schools that train resistance cadres, "not afraid of the thousands of mountains and rivers." Their original lives are often very good and very wealthy, but life in these schools is very hard. Often there are no classrooms, lack of desks, chairs, candles, books, and medicines, sleeping very crowdedly, wearing and eating very roughly, and even having to take time out to build the cave dwellings they live in, grow food and vegetables, and participate in the work of the kitchen, carrying water, and cooking. But they still do not want to give up a minute of their time, and study very nervously and very happily. Even though it snows and freezes, they still get up very early to wash their faces with cold water, run and climb mountains against the north wind, and sing loudly.

They often do not count the merits, fame, and wealth in various services, and always bury themselves in hard work with a spirit of perseverance and a will of never giving up. No matter how bad the environment is, they rarely have the bad habits of prostitution, gambling, corruption, flattery, and bullying. No matter how dangerous the work is, they rarely hesitate.

Why can we do this? Besides for the liberation of the motherland, besides for the resistance, can there be any other reason?

The resistance itself is the best school. The resistance has educated our youth, so that we can re-understand ourselves and the era we are in. Our thoughts are rapidly progressing, so that we are no longer pessimistic and doubtful, and do not only care about the enjoyment of one person at one time and take aloofness from politics as noble. The resistance has further educated us that only by mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and relying on the masses can we defeat all × people and overcome all difficulties. The majority of the youth of our generation are willing to give everything to the motherland, and are wholeheartedly committed to realizing an independent, free, and happy Three People's Principles Republic. For the cause of the Chinese people, we are willing to fight to the end and sacrifice everything. We are eagerly pursuing social science and progressive theories in the world, and we love truth more than our own lives.

The resistance educates us, so that we have a great vision and a calm mind. We see that the victory of the resistance requires long-term patient struggle. Our selfless mind is matched with the hard work of compromising, and even those young people with deep-seated prejudices cannot help but be moved.

In June this year, a classmate from the Anwu Fort Youth Training Class went to a guerrilla team in western Shanxi to work as a squad leader. The captain of this guerrilla team was an stubborn and old-fashioned person. At the memorial meeting for the "July 7th" Resistance and Nation Building, he gave a speech saying: "Today is our national humiliation memorial day," which made some of the soldiers laugh. The captain put the people who laughed in confinement. Once again, a soldier sang the March of the Volunteers, and the captain said: "Why sing if there is no order?" and also put him in confinement. The captain's oppression was very terrible, and he even lost his temper for no reason and kicked the soldier's body with his feet. This kind of thing caused great dissatisfaction among everyone. But this youth always tried to persuade everyone and eliminate everyone's alienation from the captain.

But later, some of the members of his squad, because they couldn't bear the captain's tyranny, actually ran away, and were afraid that their beloved squad leader would be severely punished, so they left their guns behind. When the captain found out, he insisted on shooting this squad leader, which caused many officers and the county magistrate to intercede. As a result, this squad leader was pulled by the captain and beaten forty big boards. His hands were swollen red; he forgot to salute when he walked away, so he was pulled back and beaten four more big boards.

Even so, he still sees the resistance as higher than everything else and is not discouraged by this at all. He not only continues to work actively as usual, but also continues to encourage everyone to work hard and rest assured. No matter what, it is necessary to maintain the unity of the troops up and down. Until later, this youth, in voluntarily taking on the most arduous task, went to Taiyuan City to reconnaissance the X situation, and was unfortunately arrested and sacrificed. What a great spirit the Chinese youth has shown here!

There are also several young people working in a theater troupe in an army in North China. The officers despised them and were jealous of them. Intentionally making things difficult for them. Once they asked this theater troupe to perform a play the next day, and they had to perform well. The young people in the theater troupe immediately wrote and rehearsed the play all night, and the next day they performed it as expected, and it made the officers very impressed. The officers gradually understood that they only had a single-minded loyalty to devote themselves to the resistance, and they climbed the mountain every morning after washing their faces with cold water. The oldest secretary-general, who originally opposed them the most, also joined their climbing team and also canceled the guard. Once he said to them: "Your patriotic spirit is really good, the future of China is all in your generation of youth!" As he spoke, tears fell.

In the resistance, our youth's social status is improving day by day. In the past, many people in society looked down on young people, thinking that young people were useless and only had five minutes of enthusiasm. When they saw young people, they all said, what can children do? Now this kind of mentality is gradually being broken. There are many county magistrates in some war zones who are young people, because they are serious in their work, have noble personalities, and only know how to go down to the countryside to work and do not know how to be promoted and make money. The people all love them and call them anti-Japanese county magistrates. The more the resistance develops, the more the government and the people need young people, and the more important the status of young people becomes.

Chairman Chiang said: "Youths are the vanguard of the revolution and the new life of the country. All social evolution and political reform depend on the impetus of youths to be their main force... Always remember that the Chinese revolution is a long and arduous undertaking. I love the youth who are rich in revolutionary spirit and continue the revolutionary cause as if they were the most precious treasure; in other words, Zhongzheng really sees our youth as my life. There must be countless revolutionary youths who combine to form a great force, advancing wave upon wave, never giving up, and then can they vigorously implement the doctrine, defend the country, and revive the nation, so as to achieve the ultimate goal of the national revolution."

Our youth, today is already the pillar of the national nation, we must bear a very arduous and noble responsibility. The times not only want us to bear the task of resistance, but also want us to bear the task of revitalizing the country and building the country. The key to the Three People's Principles of New China is in our hands. Our every move is related to the future of the Chinese nation.

Chinese youth today not only have a great role and a high status in China, but also have a great role and a high status in the world.

Eden of England said: "The Chinese resistance saved European democracy."

The American Student Federation wrote to the Chinese Student Federation: "Frankly speaking, our lives and safety also depend on the weapons you are shouldering."

The youth of all countries now sympathize with us, respect us, and constantly use various methods to help, encourage, and comfort us. Our international friends, the World Student Federation, sent a delegation to China to see us. We are warmly welcomed wherever we go in Europe and the United States. They all praised the Chinese youth as heroic and said that the Chinese youth are the model for the youth of the world.

### Notice to All Friends Who Sympathize with the Resistance Against Japan

— Song Qingling

Regarding the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, I sincerely offer a brief introduction to all friends who sympathize with the resistance against Japan.

In the current war, Japan not only destroys our families but also, in order to force our people to become completely agricultural slaves, it especially uses all means to destroy our modern industry. Seventy-five percent of our machine industry has already been destroyed or confiscated by them, and over a million workers have lost their jobs. We will never respond to this brutal act with despair. Even during such a war, our people and our government have already resolved to restore our productivity, both old and new, in various inland areas. Even along the railways occupied by the Japanese, we are building thousands of small-scale factories. Because we want to involve the vast majority of the people, to make their sacrifices worthwhile, and to make this construction democratic, these factories are being built in a cooperative manner. Through these cooperatives, we hope to absorb refugees, turning the millions of relief funds spent on refugee camps in Japanese-occupied areas from wasteful charity into productive capital. Currently, in these areas, impoverished refugees are merely being kept alive there, waiting for the Japanese to be ready to exploit them at any time. Industrial cooperatives can maintain the stability of inland markets, so that even if the Japanese occupy all the cities, the disruption of the rural economy can be avoided. Industrial cooperatives can resettle unemployed workers, supply the army with clothing and provisions, prevent famine, and alleviate other difficulties that may arise from economic disruption, supporting the long-term resistance against Japan, so that Japan gains no benefit from occupying our cities. This movement needs the help of righteous and progressive people everywhere. Relief organizations should donate the relief supplies originally intended for Japanese-occupied areas to these cooperatives, and industrial manufacturers should provide credit for the purchase of machinery and raw materials to these industrial cooperatives. By supporting this permanent production, relief efforts can also rebuild their own future markets. Patriotic bankers should provide loans, and trained young people should join and serve as technicians. Our government and people wholeheartedly welcome all support for this emerging movement!

### We Maintain Superiority on All Battlefields; Fierce Battle in Central Hubei for a Week Eliminates Two Thousand Enemies; Our Air Force Flies to Southern Jiangxi to Bomb Enemy Headquarters

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] In the current situation on all battlefields, we are in an advantageous position. The enemy in southern Henan and central Hubei are clustered in the areas of Zhe River, Anlu, Dahong Mountain, Yingcheng, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang, putting up a last-ditch struggle. In the fierce fighting over the past week, enemy casualties have continued to reach 2,000. Our guerrillas are active near Xinyang, constantly attacking the enemy. Localized fighting continues in southern and northern Hubei. Our forces are strong. Moreover, in Anhui Province, we recaptured Suzhou once again in mid-month, eliminating a considerable number of enemies.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] Shaanxi News: In southwestern Shanxi, the enemy is still taking a defensive posture on the major transportation lines. Areas outside the transportation lines are all in our hands. The southern section of the Tongpu Railway and the area near Zhongtiao Mountain are completely under our control. Although the enemy has reinforced Fengling and is attempting to cross the river by force under the cover of artillery fire, our defending soldiers are constantly retaliating against the enemy, killing many. The river defense is secure.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] According to reports, the enemy in various occupied areas of North China are demoralized, and anti-war sentiment is high. The enemy does not dare to leave the cities in various places. The lives of our people in the countryside are as usual, and everyone believes that resistance against Japan will surely be victorious. Our guerrillas near Qingdao recently attacked Qingdao Island, briefly occupied Zhan Mountain, and killed a considerable number of enemies.

Southern Henan and Northern Hubei

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 25th] The 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions of the enemy, with Xiangfan as their main target of attack, attempted to annihilate our main force in the Sui-Zao area. They have all been routed and are no longer able to form an army. Among them, the 16th Division suffered the most severe losses. According to a certain high-ranking official returning from the front line who spoke to reporters, the enemy was forced to march 210 kilometers between the 14th, 15th, and 16th due to the movements of our troops. While our troops were attacking the enemy forces in the Tang River area, the enemy soldiers and horses were mostly exhausted on the way, allowing us to capture them. This time, the enemy attacked our northern Hubei, originally intending to encircle our army. Unexpectedly, the troops east of the Pinghan Railway suddenly crossed the railway. Our troops in western Hubei simultaneously advanced into northern Hubei. At the same time, our troops on the Xianghan and Jinghan roads launched attacks everywhere, creating a favorable situation of counter-encirclement. When the enemy was on the verge of collapse on the 19th, the self-defense forces of Zaoyang, Gucheng, and Yicheng counties immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy abandoned all their military blankets, uniforms, and telephones everywhere. Okamura, the top commander of the enemy in Central China, has been severely reprimanded by the enemy's supreme command for the failure of his command of the war. At the same time, the 16th Division, which suffered the heaviest defeat, has already been transferred to Wuhan. Currently, there are only over two thousand enemy troops in Zhongxiang. Our troops are still engaged in mixed warfare in Dahong Mountain. The enemy has been annihilated to the equivalent of a battalion or so. Our forces on the Xiangyi, Jinghan, and Zhonghan roads are even more powerful. The enemy reinforcements are holding their ground and dare not come out to fight. We hold an absolute advantage.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 26th] Shashi Telegram: Since Zao Mountain was recaptured by us, Tianmen has been besieged by us, Jingshan has been pressed by us, and the enemy in Zhongxiang is generally fearful. In recent days, most of them have retreated towards Jingshan, seemingly trying to relieve the siege of Tianmen.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 26th] Shashi Telegram: After Shashi County was recaptured by our army on the 22nd, the enemy trapped in Dahong Mountain has become fish in a cauldron, only trying to put up a last-ditch struggle. Now, they have again divided into three routes and are advancing towards our Xiaogan and Dahong Mountain, currently in a stalemate with us.

Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Border

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 25th] The enemy in northern Hunan launched a full-scale offensive against our positions on the north bank with all their might in the past two days. Our officers and soldiers fought back fiercely, killing or wounding over a thousand enemies. The lines have returned to stability.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 25th] Linqiao, southwest of Tongcheng, was originally garrisoned by two thousand enemy troops. After our continuous sweeps in recent days, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. There are no enemy traces in the area south of Chongyang and Linqiao.

[Central News Agency, Gaoan, 25th] On the 24th, a certain unit of ours crossed the river and launched a night attack on the enemy entrenched near Shitougang and Qijia, killing over twenty enemies. The enemy fled to Wanfujiang. We seized five rifles and captured an enemy private first class.

[Central News Agency, Gaoan, 25th] The Qianzhou Street post office in Anyi was garrisoned by a high-ranking enemy headquarters. On the 24th, four of our aircraft flew to bomb, enemy...

### General Chen Cheng Discusses the War Situation: We Will Surely Expel the Japanese Army in Three to Five Years; The Enemy Faces Numerous Difficulties in the Occupied Areas

[Chongqing, 22nd, Air Dispatch] Foreign News: General Chen Cheng, who is currently commanding the battles in southern Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, is one of China's capable generals. This afternoon, the 22nd, he hosted a press conference here, stating:

"We do not expect to win this year or next, but if we continue to fight for three years, we will eventually achieve final victory."

Reviewing the war situation, the general said that Japan not only cannot make any further progress but is also trapped by the Chinese army in its occupied areas. In the area behind the Japanese army's lines, not counting the guerrillas and mobile forces, there are still as many as sixty divisions of the Chinese regular army.

The Japanese army in northern Hubei concentrated the forces of three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade, namely the 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions, in an attempt to encircle the Chinese army under the command of General Tang Enbo. However, after the battle north of Zaoyang, the Japanese army's encirclement plan has failed. Currently, Sun Lianzhong and Liu Ruming's troops are stationed in Xinye, and Liu Heding's regiment is stationed in Dahong Mountain. The Japanese army can no longer advance towards Xiangfan.

As for the Nanchang war zone under his command, the Japanese army's occupation of Nanchang is militarily advantageous to the Chinese army. Therefore, the Chinese army does not need to defend the areas south of the Xiu River, which allows the Chinese army to avoid attacks on multiple fronts. The Japanese army is currently engaged in defensive warfare in a vast area, and their strength has been greatly reduced due to the offensive against Nanchang. The Chinese army's counter-offensive towards Gaoan and Nanchang has prevented the Japanese army from achieving their goal of encircling the Chinese army north of Hubei and south of Hunan. Now, the enemy's strength has been greatly damaged, and the Chinese army is seizing the opportunity to strike back at multiple points. Therefore, the power of the counter-offensive is entirely in our hands. The Chinese army launched a counter-offensive towards Nanchang on April 22. Although it failed to recapture the city, several hundred soldiers briefly broke into the city. Unfortunately, they were unable to establish a foothold in the city. Furthermore, we have occupied several points on the railway between Nanchang and Jiujiang, which makes transportation very inconvenient for the Japanese army. Although the railway between Zhejiang and Jiangxi has been cut off, the Chinese army can still maintain transportation through the highways and coastlines further south. In addition, the Chinese army south and east of Nanchang is self-sufficient and has now been reorganized into mobile units.

The Japanese army currently has thirty infantry divisions and three cavalry brigades distributed in the following areas: three divisions in Guangdong and Hainan Island, two divisions in Shanghai, the railway zone, and southern Shandong, five divisions in southern Jiangxi, Hunan, and northern Hubei, three divisions in the Xiangfan area, and one cavalry brigade, two divisions in northern Anhui and the Pinghan Railway, four divisions in northern Jiangxi, the Jinpu and Shandong railway zone, three and a half divisions in Hebei and Chahar, two divisions in eastern Henan and the Jinpu Railway zone, five divisions in Shanxi Province, and two divisions in northern Shanxi and Suiyuan.

The worst period for China is now over. The general frankly admitted that China's most critical period was at the beginning of the July 7th Incident, when there were differing opinions in North China regarding the issue of war and peace, and again after the fall of the capital, when China suffered heavy losses in that battle. If the Japanese army had failed to inflict a decisive defeat on the Chinese army in the battles of Nanjing and Wuhan, such an opportunity would never come again. The general concluded, "China will surely achieve final victory. It is only a matter of time."

General Chen Cheng also stated that Japan is currently encountering four major problems in the occupied areas: a lack of time, labor, capital, and political and social stability. It is claimed that Japan's financial resources have been almost exhausted and that it is unable to develop the occupied areas. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and the United States' Four-Year Plan both require huge amounts of capital to be implemented. Japan currently lacks the resources, so Japan cannot exploit China's resources to conquer China. According to convention, it takes three to five years to profit from investing in the development of any land. It has been eight years since Japan invested in Manchuria, but it still cannot gain any benefits. Furthermore, if Japan wants to use China's resources to conquer China, it must first consider the "time" problem. Currently, there are very few Chinese laborers who are helping Japan. Chinese workers are unwilling to cooperate with Japan or help Japan exploit China's resources, so it is impossible to maintain political and social stability in the occupied areas.

### Japanese Navy Declares Interference; Foreign Ships Sailing Along Our Coast; All Foreign Ships Within Two Hundred Miles of the Coast Will Be Intercepted and Searched

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai Foreign News: A Japanese navy spokesperson stated that the navigation of third countries along the Chinese coast will now be completely blockaded. This is not a matter of rights but a requirement of the Japanese authorities. In other words, the Japanese have the right to order any ship in the Chinese coastal area to stop sailing and to check its registration certificate to determine whether it is being used for military purposes by the National Government. "Used for military purposes by the National Government" means whether the ship is carrying goods for the Chinese side's military use. As for the list of prohibited goods, it cannot be announced at this time, but this matter is being considered by the Japanese. Food and medicine may be listed as prohibited items.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai Foreign News: The Japanese spokesperson also stated that the Japanese blockade is limited to an area 200 miles from the coast. When a reporter asked what attitude the Japanese would take if the naval authorities of a third country sent warships to escort merchant ships, the spokesperson refused to answer, but said that the United States would probably not take such action. The spokesperson also said that navigation between Japanese-occupied areas and other parts of China will be completely prohibited, but he does not oppose peaceful trade within the occupied areas. However, the spokesperson refused to specify what kind of goods constituted "peaceful trade."

### British Authorities Take Seriously; Will Consult with the United States on Countermeasures

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] British relations with Japan are becoming increasingly serious. At the same time, negotiations with the Soviet Union for an alliance are progressing extremely rapidly. It is now known that Foreign Secretary Halifax has notified the U.S. Ambassador to Britain of the details of the recent British-Soviet negotiations. The authorities here take the Japanese announcement of a blockade of the Chinese coast very seriously. It is claimed that the Japanese spokesperson did not acknowledge that a formal state of war legally exists between China and Japan, but his statement clearly amounts to a unilateral demand to enjoy the rights of a belligerent. However, before implementing retaliatory measures, Britain will temporarily wait for the situation to develop. Consultations will likely be held between London and Washington. According to experts, if Japan implements the blockade, Britain will adopt economic retaliation measures. The United States may ultimately invoke the Neutrality Act. Regarding some suggestions to have British warships escort British ships sailing along the Chinese coast, not only would the cost be too high, but Britain's warships in the Far East are also insufficient. This proposal is practically difficult to implement. Britain's economic retaliation against Japan will likely be implemented after an agreement is reached with the United States and joint action is taken.

[Reuters, London, 26th] At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Member of Parliament Henderson asked if the Japanese claim to blockade the Chinese coast, if implemented, would be in serious conflict with international law and whether the government would send warships to escort merchant ships in Chinese territorial waters to provide protection. Mr. Butler replied, "Since there are such rumors, further protection of British shipping is under urgent consideration." Mr. Butler also acknowledged that "this Japanese action is far from international law." Member of Parliament Feller asked, "Will the government take retaliatory measures, or will it only send ships for protection?" The reply was, "I do not wish to say anything further today, but I can assure you that the government takes this matter very seriously."

### Lanpura Wheel Intercepted for Investigation; Britain Protests to Japan; Colonel Norbert Doke and Others Go to Shanghai; The French Will Also Protest the Search of French Mail

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] British Ambassador to Japan Craig lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government's Foreign Ministry today over the detention of the well-known merchant ship Lanpura outside the Chinese coast by Japanese naval officers, an action that is highly likely to provoke resentment. Mr. Craig also raised concerns over the continued detention of the British ships Sangre and Larita. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson told a Reuters reporter that the detention of the Lanpura was purely a routine procedure because the Japanese navy wanted to verify the ship's nationality.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 26th] French Far East Naval Commander Vice Admiral Doke arrived here this morning aboard the flagship and immediately began investigating the Arimeth incident. At the same time, British Ambassador Sir Cole and U.S. Naval Commander Admiral Nobel have also decided to come here from Gulangyu aboard the Birmingham.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] The Daily Mail reports that the recent aggressive actions of the Japanese have caused extreme concern among all countries concerned about the situation in the Far East, considering it extremely serious. The British naval authorities are considering a plan to send British ships to protect British merchant ships. The French government intends to follow Britain's example in protesting the Lanpura incident and lodge a strong protest with the Japanese over the boarding of the French ship Arimeth by Japanese troops within the territorial waters of Hong Kong.

### Gulangyu; Four-Country Negotiations; On the Verge of Collapse

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 26th] The Japanese-language Shanghai "Mainichi Shimbun" published a commentary today stating, "If the British side believes that the partial withdrawal of the Japanese navy from Gulangyu is a sign of weakness and intends to station its navy permanently in Gulangyu, then Japan may be forced to resort to force to resolve the issue."

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to news from Xiamen, negotiations on the Gulangyu dispute will be resolved by diplomatic representatives from various countries. The second talk by naval personnel from the four countries (Britain, France, the United States, and Japan) will be the last. At the same time, the acting director of the Gulangyu Municipal Council has requested the Japanese consul to lift the ban on civil ship traffic, as this ban has stopped the transportation of daily necessities. It is reported that the foreign consular corps has suggested the establishment of a special zone to allow the transportation of materials into the zone, but it is reported that the Japanese side has refused.

### The United States Remains Silent; The State Department Awaits Reports

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Hull refused to comment on the news of the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast. He said that he has not yet received an official report on the matter and therefore cannot express an opinion.

### Record of Zhongshan Detai (Part 1)

— Zhang Changren

A Pioneer of Anti-War Japanese Soldiers

Lieutenant Colonel Zhongshan Detai, a staff officer of the Japanese 6th Division, walked from Echeng to a certain village on the border of Henan and Hubei and surrendered to us. Zhongshan is currently serving in the armies of Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces.

—— Reuters Dispatch ——

[Special Changsha Air Dispatch from Our Newspaper] With the consent of the staff department of the commander-in-chief of the first war zone, the reporter went to the headquarters of the special service battalion in the Chang Gongbu area near Changsha on the afternoon of May 15 to interview the anti-war Japanese cadet officer Zhongshan Taide. When the reporter was at Yang's headquarters near Xiushui, he heard that Zhongshan had jumped out of the cage of the invading army with great wisdom and courage, and he wanted to visit him once. Unfortunately, due to a day's discrepancy in the journey, he had already passed through Xiushui and taken the Tonggu route to Changsha. Unexpectedly, after only ten days, he was able to fulfill his long-cherished wish to meet him.

Mr. Zhongshan Taide lives in a school-style building, living with the brothers of the third company of the Shi Wu battalion. After the introduction of the third company commander, knowing that when the reporter walked up to the first floor, there was a short and stocky young man wearing a white homespun short shirt and pants, wearing slippers, walking slowly in the aisle. It turned out to be the person I wanted to interview.

We shook hands tightly. In the palms, there was a fusion of anti-aggression and anti-fascist fervor.

The reporter does not understand Japanese; Mr. Zhongshan does not understand English but can speak simple Chinese - this was one of the courses he studied in school in his country. He read out the name and occupation on my business card in Chinese, and after understanding that I had just returned from the front line in Xiushui, he said, "Hard work! Hard work!" as he reached out to invite me to sit in his bedroom on the third floor.

I first expressed my respect for his autonomous action in responding to the oppression of the Japanese warlords. Seeing that there was no mosquito net, I apologized for not being hospitable enough. He said, "It doesn't matter. The Chinese brothers don't have mosquito nets either." - That evening, I talked about it with Chen Zhen, the intelligence chief. He said that he had already bought them.

Then we began to communicate in writing.

Mr. Zhongshan Taide is from Osaka, Japan, and is twenty-four years old this year. He is a graduate of the Japanese Citizen's School and the Army Officer School's accelerated program. In his childhood, his family was poor, relying on selling newspapers (earning eight cents a day) to support the family, and he himself thus obtained the opportunity to study. It can be said that he has had a very profound feeling of dissatisfaction with Japanese society since he was a child. On June 28, Showa 13 (1938), he left his 48-year-old mother and 20-year-old wife in a lumber store in Osaka, and he himself was ordered to come to China, serving as a cadet officer in the Sixth Division headquarters, entering and exiting the battlefields on both sides of the Yangtze River. After the occupation of Wuhan, although it was once widely rumored that the "China Incident" was about to end, and the transportation authorities had even prepared to dispatch ships to send soldiers back to their countries, after the announcement by the Chairman Chiang, the Japanese soldiers' dreams of returning home were shattered, and he also continued to move with the army on the Guangdong-Hankou Road between Wuchang and Xianning. A year of expeditions made him recognize the truth about the war against China. He resolutely abandoned his promising career as a young military officer and joined the ranks of our country's sacred national revolutionary war.

Although he did not arrive in Changsha until early May, he had already left the Sixth Division headquarters stationed in Echeng as early as February 16. It was on that night that he sneaked out of the camp, walking south along the highway. In order to avoid the eyes and ears of the Japanese army, he only walked forty li by dawn and had to hide in the forest. At that time, he was still wearing a Japanese military uniform and carrying sixty Japanese yen, which he wanted to use to buy a set of Chinese farmers' clothing. The local people gave him a set of clothes he needed but returned the Japanese yen he paid. He knew that there were Chinese guerrillas near Liushikou Street, so he asked a fishing boat to take him there. After a day's journey by water, he arrived at his destination. The chief of the political department of the Xiang-E-Gan border area's civilian guerrilla headquarters - a student from Wuhan University - welcomed him and immediately arranged accommodation for him. A few days later, after passing through ×× Old Street and ×× Street, he met Yang Jun, the guerrilla battalion commander, in ××. He began to participate in the guerrillas there, staying for a month and a half. Battalion Commander Yang understood Japanese but could not speak it. They communicated in writing every day. Although life was difficult, they were very happy in spirit. It was at this time that he truly understood the greatness of the Chinese sons and daughters fighting for national liberation.

### Chongqing Again Suffers Air Raid; Heavy Casualties in Northern Guangdong; Harassment Occurs from Time to Time Along the Zhejiang and Fujian Coasts

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Japanese planes attacked Chongqing again last night, the 26th, at 7 PM. At that time, the new moon was high in the sky, and the clear sky was like a wash. The scene was clear, and the Japanese planes specifically targeted government offices and densely populated areas, dropping over 100 bombs. The disaster area, including Zhuo, the area affected on May 5th, and the commercial center of Chongqing, became a disaster area of one mile wide and one and a half miles long. All city telephone lines were cut, all telegraph poles were knocked down, and piles of rubble accumulated in the streets, with some reaching heights of over twenty feet.

When the Japanese planes intruded into the city's airspace, Chinese anti-aircraft guns roared in unison, forming a network of fire in the sky. Six Chinese fighter planes, despite the vast disparity in numbers, were not intimidated. They weaved through the fire net and the Japanese plane formations, attacking upwards and downwards, displaying extraordinary bravery. The Japanese planes incessantly dropped bombs densely along the riverbanks and in the area of Central Park, which is located on the edge of the city. One bomb hit the Chung Mei Bank, killing seven people standing at the entrance. The Lin Yeh Bank was shaken, and the tower of the Chongqing Bank was bombed off.

Six bombs landed near the Canadian Church's residential buildings, but the church and the YWCA dormitory were unharmed. One bomb hit a temple in the city center, and another destroyed the "Relief Association for Wounded Soldiers" run by foreigners. Numerous bombs fell around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The most tragic situation was in Central Park, where five bombs landed, resulting in hundreds of casualties. One bomb hit a shelter, killing twenty people. The tower-shaped shelter was destroyed, and the trees in the park were stained with blood. More than twenty people who sought refuge under a rock were killed by the violent shock and shrapnel. The German trading firm Kung Shih and the residence of the German Pi Tzu were destroyed. Bombs dropped by Japanese planes fell on small factories along the river, destroying boats, with corpses and body parts floating in the river. One bomb landed behind the Canadian Metropolitan Hospital, but there were no casualties. Several bombs also fell within the disaster area of May 5th, killing several soldiers defending the area. The total number of deaths and injuries in the city was estimated to be less than a thousand. An hour after the bombing, the entire city was enveloped in a dense, smoke-filled haze, suffocating and blinding those seeking refuge. Currently, there are two fires in the city that cannot be controlled.

A firecracker factory in the city was bombed, leading many citizens to believe that a military arsenal had been hit. This was quite amusing, as the explosion of firecrackers only allowed the police to enter the area half an hour later to rescue workers.

Currently, firefighters are finding it difficult to extinguish the fires in the city due to being blocked by rubble, but excavation teams are actively working to clear the obstacles. Hundreds of rescue workers have been dispatched to rescue the affected citizens.

The air is filled with the smell of gunpowder. According to sources, this is because the Japanese side is lacking cotton and is using old methods to manufacture bombs. The Chinese side claimed to have shot down two Japanese planes.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 26th] According to reports from Chinese sources here, since the beginning of spring, Japanese planes have been carrying out massive bombings. Last night's disaster in Chongqing has reached the peak of air raids. In South China, sixty-six Japanese planes, divided into five groups, bombed various locations along the Yuehan Railway. In Yingde, thirty-three Japanese planes attacked, destroying hundreds of houses and causing heavy casualties. At the same time, twenty-three Japanese planes dropped twenty bombs in Wengyuan, destroying many houses and killing ten civilians. Also, ten Japanese planes dropped twenty-four bombs in Shaoguan, destroying twenty houses and killing twenty civilians. The Zhenhai Fortress near Ningbo was also subjected to an air raid, but the number of casualties is unknown.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 25th] At 5:05 AM on the 25th, five enemy planes invaded Zhenhai, dropping eleven bombs in the urban area, killing four people, injuring seven, and destroying ten houses.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th] Three enemy planes flew north from the South Sea, and at 2:20 PM, dropped three bombs on Putian County, causing slight damage. The county, located 160 miles south of Yinzhou, encountered an air raid for the first time today.

### Wang Jingwei Suffers Disdain; Requests to Visit Japan Three Times, Ignored; Desperate End as a Second-Rate Puppet

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai report: Wang Jingwei is still living in the former residence of Jiang Zhongzheng in Shanghai. Wang has repeatedly expressed his desire to go to Tokyo to [Japanese]. However, [Japanese] does not value Wang and has not responded, so he has not been able to go. A few days ago, rumors in Shanghai spread that Wang had gone to Tokyo, which likely originated from this. It is now heard that Wang has requested to go to Japan for the third time, but how [Japanese] will respond is unknown. According to Wang's confidants, Wang knows that he is powerless and has expressed to [Japanese] that if Wu Peifu is willing to serve as a puppet, he is willing to assist Wu as a deputy, which shows his extreme desperation. Examining Wang's intention, he originally wanted to use his past political position, ××××, ×××××××××××××××, which is not only despised by the whole country, but [Japanese] also understands his empty promises and does not value him, so he has no conclusion and only highlights his ××. Now he lowers his head and begs to be a second-rate puppet. Even his confidants believe this kind of ×× behavior is hopeless and are unwilling to continue to be employed. Therefore, the activities of Wang's followers in Shanghai have been quieter recently than before.

### Britain Presents Draft Agreement to the Soviet Union; Issues Declaration Before Formal Signing; and Consults on Effective Military Cooperation

[Associated Press, London, 25th] The British Foreign Office has instructed its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to notify Soviet Foreign Minister of the outline of the tripartite mutual assistance agreement plan proposed by Britain, stating that the entire plan can be drafted soon. It is reported that the Soviet Union has accepted the British plan. Today, British defense ministers held lengthy talks with the foreign secretary regarding the tripartite agreement. It is said that the important elements of the tripartite military alliance have been included in the British proposal and will be submitted to the Soviet government.

[Reuters, London, 5th] How about the nature and scope of Britain's recent suggestions to the Soviet Union? The official single latitude is like a deep well. According to Reuters' diplomatic interviewer, the public believes that the suggestions contain the following key points. First, the suggestion contains a mutual assistance agreement, when any of the three countries (Britain, France, and the Soviet Union) directly attack the European territory of any country, the other two countries will assist. Before the formal agreement is established, the three countries will issue this declaration. Second, the suggestion also stipulates that when a country guaranteed by any of the three countries is directly attacked, the three countries should consult and act with each other. However, the country being guaranteed is still under discussion. Also, the country being invaded must rise up to resist before the guarantee can take effect. Third, the general staff of the three countries must hold consultations so that the navies, land forces, and air forces of the three countries can cooperate most effectively. The public believes that any agreement between the three countries must abide by the above three principles. Although these suggestions from Britain are not completely in line with the Soviet Union's proposal for a full defensive alliance, they have actually made provisions for any threat to the three countries from the outside world. At the same time, they do not pose any threat to countries that pursue peace and cooperation as their policy.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] Responsible figures recently announced that the draft mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been delivered by the British government to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has begun to be studied. It is expected that the governments of France and Britain will reach an agreement this evening, so that Foreign Minister Bonnet can hand over this draft to Soviet Ambassador Suritz before noon tomorrow. The British Foreign Office will then telegraph Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union (Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky is currently in Geneva). At that time, only details will need to be discussed, so the agreement is easy to conclude.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] The Friday News Record reported that, according to government sources, British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha will travel to Moscow in the near future, because the future Anglo-Soviet agreement contains conditions for military cooperation.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] According to reports here, the French government has decided to follow Britain's example and send a military delegation to Moscow to discuss the military conditions of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] According to the Friday Standard Evening News, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Red Army has been invited to visit the British military exercises. It also said that the British Secretary of War, if the European political situation is favorable at that time, may travel to Moscow in September to respond to the Soviet Union and visit the Red Army exercises. It also said that after the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement is completed, the military staff conference of the three countries will be held next month.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] On Friday afternoon, the military officially announced that the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Red Army has accepted the British invitation to visit the British autumn exercises. It was said that senior officials from several countries will come to London for talks. According to informed sources, this refers to the chiefs of staff of France and Poland.

Germany Issues Announcement; Threatens Britain and France; Accuses "Encirclement Policy"; Britain Declares It Does Not Understand German Tone

[Reuters, Berlin, 25th] Regarding the efforts of Britain and France to conclude an agreement with Soviet Russia, the German authorities today authorized a statement to the foreign press, stating that "collective countries will give a corresponding response to attempts at such encirclement tactics." The statement also said that these efforts by Britain and France are enough to increase the deterioration of the situation.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th] Semi-official sources recently issued a public announcement, stating that Britain is currently seeking to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that although Germany and Italy are willing to resolve various European issues in a friendly manner, they have been rejected by Britain and France. The day before yesterday, Italian government spokesperson Gayda published an article in the Italian Daily, also stating that Europe is currently at a crossroads. It is hoped that Britain and France will amend the Treaty of Versailles in a peaceful manner and not engage in encirclement. It must be known that Germany and Italy invited Britain and France to cooperate, which is the last time. Germany and Italy earnestly advised them, but Britain and France continued to promote the so-called effective new method, and were only engaged in continuing the encirclement policy. The situation is clear and cannot be denied. Furthermore, it is proven that Britain and France are unwilling to cooperate in seeking constructive solutions to maintain European peace, and it is also clear that they have no real intention of resolving the peace problem. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. The integrated countries will inevitably have to respond to this new attempt at encirclement.

[Central News Agency, London, 25th] After the German semi-official announcement was issued, official sources here also made a statement, saying that the German announcement stated that the Axis powers invited the democratic countries to jointly resolve various European issues, which is the last word. British officials, after reading it, were baffled. It is noted that the obligations that the British government has accepted and should accept will only be implemented when the sovereign states concerned are threatened by aggression. According to the British government, it has always advocated using negotiations to seek solutions to various pending cases, and is still willing to cooperate in order to achieve this goal.

### Huge Budget for the Next Year in the Soviet Union; Joint Session of the Two Houses Opens; Minister of Finance's Speech Crushes Aggression

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 26th] The Soviet Supreme Soviet (the two houses of the Nationalities and the Union) is the most prestigious organization in the European Parliament. It held its first meeting of the year in the Kremlin yesterday, with 1,200 people attending, representing more than 100 ethnic groups in the country. The deputies were mostly dressed in different national costumes, and the whole venue was colorful and dazzling. Stalin and the chairmen of the People's Committee arrived on time. The National Congress was formally opened, and Stalin would not participate in the discussions. The most important item on the agenda was the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Chairman of the People's Committee and Foreign Minister Molotov will attend the meeting to deliver a speech, and then the deputies will hold a debate on the international situation. When Molotov delivers his speech, he will explain the reasons for the resignation of former Foreign Minister Litvinov. In addition, the national defense issue and the Five-Year Plan are also on the agenda for debate. This meeting will last for a week or ten days before adjourning.

[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] At today's meeting of the two houses of the Soviet Union, Finance Minister Zverev reported that the Soviet Union's total military expenditure budget for 1939 was 40,885,000,000 rubles, compared to 27,000,000,000 rubles last year. This figure accounts for more than 25% of the national budget. The representatives cheered and applauded for five minutes. When Zverev spoke, Stalin, Voroshilov, and other government officials listened attentively. Zverev also said that the current Soviet army and navy "are ready to give warmongers a three-fold return." He also said that "as proven by the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Red Army is ready to crush any enemy who dares to invade our country's borders."

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 25th] The Soviet Supreme Soviet, the Nationalities Council and the Union Council, held a joint meeting today. The People's Committee of Finance, Svane Lixi, presented the budget for the next year, with total expenditures of 154,957,000,000 rubles, of which (1) national defense expenditures accounted for 40,885,000,000 rubles, an increase of 13,885,000,000 rubles over this year, (2) national economic expenditures accounted for 59,300,000,000 rubles, and (3) social welfare expenditures accounted for 38,564,000,000 rubles. Svane Lixi also made a speech, stating that the Soviet army is very strong. If other countries dare to invade our borders, they will be dealt a head-on blow and destroyed. In short, the Soviet Union has a population of 170 million people, led by the great Stalin, which no force can destroy. Those madmen who intend to attack our country should know that they will retreat in the face of difficulty.

[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] Former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov attended today's joint meeting of the two houses of the Soviet Union to participate in the discussion of the 1939 budget. He sat in the front row with Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin and chatted and laughed with other representatives. The British ambassador and other diplomatic envoys were also present.

### Japanese Ambassadors to Germany and Italy; Rumored to Resign; Dissatisfied with European Policy of the Japanese Cabinet; Arita May Be Forced to Step Down

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to reliable sources, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima and Ambassador to Italy Shiratori are dissatisfied with the European policy decided by the Japanese cabinet. This decision contradicts the efforts of the ambassadors to conclude a tripartite military alliance in Europe. The two ambassadors now plan to resign, believing that their work is no longer needed. Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita are currently discussing ways to change the ambassadors' views, but if they are unsuccessful, they will accept the resignations of the two ambassadors. After the two ambassadors resign, Foreign Minister Arita may be forced to step down, and Togo, a diplomat from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who will soon return from Moscow, may be appointed as Foreign Minister. It is expected that the European policy decided by the Japanese cabinet will be announced soon. Shiratori and Oshima refused to send this policy to the German and Italian governments. The current difficulty is that the two ambassadors are carrying out activities to involve Japan in the European situation, while the Japanese government has decided to not interfere in affairs outside of Asia.

[Reuters, Berlin, 25th] It is believed here that Germany and Italy will conclude a military alliance with Japan or Spain (especially the possibility of signing an alliance with Japan is greater) as an Axis response to British, French, and Soviet negotiations. Recent speeches in Japan celebrating the German and Italian military alliance and strengthening the anti-communist agreement have been noted here. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany has recently visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop several times, increasing the difficulties encountered by Japan, which are not insurmountable. Some Japanese sources here indicated that Japan would not be able to strictly adhere to neutrality in the event of a European war.

### British House of Commons Debates; Trade in China; Will Take Appropriate Protection If Necessary; Closely Monitoring French Steps

[Reuters, London, 26th] Undersecretary Butler today answered a question in the House of Commons regarding the French restriction on the import of Japanese goods into French territories, citing the notes exchanged between France and Japan last year and the use of consular certificates. He said, "The purpose of this method is obviously to obtain a guarantee for the import of French goods into Japan. As for the effect of this method, it is not possible to make any statement as to the extent to which Japanese goods are refused entry into the territory. The British government is closely monitoring the trade interests in the Japanese-controlled areas, so that appropriate protective measures can be taken if necessary." Mr. Henderson asked, "Wouldn't it be better for Britain to act jointly with the French authorities in this matter?" Butler replied, "There are certain difficulties in this matter, but the government is closely monitoring the French steps." Sir Fox then asked whether the Admiralty was satisfied with the current naval strength in the Far East, so as to provide British shipping with legitimate protection against aggression of any kind, and whether the government would consider increasing the British Navy in the Far East. Shakespeare, representing the government, replied that the government was very concerned about the protection of merchant shipping by the British Navy in the Far East, but it did not seem appropriate to announce the future situation of the Far East fleet to the public.

### If Japan Joins the German-Italian Alliance; British-French-Soviet Agreement; Will Extend to the Far East

[Central News Agency, London, 25th] According to sources in Berlin, the German-Italian alliance treaty may be expanded in scope, with Japan joining the alliance. Sources close to the government here recently commented, stating that if this news is true, the British-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement will inevitably be extended in scope to the Far East. However, to date, Britain has never made this suggestion, nor has the Soviet Union mentioned this level, so as not to increase the difficulty of negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Considering Japan's past attitude, this news from Berlin may not be reliable, but if Japan suddenly changes its plan and fully cooperates with the German-Italian Axis, the British response will arrive very soon.

### Japan and the Axis Powers of Germany and Italy

— Translated by Shi Xiang

The issue of Japan's relationship with the anti-communist Axis powers seems to be receiving close attention and consideration in Japan. This is because of Germany's proposal that Japan join a military alliance with Italy to oppose the democratic front of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries. However, unexpectedly, opinions among the Japanese people on this proposal are quite divided. Regardless of how the Axis powers exchange views on a military alliance, Japan is always hesitant and unenthusiastic, fearing that it will become trapped in this alliance without being able to extricate itself. Japan is willing to participate in an alliance that directly confronts the Soviet Union, but it opposes joining a broad agreement because Germany would then ask the Japanese fleet to go to Europe in the event of a European war without giving Japan any compensation. Japan suspects that Germany and Italy are trying to obtain a large price for a small reward.

The German-Japanese high-level trade agreement is said to be progressing very poorly because Germany insists on using gold to pay for trade between the two countries, instead of bartering. However, Japan is very short of foreign currency. Therefore, judging from the current situation, Germany and Japan are unlikely to cooperate closely. Furthermore, Japan's interests are mainly in the Far East, while Germany's are in Europe. If a European war breaks out in the future, and Japan joins Germany and Italy in fighting, then the benefits it can obtain will certainly be small. Moreover, the democratic countries are likely to form a united and strong anti-fascist aggression front, so Japan might be defeated. Germany and Italy cannot financially help Japan conquer China, so Japan is unwilling to form a military alliance with them to deal with Britain, France, and the United States, because it still dreams of obtaining a loan from these countries.

From Germany's perspective, Germany is also unwilling for Japan to take military risks in China, because this would not only weaken Germany's advantage when war breaks out in Europe, but also directly destroy Germany's commercial interests in China. Therefore, Germany is attempting to mediate the Sino-Japanese War, restore friendly relations between China and Germany, and promote the harmony of the two peoples. Although there was an incident in the past where Germany recalled its advisors in China, the recent report of a barter trade agreement between China and Germany further proves that although Germany still has dealings with Japan, it is still willing to maintain friendly relations with China. Japan's request to Germany not to transport military materials to China does not seem to have attracted Germany's attention. Similarly, Japan's statement that it might consider ceding Qingdao to Germany has not evoked any reaction in Berlin. German people deeply feel that the value of such temptations, when compared with the losses they would suffer from severing diplomatic relations with China, is really too insignificant to mention. Therefore, no matter how similar their interests and goals may seem on the surface, and despite the frequent exchanges of envoys between the two countries, there is still a great divide between them, separating Japan from the Axis powers and preventing them from approaching each other.

In short, they are only concerned about their own interests and want to use their position in the Axis to obtain the maximum possible benefits. As long as their interests do not conflict with each other, they can coexist peacefully. But once their interests cannot be coordinated and disputes arise, then all their agreements will quickly collapse.

Small Evidence

### Calls for Punishing Wang Jingwei

Since the Central News Agency officially announced the news of Wang Jingwei's travels between Japan and Shanghai, Wang Jingwei's usual claims of "anti-communism" and "peace" have completely failed. His [missing text] actions have aroused [missing text] among all Chinese people. They have even aroused [missing text] among Wang Jingwei's close associates (although some of it may be deliberate pretense). Overseas compatriots' [missing text] of Wang can be said to be increasingly激昂, and calls for punishing Wang, demanding that a decree be issued to [missing text] Wang Jingwei, have already resounded in newspapers at home and abroad! Regarding all of Wang Jingwei's current words and deeds, such as how he aids Japan [missing text], this newspaper's editorial today has already pointed out something. We humbly hope that the central government can examine the interests of the nation and the country, heed public opinion at home and abroad, and implement appropriate measures of [missing text] against Wang. This will not only strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front lines, but also greatly benefit the national spiritual mobilization, the cause of resistance and national reconstruction, and the cause of true world peace. It is truly dependent on this!

### The Supreme Soviet

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened on the 25th evening, with 1,200 delegates in attendance, representing more than 100 ethnic groups. At a time when the entire capitalist world and all colonies and semi-colonies are engulfed in the flames of a new war, this Supreme Soviet, convened on a vast land of independence, freedom, and happiness, naturally deserves the attention of people around the world.

From the 10th to the 21st of March, the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party once reported how the Soviet Union faithfully promoted the cause of peace, maintained world peace, advocated democratic institutions, aided oppressed nations, and opposed the policy of aggression. It also told us that due to the development of the Soviet national economy, the improvement of the people's cultural and material lives, and the strengthening of national defense capabilities, it is sufficient to guarantee that the Soviet Union will be able to faithfully and smoothly implement this policy. This Supreme Soviet will conduct more concrete discussions on diplomatic, economic, and national defense issues, and formulate resolutions representing the common will of the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. It will certainly make greater contributions to the consolidation and development of the Soviet Union, and to the development and achievement of the international anti-aggression and anti-fascist movement!

Since the start of our country's resistance war, the facts of the past twenty-odd months have proven that the Soviet Union is indeed one of China's most faithful friendly nations. We should naturally express our joy and congratulations for the development of the Soviet Union's national strength and the improvement of its international reputation. We should naturally express even more respect and wish success to this Supreme Soviet, with its 1,200-odd delegates representing more than 100 ethnic groups. At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to learn from the Soviet Union, adhere to internal unity, resolutely resist [missing character] and eliminate traitors, enhance national strength and prestige, and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, in order to promote the Soviet Union's national aid-China movement, and especially to encourage the aid-China and anti-Japanese movement in Britain, the United States, and France! Today, the world will undoubtedly recognize that the development of the national strength of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will be the strongest guarantee of world peace!

### Three British Merchant Ships Detained in Guangzhou for Over Seven Months Released and Return to Hong Kong — Tung An, Ta Ming, and Tai Lee Arrive in Succession Yesterday Afternoon — Falsely Accused of Carrying Military Supplies, They Were Raided and Plundered on Board

At the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, there were more than ten foreign merchant ships, large and small, trapped on the Pearl River and West River in Guangzhou. After the [missing character] army occupied Yueyuan, they deliberately detained the foreign ships under the pretext that the waterways were dangerous. It was not until recently, after the consuls of various countries made great efforts to negotiate, that the [missing character] side released the foreign ships one after another. Jinshan, Guangxi, Jiangsu, and many other ships have escaped danger and returned to Hong Kong one after another. Guangdong of the Tong An Company, Ta Ming of the Fu An Company, and Tai Lee of the Si Yi Company were still detained. After the British Consul stationed in Guangdong continued to negotiate with the [missing character] side, they were finally allowed to return to Hong Kong yesterday. They arrived one after another after 4 pm. The details of the process are recorded as follows:

Returning to Hong Kong Yesterday

The British ships returning to Hong Kong from the province yesterday included Tung An of the Tong An Company, Ta Ming of the Fu An Company, and Tai Lee of the Si Yi Company. They left the province at 8:30 yesterday morning. The ships had received notice from the [missing character] side beforehand to unload all the cargo on board the day before departure. At 8:00 yesterday morning, the [missing character] side sent troops on board to search extensively. Under the pretext of inspection, they wantonly harassed the crew. The ships did not carry any passengers, only a few foreigners were on board to come to Hong Kong. At 8:30, they set sail from the provincial river, with Tung An taking the lead, followed by Ta Ming, and then Tai Lee bringing up the rear. The [missing character] side did not send any ships to guide them, only two "pilots" were sent to steer Tung An as a guide. Ta Ming and Tai Lee followed behind to the exit. At about 9:00, when the Tai Lee ship bringing up the rear reached the Sanzhi Xiang River, the officer in the officer's cabin mistakenly steered off course, causing it to run aground and unable to move forward. The shipowner immediately telegraphed the Tung An and Ta Ming ships for help. Upon receiving the news, the two ships immediately stopped sailing. One of the [missing character] "pilots" from the Tung An ship crossed over to the Tai Lee ship to take over as helmsman, and then continued to sail forward. When the Tung An and Tai Lee ships sailed to outside Humen, the [missing character] pilot immediately [missing character] the ship and returned to the province. The two ships continued to steam to Hong Kong. The Tung An ship arrived at Ang Chuan Zhou at 3:00 pm to be quarantined by the Hong Kong medical officer. It docked at the pier at 3:00 pm. The Ta Ming ship and Tai Lee ship were delayed until nightfall before arriving in Hong Kong.

Crew Talk

According to the crew of the Tung An ship, when Guangzhou fell, the ship sailed away from the pier with the other foreign ships and anchored near Shamian. A long time after Guangzhou fell, there was still no news of returning to Hong Kong. The [missing character] soldiers frequently boarded the ships to conduct searches and harassment. Many of the metal items on the ship were plundered by the [missing character] army. Other items were also taken away by the [missing character] army. The ship was under the control of the [missing character] army and there was nothing that could be done. After the ship stopped sailing, the members of the upper levels of each department were stationed on the ship. Although the [missing character] military authorities did not prohibit the crew members of the foreign ships from going ashore, they threatened the crew that they should not take risks unless necessary. A few people wanted to see the situation in the city and left the ship to go ashore, but when they landed, they were insulted and searched all over by the [missing character] soldiers. In addition to the confiscation of money, the documents in their pockets were not spared. When they entered the city, they were beaten and humiliated by the [missing character] soldiers on guard. Therefore, most of the crew members did not dare to go ashore. For seven and a half months, they were trapped on the ship, no different from being under house arrest.

Negotiation Process

Regarding the process of negotiating the return to port of the above-mentioned ships, according to the reporter's investigation, at the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, the [missing character] army used the pretext that the waterway mines had not been cleared and the Pearl River could not be opened, and detained the foreign merchant ships in the provincial river. Most of those detained were British merchant ships. Therefore, the British authorities, at the request of various shipping companies, instructed the British Consul-General in Guangdong to negotiate with the [missing character] side, requesting that the trapped ships be released and returned to Hong Kong as soon as possible. Upon receiving the order, the British Consul immediately negotiated with the [missing character] side based on reason. The [missing character] side made various excuses to delay the matter. On the one hand, they sent a large number of [missing character] ships to and from Guangzhou and neighboring ports, monopolizing the shipping rights of the Pearl River. In these seven months, although the British Consul urged the [missing character] side to release the ships with all his strength, there were no results. It was not until a month ago, after the British authorities made further strong representations, that the ships were released one after another. Tung An, Tai Lee, and Ta Ming, which returned to Hong Kong yesterday, will be the last batch to leave the province. The three ships were originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong with Guangxi a week ago, but they temporarily received a notice from the [missing character] side to reschedule their departure to yesterday. Only Quanxing is still left in the provincial river.

No Military Supplies

It was found that at the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, the [missing character] side falsely claimed that the foreign ships left in Qingzhou contained military supplies for our army, so they detained them. At the same time, they released rumors that each ship had carried military supplies that had not been unloaded when they went to the province from the port. Yesterday, a foreign news report in Hong Kong also had the following record: "Four British merchant ships trapped in Guangzhou were approved by the Japanese authorities to return to Hong Kong today." But they were only allowed to carry ordinary cargo, and other military supplies had to be unloaded before leaving Guangzhou. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the claim that each ship was carrying military supplies is absolutely inaccurate. When each ship went to the province from the port, they were carrying ordinary foreign goods and food. After arriving in the province, they were completely unloaded and returned to the cargo owners. On the day of the blockade of Humen, each ship had loaded export goods in preparation for shipping them to Hong Kong. Until they left Hong Kong yesterday, all the goods were unloaded. Moreover, each ship was searched repeatedly by the [missing character] army during the period of detention, and no military supplies were found. The so-called carrying of military supplies is absolutely groundless. In fact, the [missing character] army used it as an excuse to make things difficult for the foreign ships.

Recent Situation in the Dead City

A certain merchant arrived in Hong Kong yesterday on the Tung An ship. When the reporter asked about the recent situation in the dead city, he said that the degree of terror and chaos in the city after the [missing character] army occupied Guangzhou for half a year has not diminished from the initial fall. The residents who stayed in the city initially thought that the situation in Guangzhou could be stabilized soon. Now that they have witnessed everything in the city falling into silence, they have also left the city one after another. Recently, because our army's counterattack is becoming more urgent, more and more people are fleeing. Although the [missing character] army is trying its best to publicize that order in the city has been restored, the demonstration of facts has become the opposite. Whether it is day or night, bandits can run rampant in any prosperous area of the city. The puppet police have no weapons. They cannot stop the bandits from robbing, but instead have to avoid them. In the past month, guerrillas in the suburbs have frequently launched attacks on the [missing character] army in the city. The [missing character] army is quite bewildered. Although the [missing character] side tried its best to cover it up, the frequent movement of troops and transportation of wounded soldiers every day could not completely hide it from the ears and eyes of foreigners. In the financial aspect, legal tender is still circulating smoothly. The [missing character] army forces the use of military banknotes, but the citizens have refused to accept them in many ways. Therefore, there are very few [missing character] military banknotes circulating in the market.

### Homeless Paupers to Be Sent to Refugee Camps

Local medical authorities are planning to send homeless paupers sleeping on the streets to government refugee camps for resettlement. This move by the authorities is intended to have a positive impact on public health in Hong Kong. Moreover, refugee camps have various educational and handicraft facilities. After the paupers move in, they will have many opportunities to receive education and learn skills, which will greatly benefit the paupers directly. The Medical Department also requires the cooperation of the police to be responsible for relocating the refugees. As for the temporary structures built in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon some time ago, the authorities have also ordered them to be dismantled as soon as possible.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Hong Kong Manufacturers to Fill Out Itemized Forms — To Be Submitted Every Six Months — Safeguarding Domestic Products and Preventing Counterfeiting

In order to protect the production of domestic goods in our country and eliminate malpractices such as counterfeiting domestic goods, after issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is now conducting stricter inspections to avoid mixing the genuine with the fake. It recently sent a letter to manufacturers in Hong Kong stating that all manufacturers who have already received certificates of origin for domestic goods should fill out an itemized form every six months from now on. The Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers Association has already received the notification letter and has forwarded it to the manufacturers to comply with. The notification from the Ministry of Economic Affairs is recorded as follows: Ministry of Economic Affairs Notification Gongzi No. 26521. Upon investigation, the regulations of our Ministry for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods were revised and promulgated in July of the 27th year. However, the internal situation of each manufacturer that has already received a certificate of origin for domestic goods is subject to change from time to time. If we do not examine them closely at any time, it will be difficult to make [missing character] meetings. The following measures are hereby determined to be implemented: (1) All manufacturers who have already received a certificate of origin for domestic goods shall fill out an itemized form once every [missing character] months and submit it to our Ministry for record. The form shall be the same as the itemized form to be submitted when applying for a certificate of origin for domestic goods. (2) The itemized form to be filled out shall be submitted to the local competent authority for [missing character], or sent to the local legal industrial and commercial organization for certification before being submitted for review. The certification procedures shall be handled in accordance with the method of filling out and submitting the itemized form for applying for a certificate of origin for domestic goods. In addition to notifying separately, the Association is hereby instructed to send a copy to inform the Chinese factories in Hong Kong that have already received certificates of origin for domestic goods to comply with and report on schedule. This is hereby notified, Minister Weng Wenhao.

### Fishmonger Beats Girl

Perpetrator Sentenced to One Month

At 4:00 pm on the [missing character] of April, when the New Central Market was crowded with customers, a thirteen-year-old girl, Chen Wanglan, bought fish from a certain fish stall. She had a quarrel with the fishmonger Chen Qi (35 years old) over a small matter. Chen actually punched and kicked Yulan. Yulan could not withstand the violence and was beaten unconscious. Afterwards, detectives arrived at the scene and arrested Chen. The injured person was sent to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious and she has recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The detective authorities then charged Chen with assaulting the girl Chen Yulan at the Central Magistracy. The case was heard again yesterday morning by Judge Yi Shitang. The defendant admitted to committing the assault without hesitation, saying that on that day, the plaintiff came to his place to buy fish for nine cents. After agreeing on the price, the plaintiff gave four cents less. He then negotiated with her, but she suddenly grabbed his clothes, tearing them. He could not bear it, so he slapped her. Now he admits that what he did was inappropriate and asks for leniency. The official sentenced him to a fine of 20 yuan or imprisonment for one month.

### Education Authorities — Cracking Down on Excessive Admissions by Schools — Actively Investigating — Regulations on School Building to Student Ratio

The Hong Kong Education Authorities have strict regulations for schools, with strict stipulations on the seating on each floor, and students should not be admitted in excess, which would impede the sanitation of the students. However, since the unrest in South China, the number of students has increased sharply. Among them, not a small number only want to charge more tuition and do not care about student hygiene, accepting all and arranging more seats. Some even have less than three to four cubic feet per seat. It seems that this has a profound impact on student hygiene. The Education Authorities have paid close attention to this and are now actively investigating. Those who only seek excessive admissions and deviate from the regulations on seating area will be cracked down on. The crackdown method is to issue a serious warning for the first time and urge them to improve quickly. If they still do not improve, they will be punished. If the violation is too serious, their school license may be revoked.

### Smugglers and Tax Police — Major Battle Near Shenzhen — Guerrilla Troops Sent to Assist — Thirteen Male and Female Smugglers Captured

The ferocity and rampancy of smugglers on the Sino-British border are unprecedented today. Whenever there is a search, they resist with guns. On the 23rd of this month, dozens of smugglers occurred again in the Shenzhen area, transporting [missing character] goods for import, intending to transfer them to Changping along the railway. This was discovered by the Tax Bureau, which ordered an inspection. The smugglers resisted inspection with guns. As a result, a total of thirteen smugglers were arrested on the spot. Yesterday, the reporter took a special car to various parties to investigate the truth. The information obtained is recorded as follows:

Quiet Night, Gunshots

It was found that Shenzhen and the Hong Kong border are closely related. The defenses are tight. Recently, a general group of smugglers took advantage of the chaos of the war in South China and suddenly became active. The Tax Bureau reported this and severely suppressed them. At 4:20 am on the 23rd of this month, a small station not far from Shenzhen near the British border suddenly heard gunshots in the quiet night, echoing far and wide. The residents were awakened by the gunshots from their sweet dreams. The residents initially thought that [missing character] cavalry were launching a night attack, and fled to the British border in a panic. The scene of panic can be imagined.

Inspecting Smugglers, Major Battle

It was later found that the incident was caused by smugglers opening fire to resist the inspection. On the morning of the 23rd, a total of ten male and female smugglers were secretly transporting a large batch of inferior goods for import, using four-wheeled handcarts, along the Chinese section of the railway, intending to transfer them to Changping. This was discovered by the Tax Bureau, which quietly dispatched many inspectors to lie in ambush near Shenzhen Station, waiting for the smugglers to pass by and intercept them. At that time, the search officers saw dozens of smugglers walking in single file and wanted to stop them. However, due to the disparity in numbers, they did not dare to neglect the importance of public order. Therefore, they shouted for them to stop and inspect when they were not far away from the smugglers. Unexpectedly, the smugglers not only turned a deaf ear to this, but also did not restrict the stoppage and continued to rush forward as before. The inspectors were forced to fire their guns to demonstrate to the smugglers. Unexpectedly, the smugglers were not afraid of the law and returned fire to resist the inspectors. For a time, gunshots were very dense, like firecrackers.

Male and Female Smugglers, All Captured

The guerrillas and county police stationed in a certain place suddenly heard gunshots in the middle of the night and did not know what had happened. They followed the sound and rushed to Shenzhen Station. They found that it was a conflict between smugglers and inspectors. They cooperated with the inspectors of the Tax Bureau to inflict pain on the smugglers. As a result of the fierce battle, the smugglers were defeated. Thirteen male and female smugglers were captured on the spot. At the same time, three short guns were seized. The guerrillas, county police, and inspectors of the Tax Bureau escorted the captured smugglers to the Guerrilla Headquarters in a certain charity hall nearby for questioning. The reporter believed that the matter was of great importance and specially visited a certain senior official at the headquarters to inquire about everything. According to reports, the headquarters attached great importance to the case and had discussed the response with the bureau in the future. At the same time, the seized inferior goods would be resolved immediately and confiscated according to law. The smugglers who resisted inspection with guns would be escorted to the headquarters for strict handling according to law.

### Dance to Raise Funds

The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives held a dance last night at 9:00 PM at the Hong Kong Hotel to raise funds. Celebrities from all walks of life here attended. Dresses fluttered, creating a magnificent scene. That night, local Hong Kong socialites and young ladies performed songs and dances, including classical dance, piano solos, waltzes, Chinese sword dance, and four sets of songs and dances, as well as Egyptian dance. The program was very rich. The joyful gathering ended at 2:00 AM this morning.

### Hong Kong!

Designated as a Cholera Port

The authorities in the Dutch East Indies and Tianjin have declared Hong Kong a cholera-infected port. Ships traveling from Hong Kong to those locations must be quarantined at sea, it is said.

### Guangdong Muslims and the × Muslim Leader Vehemently Denounce [It]

The Muslim Community Consistently Supports the Central Government, All Believers Fight for the Country

Rumors have spread in Guangdong × that prominent Guangzhou Muslims such as Mr. Ma, Mr. Zhou, and Mr. He have formed a so-called "Muslim Autonomous Association" in Guangzhou. A reporter learned that the Muslims in the ninth shed of the Kam Tin refugee camp in Hong Kong, who are refugees from Guangzhou, would likely know about this false organization. He specially visited Zhou Shanzhi, the Muslim leader of that shed, to inquire about everything. He was granted an audience and had the following conversation.

Question (Reporter asks, similarly below): Regarding the news from Guangzhou × that prominent Muslims such as Mr. Ma have formed a "Muslim Autonomous Association" in Guangzhou, has your honorable leader heard of this?

Answer (Muslim Leader Zhou Shanzhi answers, similarly below): This shed consists of

Refugees Fleeing from Guangzhou

who came here. They share the same hatred towards the × people's invasion. The honorable leader, along with those in the same shed and other refugees residing elsewhere, have absolutely no involvement with the said false organization.

Question: What are your honorable leader's thoughts on this matter? May they be revealed?

Answer: We Chinese Muslims are one of the five major ethnic groups. We have always strictly adhered to the "Quran," which says, "Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors." It also says, "Have they not broken their oaths and determined to expel the Messenger, and they began against you the first time? Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you are [truly] believers." Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad's legacy states, "Love of homeland belongs to faith (i.e., virtue)." The scriptures on defending the faith say, "When the × people invade a fortress, resistance is the divine duty of the local men and women. When news of the invasion reaches people in other places, it is also their divine duty." Therefore, our believers have always been devoted to

Defending the Country

and dedicated to serving on the battlefield. Throughout history, there have been such people. In the past, during the Korean War, General Zuo Baozhen sacrificed himself resisting ××. During the Boxer Rebellion, General Ma Yueshou died resisting foreign ×. After the September 18th Incident, during the Battle of Shanhaiguan, General An Dexin bravely fought ×× and gave his life. These are just a few examples of the facts. There are countless others who have been loyal, patriotic, and sacrificed their lives. As for those currently serving in the government, participating in the national salvation effort, directing military planning, and resisting ××, there are quite a few. I cannot list them all. Muslims are willing to sacrifice for national salvation because they have been deeply influenced by the Quran and teachings.

Since the "July 7th" Marco Polo Bridge Incident years ago, ××'s iron hooves have trampled everywhere, turning homes into ruins. Countless of our believers have been subjected to the butchery of ××. Since the full-scale war of resistance began, under the leadership of General Bai Chongxi, the chairman of the "Muslim National Salvation Association," Chinese Muslims have unanimously and resolutely

Supported the Central Government

adhering to the established national policy and the war of resistance advocated by the Supreme Leader, Chairman Chiang, gritting their teeth, enduring pain, standing on the same front, uniting sincerely, and fighting to the end, striving to win the final victory. This is the united mindset and expectation of our Chinese Muslims.

This time, Guangzhou unfortunately fell, and countless compatriots suffered ×××. We did not want to groan under ××××, and many have come here for refuge or fled to various villages. Those who still reside in Guangzhou are mostly those who could not escape in time during the chaos. However, their numbers are small, and they have no power. Our Muslim custom is to have the imams of the various mosques as our leaders. In Guangzhou, there are five mosques: "Guangta Wei," "Xiao Dongying," "Danan Road," "Haopan Street," and "Eastern Suburbs." All the imams, such as Yang Ruisheng, Wang Zhengxuan, Ma Renfeng, and myself, have gone to Hong Kong and Macau for refuge. To put it simply, the Muslims in Guangzhou are like leaderless dragons. The "××× Newspaper" is a publication under the dominion of ×× and has no value. As for the established "Muslim Autonomous Association," it is undoubtedly a puppet organization.

The People of the Association

are a bunch of two or three shameless individuals and have no qualification to represent our Guangdong Muslims. As for Mr. Ma and others staying in Guangzhou, forming a fake association under the influence of the × people, whether they have other motives or are suffering from the oppression of the environment, we do not know.

Reaching this point in the conversation, Muslim Leader Zhou solemnly and sternly said, "We dare to resolutely declare that the said false organization is a despicable tool used by the × people. All Guangdong Muslims vow to oppose it to the death. We have heard that the false association will announce its establishment on May 26th, but no matter how it operates, we will absolutely deny it, and it will not have any effect or influence the division of our Muslim unity and determination to resist the war. Those ×× will only waste their efforts, seeing their schemes fail day by day."

Chairman Li Han-hun Intends to Improve the Baojia System

Determines Autonomous Funding, Cancels Zero-Extraction Method, Appoints Young Cadres, Increases Salaries

(Shaoguan Special Dispatch) The Baojia system is the foundation of political facilities. If the principles are sound, all political measures can be carried out smoothly. Local autonomy in Guangdong Province has been in operation for years, but due to adherence to old methods and lack of funds, it has not achieved satisfactory results, which has greatly affected administrative advancement. The provincial review of local autonomy has identified

Past Shortcomings

in approximately the following areas: (1) Most township chiefs have not been trained, and even those who have been trained often lack practical knowledge. There are no less than 70,000 district, township, village, Bao, and Jia chiefs in the province. Since many have not been trained, it is not easy to promote autonomous Baojia work. (2) Autonomous funding is difficult, and township chiefs' livelihoods cannot be resolved. Baojia chiefs also receive only three jiao per month for office expenses, and less in impoverished areas. As a result, the overall status of township and Baojia chiefs has not been raised. In a poor living and low status, it is not easy for township chiefs to be filled by outstanding members of society, which naturally reduces the effectiveness of their work. (3) In recent years, counties have handled Baojia expenses by levying taxes per household (autonomous household donations), collecting between half a hao and one hao per household per month. The amount is small, and the frequency is high, causing the people to feel disturbed and the Bao and Jia chiefs to feel troubled. The two sides often have disharmony, which greatly affects the implementation of autonomy. (4) Our country is in the process of discarding the old and establishing the new. At this time, frictions often occur between new and old forces in local areas. Young people accuse their predecessors of being outdated and corrupt, and their predecessors accuse young people of being naive and frivolous. As a result, many local undertakings are consumed by this kind of conflict in the coordination of new and old forces. Guangdong is the source of revolution. In politics, economics, culture, etc., they all have superior conditions, but the reason why political soldiers cannot promote Qingming is that the autonomous Baojia is not perfect, which is the biggest reason. Recently, it was heard that Chairman Li Han-hun had already seen this result at the beginning of his inauguration, and his

Transformation Plan

has now been largely decided. Its main content includes: (1) The first step is to determine that the annual autonomous funding for the entire province will be 9 million yuan, which will be planned and distributed by the provincial government. The current fragmented autonomous funding levy will be cancelled to reduce provincial disturbances. The newly determined autonomous funding will be used in part for training and for autonomous cadres, and in part for the living expenses of autonomous personnel and for public expenses. Although the amount of salary is not as expected for a while, after the province's finances are reorganized and the provincial treasury's income increases, the second step will be to increase funding and increase the living expenses and office expenses of autonomous personnel. In the five months since the provincial government was reorganized, due to the impact of the war of resistance, the provincial treasury's income has been difficult to reduce, but because of its best efforts to curb one expenditure, it is not in line with each other. Many of them were ordered to be paid and can be led back in the future. There is also a plan for how to reorganize taxes and increase revenue in a rational manner that does not hinder people's livelihoods. Province-wide revenue can be gradually increased. The overall planning of autonomous expenses is very promising. (2) Autonomous personnel at all levels, such as township chiefs and Baojia chiefs, will be appointed with trained or experienced outstanding young people to raise the vigorous vitality of society. The predecessors in the local area will be in a guiding position. The younger generation is willing to get the support of the experienced fathers and brothers, and the older generation is also happy to guide the younger generation. In this way, the frictions can be eliminated and the strength can be increased. The status and life of autonomous personnel have been improved, and the harmony and coordination of personnel have been added. The elimination of fragmented donations and draws has led to popular support, working together, and with one heart, the autonomous Baojia cause in the local area will surely be implemented with great vigor and will be effective day by day. This plan can be submitted to the Provincial Council Meeting soon and implemented after being approved.

### Zengcheng × Army Launches Surprise Attack on Boluo and Is Repelled

We Closely Monitor Them in Nankeng and Other Places

(Dongjiang Express News) On the Dongjiang front, the × army strongholds at Zhucun and Danzao on the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway, and at Shijiao and Shilong on the Guangzhou-Wuzhou Highway, have been repeatedly attacked by our army in the past half month. Zengcheng × is surrounded on all sides, unable to advance or retreat. In addition, guarding Zengcheng alone will be exhausted. They had to reluctantly mobilize a part of their troops to launch a counterattack, attempting to relieve the siege of Dongjiang and prevent our westward advance. A week ago, they had attempted to cross Boluo, but were repelled by our army and the local militia. Yesterday morning, the 24th, at 9:00 AM, Zengcheng × again sent about 200 infantry and cavalry to harass the area near Lianhe and Futian. Our army's Chen Ji received the news and, together with Luo's guerrilla militia led by Zaihua, intercepted them in separate directions. After several hours of fierce fighting, the × forces were defeated and fled across the Zengjiang River along the Litchi Stream. According to intelligence, the × army is mostly stationed around Dajiang Market and still has designs on Boluo. Our troops are guarding the Jigongkeng, Huanglongku, and Fushuling areas and are closely monitoring them to ensure that they do not succeed.

### After × Planes Bomb Shantou

Chaoyang Suffers a Calamity

The Dead and Wounded Total Dozens, The Population Is Now Being Evacuated

(Shantou Special Dispatch) On the 24th, a × aircraft carrier and four × transport ships sailed from Xiamen to Shantou. After a brief stop, they sailed to Guangzhou. The aircraft carrier anchored off Mayu Island in Shantou and dispatched nine planes, which invaded Chao-Shan twice, around 12:30 PM and around 1:00 PM. Each raid lasted for more than an hour. The first reconnaissance targeted Mayu Island and Jiaoshi Mountain in Shantou Port, dropping nine bombs on the poor residential area beside the Shantou Bird Bridge Beihai. They destroyed more than 20 fir shops, glass factories, and shacks, injuring one old woman. Two bombs fell near the Huilan Bridge, three bombs fell at the intersection of Xinma Road and Handi Road, destroying dozens of houses. Another bomb fell in the water near Huilan Bridge, and one did not explode. Around 1:00 PM, they passed by Chaoyang and went out to sea. The second raid directly attacked the densely populated urban area of Chaoyang, dropping more than 20 bombs on the main street of the county government, the county high school, and the Chen Family Ancestral Hall area, destroying dozens of houses, killing 13, and injuring dozens more. The aircraft carrier is still moored in Linghai. After the incident, the Shantou community welfare group set out to express condolences in the affected areas. The various benevolent halls' burial teams and rescue teams rushed to Chaoyang to assist in excavation and rescue. In addition, starting on the 26th, the population will be forcibly evacuated to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The forced evacuation of the elderly and weak population will be handled by the various jie (community) bureaus, which will dispatch police to escort them to the car and boat companies for free transportation out of the area. The number of people has now been thoroughly investigated, and population evacuation notices have been issued, respectively ordering the car and boat companies to transport those carrying these documents out of the area free of charge.

### Director Zhang Hui Orders Ban on Exporting Herbs to Aid ×

(Zhongshan News) Guangdong × suffer from water and soil incompatibility, many suffering from beriberi, many dying from it. Now they are using traitors to widely collect medicinal herbs in the interior of the Siyi area and transport them to Hong Kong and Macau for assistance. Zhongshan County Director Zhang Hui immediately ordered the various inspection agencies to investigate and prohibit it after receiving the report. The order stated, "According to reports, recently, the × who landed in South China suffer from water and soil incompatibility and many suffer from beriberi. They are using traitors to widely collect Artemisia and motherwort in the interior and transport them to Hong Kong and Macau to aid × urgently. This should be strictly investigated and prohibited."

### Provincial Government Telephones Subordinates To Strictly Prohibit Obstructing Mail Transport

Highway Bureau and Car Merchants Must Not Hold Back Mail

Villagers Who Find Mail Must Send It to the Local Post Office

(Shaoguan Express News) The provincial government yesterday telegraphed its subordinates, stating that the committee's Guilin headquarters issued a message, "The postal service is a national transportation undertaking, and its responsibility is significant, especially during this period of resistance and national construction. The military mail transmission, the communication of news between the front and rear, as well as the advancement of politics and the promotion of culture, all rely on the postal service, and the rapid transmission of orders relies on the postal service. In addition to self-owned vehicles, other means of transportation are needed to assist it in order to complete its mission and achieve its ultimate goal. Recently, the diversion road bureau and the commercial transport car company often return the mail, often not transferring it according to schedule, because the military transport is frequent and many vehicles are sealed off for use, resulting in delays and affecting wartime communication. Although I have negotiated several times, the result has not changed. It is proposed that you order the highway bureau and the business military company to transport the mail quickly and do not delay it, and that Gui Province is now becoming an important area for mail transportation in and out. There are many mail shipments to and from the frequent shipments, and the escort employees may be negligent in their protection. It is inevitable that they will be lost on the way, and there are many villagers who find mailbags and return them to the post office. There are also people who extort money or hide and do not report it, affecting the transportation of mail and communication, which is very worrying. In order to remedy this, in addition to strictly ordering all employees who escort the mail to pay close attention, you are also requested to notify the county governments, townships, and public offices to pay attention on their behalf, and to inform all villagers that if they find mailbags, they should immediately send them to the nearby post office for processing, and they must not extort rewards or hide and not report, in order to emphasize official duties and benefit communication, etc."

### × Warships and Planes Harass Beihai

Three Air Raids Cause Considerable Losses in the Urban Area

British Ship Jiaying Is Also Boarded for Inspection

(Nanlu Express News) In the coastal counties of Nanlu in Guangdong Province, × warships have been appearing and harassing them in recent days, and × planes have been scouting and bombing them, causing unease among the people. The authorities have also taken the necessary preparations, as reported in previous reports. On the 19th, × planes and × warships jointly attacked Beihai again. The urban area of Beihai suffered considerable losses from the bombing. On the afternoon of that day, at 1:40 PM, a three-funnel × cruiser sneaked into the sea off the Longwang Temple in Beihai and roamed back and forth. At 2:00 PM, a × plane took off from the ship and flew to Gaode, a suburb of Beihai, dropping four bombs. One bomb each hit the Hede Pawnshop, destroying a corner of the watchtower, and affected the adjacent Liu Shenglun store and three shops across the street. One bomb hit the Honglihao store in Fish Street, destroying it completely. Two bombs hit an open space in the Red Tile Kiln, causing no damage. After the × plane did its evil deed, it fled. A few days later, it flew out of the ship again and sneaked into the airspace of Beihai City, dropping four bombs. One bomb landed at No. 21 Haizhu East Road, and Nos. 209, 22, and 22 each hit one bomb, destroying two houses. One bomb fell at No. 231, destroying three poles. At the same time, the × warship suddenly fired more than 20 shots continuously at the Di Jiao area. Four shells landed in the Di Jiao village, destroying three houses, killing five people, and injuring more than ten people. The rest fled into the wilderness. When the × planes and × warships were wreaking havoc, they launched two more steam launches, each carrying 15 and 16 × soldiers, respectively, to spy along the coast. They chased after our fishing boats at sea. Five of them were unable to escape and were captured by them. More than ten fishermen were killed, and the fishing boats were set on fire at night. At 4:00 PM, a × plane attacked Beihai for the third time, dropping four more bombs in the Haizhu Li area. One bomb hit the vegetable market, destroying the central seat. One bomb fell at No. 60, destroying three houses. One bomb fell at No. 66, destroying it completely. One bomb landed between Nos. 62, 64, and 68, all of which were destroyed. In total, Beihai was bombed three times in one day, killing only one woman, one man, and one boy, and injuring 22 people. At the same time that the × navy and air force jointly harassed us, the British merchant ship Jiaying happened to be passing through the area. × ignored international law and sent soldiers to board the ship for inspection, causing a disturbance for a while before leaving.

### Counterattack on Jiangmen Gains Victory After Victory

Recapture Mo Ku Mountain and Other Places and Advance into the City

Rumors of × Army Landing at Niuwan Shizui Are Inaccurate

(Zhongshan Express News) According to military intelligence, our Han attack on Jiang Hui is progressing victoriously. On the Xinhe Road front, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the Duruan Binggen Mulang area on the 24th, annihilating many ×. They took advantage of the victory to advance to Jiangmen via the Mu Chuang and Luolai routes. To the east of Penglai, our Deng brigade's ×× troops encountered the × near Wucun, killing more than a hundred ×. After our army swept away the remnants of × from Wucun and Modou Mountain, they continued to advance. At 8:00 PM that night, our vanguard had already reached the vicinity of Baishi Street and recaptured the key points of Tiancheng Temple, Chan Tou, Mo Ku Mountain, and Wai Jingkou, advancing to Penglai Mulang. In order to cut off the connection between Jiang Hui and ×, our army continued to advance into Xiaogui Jia on the morning of the 24th. There were more than a hundred × soldiers stationed there. Seeing our army rushing in, they retreated immediately. Our soldiers bravely chased them and engaged in fierce fighting with × in the Buqi Bang area. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, our army once rushed to the Metropolis Station, killing many × and setting fire to the baggage stored by × at the station. For a while, the fire was soaring, visible for several miles. After dark, × reinforcements arrived from Jiangmen, more than 500 people. On the morning of the 25th, our × were still fighting fiercely near Qibang. In addition, our guerrillas hiding in the suburbs of Huicheng attacked × every night. On the evening of the 23rd, the × at Huimin Gate were annihilated by our guerrillas, killing more than people. The × army became angry with embarrassment. At 7:00 AM on the 24th, they dispatched eight planes from Jiangmen to fly low along Xinkai Road for reconnaissance, firing machine guns and dropping dozens of bombs wildly in Siqian. Then, they passed over Daze and dropped six or seven bombs at the Daze ferry, sinking six or seven small boats and killing or injuring more than ten Dan families, destroying countless civilian houses. On the evening of the 24th, a large public welfare ship towed several civilian boats from Muzhou back to Public Welfare, without being inspected. The garrison opened fire to stop them. The villagers mistakenly thought that × were coming to commit crimes. The current investigation of Niuwan and other places shows no trace of ×. The defense is peaceful.

Movies and Theater

### Red "Blue" Film and Three Primary Color Films

The Soviet Union's "Woman Warrior" is a color film of red and "blue" primary colors. After its release, the theory world unanimously praised it, but some people raised objections about the praise for color performance. Here, I would like to provide some principles that I have seen in books for reference, but I hope not to "insider" and pour cold water on my sincerity in teaching.

Color has the distinction between light color and paint color. There are different lengths of light waves mixed in the sunlight. The presentation of seven colors is due to the different lengths of light waves. When white light passes through a red film, it appears red. The reason is that only red light waves can pass through the red film, so it appears red. Because equal components of the three light colors red (Red), blue (Blue), and green (Green) mix to form white, the usual red and green are called the three primary colors of light colors. This is different from the three primary colors of paint colors. In terms of light color, equal components of blue and green mix to form cyan (Blue-Green). Therefore, two parts of cyan mixed with one part of red also become white. The red "blue" mentioned here is cyan. We can see that the colors obtained from the three primary colors can also be obtained from the red "blue" two primary colors, but because the matching components are different, it is more troublesome. In fact, red and blue mix to form yellow (Yellow), and red and green mix to form magenta (Magenta). Using yellow and green or magenta and blue as two primary colors can also achieve the same result. The generation of object color is the same as that of paint color. An object that can absorb green light waves and reflect red and blue will appear yellow. If it can absorb red light and reflect blue and green, it will appear magenta. Therefore, for example, when using three primary color lenses to capture a yellow object, the paper only retains a considerable component of shadows on the red and blue sheets, but not on the green sheet. When using red "cover" two primary color lenses to capture a yellow object, both the red sheet and the "blue" sheet (cyan sheet) have shadows, but their components are different. These two kinds of shooting films, when they are mapped back in place, should have the same results in terms of color theory. Here, we can see that in terms of component coordination, two primary colors are more difficult than three primary colors, and in terms of shooting procedures, two primary colors are simpler than three primary colors. In any case, the fact that the Soviet Union shot two primary color films with such achievements this time cannot but be said to be quite successful and worthy of people's admiration.

### Shanghai Cinemas Develop Abnormally

### A Record of the Heroic Killing of ×× by the People of Qingyuan and Conghua

— Ye Naibing

[Central News Agency Battlefield Communication] This reporter would like to report in detail on the facts of the resistance against Japan by the people of Qingyuan and Conghua. Among the people of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, those of Qingyuan and Conghua are the most capable of exerting their power, fulfilling their duties, protecting their hometowns, and creating many moving and heroic historical facts.

Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese troops have followed up by occupying the southern section of Conghua, namely the southwest corner of Liuxi River (locally known as Conghua River), and the southern edge of Huaxian County. This remains the case to this day. However, the power of the Japanese troops has also extended to Qingyuan County in the north. Naturally, the Japanese troops have always wanted to attack the Yuehan Railway since they occupied Guangzhou. If the Japanese troops were to advance north, the Pajiang District of Qingyuan would bear the brunt. Qingyuan is located north of Conghua and Huaxian counties. The Yuehan Railway passes through its east, and the Pajiang District is located in the southeast of the county, precisely on the right side of the railway, about one hundred li from Guangzhou.

The people of Qingyuan are known for being strong and fierce, and they also possess a lot of weapons and artillery. Clan feuds are like national wars, with murder and destruction of villages being commonplace. However, when it comes to the critical moment of resistance against Japan, our people have turned the power of internal strife into attacking the Japanese invaders and defending their homes. As for the people of Conghua, because they are directly trampled upon by the violent Japanese and are also influenced by the news, they are equally brave and participate in the resistance, defending their homes and preventing the Japanese cavalry from trampling on the ancestral tombs of their ancestors.

The First Resistance

In late October last year, after the Japanese troops occupied the area south of Jiekou and Lu in Conghua County (Taipingchang, Shencui), they often appeared in the villages and towns of the Weigan Market area (more than ten li northwest of Conghua City, sixty to seventy li southeast of the Pajiang Estuary) along the Qingcong Highway, plundering property and forcibly seizing grain, pigs, and cattle. Later, they became accustomed to it and even ordered the villagers to bring a certain amount of grain, pigs, and cattle to the Jiekou furnace Japanese camp every day to be transported elsewhere by vehicles. They also declared that if they did not comply, they would set fire to the village and kill without mercy. Initially, the people in the Weigan area were powerless and had no choice but to swallow their anger. Who would have thought that the Japanese beasts would have no conscience and would gradually become even more unscrupulous, attempting to invade Qingyuan territory through Conghua? The people of Qingyuan certainly would not let it go, so they immediately rose up to resist.

On November 16th of last year, more than 70 Japanese soldiers, with two motorized bicycles as vanguards, invaded the area bordering Qingyuan from Conghua. There was a shallow river there. The Qingyuan Self-Defense Forces had already made preparations, ambushing sentries on the north bank of the river. When the Japanese troops reached a considerable distance, they immediately opened fire, killing two Japanese vanguards on the spot and seizing two automatic bicycles. The remaining Japanese troops knew that the people of Qingyuan would resist them and had killed their men, so they hurriedly retreated in disarray. Twelve members of the Self-Defense Forces were the bravest. They took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy all the way to the Weigan Market, more than fifteen li away, before returning. This was the first resistance of the people of Qingyuan. In this battle, we lost four men and wounded two, while the Japanese troops were wounded more than ten and the number of deaths was over twenty.

The Japanese ambition was not dead, and their desire for revenge was urgent. On the 17th and 18th, the Japanese sent threatening letters to the Weigan Market Station saying that they would definitely come to attack Qingyuan soon. I, as someone with no special skills, was not afraid, nor did I believe them. We only prepared for the Japanese invasion, vowing to resist to the death (to be continued)

She became so noble. She made him. "By Jove, Eliza," he exclaimed, "say I wanted to make a lady out of you, and I've done it now." He went up to her, "I like you like this!"

But she did not reply, using the charming and elegant manners he taught her, she walked to the door.

"Goodbye, Professor Higgins," she said crisply.

The laboratory in Wimpole Street sank into darkness. But Higgins' mood was even darker. He was in bitter recollection. He felt that he was really stupid and too selfish. He also felt infinite loneliness in his heart.

He stood up frustrated, turned on the desk lamp, and wanted to do something. He accidentally opened the button of the tape recorder. A harsh and unpleasant voice came from the quiet room: "I washed my face and hands when I came! Really!"

He excitedly turned off the button. But suddenly, at the doorway behind him, there was another beautiful and crisp voice, saying softly:

"I washed my face and hands when I came."

When he turned his head in surprise, he saw Eliza, and he hurriedly rushed to her side and kissed her repeatedly. (The End)

### Today's Jia Shan Charity Soccer Match: South China vs. All-Stars; Hou Rongsheng Joins South China and Will Play Today; Match Starts at 5 PM at Caroline Hill

[Report from This Newspaper] The South China Athletic Association's soccer team, which will travel to Southeast Asia, has changed its departure date to the 30th of this month. As a result, the charity match that was postponed due to rain last Saturday will finally be held today. The soccer connection is renewed, and fans will have a feast for their eyes. At that time, Caroline Hill will surely be full of excitement. This match is a contribution before South China's departure and is also the final chapter of the soccer season.

To advocate for compatriots, South China soccer players have always spared no effort. Now that they are about to travel to Southeast Asia, this practice match is a win-win situation. Furthermore, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the All-Stars team, this charity event will be completed, which is truly meritorious.

Hou Rongsheng has joined the South China team and will travel with the team. Therefore, Hou Rongsheng's name appears in South China's lineup today. The defensive strength will also increase with Hou Rongsheng's presence. However, Hou Rongsheng was originally in the All-Stars' designated lineup. Now that he has switched sides, Li An'na will play out of position as the right inside midfielder. Li An'na occasionally played this position in the Hong Kong-Macau Interport Tournament a month ago and performed well. Playing it again today will likely be another good performance.

Although the All-Stars lineup is not perfectly complete, each player's skills are top-notch. If they can find a cooperative understanding during the match, the whole team will naturally have a wonderful performance. However, with Li An'na and Han Niweilu as inside midfielders, they are ultimately not used to it. Although they may try their best, it will still be difficult to avoid revealing weaknesses. The weakness of the whole team lies in this.

Center-back Nuo'er is a member of the Navy. The name is unfamiliar, but it is expected that he must have something to offer. Furthermore, with Xu Jingcheng and Xia Xian supporting him from the left and right, the midfield line should not be weak. However, the inside midfielders are ultimately unreliable. As the defenders' shield, they will inevitably struggle to look after both the front and the back. If the forward line can fully exert its power, it may reduce their worries about the rear.

South China, on the other hand, has formed a very ideal lineup, as if it were seamless. Although Liu Songsheng is used to being a midfielder, his ball-feeding skills are excellent, and he will be able to handle the responsibility of supplying the forward line. However, since he is responsible for supplying the ball, he must often attack. If he leaves his defensive position slightly vacant and gives others an opening, it will make Ai Rongsheng behind him too busy. However, Rongsheng has just joined the team and will definitely be very diligent. The busier he is, the more he will show his skills.

With Li Huitang as the commander of the forward line, and the assistance of getting into the game, the sharpness of the attack is expected to be beyond what the All-Stars' inside midfielders can withstand. Therefore, South China's victory is expected.

The match location is at Jia Shan, starting at 5:00 PM. Tickets are priced at one dollar, six dimes, and three dimes. The lineups of the two teams are listed below.

### Today's Baseball Game: South China vs. Youpi; Who Can Maintain Their Undefeated Status?

[Report from This Newspaper] No matter what kind of career you engage in, diligence is essential. Look at the Youpi team, which is participating in this year's Open Baseball League. It was originally the North's Body of the unremarkable Volunteer Army. However, because they have been diligently practicing recently, their skills have greatly improved, and the team's overall coordination has become more meticulous. Therefore, since the beginning of the season, they have won both games and have suddenly gained the title of a strong team.

It was not surprising that Youpi defeated the Western Club in the previous game. The most commendable thing, however, was their match against Min Diannu. They controlled the entire game and made the evenly matched Min team lose their composure, winning by a score of nine to four. Because of this victory, they shifted the gaze of the general audience and marked them as the protagonist with the power to contend for the championship in this session.

Today is again the day for Youpi to take to the field, just as they are facing the South China Club, who have not yet dared to show their achievements. Therefore, in order to maintain their unbeaten status, the importance of this game is formed.

South China has only played once before, and they were facing the Western team, which is the weaker of the six teams, so their true strength was not fully demonstrated at that time. However, all the players are experienced veterans, and the team's coordination is also good.

Pitcher Li Zhongzhen is a veteran with skilled techniques and extraordinary methods. However, he is an older man with less stamina. If the weather is a little cooler, he can last up to seven innings. Otherwise, he will feel soft after pitching a maximum of five innings. Therefore, the question of whether South China will succeed or fail today depends on whether Li can support the pitch to the end.

Separating the two sides by talent, South China has more veterans, and its defense is better than its attack; Youpi has more newcomers, and its offense is better than its defense. Therefore, each has its own merits, and it is difficult to distinguish the high and low. Only when the end of the war arrives can we know the victory or defeat.

The game starts at 2:30 PM at the Caroline Hill Navy Stadium. Tickets are only five cents each, but there are not many seats, so to avoid missing out due to being full, you must arrive early. The lineups of the two teams are recorded as follows. (Stadium Grand Duke)

### Philippine Davis Cup Players Win All Matches in Shanghai: ...... Sanchez Defeats Carson ...... Umbon Defeats Li Guofan

[Shanghai News, 22nd] Philippine Davis Cup players, Sanchez and Umbon, passed through Shanghai yesterday afternoon on their way to the United States to participate in the Davis Cup. The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club specially invited them to hold an exhibition match. There were a total of three singles and doubles matches, held at the French Chamber of Commerce hard court. Five to six hundred Chinese and Western spectators watched. As a result, the Philippine players won all three singles and doubles matches. Although the two players do not have particularly profound skills, they are young and strong, and their future achievements are immeasurable. It was particularly difficult for Sanchez to defeat Carson. The performance results are as follows:

(1) Tang Baojia 6-4 Forbes

Cai Guoji 9-7 Cola Sha

(2) Umbon 6-3 6-1 Li Guofan

(3) Sanchez 2-6 6-1 8-6 Carson

(4) Sanchez Umbon 8-6 3-6 6-3 Carson Shi Guiya

Young and Strong, Excellent Skills

The two men are not surprising in appearance. Umbon is especially thin and small like a child. It was thought that he must not be Li Guofan's enemy. Who knew that he was in great physical condition and shot the ball steadily. Li's failure lies in the fact that his physical strength is not as good, and he is not as steady. In the first few games, they were still able to counter each other. After entering, Li was exhausted and completely panicked. He repeatedly touched the net and flew wildly. Umbon was still able to counter the two corners calmly, plus the overhead air pressure. In the first set, after three pairs of three, he fell sharply and the situation changed suddenly. In the second set, Li only scored the second game. In the battle between Shan and Carson, Carson galloped across the field at the beginning, winning 2-6 very easily. In the second set, Carson was already showing signs of fatigue and was not running fast. Probably because the season had just begun. Arguing that Carson was better than Sanchez in art, overhead cut, and slash, Shan was indeed not as good. But in the end, the hoarse exhausted was no match for the youth who was rising like the morning sun.

Carson is Experienced, but His Endurance is Not Good

In the second set, Carson gave up. In the third set, Sanchez became more and more courageous. His forehand counter-punch was indeed a wonderful performance. Carson was already unable to shoot the ball and was barely coping. After 4-2, Carson reluctantly chased to a tie. Sanchez saved the ball in the tenth game, lost the last winning point, and Carson chased again to tie each other by 5 and then took the lead by 6-5, but in the end he could not resist Sanchez's fierce draw and lost three games in a row. In the end, Carson had no intention of fighting in doubles. Shi Guiya's wild ball was seen repeatedly, and there were not many highlights. The two Philippine youths were still full of energy. Sanchez's style is quite similar to Qiu Feihai, with an excellent forehand and a weak backhand. He hasn't shown other strengths yet. The two are at a young age and will be future stars in the East.

### The Post-War Situation of Cotton Mills: Concentrated in Shanghai, with Raw Materials Monopolized; Relying on Imported Cotton for Relief

Following the fall of coastal cities after the war, cotton mills suffered severe damage. Factories refused to cooperate with the [Japanese] side and established new mills in the Shanghai International Settlement. Ten mills, including Xinsheng, have already completed construction and commenced operations. However, due to the [Japanese] monopolization of raw materials, they were forced to order imported cotton for relief. Detailed information is provided below.

Shanghai: A Gathering Place for Cotton Mills

The distribution of China's textile industry concentrated in coastal cities before the war, with Jiangsu province taking the lead due to its long history. This was attributed to its suitable terrain and climate, convenient transportation, active financial sector, and excellent market conditions, making its progress unmatched by other provinces. Out of a total of 148 mills nationwide, Jiangsu province had 88, accounting for 59.5% of the total. Shanghai stood out as the most developed city, leading the nation's cotton mill industry, with 65 mills, accounting for 73.9% of the province's total. Among these, 31 were Chinese-owned, 30 were [Japanese]-owned, and 4 were British-owned. Therefore, it was not only a gathering place for Chinese cotton mills but also a center for foreign cotton mills.

[Japanese] Forces Take Over Mills in War Zones

Following the fall of coastal cities after the war, most of the cotton mills in the war zones were destroyed by artillery fire. Even those that survived had incomplete internal machinery. At the same time, the [Japanese] side attempted to take over by force, making any recovery impossible. However, Zhenhua Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, with 13,928 spindles, was leased to Heji through the efforts of You Jusun of the "Citizens' Association" and was allowed to continue production as usual with [Japanese] approval. Factories within the war zones that were taken over and put back into operation by the [Japanese] side included Shenxin and Shui'an mills. However, these had no connection to the original factories and were entirely due to the [Japanese] side's illegal takeover and operation. Some of these factories had foreign interests, which the [Japanese] side disregarded despite ineffective negotiations.

Ten New Mills Commence Operations in the International Settlement

All cotton mills within the occupied areas resolutely refused to cooperate with the [Japanese] side, willing to sacrifice business and instead establish new mills in the Shanghai International Settlement. However, most were established under the names of foreign merchants, such as British and American companies. According to a survey conducted by a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the following have commenced operations: (1) Xinhe with 25,000 spindles, (2) Xieji with 2,600 spindles, (3) Anda with 15,000 spindles, (4) Taifeng with 15,000 spindles, (5) Xinsheng with 16,000 spindles, (6) Qixing with 6,000 spindles, (7) Rongfeng with 15,000 spindles, (8) Zhongfang with 20,000 spindles, (9) Defeng with 8,300 spindles, and (10) Baofeng with 10,000 spindles. Among these, Xinsheng and Xieji are entirely Chinese-owned.

Existing Mills in Operation: Spindle Count

The existing factories in the Shanghai International Settlement that were in operation before the war, with their spindle counts, are as follows: (1) Shenxin Second Textile Mill with 56,000 spindles, (2) Shenxin Ninth Textile Mill with 89,000 spindles, (3) Xinyu First Mill with 25,000 spindles, (4) Xinyu Second Mill with 24,000 spindles, (5) Hongzhang with 24,000 spindles, (6) Yongan Third Mill with 63,000 spindles, (7) Datong Cotton Mill with 4,700 spindles, (8) Tongyi Textile Mill with 47,000 spindles, (9) Qinfeng Textile Mill with 4,300 spindles, and (10) Chongxin Textile Mill with 34,000 spindles. Chongxin and Tongyi are registered under British companies, and Shenxin Second Mill is managed by an American enterprise.

[Japanese]-Owned Mills in Shanghai

The [Japanese]-owned mills in Shanghai that are already in operation include: (1) Rihua Textile Mill Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh, with a total of 174,816 spindles and 42,296 doubling spindles, (2) Naigaiwata Cotton Mill Company First to Ninth, with a total of 280,536 spindles, 111,880 doubling spindles, and 3,800 looms, (3) Shanghai Spinning Company First, Second, and Third, with a total of 119,024 spindles, 23,320 doubling spindles, and 2,304 looms, (4) Tongxing Textile Company with 97,000 spindles, 30,140 doubling spindles, and 1,412 looms, (5) Gongda, Donghua, Youkang, and Shenyu companies with a total of 441,940 spindles, 8,200 doubling spindles, and 7,000 looms.

British Jardine, Lun Chang Factories

The existing British-owned factories in Shanghai have now fully resumed operations: (1) Jardine Textile Corporation, Jardine Public Welfare Yangshupu with 40,976 spindles and 2,135 looms, (2) Lun Chang Textile Dyeing and Printing Co., Ltd. with 3,640 spindles and 1,130 looms. Among the British-owned spinning factories, only Public Welfare produces yarn, but its yarn production is insufficient for the weaving needs of the other three factories, requiring the purchase of yarn from Chinese and [Japanese] mills. As for Lun Chang Textile Company, it is reported to have installed 44,000 spindles and is making every effort to expand to implement a policy of self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-dyeing. Currently, British yarn circulating on the market is produced by Chongxin, Tongyi, and newly established mills such as Xinhe and Anda.

Monopolization of Raw Materials, Ordering Imported Cotton

Japan is using all its strength to collect cotton from occupied areas in China and transport it to Japan as raw materials for industrial and military supplies. As a result, the quantity of cotton exported to Japan has increased sharply. Last year, the value of cotton exports was 10,100,003,224 national currency units. In the first quarter of this year, the value of cotton exports was 3,527,021 national currency units. Shanghai cotton mills are facing a shortage of raw materials due to the [Japanese] monopoly of cotton, forcing them to order imported cotton from places like Egypt, the United States, and Brazil for relief. Last year, the total value of cotton imports was 12,735,044 national currency units. In the first quarter of this year, cotton imports increased to 26,579,113 national currency units.

[Japanese] Attempt to Monopolize the Yarn Industry

Due to the surge in newly established cotton mills in Shanghai after the war, it remains a gathering place for Chinese and foreign cotton mills. Increases in yarn prices are based on the Shanghai market as the standard. The Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange is facing difficult circumstances and has no hope of resuming trading. However, the [Japanese] side has organized a cotton exchange at the old site of the precious metals exchange on Second Avenue, with plans to open on July 1st. As for yarn sales, the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and North China provinces are monopolized by [Japanese] yarn, and Chinese yarn is almost non-existent. The sales areas for Chinese yarn are the southwest provinces and non-occupied areas. Even yarn sales in Shanghai are being seized by [Japanese] yarn because [Japanese] yarn prices are lower than Chinese yarn prices.

### Country Living in Shatin

— Xitang

That small, powder-blue building at the foot of To Fung Shan was once my home, and it will forever linger in my dreamlike memories of Hong Kong.

The [Japanese]'s massacre forced me to leave my home and suffer the hardships of displacement. However, in Shatin, I found rest.

Shatin has clear, blue skies, lush green mountains, majestic peaks, azure seas, clear sandy streams, dense green trees, strong, resilient pines, elegant bamboo, and charming wildflowers. The scenery is beautiful, peaceful, and quiet, like a poem, a dream, a painting. I especially love the mountain of Han Mu and the turbulent sea. When the wind rises, I can hear the mountain breeze, the sea breeze, the waves, and the pine groves, all joining in a solemn and magnificent symphony.

Morning, noon, evening, and night, the colors are different, and what unfolds before my eyes is not a static picture but a constantly changing kaleidoscope. As the sun rises and sets, the moon waxes and wanes, the clouds paint myriad colors, and the sea changes in an instant.

The most magical and magnificent scenes are at dawn and dusk. At dawn, the mountains, the hills, the green fields, the shores, are shrouded in a misty morning fog. The morning mist is like a soft, shimmering curtain, or a light, sparse pearl veil. Everything shrouded within is hazy and indistinct, appearing and disappearing. This scene is like an ancient beauty from a foreign land wearing a veil. Her charm and allure inspire admiration and longing, yet she remains unattainable.

At dusk, the red sun sets in the west, the oblique rays reflect, and the sky is filled with colorful clouds, dazzling and vibrant. You feel as if you are seeing a rainbow dress or a tapestry embroidered with a hundred flowers. Sometimes I seem to see the handsome and dignified sun god Apollo driving his powerful, snow-white steeds, speeding home. The sea also reflects these colors, transforming into another enchanting realm. I then believe that there is indeed a crystal palace decorated with coral and jade trees beneath the sea. I seem to hear the celestial music of the sea playing in unison and faintly see the sea goddess gracefully walking on the waves. I look forward to the appearance of a mermaid, and I even hope to hear the enchanting and captivating voice of the Siren coming from the sea.

As for the mountain scenery at dusk, the solemn and silent mountains are like monks. At this moment, they also become lively. The night envelops them, and the setting sun also reflects on them, so these mountains are no longer just monotonous green or dark green. They are sometimes crimson, sometimes lavender, sometimes turning blue, or sometimes slightly black, and gradually deepening to a dark black.

These majestic, magnificent, and magical scenes can only be painted by the glory of the Creator and cannot be depicted by ordinary people. I can only be amazed, focused, and joyfully appreciate the greatness of creation!

Sometimes I walk up To Fung Shan, where there is a grassy slope like velvet. I like to watch the sunset there, admire the dawn colors of the sea and mountains. I especially like to lie on the grass, watching the sky slowly darken, watching all the colors gradually fade, listening to all the sounds slowly disappear. If it is a moonlit night, when everything on the ground turns dark, the moonlight shines brightly, the sky is like jade, and the clouds are as white as snow, then I feel ethereal, as if I want to "ascend to heaven."

If it is a starry night, when everything on the ground turns dark, you can see countless stars twinkling in the quiet sky. Because I am high on the mountain, the sky seems particularly low, as if it is tightly covering the mountain. Thus, the distance between me and the sky is so close that I can reach out and touch the stars, and I seem to hear the stars whispering. Although the night is cold, I feel like I am wrapped in a soft cloud gauze. In this way, in the silence and in the embrace of the mountains, I become one with nature.

Although I cannot help but feel sad and angry when I think of my home, I never feel like I have left my country or become depressed and dejected. Because my home is not far away, if I want to, I can get home in three hours. Moreover, there are three express trains every day, each bringing news from Guangzhou. When I see visitors from Guangzhou on the train, I feel comforted and friendly because they have safely escaped the danger.

The impermanence of life and the sudden changes in the world sometimes stir up light sorrow, but the dreamlike mist and the beautiful scenery are enough to cleanse away worldly thoughts and worries, giving people a transcendent and detached sadness.

However, I do not forget the smoke and flames of war in my motherland. In the early morning, when I hear a few bars of the Soviet Union's marching music, I feel as if I am experiencing the battle calls of our front lines. When I see the lines of British soldiers marching in front of my building and see their frequent military movements, I think of the busy activities of our brave soldiers on the front lines. Or, at night, when I see the searchlight exercises of To Fung Shan's anti-aircraft defenses and see the enemy planes in the dark being illuminated by searchlights like demons that cannot escape, I feel a renewed sense of excitement, and my longing for my motherland deepens.

Every time when the night is quiet and the waves crash against the shore, in the symphony of the sad sea breeze and mountain breeze, I take out my stand and stand before it, facing the benevolent sky, facing the understanding stars, facing the quiet mountains, facing the solemn sea, and sincerely pray for my motherland!

### Satisfied

— By Fory the

I hope you are happy, Mr. Chamberlain, Franco, Hitler, and Mussolini have formed a gang. The cannons of fascism, which you painstakingly supplied, are now practicing in Gibraltar. At the same time, the cries of Spain, which once appealed to you for justice, have subsided in the roaring whirlwind of propaganda.

You are also happy, Mr. Daladier! To break Franco at the axis is a dream, you must know.

The masses should be happy, children of the British Empire! There is no need to worry about the death and destruction of a loyal and helpless nation. Franco can be bought with imperial money, okay. I hope that the dying struggles of Catalonia and the cries of the children of Barcelona have not disturbed the respectful thoughts of the imperial people.

Are you satisfied? Honorable members of parliament! You always say that Spain is a communist country, deservedly unable to get help.

You must be satisfied, isolationist sirs! You put on the cloak of neutrality laws—helping the aggressor, strangling democratic forces.

Furthermore, all intelligent and kind gentlemen! You think the Spanish war is just "a domestic squabble," a family quarrel should be more fun, yes, one million Spaniards died for you, and another fascist country was born in Europe.

Can you hear the ghostly, piercing cries?

This is the cry of the nation sacrificed for democracy, sold out by the people who shout democracy, who bound their hands and helped their enemies.

So many orphans are wandering to every corner of the world.

So many innocent refugees are living in France.

Can you hear the tragic cries of the Spanish people? They fought for democracy and died without help.

I hope:

You will never fear those who are next to you in Spain:

The Spanish monster created by the help of your countries is very satisfying;

In the future struggle between democracy and fascism, you remember Spain!

May you always be happy! (Translated by Bao De)

### My Memories

— Yu Saifu

I love the Yangtze River.

In my childhood, on the Yangtze River's current, a steamboat carried me to various ports.

My father's rough voice—

He was teaching me, and pointing at the splashing waves and the playful boatmen.

He said: "Live like this!"—

How white are the waves on the Yangtze River. The green groves, mountains, and damp villages on both banks…

But there were wrinkles on my father's old face, some shadows of hatred. He was no longer young and strong. His spirit was only sinking into the abyss of suffering.

The ship's engines roared endlessly, day and night. Our Yangtze River was in turmoil.

Last year, on the banks of the Yangtze River, we saw [Japanese] warships spewing thick, black, bloody smoke, sailing without any regard.

Last year, on the banks of the Yangtze River, we saw [Japanese] warships sunk by our planes. That was a heroic act under the starry night.

We heard the noisy sounds on the warships. We saw the warships, emitting smoke…

Last year, on the banks of the Yangtze River, I was no longer empty-handed. In our hands, we tightly gripped weapons.

And my old father? His rough voice:

"Live like this!"

This voice, passed through the lonely villages, and at night, the waves of the Yangtze River roared with an angry sound.

"Why is it so restless?" a young comrade asked me.

Looking at the milky-white moon in the sky, I said:

"It is not restless. It wants to rise up in resistance, just like us… because it is Chinese."

We did not continue the conversation.

My old father no longer accompanies me on my wanderings. As for him? I do not know his whereabouts. He will be at ease because he understands how to "live like this."

The waves of planes and the steel boatmen…

How can we forget? Our beautiful Yangtze River is now being trampled upon by the [Japanese].

### On the Way Home (Part 1)

— Wang Li

Having shaken hands with my dear comrades, dear brothers, I changed into civilian clothes and, with an excited heart, set out on the road from the guerrilla area to the occupied area.

Carrying a small bundle on my back, I walked silently through the rural fields. Before me, the morning sun cast a dazzling light.

Far away on the side where the sun rose, there was my hometown, which had already fallen, with my father and younger brother. Straining my eyes to look at that horizon, a heart that had been aching for so long seemed to be tightly gripped by a powerful hand. My steps quickened on the road, which was still wet with night dew.

Hometown! Father! Brother!

In the blink of an eye, I had been separated from them for over a year! In the year or so of separation, we had lost contact.

—In this year or so, was my occupied hometown safe? During this year or so, were my father and younger brother still alive?

This longing, which had been lingering in my heart for so long, was now urgently awakened.

Confused thoughts dominated my entire mind. My legs seemed to be walking at someone else's command. A small stone tripped my foot, and I finally woke up.

I turned back to look at the side where my comrades, brothers, and heroic sons and daughters of my country were. I felt an infinite reluctance to part. I also looked at the three peaks of Maoshan in front of the blue sky. Thin, light clouds were floating above the peaks.

—Maoshan! Goodbye! Goodbye! Maoshan—I whispered to myself and nodded to it silently.

Then I turned back to face the dazzling sun and strode forward.

In the evening, I arrived at a village and rested my tired feet at a farmer's house, spending the night there.

In the morning, I carried my small bundle on my back and continued my journey. But when I reached about one-third of a mile away from the highway, several gunshots suddenly rang out in front of me, and I had to stop. Then, the sound of rifles and machine guns burst out in succession. (To be continued)

### An Admonition to Literary Youths with Old Hobbies

— Shangqing

It has long been said that although China lags behind in science in the modern world, resulting in a material civilization that falls behind others, its philosophy and literature possess unique strengths, surpassing all countries in spiritual civilization. Therefore, scholars of national essence stubbornly cling to many thread-bound fragments, refusing to let go, regarding them as secret treasures within their pillows, appreciating them, studying them, imitating them endlessly, and also desperately promoting them, urging younger generations to follow their path, everyone to appreciate, to study, to imitate. The majority of middle school Chinese language teachers inevitably do this, and almost all university Chinese language professors are like this. Let us carefully consider, is this really right?

Whether our philosophy and literature surpass those of all other countries is too big a question to discuss now. Even if our philosophy and literature do possess unique strengths, should all young students appreciate, study, and imitate them? I think anyone who knows what a country, especially our country now, needs would not say yes. Of course, for young people who have a special fondness for and talent in this kind of philosophy and literature, they may appreciate, study, and imitate it, but it is definitely not something everyone should do.

Now, we don't have time to talk about philosophy, so let's talk about literature. I only see many literary youths with this hobby, they like to write classical Chinese, and the more incomprehensible it is, the more they want to write, their purpose is not to learn, but to show off, to show that they have knowledge. Even when they can write fluently, they still write regardless of time, place, or need. They like to compose poetry, seven-character and five-character verses, with alternating tones. They don't care whether the poetry is good or not, they just claim to be refined. They also like to use literary allusions in their speech, saying "however," "therefore," "zhi," "hu," "zhe," "ye," regardless of whether it's appropriate, always inserting a few into every sentence to show that they are authentic literati. Worse still, they still cannot shake off the idea of talented scholars and beautiful women, writing flowery love letters and romances, or filling pages with ornate and frivolous poems and lyrics. At school, they embrace the "dogmatic" approach to medicine. In society, they adopt a procrastinating attitude towards work. In their family life, they consider themselves noble for not engaging in household production. If anyone says they shouldn't be like this, they will be given a disdainful look and denounced as vulgar. If they have family wealth, they will surely squander it. If they don't have family wealth, they will surely be in dire straits. Yet they do not regret it, nor do they change. They always use the saying "a gentleman endures poverty" and "poets excel in poverty" to console themselves.

Seeing such young people, I feel pained, so I want to use my sincere wishes to tell them a few words:

In this era, especially in China now, it is best if you do not indulge in literature, because literature is not the most urgent necessity, especially do not indulge in old literature, because most of what is in literature is just: discouraging words, decadent words, empty dreams, illusions, meaningless loyalty, pretentiousness, and groaning without illness... These are opium, alcohol, any harmful intoxicants.

If you already know the harm of this kind of old literature, but cannot quit it for a while, then I advise you to just appreciate it, and use it as entertainment in your spare time. But do not go further and engage in research. If you have the spirit of research, I would rather you study subjects that are of practical use to modern times, especially to our country, rather than studying this old literature.

To take a further step back, if you do have a true fondness for this kind of old literature, and indeed have a special talent for it, and you must engage in research, then go ahead and research it. It is not bad to research and find some clues and some practical results, but you must never engage in imitation. Because even if the imitation is good, it is just a fake antique, and if it is not good, it is even more of a joke. And eight or nine times out of ten, the imitation is not good, so why bother to do something futile and unnecessary?

Finally, if you are already addicted to imitating this kind of old literature, I still advise you to imitate as little as possible. This kind of thing is fundamentally useless, and it is really only good for covering jars, and it inevitably has a bad influence on others. Don't adopt the demeanor of old-fashioned literati just because you are good at imitating this kind of thing. In the past, courtesans would scold scholars as being only worth a few coins per pound. Now, I'm afraid they are not only worthless, but people will cover their noses and walk past you when they see your affected air! If your writing skills are already very solid, it is better to write more new-style creations that are relevant to the times.

What I am saying is indeed untimely, and perhaps some people will scold me for not understanding old literature and therefore making superficial remarks to insult old literature. I will not defend myself. I am willing to accept such scolding. But what I truly feel is dangerous, and I must speak out. I do not want to see good young people get on the wrong train and travel back thousands of years, wasting their lives and ruining the important affairs of the country. I hope that every one of them can embark on the grand road of modernization!

At the same time, I also hope that the majority of middle school Chinese language teachers and almost all university Chinese language professors will not excessively promote this kind of old literature, and will clearly distinguish between appreciation, research, and imitation. Even if they do promote it, they should do so with the aim of being practically useful to both themselves and the country.
