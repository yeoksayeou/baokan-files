### War of Resistance, Nation-Building, and Democratic Politics

One of the crucial conditions for the final victory and success of the great undertaking of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building is the implementation of democratic politics under centralized leadership, thereby strengthening the connection between the government and the people and maximizing the capabilities of the anti-Japanese regime. This was declared in the manifesto of the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress, explicitly stipulated in the Outline for the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, and subsequently elaborated and encouraged throughout the nation by the supreme leader based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. The establishment of the National Political Council was precisely based on the needs of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, opening an unprecedented glorious page in China's history of civil governance.

Democracy is, in essence, equality. In this worldwide struggle against fascism and aggression, what is sought is world peace and democracy. The governments or peoples of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France are fighting to defend democracy and peace, making the defense of democratic politics the primary task at hand. The reason our country is suffering so much from the bombardment of artillery fire and the trampling of iron hooves today is entirely due to the aggression of the Japanese fascists. Therefore, our country's War of Resistance for national independence and freedom is also a global struggle against fascism and aggression, and at the same time, a righteous war to defend democracy and peace. Our country's united War of Resistance is inextricably linked to the global struggle against fascist aggression, demonstrating the necessity of developing democratic politics in China today in terms of international significance.

At the same time, there is something else we cannot ignore: if we want to achieve the final victory and success of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, we must mobilize all the people of the entire Chinese nation. This is a fact known to all and is also the current urgent task of the central authorities and various parties striving to realize it. But how can we concentrate the dynamic forces of the entire nation on the cause of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building? The recent General Mobilization of National Spiritual Strength is one of the main methods, and the realization of democratic politics during the War of Resistance, in order to promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, to stimulate the people's initiative, creativity, and enthusiasm, and to dedicate all their strength to serve the cause of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, is the most urgent task at hand. Furthermore, the gradual realization of wartime democratic politics and the resulting appropriate improvement of all political institutions will lay the foundation for the future construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, and its great significance for the establishment of new anti-Japanese people's regimes in the occupied areas is even more evident. This demonstrates the necessity of developing democratic politics in China today in terms of domestic significance.

As China's full-scale War of Resistance enters its second stage, based on the experience and lessons learned from twenty months of heroic and bloody battles, and in response to the recent developments and trends in the international situation, promoting the wartime democratic political movement has become the most pressing task for the entire nation. The great achievements of the three sessions of the National Political Council have made the entire nation feel the urgent need to promote democratic politics and serve the War of Resistance and Nation-Building movement, as well as its optimistic prospects, and the rapid establishment of local representative bodies has become a unanimous demand of the country. The government has therefore made a decision to establish provincial, municipal, and county councils by April 1st. We express our infinite congratulations and expectations on behalf of the people of the country for the government's appropriate decision based on the domestic and international situation and the urgent needs of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. Based on our humble opinion, we hope that the provincial, municipal, and county councils will consider the following points:

As the War of Resistance moves towards a new stage, China is gradually forming a balanced stalemate. The key to our country's ability to overcome and achieve results lies in the mobilization of national strength, and the mobilization of national strength begins with the progress of local politics and the development of democratic forces. This is the first reason why the provincial, municipal, and county councils must be convened as soon as possible and universally. The National Political Council is the only representative body that has emerged to meet the new needs of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. For more than a year, it has made great contributions to strengthening the connection between the government and the people, laying and consolidating the foundation of civil governance, and assisting in the great undertakings of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. This is the second reason why the provincial, municipal, and county councils must also promote this spirit of the National Political Council. Our country's War of Resistance and Nation-Building today is to strive for independence, freedom, and happiness for the entire Chinese nation, and to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People with equal international, political, and economic status. It can be said to be a struggle to realize democratic politics. In this struggle, the concentration of popular strength is a major prerequisite, and the development of public opinion is an even more important prerequisite for concentrating popular strength. This is the third reason why the provincial and municipal councils must become de facto local representative bodies. Although everyone knows the importance of developing public opinion and concentrating popular strength, relying solely on the government's top-down advocacy seems insufficient to meet the needs of the current situation. Therefore, the provincial, municipal, and county councils especially rely on the assistance of all ethnic groups and parties in the country, the government, and the enthusiastic participation of people from all walks of life. This is the fourth reason.

The international struggle situation is now extremely dangerous, and the success of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building is still far away. All our compatriots who seek to save the world, the country, and themselves should strive forward and dedicate their efforts! This is the sincere hope we extend to all provincial, municipal, and county councils.

### Today! East and West Two Glorious and Heroic Festivals

Commemorating the Beijing Massacre and the Paris Commune

March is a season of passionate and great revolutions.

March 18th is an even greater festival for the people's revolution in the East and the West.

In the East, in Beiping (then called Beijing) in our China, thirteen years ago today, the "Tiananmen Great Massacre" occurred.

In the West, in France, sixty-seven years ago today (1871), the "Paris Commune," the first revolutionary regime of the working masses in history, was established.

Whether it is the "Tiananmen Massacre" in the East or the "Paris Commune" in the West, the glorious and heroic historical traces they left behind are of great significance to the Chinese compatriots who are fighting for national freedom and happiness, and to the anti-fascist and anti-aggression warriors of all countries who are fighting for world peace and justice. Moreover, this leaves us with very profound lessons.

(I) The East's [March 18th]

March, this extraordinary month most worthy of commemoration in the history of mankind's struggle for freedom, thirteen years ago (1916) today (March 18th), Beijing students and the masses held a National Assembly, opposing the Japanese army's bombardment of the Dagu Forts and the Eight-Nation Alliance's ultimatum to our country, held a demonstration, and petitioned Duan Qirui's government. Unexpectedly, as soon as the crowd arrived in front of the Executive Yuan, they were shot at by the guards, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. From that day on, the northern masses issued revolutionary roars, responding to our southern revolutionary actions, and laying the foundation for the success of the Northern Expedition.

(I) The Political Background of the Beijing Massacre

After the "May Thirtieth Movement" in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), Japanese × imperialism intensified its steps in invading China, especially suppressing our people's revolutionary movement, not hesitating to take direct action. At that time, the Feng Clique warlords completely suppressed the people's anti-× and anti-feudal movements under the instructions of ××ism, while the broad masses also widely launched movements against the Feng Clique warlords. The Zhili-Feng War broke out, and Sun Chuanfang, Wu Peifu, and others took advantage of the people, especially the students', anti-Feng upsurge to quickly defeat the Feng army in Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou. Under the leadership of Zhang Zuolin, the Feng army sent Zhang Xueliang and Yu Songling to enter the pass to assist in the battle. However, under the development of the revolutionary movement, some military personnel were also affected, and on October 1, 1925 (the fourteenth year of the Republic of China), Guo Songling inclined towards revolution, staged a mutiny in Luanzhou, led his army out of the pass, occupied Jinzhou with irresistible force, and advanced towards Shenyang. Japanese ××ism directly helped its tool, the Feng Clique warlords, send 2,500 troops to occupy the Fengtian Arsenal and the powder magazine, using Japanese troops disguised as Feng troops to directly attack Guo Songling's army, and also used 80 aircraft to bomb Guo's army. Guo's army was finally defeated miserably on December 25, and Guo was also captured and murdered.

After Japanese ××ism dispatched troops to Manchuria and defeated Guo Songling's army, which had anti-Japanese and revolutionary tendencies, it further called for the alliance of Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu, and assisted Wu with huge sums of money, and supplied Zhang Zongchang and others with military weapons, bullets, and military personnel, attempting to fundamentally eliminate the National Army, which was close to the people's revolution. When the First National Army repeatedly defeated the Zhili-Shandong Allied Army, the Japanese ×× fleet suddenly bombarded the Dagu Forts, colluding with the Feng fleet to seize Tianjin, in order to support Zhang Zongchang and Li Jinglin, and used the ultimatum of the Eight-Nation Alliance to carry out intimidation.

At this time, the broad masses of our country, with male and female students as the vanguard, bravely and resolutely carried out a united resistance and counterattack against ××ists. We opposed the Japanese army's invasion of the three northeastern provinces and the alliance of the Feng-Zhili warlords, and our voices opposing Zhang and Wu's demonstrations and urging the National Government to launch the Northern Expedition spread throughout the country. Thus, the struggle between revolutionary and reactionary forces unfolded widely and cruelly, and the great massacre at Da'anmen in Beijing occurred at this time.

(II) The Course of the Beijing Massacre

At that time in Beijing, ever since the "May Thirtieth Movement" occurred, the emotions of revolutionary and reactionary forces' struggle surged higher and higher every day. The students and citizens there had repeatedly clashed with local military police in bloody incidents to commemorate "May Seventh," to oppose the Customs Conference, and to implement the revolution in the capital. On March 18, 1926, tens of thousands of students, workers, and citizens in Beijing gathered, vehemently opposing the Japanese warship bombardment of Dagu, opposing the ministers'团's "ultimatum," and held a National Assembly at Tiananmen. After the meeting, they held a demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "Down with ××ism," "×× Japanese ××ism," "Down with the traitor Duan ××," and "Expel the ministers of the Eight Nations." They also petitioned the State Council of Duan Qirui's government. However, Duan ××, Zhang ×, and ××, the leaders of the traitorous government at the time, hated the people's movement to save themselves and the country. In order to carry out a 50 million loan, they executed the instructions of the ministers'团 of the Eight Nations, especially Japanese ××, and ordered the shooting of the masses—under the fire of more than ten minutes, 26 people died on the spot, more than 200 were seriously injured, and more than 2,000 died in hospitals due to injuries. This was the tragic historical event of the "March 18th" massacre in which Japanese ××ism suppressed the people's revolutionary movement through the traitorous government of Duan ××. From then on, under the instructions of ××ism and the joint attack of the Feng-Zhili armies, the National Army was forced to retreat to Inner Mongolia and the Northwest, and the revolutionary movement in the North temporarily showed a considerable state of decline. Zhang and Wu met in Beijing, the reactionary forces became rampant again, actively attacked the people's revolutionary forces, and actively created darkness and terror. Under the leadership of ××ism, especially Japanese ××ism, these reactionary elements organized the "Anti-Red League," etc., to carry out so-called "anti-communist" work, using the names of "anti-red" and "anti-communist" to carry out counter-revolutionary and traitorous activities.

(III) The Experience and Lessons of the Beijing Massacre

From the facts of the "March 18th" Beijing Massacre, it can be known that although it was the traitorous and calamitous government in power at the time that directly shot and killed the masses, it was ××ism, especially Japanese ××, that caused and promoted this incident. It tried its best to help the reactionary forces, came forward to attack the revolutionary forces at the time, and promoted the so-called government in power at the time to massacre the people, carrying out the poisonous strategy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." Therefore, we should pay more attention to the fact that: First, Japanese ×× is still using old and new, overt and covert, executioners of the masses to organize puppet governments and traitor governments. The key figures in all traitor governments today were either openly or secretly accomplices in the slaughter of the Chinese people by the Japanese ××ists during the "March 18th" incident. Our war of resistance today is not only settling the blood debts since the "September 18th" or "July 7th" incidents, but also settling the blood debts accumulated in history. We must move forward today, following the blood path of the martyrs of "March 18th," and we must also be able to accomplish their unfulfilled ambitions!

Second, although the people's revolutionary movement at the time of "March 18th" was so loyal, brave, and heroic, it was ultimately because the united front on the revolutionary side was not united firmly and organized strictly. On the one hand, it failed to mobilize workers, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie more widely, and failed to win over friendly forces from the governments and military police of the reactionary warlords; on the other hand, the revolutionary center was still in the South at that time, and the revolutionary struggles of the people in the North and the South had not yet achieved close connection. These painful experiences should teach us that, as the War of Resistance turns to its second stage, we must strengthen the consolidation of national unity, expand the national united front, develop the leading political party of the War of Resistance of all ethnic groups, and at the same time pay attention to winning more friendly forces internationally and even in the × camp!

Third, at the time of "March 18th," the × people's united front occupied a considerable advantage. Japanese ××ism, on the one hand, used our country's reactionary forces and traitor government, and on the other hand, also allied with ××ist powers, such as the Eight-Nation Alliance issuing an ultimatum to us. Today, as the War of Resistance turns to its second stage and the difficulties of the × people are becoming more and more serious, the × people will certainly not relax the implementation of their consistent conspiracies. Therefore, we should pay more attention today to: (1) Pointing out the serious situation of the joint attack on China and the promotion of the world war by the three aggressive countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy. (2) Pointing out the conspiracy of the Japanese, German, and Italian aggressive groups to attack democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, and calling on democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, France, and the United States to strengthen the union of the Soviet Union to aid China and all invaded ethnic groups in order to protect their legitimate rights, status, and world peace. (3) Exposing the Japanese ××'s intensification of the use of Han traitors and accomplices who have overtly or covertly massacred the people in the past, using the slogans of "anti-communism" and "peace" in an attempt to alienate our unity, undermine our war of resistance, and achieve their conspiracy to quickly conquer China. We must also intensify the elimination of all remarks and actions that openly and latently violate the propositions of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, such as "anti-communism," "pro-peace," "repudiation of Europe and the United States," and the "one-day Manchuria-Mongolia group."

(II) The West's [March 18th]

Sixty-seven years ago today, March 18, 1871, the glorious and great anniversary of the establishment of the "Paris Commune" by the working people of France, is of great significance not only to human beings seeking freedom in all countries of the world, but also to our compatriots who are bravely resisting the war.

(I) The Success and Failure of the [Paris Commune]

In 1870, in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor of Germany, defeated France, and the French Emperor Napoleon III was captured. The Prussian King ascended the throne of Greater Germany in the Palace of Versailles outside Paris.

Because the French bourgeois government could not resist the irresistible attack of the enemy army, and feared that continuing the war of resistance would lead to victory that "must be obtained by the domestic revolutionary workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois masses," based on this erroneous estimate, it signed a treaty of national betrayal and humiliation with Prussia. At the same time, it carried out a cruel and bloody suppression of the resistance of the workers and citizens. In this way, the revolutionary anger of the masses was finally ignited.

The working people of Paris, with the workers as the vanguard, united in the midst of thousands of hardships and in the midst of internal and external double iron-blooded oppression, in order not to be slaves of a subjugated country, in order to fight for the independence and freedom of the French nation, and in order to oppose the actions of some people at that time who wavered, compromised, and sold out the interests of the nation and the country, and implemented "holding Qian Ge to defend the country." March 18 (1871) was the day they established the "Paris Commune" to oppose aggression, oppose compromise, resist to the end, and seek independence, freedom, and happiness.

On March 18, the working people of Paris, under the leadership of the workers, held a heroic armed resistance with the soldiers of the National Guard, and joined hands with the government army to overthrow the regime of the aristocratic bourgeois who compromised with × and sold out the nation. The high-ranking officials of the surrendered government fled to Versailles, which had become the headquarters of the × people, and the revolutionary masses established the "Paris Commune."

The "Paris Commune" was the first regime of the hard-working masses in the history of the world. Lenin repeatedly criticized the labor regime "Paris Commune," which was the first to appear in the world and is still being learned by the hard-working masses of all countries, in lengthy articles, saying: When the mass movement of the proletariat broke out, although this movement was a failure, short-lived, and obviously weak, Marx began to study what political form this movement had discovered. The "Commune" is the form that the proletarian revolution "finally discovered," and under this form, the economic liberation of labor can be realized. The "Commune" is the first attempt by the proletariat ×××× to break the state machine of the ×× class, and the political form that was "finally discovered," and this political form can and must be used to replace the destroyed state machine. Lenin went on to say that "the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, in different environments and under different conditions, continued the cause of the 'Paris Commune,' and proved the correctness of Marx's brilliant historical analysis."

However, the "Paris Commune" regime was submerged in a bloody mess because it did not thoroughly attack the × people, did not establish a solid united front, and the counter-revolutionaries and traitors of France were able to carry out a large-scale counter-offensive with the help of Prussia, resulting in the "Paris Commune" being submerged in a bloody mess and ending its life of more than two months; countless freedom-seeking people and workers suffered cruel massacres, until the water of the Seine River was stained red!

(II) The Experience and Lessons of the [Paris Commune]

Although the Western "March 18th," the revolution of the "Paris Commune," had a short life of only more than two months, it became a model for the struggle of human beings seeking freedom all over the world. Lenin used the following words to describe the revolutionary teacher Marx's emphasis on the "Paris Commune." "Marx was not only overjoyed by the heroic spirit of the 'soaring' members of the 'Paris Commune,' but he also believed that this mass revolutionary movement (although it did not achieve its goal) was a historical experience of great significance, a considerable advance in the world ×××× revolution, and a practical step mule that was more important than hundreds of programs and arguments. To analyze this experience, to draw strategic lessons from this experience, and to re-examine one's own theory on the basis of this experience, these are the tasks that Marx himself identified."

What is the "historical experience of great significance" that the "Paris Commune" left us? The first is that it proved to us with the fact of overthrowing the regime that compromised and sold out the nation halfway that the united resistance force of the workers and masses and the hard-working masses is invincible. All struggles of the oppressed against the oppressors must have the direct and active participation of the hard-working masses in order to finally succeed.

The second, the "Paris Commune" pointed out to us the only path to victory in the revolutionary struggle, "A true revolution of the masses is for the majority of the masses, and the deepest social stratum of the masses under various oppressions and exploitations, to stand up independently, and they use their own demands and their own attempts to build a new society on the ruins of the destroyed old society according to their own interests, and affect half the journey of the revolution."

Third, it also used the establishment of the "Paris Commune," the regime of the hard-working masses, to illustrate to us that the hard-working masses should destroy and smash the "ready-made state machine—and not only be limited to simply seizing this machine.

Fourth, what should be used to replace the broken state apparatus? The "Paris Commune" also answered us with the facts of the prompts, that is, to use "××××, that is, the hard-working masses' own organization, to become the ruling class," to "replace it with the acquisition of democracy." The "Paris Commune" The first decree was to replace the standing army with the armed masses. The "Paris Commune" was organized by city representatives elected by the districts of Paris according to the general election system. They were fully responsible and could be replaced at any time. Most of them were personnel or were considered representatives of the working class. The police, who had always been state government workers, were immediately stripped of all their political functions and became the responsible agency of the Commune, as were the officials of all other administrative agencies. From the members of the Commune, from top to bottom, all personnel serving society were given workers' wages. All state privileges and office expenses disappeared along with the demise of these officials themselves. The majority of the members of the "Paris Commune" were able to replace the privileged minority (privileged officials, generals of the standing army) and directly perform all functions themselves. The functions of state power were increasingly performed by the entire population. It changed from bourgeois democracy to labor democracy, from the democracy of the oppressors to the democracy of the oppressed.

Fifth, the "Paris Commune" adopted a new system to replace the corrupt representative system of selling one's body in capitalist society. Under this new system, there is freedom of judgment and discussion. The representatives must operate themselves, must implement their own laws themselves, must examine themselves The results obtained in actual life must also be directly responsible to the voters themselves. It proves to us that: "To eliminate the official system everywhere immediately and thoroughly is a bird utopia, but it is possible to destroy the old official machine at one stroke and immediately build a new organization to gradually eliminate all official systems. The most direct current task of the revolutionary hard-working masses.

Sixth, the experience of the "Paris Commune" also tells us that "national unity" should not be destroyed. On the contrary, it should be organized by means of the commune system. The unity of the people should become a reality. The method is to eliminate the state power that considers itself to be the embodiment of this unity, but at the same time wants to be independent of the nation and stand above the nation. The centralism of the awakened democratic hard-working masses must be contrasted with the centralism of the warlords and bureaucrats of the asset class.

Although the "Paris Commune" created these many historical experiences of great significance, it itself failed under the glorious history of two months. The first failure was that the objective environment at that time was not fully mature. The first was that they did not thoroughly eliminate the efforts of the French and foreign counter-revolutionaries, so that the × people could calmly implement a large-scale joint general counter-offensive, and suffered an irreparable tragic defeat. The third was that their own united front was not consolidated and developed, and the leading party did not closely unite the parties, and at the same time neglected rural work, and could not unite the vast peasants around themselves, sitting and making × Fangde calmly implement provocative strategies, sitting and making the peasants become a powerful team to attack Paris.

(III) Conclusion

Summarizing the experiences and lessons left to us by the two glorious and great festivals of "March 18th" in the East and the West, and in conjunction with the new environment and new tasks of the new stage of our Chinese nation's War of Resistance against Japan, we must move forward more heroically today along the blood path of the martyrs of the Beijing Massacre and the Paris bloody battle, and promote the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle to realize national independence and freedom and world true peace. At the same time, we must also accept the experiences and lessons of the Beijing Massacre and the Paris bloody battle, on the one hand, strengthen our internal unity, expand our united front, and increase our aid force internationally and in the × camp, especially by starting with the promotion and development of the provincial, municipal, and county councils, and actively implement democratic politics so that the lively forces of the entire nation, especially the workers, peasants, and working masses, can be concentrated under unified leadership to serve the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. On the other hand, we must intensify the efforts to break the conspiracy of the × people to use Han traitors and "anti-communist," "pro-peace," and "compromise halfway" remarks and actions to achieve "using Chinese to control Chinese," and intensify the increase of the × people's domestic, military, and international difficulties, resolutely support the protracted War of Resistance, and strive for final victory.

### The Decline of Japanese Liberalists (II)

—Original by He Sell

Originally published in [Asia Magazine]

The officials of various government agencies also felt that the matters within their duties were being encroached upon by military agencies. I found that the people in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were very dissatisfied, especially those in the unlucky East Asia Bureau. In addition, some people who worked in the government had the opportunity to know the inside story of Japanese finances, and they believed that Japan's deposits and cash were not enough to support an expanded war against China.

Most of the members of the Japanese Diet are also liberalists. Three members and several American journalists held informal talks last time. They showed amazing open-mindedness when discussing various issues, especially when discussing the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Liberalists also accounted for a large percentage of the journalists. They can still scold the cabinet members, but they have to be euphemistic when it comes to the military. They can write articles to discuss various military issues, but they are detained when sent to the inspection office. Finally, speaking of a group of political elders around the Japanese Emperor, they are also inclined to liberalists. Except for the only veteran Saionji, who is not a member, such as Hiranuma, Makino, Matsudaira, Kan'e, and Kiyoura, one can still see some traditional ideas of the Meiji era.

Since Japanese liberalists occupy so many sectors of society, the authorities regard them as more terrible than communists and workers. Japan has a well-established judicial system and a strict police organization, and those who are stirring at the bottom are not difficult to catch in one fell swoop, but it is not so easy to deal with liberalists. They are now entrenched in important places, and their plans are beyond the reach of the local prosecutor's ears. They have potential power, and they may be able to change the most important issues of the country overnight and exert their full power.

The fundamental difference between the position of liberalists in Japan and their position in other totalitarian countries such as Germany and Italy lies in this. As we said above, they are still entrenched in key positions, and once they have organized action, it will definitely be popular throughout the country. It is not difficult for them to get the support of the royal family, which is indeed the most complex and difficult point in Japan now. (To be continued)

### Our Troops in Jin and Yu Provinces Counterattacked for Days; Cannon Warfare Confrontation across the Xiang River in Central Hubei; × Troops Were Severely Attacked by the Poyang Lake

[This Paper's Telegram] Xi'an Telegram: Our troops in Jin Province have been counterattacking for days, and the battle situation has stabilized. In the Wanquan and Linjin areas of southwestern Jin Province, a guerrilla unit of our army has cleared out most of the × bandits nearby. After the × bandits invading Ningwu County attacked Shenchi, we are counterattacking. Wuzhai and Kelan are both in our hands. Fierce battles have been fought for days between Pinglu and Pianguan. We recovered Goubao and are continuing the battle. Lishi is surrounded on three sides by our forces. Nearby Lijiawan and Hejiaqiao have also been recovered by us. The × bandits near Dawu Town have been completely resolved.

[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] The battle situation in the occupied areas is still fierce. A telegram from Shaanxi stated that local battles have been quite intense in various parts of Jin Province for days. However, the × bandits are still busy building fortifications, repairing roads, stationing troops, and stockpiling grain along the communication lines. A certain unit of our army in southwestern Jin Province has been attacking the × bandits in recent days and has approached Wenxi and Xiaxian. The Tongpu Railway has been repeatedly damaged by us, causing extreme panic among the × bandits. The × bandits from Anze invading Qinyuan in eastern Jin Province were intercepted by us at Dayang Village and Jiaokou River and made no progress. In the past two or three days, the × bandits have suffered casualties of four to five hundred men. The × bandits invading Jiyuan in northern Henan Province number only three to four hundred men. With our forces attacking from three sides, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. After we captured Zhaoyuan in eastern Shandong Province, we are continuing to attack the × bandits near Qixia.

[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 17th] A telegram from Jingmen stated that in central Hubei, our army and the × bandits are still confronting each other across the river. Our army shelled the east bank of Shayang, killing many × bandits. A certain unit of our army attacked the × bandits north of Zhongxiang and achieved considerable gains. There was also cannon warfare between Xihe and Suizhou.

[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] As of the 16th, there were no major battles on any of the battlefields. Although the × bandits are actively deploying, judging from the current situation, a large-scale invasion is unlikely. A telegram from Jingmen stated that in Shayang, central Hubei, our army and the × bandits are still confronting each other across the Xiang River. The × bandits currently occupy the area east of the river and near Jiukou, totaling about two thousand men. The × bandits in Yangzi, Zhongxiang, have adopted a defensive posture. The × bandits in Xihe, numbering about three thousand men, are urgently plotting to invade westward, and we have taken strict precautions. Although the × bandits in northern Jiangxi Province are attempting to attack Nanchang, we are awaiting them with heavy troops and will surely inflict heavy losses on them. Several dozen × bandits who landed on the shore of Duchang on Poyang Lake a few days ago were annihilated by us. The battle situation in northern Hunan Province is quiet.

[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 17th] A telegram from Zhengzhou stated that our army is counterattacking Qiyuan in northern Henan Province, and fierce battles are raging with the × bandits. The × bandits are urgently trying to repair the Xinxiang-Kaifeng railway, but our guerrilla sabotage is making it difficult to complete. The × bandits near Zhongmou have been attacked by us for days and have suffered heavy casualties.

[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 17th] A telegram from Guilin stated that twenty to thirty × planes have arrived on Hainan Island. Their main force is still in Haikou, Changya County, Ding'an, and Qiongzhou. A unit of × bandits was heavily defeated near Qiongdong by our forces. The war in Guangdong is quiet. A certain unit of our army is approaching Xinjie. The × bandits who landed in Pingfeng, northern Jiangxi Province, a few days ago have suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by us for days.

[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] A telegram from Guilin stated that the war situation in South China is stable. The × bandits in Guangdong and on Hainan Island are busy building fortifications.

[United Press, Shanghai, 17th] A Japanese military spokesman stated that Chinese troops are actively launching guerrilla warfare in the Nanjing, Wuhu, and Jiujiang areas to contain Japanese activities in Hubei. He continued that the Chinese army has concentrated five divisions on the Hangzhou River, which apparently indicates that a large-scale counterattack will be launched soon.

[Central News Agency, Hequ, 17th] When our army recovered Jiaokou (4 kilometers south of Shicheng), they killed over × bandits, including four × officers. The wounded were countless. They captured over 70,000 rounds of ammunition, over 100 rifles, seven light machine guns, two pistols, telephones, binoculars, gas masks, and many other items.

[Central News Agency, Hequ, 16th] The reasons for the × bandit's attack on the northwest of the camp this time: first, our implementation of the scorched earth policy has been quite effective; second, the × bandits' reinforcements are insufficient, with only about 3,000 troops in total. The number of dead and wounded before and after has reached over 1,000, leading to a disastrous defeat. Our army's morale is even more boosted after this victory.

[Central News Agency, Xiangyang, 17th] Four × planes bombed Fan today at 10:00 AM, one of which was hit by our forces, caught fire, and fell. Seven × planes then bombed Xiangyang. The × plane shot down landed on Luosha Beach. Over a hundred bombs were dropped in Ji'an.

### Our Troops on the Eastern Front Inflicted a Fatal Blow on the × Bandits; Implementing a Comprehensive Countermeasure to Prevent the × Bandits from Plundering; Mobile and Surprise Battles are Unfolding in Northern Jiangsu

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] A reporter's report on the current situation regarding the × bandits after travelling from Hangzhou to southern Anhui is as follows:

Hangzhou-Fuyang

(A) There are about two to three thousand × troops between Hangzhou and Fuyang, with very few reinforcements or reductions. The × bandits have boasted that they will build permanent fortifications along Wukang, Yuhang, Fuyang, the lakes, and mountainous areas. However, no activity has been seen in days. Looking at the forts from afar in Fuyang, the × bandit sentries are very sparse, and the situation remains the same. It is said that the Lu Zhangsheng bandit troops and the × troops coming and going between Jiaxing and Haining are more numerous. It is rumored to be a mixed brigade, intending to eliminate our guerrilla units on the coast. There have been repeated battles in recent days.

Taihu Lake

(B) There are about two divisions of × bandit troops along both sides of Taihu Lake and along the river to Wuhu. Their main force is clearly stationed in Shanghai and concentrated in two places between people and Zhi, ready to use the railway and highway lines for rapid transport in case of emergency. According to reliable reports, there are mostly two to three hundred × bandit troops between the large and small mountains around the lake, and as few as four to five hundred. They patrol day and night.

Active operations. The large basin shaped like a Buddha bow facing northwest to Yang is a weak link in the × bandits' military deployment. Judging from the panicked situation of the puppet organizations recently, the × bandits are already feeling the difficulty of defense.

Northern Jiangsu

(C) The × bandit army is using the heavy pressure of one and a half divisions, divided into three routes, to press southward along the coastline, urgently trying to open up the Huai River and the Qian River in order to facilitate transportation. Since our army retreated from Lianshui and Huaiyin to south of the Huai River the day before yesterday, it has disintegrated into smaller units to carry out comprehensive mobile surprise battles. The area around Funing, Yancheng, and Dongtai will be the center of the war in northern Jiangsu. However, the offensive of the × bandits has weakened recently.

Southern Anhui

(D) The × bandit army is close to the ferry crossing on the opposite bank of Anqing. On the river surface between Dadu Kou and Lishu Xiang Kou to the west, the × bandit speedboats have been patrolling closely in recent days. Since the dawn of the 3rd of this month, after three hundred × puppet troops attacked the Second District of Dongliu and were defeated by our self-defense forces, it has been silent. Since Wangjiang City on the north bank of the Yangtze River was recovered on the 6th, the × bandits have not dared to act recklessly. There are no × bandits in Fengtai, north of Susong County, and local order has also stabilized slightly.

The × bandits also claim that the eastern battlefield is a place for economic and political warfare. The × puppet newspapers have repeatedly spread false peace rhetoric. Judging from their intentions, they clearly want to deceive our people with false peace in order to weaken our side's will to fight, and take advantage of the rich resources of our Taihu Lake basin, trying to avoid direct battles, and to implement their insidious plan of plunder. We have begun comprehensive countermeasures, and will give the × bandits a fatal blow.

### The × Bandits are Promoting a Poisonous Policy in Hankou; Large Quantities of Opium are Shipped from Outside the Pass; Troops are Dispatched to Force Residents to Purchase and Smoke Opium

[United Press, Hankou, 17th] According to news from Chinese sources in this city, since the Japanese army occupied it, the Japanese army has shipped as much as one hundred tons of opium from "Manchuria". The Japanese army, through the Wuhan Security Maintenance Association, has notified [the local opium dealers] to purchase the newly arrived opium as soon as possible, otherwise they would be accused of resisting Japan. However, the dealers, due to their existing inventory and repeated price drops, found it difficult to sell. In addition, their capital was extremely limited, totaling only 24,000 yuan for all of them, so they were unable to continue purchasing. The Japanese side finally ordered them to withdraw secured loans from local banks to purchase opium. It was also learned that on March 8th, three Japanese soldiers carried opium westward along Haoxi River, forcing people to buy it. This Japanese plan to poison Wuhan is entirely managed directly by the Japanese military authorities. The budget for the "Wuhan Security Maintenance Association" Tobacco Prohibition Bureau for February of this year totaled 984,550 yuan, of which 25,000 yuan was revenue from the sale of opium and 55,000 yuan was tax collected from opium smokers and opium dens. There are currently over ten opium dens in this city, with over a thousand smokers.

### Murder Case of a Rickshaw Puller in Shanghai; Corpse Discovered

[United Press, Shanghai, 17th] This morning, at 8:00 AM on Thursday, Tailai Taxi Company received a call from Hongkou requesting a taxi. A Chinese rickshaw puller drove alone to pick up the customer and disappeared. Later, the taxi was found near the New Asia Hotel. Later, the rickshaw puller's corpse was discovered on Zhaoxing Road.

### New York Women's Organization Presents Gold Medal of Honor to Madame Chiang Kai-shek to Express Respect

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] The New York Federation of Women's Clubs recently presented a gold medal of honor to Madame Soong Mei-ling, wife of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Chinese Kuomintang, because Madame Chiang has been leading the women of her country to engage in the war of resistance amidst national difficulties. Her fearless spirit is worthy of admiration, so the association presented her with this honor to commend her. During the presentation ceremony, Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih was unable to attend due to illness and was represented by a secretary from the embassy. Secretary Cui gave a speech, stating that the New York Federation of Women's Clubs' action shows extreme sympathy for the Chinese nation's war of resistance. We have great admiration for this expression.

### Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Escapes After Being Kidnapped; Abducted in a × Occupied Area; Fortunately, He Was Discovered Immediately and Returned to Tianjin Safely

[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] Mr. Diatali, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in this city, was kidnapped today from his residence in the former German concession (now occupied by the Japanese army) by three men dressed in Chinese clothing and forced into a car. Later, Mr. Diatali was discovered between Tianjin and Dagu, twelve miles from Tianjin. The car was stopped near Xiazeng (transliteration) between Tianjin and Dagu. The thugs in the car were quickly disarmed by the police. After contacting Tianjin by telephone, they sent people to escort Mr. Diatali back to Tianjin.

[United Press, Shanghai, 17th] According to sources from Wei Yang, those who kidnapped Mr. Diatali, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin, were Japanese dressed in Chinese clothing, not Chinese.

### After the × Bandits Invaded Hainan Island, Security in Annam is Strengthened; France Dispatches a Squadron of Pursuit Aircraft to the East; Military Exercises are Unprecedented in Scale

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 17th] Since the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, the defense of French Annam has been greatly strengthened. Currently, the French side is establishing an aircraft factory in Annam to manufacture aircraft. This funding will be allocated from the colony's finances. Foreign ships are prohibited from sailing to Cam Ranh Bay. Soon, the French side will dispatch fifty high-speed pursuit aircraft to Annam to strengthen the defense there. The new airport newly established by the French at Da Nang (north of Cam Ranh) was completed on February 23. A part of the Annamese Air Force is currently stationed there, and the French side will soon dispatch additional aircraft to Da Nang to strengthen its defense. An unprecedented large-scale military exercise will be held in Annam this year. At that time, a military delegation from Siam will come to Hanoi to participate in the review.

Air Defense in the Dutch East Indies Will Also Be Strengthened

[Reuters, Washington, 168th] The Dutch military inspection delegation has ordered 18 Douglas bombers from the United States to strengthen the defense of the Dutch East Indies. The delegation is led by Vice Admiral Duum and is scheduled to return to the Netherlands tomorrow.

### Osaka Arsenal Explosion Case; Anti-War Elements Executed by Firing Squad; × Feels Embarrassed and is Now Studying Countermeasures

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to news from Tianjin, the explosion at the Osaka Army Arsenal on the 1st of this month caused heavy losses to the × bandits. It has been confirmed that this incident was an actual anti-war action by anti-war elements. The initiators were examiner Kawasaki Gi, Second Lieutenant of Artillery Masumoto Hachigake, and Artillery Warrant Officer Kawasaki et al. within the arsenal. They were arrested on the 11th and executed by firing squad in Osaka Zhonggong District. The implications of this case are very widespread. The × bandits feel deeply embarrassed and are now studying countermeasures, but they are still keeping it secret and using accidental fire as a cover.

### Jing Sha Youth Wartime Service Corps (Part Two)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Geng Ya

The performance of dramas and singing is even more countless. They have worked with the civil movement team to mobilize and organize the masses, first forming the Bundled Goods Workers' Union, with over 1,100 members; second, the Cotton Factory Workers' Union, with 1,300 members; the Drama Association, with over 400 members; and the Rickshaw Pullers' Union, the Medical Association, etc. In total, there are sixty trade unions under the control of the corps, with a total of over 10,000 members. After the corps launched a donation campaign after the major industries relocated to the interior, it was able to obtain over 100,000 yuan in a short period of three months, which is a good example of their ability to effectively mobilize the masses.

Before launching the donation campaign, the corps publicized the meaning of the donation to various workers' unions and set a total donation target of 100,000 yuan for the city. The amount each union should donate was based on the prosperity of the union members. For example, the Bundled Goods Workers' Union was asked to donate 500 yuan, but they actually donated 1,000 yuan. Among them was a 15-year-old female worker who donated all of her savings from half a year's wages, 13 yuan, after deducting living expenses. The Drama Association was asked to donate 500 yuan. They collected donations from theater performances and exceeded 600 yuan before the deadline. A famous performer suddenly appeared and spoke out in support of the donation during a performance of a famous play, donating 50 yuan herself, and the audience donated several hundred yuan on the spot. Similar enthusiastic donations were made by other industries, resulting in remarkable results. However, this is also a result of the corps promoting the spirit of "leadership from the top down, promotion from the bottom up", first uniting the military and civilians as one, and then achieving satisfactory results.

Mr. Liu Rongchao, the corps leader with a Yu Youren-style full beard, wears the same material military uniform as the corps members and messengers, with the rank of major general, looking imposing, somewhat like "Old General Huang Zhong". In fact, when asked about his age, he is only 34 years old. He was previously a professor of philosophy at Sun Yat-sen University and attended an anti-Japanese cadre training class. Currently, he is entrusted by the Wartime Relief Association to lead these young people in anti-war work, so he can manage everything with ease and cultivate a beautiful flower from the strength of the people of Jing Sha.

Several young people in the corps came to my hotel to talk to me. They are young people around twenty years old, their cheeks flushed with youth, perhaps from being blown by the frivolous Xuefeng. They have an attitude and demeanor like the sons of "scholarly families", truly refined and elegant! No wonder a friend who looked down from upstairs mistakenly thought they were "female comrades". However, their true spirit, which is stored in their hearts and manifested in their backs, fully shows that they already possess the basic qualities that a soldier must have: a strong physique, a firm determination, and alertness. Moreover, they have had a small trial run, capturing and executing several traitors.

We, the sons and daughters of China who are fortunate enough to be born in this great era of national revival, should all "cross the sea like the Eight Immortals, each displaying their unique abilities." If we don't quickly do what we can: those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength, those with talent (planning) contribute talent, and seize the opportunity to establish special merits, when else will we wait?

### Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce Issues Statement; Exposes × Economic Conspiracy in North China; Calls on All Parties to Unite to Defeat It

[Reuters, Shanghai, 17th] Sir Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in this city, issued a solemn official statement today. On behalf of the British Chamber of Commerce, he lodged a serious protest against Japan's implementation of the new currency system in North China. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The pseudo "North China Provisional Government's" new currency system began to be implemented in major cities and ports of North China on March 11, including Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei. The purpose of this new currency system is to expel Chinese legal tender and circulate the banknotes of the pseudo "United Reserve Bank". The banknotes of this "United Reserve Bank" are closely linked to the Japanese yen and have extremely insufficient reserves. In terms of foreign exchange, they have no value at all, while Chinese legal tender has sufficient reserves and a fixed value in the foreign exchange market.

In order to facilitate the circulation of the "Reserve Bank" banknotes, the pseudo "Provisional Government" has prohibited customs from approving the export of goods and ordered those who order goods to purchase "Reserve Bank" foreign exchange at a fixed price of fourteen shillings at the Yokohama Specie Bank. This measure will gradually lead to a situation where Japanese banks tend to monopolize finance. If commerce continues to operate on this basis, the "Reserve Bank" banknotes with insufficient reserves will be supported by foreign exchange. The result of this forced circulation of "Reserve Bank" banknotes will be that most foreign businesses will be on the verge of suspension or closure, because they cannot conduct transactions with banknotes that cannot be converted into foreign exchange. Japanese merchants are in a different position, because they can accept "Reserve Bank" banknotes and use them to purchase goods in Japan. At the same time, this new currency system will first affect Chinese exporters, and soon importers of foreign goods (non-Japanese goods) will be similarly affected - that is, the foreign exchange obtained from export trade, that is, "Reserve Bank" banknotes, cannot be guaranteed to be used for import trade, and as a result, the import trade of non-Japanese goods will inevitably be sharply reduced. What is even more advanced is that even if the foreign exchange obtained can be used for import trade, the insufficient reserve value will make the distribution system controlled by the "Reserve Bank", creating a situation that violates existing treaties and controls and restricts the import of foreign goods.

This compulsory implementation of a currency system with insufficient reserves in North China will have a detrimental effect on the sources and channels of British aid and distribution. If Japan succeeds in linking the Chinese currency system to the Japanese yen, all foreign merchants will suffer greatly, as they have tragically suffered in Manchuria. Therefore, this new currency system is extremely unfair to British interests and violates the principles of the Open Door and equal opportunity. We must make every effort to ensure its failure. The British Council recently lodged a serious protest against this illegal plan, because it not only harms the interests of British merchants, but also harms the interests of all non-Japanese parties, and as a result, it will throw harm into a larger area.

### Local Financial Conference; Closing Remarks by Kong Xiangxi; We Should Continue to Work Hard in the Future; Strengthen Cooperation and Promote Talent

At this local financial conference convened by the Ministry of Finance, everyone has been able to concentrate, report in detail, and discuss meticulously during the short five-day conference period. And during the review and discussion, everyone has been able to bring into play their understanding from experience, knowledge, and strategies to contribute to the country and society, which is of great significance.

Today, the supreme leader, in his instructions, instructed us that there are three important things during the war of resistance: one is military affairs, the second is education, and the third is the economy. The economy is closely related to finance, and finance is the mother of all undertakings. Without finance, everything is just empty talk and cannot be realized. Therefore, to maintain the source of finance, we must develop the economy, and to develop the economy, it is most important to consolidate finance and seek its development.

Gentlemen, you come from all over the country, either in charge of local finances or presiding over local finance. Your responsibilities are very important. It is a rare opportunity in ancient times to be able to gather together in this extraordinary period to discuss various major plans for the country to achieve the goal of the war of resistance.

Recently, many people have discussed the government's meeting problems, saying that meetings are held without discussion, discussions are held without decisions, decisions are made without implementation, and implementation is weak. This is probably because the personnel attending general meetings like to propose motions, and there are too many motions to discuss at one time. Therefore, they have no choice but to submit them to the government for review. Although there are not many motions at this conference, they are greatly related to the war of resistance, nation-building, and national revival. This can be said to be a historical meeting, and its important nature is naturally different from ordinary meetings. After careful research and discussion, we have decided on a very good plan, which must be implemented one by one and must not be put on the shelf. It is hoped that everyone will understand the importance of their responsibilities and mission, and after returning to their local areas, will earnestly implement the plan and strive to correct the past problems.

In the future, the supreme leader instructed that "the financial sector's various measures in the past have made great contributions to the country." Our military weapons are indeed inferior to others, but our financial system and economic organization are feared by the × bandits. Although the × bandits have used all kinds of methods to destroy our finance and destroy our economy, they have wasted their efforts and have achieved nothing. Now, after a long period of struggle, our legal tender's credit is still very solid. Even internationally, it has gained a very high status and reputation. The reports of the HSBC Bank shareholders' meeting and the speeches of British Finance Minister Simon have praised the credit of our legal tender. Not only is the attitude of third parties like this, but even the treatises written by scholars and experts from the × bandit side cannot but admit this fact. From this, it can be known that China's currency and finance have achieved considerable status internationally.

However, the acquisition of this achievement and reputation is by no means achieved by luck or accident, but is the result of the hard work of many people in the past. It is of great benefit to the war of resistance, nation-building, and national revival. We must not only maintain this situation, but also promote and expand it. Therefore, we must continue to work hard in the future. Since this conference has a detailed plan, it must be implemented step by step and diligently. In addition, we must strengthen cooperation and have a complete plan and a complete organization. We must never act on our own and without a fixed target. I once said to the attendees at the education conference that education is the mother of the country. Our future education should cultivate talents that are suitable for the following four conditions: First, have a noble personality; second, have a sound physique; third, have applicable skills; and fourth, have a cooperative spirit. This is not only the way education should be done, but also the way you should train talents in the future. In the past, the result of education was that, on the one hand, talents graduating from schools felt that there was nothing to do, and on the other hand, society felt that there was no available talent. School graduates did not meet the needs of society, and society could not accommodate these talents. This is the shortcoming of past education. In the future, the financial sector should also reward and cultivate the younger generation and promote talents who possess the above four conditions. This is a very important task of the financial sector.

Recently, transportation has not been very convenient, and everyone has their own tasks and cannot stay here for long. Therefore, this conference will end today. It is hoped that everyone can implement this conference's plan in a practical way, unite with all parties, and select and train talents who can help themselves. This is to help the country. What I have said today is not without value for everyone's reference. I hope you will work harder, hope that this war can defeat the × bandits and end soon, build China under the Three Principles of the People, not only to revive the Chinese nation, but also to achieve the highest goal of the world being for all and universal harmony.

### Gosse Flies Over from Chongqing Next Week

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th Special Dispatch] French Ambassador Gosse will fly from Chongqing to Vietnam via Hankou on the 32nd.

### Englishman Sympathizes with Our Country; Compiles and Publishes a Guide to Inferior Goods

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Chairman Inness of the Menziesde Boycott Japanese Goods Committee recently wrote to the Menziesde Customs Report that Japan's export trade to Britain and the United States has fallen sharply by 22% to 18%. Japan relies on the foreign exchange earned from export trade to purchase gasoline, so that its aircraft can fly over the Chinese mainland and bomb to death 100,000 peace-loving Chinese civilians. Our association has compiled a "Store Guide" listing the names of imported Japanese goods. We hope that all parties will actively boycott Japanese goods.

### The Cabinet Met Yesterday; Daladier Plans to Go to England to Discuss Military and Political Cooperation Steps; Maintain Close Relations with Soviet Poland

[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] According to sources close to authority, Daladier will convene a cabinet meeting today to prepare to respond to questions in the House of Representatives regarding foreign affairs.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] According to well-informed sources, Daladier will request the cabinet today to pass laws granting the government special powers to change the 40-hour work system in armaments factories in the event of an international emergency.

[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] French Prime Minister Daladier convened an emergency meeting of ministers yesterday to discuss whether he should go to England to discuss concrete policies and steps for British-French military and political cooperation and to resist the expansion of "evil forces."

[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] Government officials discussed yesterday the proposal for Prime Minister Daladier to go to England. Daladier plans to go to England next week to hold an emergency meeting with the British side to discuss military and political responses to Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia.

[Reuters, London, 16th] According to sources in Paris, the Czech incident is sufficient to strengthen Chamberlain's determination to expand the military, believing that this is the only way to save England and France. Foreign Secretary Halifax told the Foreign Affairs Committee that he believed that close relations should be maintained with Soviet Poland. He had consulted with the Soviet ambassador many times. Poland has indicated to France that if France is attacked, Poland will immediately fulfill its treaty obligations.

[Central News Agency, London, 16th] Parliamentary circles anticipate that the government may abandon its appeasement policy and work with the Soviet Union to promote diplomatic relations, replacing the understanding between Britain and Germany. Well-informed sources here have confirmed that the cabinet will be reorganized soon.

England and France Decide to Recall Ambassadors to Germany

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] According to reliable sources, England and France have agreed to recall their ambassadors to Germany.

[Reuters, London, 17th] At the House of Commons meeting last night, Labor opposition leader Attlee asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he had obtained more information about Central Europe than reported in the newspapers. The Prime Minister replied that the information he had received confirmed the newspaper reports. Maclean then asked the Prime Minister whether the government intended to withdraw the ambassador in Berlin, as his information was so unreliable. The Prime Minister replied that the government was currently considering whether to recall the ambassador to hear a more detailed report.

[Reuters, London, 17th] In the House of Commons today, someone asked about the status of the British ambassador to Germany, saying whether the government had decided to recall the ambassador to listen to a report or to permanently recall the ambassador. Sir Simon replied that this matter was under urgent consideration by the government. He replied to another question that the British ambassador to Germany had sent official information about the situation in Central Europe to Foreign Secretary Halifax. Regarding the Czech incident, the British government is currently maintaining contact with the French government.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] The British government has recalled its ambassador to Germany, Henderson. Hitler is therefore also planning to recall the German ambassador to Britain.

[Reuters, London, 17th] A diplomatic observer recently wrote an article commenting on the Czech question, temporarily unable to determine the attitude of the British government towards recognizing the German annexation of Czechoslovakia. The summary is as follows: The current situation and attitude of the Czech provinces are still ambiguous, and Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic cannot be equated with the annexation of Austria. At the time of the annexation of Austria, it was invited by [Kurt] Schuschnigg (former Austrian Federal Chancellor) to request German assistance. However, in this Czech incident, even the German propaganda machine dared not say that the German army entered the Czech Republic at the invitation of the Czech president. The difference in nature is evident here. Moreover, Chamberlain has strongly stated that Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is a violation of the Munich Agreement. The British government attaches great importance to the gold and foreign currency deposited by the former Czech government in the Bank of England. The Bank of England has now been ordered by the government to withhold this currency. In the future, when the British government discusses the repayment of Czech debts with Germany, this currency will be a powerful guarantee, and Czech creditors may be able to avoid the repetition of the Austrian incident and obtain a more satisfactory compensation. Since Sir Newton, the British minister to Czechoslovakia, was transferred to Iraq as ambassador, before the British government decides to send a consul-general to Czechoslovakia, all matters will be temporarily handled by a chargé d'affaires. It is generally speculated that Henderson, the US ambassador to Germany, will soon return home to report on the overall situation. However, apart from reporting and briefing, it is believed that Henderson's return home will not have a more serious diplomatic mission.

Rumors of Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain

[Reuters, London, 17th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent wrote today that it is widely rumored in parliamentary circles that Foreign Secretary Halifax, with the support of some Conservative members, is leading a movement to reorganize the cabinet, hoping to establish a new government based on a broad foundation. It is said that the new government will include former Foreign Secretary Eden and Churchill. The conscription system may also be implemented. The purpose is to show Germany an uncompromising attitude. Compulsory national service and a reserve system are difficult to implement without considering the attitude of the opposition party. The Labor Party has expressed a cold attitude towards the establishment of a broad government. The Liberal Party's attitude is less cold. The current government has given up adopting compulsory national service because it has been severely opposed by the Labor Party and the United Party.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden recently suggested organizing a national conference to be responsible for advising the government on various foreign policy issues. Eden's plan indicates that the conference should include representatives from all parties and factions across the country, as well as all Privy Council members from both houses of Parliament. If this plan is implemented, the conference will include Eden, Churchill, Cooper, Baldwin, Lloyd George, Attlee, Sinclair, and Hoare. It is reported that general foreign policy issues were discussed during the meeting between Eden and Halifax yesterday. Eden was specially granted access to all reports related to Central and Eastern Europe. Some believe that this may be the cause of the rumors of a cabinet reshuffle.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Rumors circulating abroad that Prime Minister Chamberlain is about to resign are untrue.

### Hitler Arrived in Moravia Yesterday Afternoon; Spoke to the Italian Prime Minister Before Leaving Beijing; Hacha Will Be Appointed Head of the Protectorate

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] Hitler spent yesterday afternoon in an unknown location and will enter the Moravian capital at noon today. German troops are now advancing there in order to hold a military parade today in preparation for Hitler's inspection. Hitler will then return to Vienna.

[Reuters, Czech Beijing, 17th] It is rumored here that Hitler spoke to Mussolini for fifteen minutes before leaving here last night. Hitler is currently traveling to the Moravian capital.

[Reuters, Czech Beijing, 16th] Today, Hitler received Czech President Hacha at the Old Castle and gave him a military salute. The German news agency still calls him "President." It is possible that Hacha will still be appointed as the head of the Protectorate, and his title will be "Protector".

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] German troops have occupied most of Bohemia without encountering any resistance. The Czech army is still stationed in the barracks. It is said that when transferring military power, a suitable and dignified ceremony will be used.

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] After Hitler issued a declaration on Slovakia, he exchanged telegrams with the President of Slovakia, and the President of Slovakia handed Slovakia over to German protection. German troops are now advancing into Slovakia.

[Associated Press, Czech Beijing, 16th] It is estimated that 5,000 people have been arrested here, and 200,000 people have been mobilized. Approximately 30,000 people are stationed in Czech Beijing. It is reported that the Czech gold is being prepared to be transported to Germany, amounting to approximately 68,050,000 to 85,687,000 yuan. Approximately 22 percent is deposited in London and other places.

### Germany's Annexation of the Czech Republic Yields Great Gains

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] All sectors in London are discussing today the economic impact of Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic, believing that Germany has gained greatly this time and has obtained a great deal of excellent military equipment, sufficient for 40 divisions of the most modern army. In addition, Germany has obtained cash worth 25 million pounds. Other possible gains of 10 million to 20 million pounds are not included. The 700,000 textile machines in the Czech Republic, totaling 1.65 million spindles, will also be acquired by Germany. Previously, the Czech Republic exported cotton yarn and cloth to various European countries, especially to the Netherlands, and their value was lower than the exports of Lancashire in England. In the future, such exports will be impossible under the German economic system, so the cotton weaving industry in Lancashire will be more developed as a result. In addition, there is an important economic point: before the occupation of the Czech Republic, Germany's population and raw material supply had developed to the peak and could not be increased any further. Now that the Czech Republic has been occupied, in addition to acquiring some people, it can also acquire a large number of raw materials.

### Anxiety in Rome; People Are Discussing Whether War Will Break Out

[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] The public's mind here is extremely unstable. People on the street are discussing whether war will break out. Some people have withdrawn their savings from banks, fearing that the development of the international situation may have serious repercussions in Romania. Jews are even more uneasy, believing that the Czech situation will trigger a new anti-Semitic movement.

### Hungary Announces Occupation of Ruthenia; Volosin and Others Fled to Romania; Romania Decides to Close Border

[Reuters, Hungarian Beijing, 17th] Hungary has formally notified the governments of Germany, Italy, Poland, and Romania of its action to occupy Ruthenia. Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy issued an order to the Hungarian army today, saying, "The difficult task of the Hungarian army is to liberate Ruthenia."

[Associated Press, Hungarian Beijing, 16th] The Hungarian Chief of Staff issued an official report today, declaring that the Hungarian army has occupied the capital of Ruthenia, and said that a team has arrived at the Berlan border.

[Reuters, Hungarian Beijing, 16th] When the Hungarian army occupied the important town of Zhustada in Ruthenia, it only encountered sporadic resistance from local people and did not encounter organized resistance. Its biggest difficulties were bad weather and inconvenient transportation. Most of the Czech army has fled to Romania.

[Central News Agency, Shuster City, 16th] It is reported that the Ruthenian army has assembled on the front line of Ersa City, repelled the Hungarian army, and is counterattacking southwards.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 27th] It is learned that the Romanian government has decided to close the border between Romania and Ruthenia to prevent refugees from entering. A message from Jeda said that Czech and Ruthenian refugees crossed the border all day yesterday. There are now more than 5,000 people in and around Jeda. The Romanian authorities will send Czech refugees to Yugoslavia to return to Bohemia.

[Associated Press, Hungarian Beijing, 16th] Ruthenian Prime Minister Volosin has fled to Romania, requesting that his country be subordinated to Romania. When he arrived in Jeda, a Ruthenian officer attempted to assassinate him, but was arrested by the police.

[Reuters, Romanian Jeda, 16th] Czech military vehicles are constantly entering Romanian territory, carrying approximately 50 officers and 2,000 soldiers. Volosin's family relatives and daily necessities were also brought along. In addition, there are 2,000 Czech Jews and Ruthenians, all fleeing here. Before 7:00 PM today (standard time), when the Hungarian army arrived in Zhustada, all Czech and Ruthenian officials had fled. The entire Ruthenia has not yet been occupied by the Hungarian army. As for the unoccupied land, the situation is extremely chaotic. According to a Czech senior military officer who arrived here and spoke to a Reuters reporter, the Zhustada war broke out immediately after receiving the Hungarian ultimatum. Young Ruthenian soldiers demanded that the military provide them with weapons. As a result, the military distributed all the weapons to them and then set off for the capital of Romania. Currently, Ruthenians are holding guns to guard the streets and engage in resistance. The officer also said that Ruthenians originally welcomed Germans and had decided to resist Hungarians, but the chances of this wish coming true are very slim.

[Reuters, Romanian Jeda, 17th] Ruthenian Minister of Health Durimei and Minister of Transportation Brasger left here today, representing President Volosin, to go to the Hungarian capital to request Hungary to allow Ruthenia to have autonomy within Hungary. Volosin telephoned Berlin yesterday, requesting Germany to persuade Hungary to allow Ruthenia to obtain autonomy. He decided on this action after attempting to seek assistance from the Romanian army to liberate Ruthenia.

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] According to Ruthenian sources here, Ruthenia has sent a telegram to the four signatory countries of the Munich Agreement, requesting assistance and guaranteeing Ruthenia's independence.

### Czech Envoy to the US Refuses German Takeover of Embassy; British Embassy Has Been Handed Over

[Reuters, New York, 17th] It is learned that the US government will express its dissatisfaction as much as possible with Hitler's recent actions. It is reported that the Czech minister in Washington has not received orders from Czech Beijing to turn the embassy over to the German embassy. The US ambassador to the Czech Republic will remain in Czech Beijing.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Czech Minister Hebner here refused to accept the request from the German embassy to take over the order today. He declared that he required a written order from his home government.

[Associated Press, London, 16th] The German embassy here received the Czech embassy at 6:00 PM today.

### Tension on the Soviet-Japanese Border; Japan Transfers Troops to Korea and Manchuria; Soviet Troops Are of Better Quality Than Japanese Troops

[Reuters, Shanghai, 17th] Reliable foreign military sources here today obtained information that, in the past week, a large number of Japanese troops have been transferred from Japan to Manchuria and Korea and then to the border adjacent to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the number reached as many as 40,000. The port of Rajin in Korea near Zhanggufeng is now suddenly closed to all shipping except for Japanese transport ships. Railway transportation between Harbin and Manchuria in Manchuria has also been disrupted due to military transportation. It is also reported that two Japanese divisions totaling 40,000 men arrived on Sakhalin Island at the beginning of this week. The northern part of the island belongs to the Soviet Union, and the southern part belongs to Japan.

[Central News Agency, Ynsk, 16th] It is rumored that the number of Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo" has increased. Political figures here do not attach too much importance to this.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 17th] Soviet Far East Army Commander Stern reported at the Communist Party Congress yesterday that, according to the experience of the Zhanggufeng Incident, it can be seen that the quality of the Soviet Far East Army is superior to that of the Japanese army in all aspects. As a result of the purge of the military, the strength of the army has become increasingly strong. It is a rumor that the Far East Army lacks generals.

### Impact of German Annexation of the Czech Republic; US Policy Becomes More Resolute; Roosevelt Will Reintroduce Defense of Guam; Army Chief Requests Consolidation of Panama River

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] According to sources close to President Roosevelt, since Germany annexed the Czech Republic, President Roosevelt's policies have become more resolute and decisive than at any time in the past. Events abroad have reduced opposition in the Senate, and the policy of strengthening the "weak decisions" of European democracies will gradually increase. The Chairman of the Senate Labor Committee today sent a proposal to Congress, requesting the continuation of the abolition of the trade agreement with the Czech Republic and requesting Germany to bear the Czech debt to the United States, approximately 165 million US dollars. The Secretary of the Army today urged Congress in the Senate to adopt a proposal to allocate 27.7 million yuan to build another dam in the Panama Canal District. Governor Rettari suggested that the construction of this dam must be able to resist air raids and accommodate the largest ships.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, said after a meeting at the White House that President Roosevelt intends to reintroduce the $5 million "port construction" proposal for Guam. The President does not object to the House of Representatives' cancellation of the item on the defense of Guam in the current naval and air force base bill, but will include Guam in the river port development budget.

### British Newspapers Condemn Hitler; The Tone Is Fierce as Never Before; Soviet Newspapers Believe the Situation Is Increasingly Serious

[Reuters, London, 16th] All national capitals are paying close attention to yesterday's events. British newspapers are publishing as much news as possible about the Czech incident, condemning Hitler. The fierceness of their tone is rarely seen in the past. Washington officials refused to comment on the incident. According to sources close to President Roosevelt, the President's serious attention to the European situation is for a reason. It is short-sighted to say that some people in Europe are exaggerating. Former Czech President Benes said that the annexation of the Czech Republic is "a new major crime in the international situation." It will be difficult to obtain peace, order, and tranquility in Europe hereafter.

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Pravda said, "The surrender of the Czech Republic has made Germany's threat to Poland and Hungary increasingly serious, creating a crisis of new conflict in the Central European situation." The newspaper also said that this move is sufficient to prove Germany's lack of integrity, and it is also the result of British and French cowardly diplomacy.

Short Commentary

### Vigilance Against Japanese Treachery

The Czech Republic has fallen completely due to compromise halfway, and the European situation has become even more critical. In this extremely chaotic international situation, we must step up our vigilance against new Japanese conspiracies!

Comprehensive news from all sides in the past few days proves that Japan does have the intention to intensify its aggression against us by taking advantage of the chaos in Europe. What is particularly important is: (1) Intensifying provocations against the Soviet Union to divert general attention and facilitate its choice of a new path of attack. (2) Intensifying the instigation of traitors to promote "anti-communism" and "peace talks," trying to undermine our internal unity, trying to shake our people's trust in the government and friendly countries such as the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France, and trying to weaken our unified resistance forces, so that we lose the power to continue the resistance. (3) In military terms, due to the current internal and external difficulties of the Japanese army, it is not possible to launch an attack from any front immediately, but it is intensifying preparations for launching a new attack, and their "southwest strategy" is particularly noteworthy.

In response to this conspiracy tendency of the Japanese, we must intensify the behind-the-scenes activities of Japanese provocations against the Soviet Union, we must intensify our opposition to peace and compromise rhetoric and actions; we must intensify our enthusiastic support for the leader, support for the government, and support for national unity; we must intensify our efforts to unite democratic and peaceful countries to promote the movement to aid China and restrict Japan; we must also intensify our efforts to consolidate the combat effectiveness of the front line, develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and actively cultivate new forces in the rear.

### It Is Rumored That Italy Will Follow Germany in Annexing Yugoslavia; Hitler's Second Target Is to Encircle Memel

[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] Since Hitler annexed the Czech Republic, the general psychology of all sectors in London has been dominated by the question of "What will be the second step?" The most common answer is that Germany will make another attempt to move eastward. It is expected that Hitler will sooner or later focus on Poland and Hungary. However, attacking Poland seems too early for the time being. Judging from the situation, its second target seems to be Memel. German leader Neumann, in a speech yesterday on the recent relations between Germany and Lithuania, stated that there are signs of increasing disputes in Memel. However, if Germany hopes to resolve Memel smoothly without conflicting with the United States, France, and Britain, it will be difficult. It is expected here that Italy will also follow Germany's example and come out to do its "dirty work of helping oppressed minorities." If so, Yugoslavia will be unavoidable. Yugoslavia also has ethnic minorities, just as Slovakia is dissatisfied with being dominated by the Czech Republic, Croatia is also equally hostile to Serbia. The Yugoslav government is currently seeking appropriate solutions, but Croatia is still not satisfied. If Croatia shows any sign, Mussolini will not hesitate to repeat the Czech incident in Yugoslavia, creating Croatia's independence and placing it under Italian protection. Moreover, there are German and Hungarian minorities in the country, so its fate will not be difficult to be the same as that of the Czech Republic.

### British Naval Undersecretary's Budget Proposal: Reporting on Ambitious Plans, Adding Over a Hundred Warships; Naval Supremacy Absolutely Must Not Be Lost

[Reuters, London, 17th] British Naval Undersecretary Shakespeare stated last night when submitting the naval budget proposal to the House of Commons that the British Royal Navy would add forty-three warships this fiscal year, and a further sixty in 1939. He also announced the ambitious measures taken by the British Navy to avoid the threat of submarine attacks and air raids.

Military Production Difficulties Overcome

The new naval shipbuilding plan includes two high-speed, 40,000-ton battleships, each equipped with 16-inch guns. He stated, "We currently have fifteen large battleships, two or three of which were built after the European War. By 1943, we will have twenty-one large battleships. In these years, naval arsenals and shipyards will build approximately two hundred ships, totaling 870,000 tons, including nine battleships, six aircraft carriers, twenty-five cruisers, forty-three destroyers, nineteen submarines, and several other small warships. During the period of retrenchment after the European War, the production of some factories fell behind, but now difficulties have been overcome, and expanded new factories have been completed and can produce to their full capacity. In the past three years, the production of heavy guns has increased twentyfold. As for the current reserves of guns, mines, depth charges, and ammunition, I dare assure this House that they are sufficient for one year of combat." Speaking of the dangers Britain might encounter in wartime, he stated, "If we lose our naval supremacy, we will only starve to death. We believe that today's British fleet is extremely powerful and capable of meeting the challenge of any possible combined fleet."

Escort Methods Sufficient to Destroy Submarines

The threat of submarines in the future will not be as serious as during the last Great War. We see from the results of statistics that the "convoy" system adopted at the end of the European War was indeed successful. Our Admiralty and shipbuilding industry, after two years of close cooperation, are now able to immediately establish a convoy organization along any necessary route after the outbreak of war. We currently have a large number of weapons for attacking submarines, sufficient for application, with over two thousand pieces immediately available. Within a reasonable period, there will be a large increase. By the end of this year, we can expect to have a thousand merchant ships, all of whose decks will be equipped with weapons. Over nine thousand merchant ship officers are studying the "convoy" curriculum. Once war breaks out, the government will acquire a large number of ships for the navy to attack submarines. I believe the British Navy's methods of searching, detecting, and destroying enemy submarines are the best in the world. In January 1938, Britain announced the sinking of any submarine below the surface to eliminate piracy in the Mediterranean. Since this announcement, no piracy cases have occurred. I wish the members of this House to draw their own conclusions."

Air Defense Equipment on Ships Strengthened

Air raids are another threat to the Navy, but the defensive weapons of modern warships, including short-range and long-range firepower, can prevent aircraft from flying low or can only fly at high altitude, so that the accuracy of their attack targets is seriously affected. British policy is to concentrate modern anti-aircraft guns on warships as much as possible, whether short-range or long-range. The defense equipment of modern warships is excellent and can avoid artillery and bomb attacks. The threat of torpedoes and depth charges has also been greatly reduced due to improvements in underwater defense systems, which are sufficient to avoid serious damage below the water surface. He continued, "Since the Naval Air Arm and the Free Air Division were returned to the Admiralty, there has been progress. Soon the Navy will acquire all the aircraft and reserves of the first line, as well as naval training aircraft. Naval aviation personnel, including those undergoing miscoding, have greatly increased. In 1937, there were only three thousand people, but now there are six thousand. Orders for aircraft to be used for the six aircraft carriers under construction have been placed. The development of aviation has greatly increased the strength of the Navy. The only thing lacking in the Navy is skilled mechanics. The government has taken the necessary steps to train naval officers to command the expanded fleet."

Reserve Personnel Reach 70,000

Shakespeare then answered a question, stating, "Our naval reserve personnel are at least 70,000. Those who have served in the Navy, all 60,000 to 70,000, have reached the age of fifty-five. The training of the Royal Naval Reserve has adopted new methods, with three new divisions starting training in Hull, Cardiff, and Southampton, and necessary steps have been taken to organize anti-aircraft gun training. It is now hoped to organize artillery teams within the reserve, which can be dispatched to the fleet for service when mobilization is ordered. In addition, it is hoped to establish ten naval brigades in the voluntary training naval reserve, whose only obligation is moral, that is, to join the naval service in wartime." Lieutenant Colonel Llewellyn stated, "Regarding the position of the British Navy in the Far East, it is not true that it has been driven out of the Yangtze River. We all know that there are various difficulties there, but usually there are forty gunboats stationed there. It is only right that six of them have sailed to Shanghai for repairs or other tasks. I have heard someone criticize the British Naval Rear Admiral in the Yangtze River area. I would like to swear that the naval officers and sailors in that area have gone through extremely difficult times and have been able to perform their duties. This is all that you expect from the Royal Navy."

British Gunboats Still on the Yangtze

Labor Party MP Alexander stated that he did not criticize naval officers in the Yangtze River area, but only criticized the policies they implemented. He also mentioned the Japanese declaration regarding the reopening of the Yangtze River. Lieutenant Colonel Llewellyn replied, "This is a matter for the Foreign Office, but we still have gunboats stationed on the Yangtze River. These gunboats have done good work in the past and are well-regarded by the people there. I still remember the British Chamber of Commerce in Hankou expressing its gratitude to Rear Admiral Halda."

### × Gift of the Invasion of Southern China! Hong Kong's Trade with China Plummets; Last Month's Trade Volume Drops to One-Tenth of Last Year's; Expected Losses This Year Exceed 200 Million Dollars

Since ×'s invasion of Southern China, traffic on various rivers has been blocked, and Hong Kong's trade with Southern China has almost come to a standstill. The figures for trade with Southern China in the last three months of last year have all seen a sharp decline. The situation has become even more serious since the beginning of this year. According to the Hong Kong Import and Export Statistics Office, which issued a report yesterday on the month of February, Hong Kong's trade with Southern China has plummeted. If this continues, the commercial losses this year will exceed 200 million. The various intelligence reports are recorded below. According to the report, Hong Kong's exports to Southern China in February were only worth 731,862 yuan, while in February of last year, they were 7,857,930 yuan. This year's figure is only one-tenth of last year's. If we combine the months of January and February, last year it was 18,366,904 yuan, and this year it was 3,067,693 yuan. The huge difference is truly astonishing. As for imports from Southern China, this year's February figure was 4,847,778 yuan, which is 2,600,1895 yuan less than February of last year. The above refers to trade with Southern China in a single month. If we total the export figures for January and February, this year's total is 9,796,198 yuan, while last year's January and February were 20,405,245 yuan, a decrease of 11 million yuan. If we combine import and export trade, there is a decrease of 22,590,8358 yuan. According to the statistics on Hong Kong's rain trade with China in the past few months since ×'s invasion of Southern China, we know that Hong Kong's trade with Southern China is declining. According to reliable sources, if × continues to occupy Southern China and block the waterways, Hong Kong's commercial losses this year will be at least 200 million yuan. Fortunately, trade with other regions can still maintain a considerable level. It is estimated that the total import volume in February this year was 36,824,820 yuan, only 4,574,051 yuan less than February last year. The total export volume was 36,502,007 yuan, which is 1,949,617 yuan less than the same period last year. If Southern China had been peaceful and able to maintain last year's level, then this year's February export trade would have exceeded last year's by 5 million yuan. In addition, the total import and export trade for January and February last year was 180,914,125 yuan, while this year it was 154,171,949 yuan, a decrease of 36,742,176 yuan.

### Mad Leper Woman Sets Fire While Praying to Gods; Shenzhen Refugee Camp Completely Burned Down; Lack of Fire Fighting Equipment Causes Fire to Burn for Five Hours; Refugees Had Already Moved, Fortunately No Casualties; A Shed in a Tsuen Wan Factory Also Caught Fire Yesterday, Losses Exceeding a Thousand Dollars

The Shenzhen refugee camp, formerly the old sites of Shenzhen Hotel and Yau Ma Tei Theatre, caught fire on the 16th. The fire spread rapidly and was extremely intense. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the reporter personally went to Shenzhen yesterday to investigate. The cause and process of the fire are roughly described below.

Mad Woman Prays to Gods, Summons Fire

It was found that since the refugees moved into British territory last month, only one mad woman, about thirty years old, remained, living in an abandoned wood-covered sampan. The police had inspected and driven her away, but she returned shortly after. On the evening of the 16th, around 8 p.m., the mad woman piled up bamboo and wood scraps behind Shenzhen Theatre, made incense and burned it, prostrated herself and prayed, and then left. At that time, the north wind was strong, and the fire burned the sheds in between, spreading to the entire refugee camp. The fire was so bright that it was impossible to approach. The British territory, including Sheung Shui and Fanling, could also see it from afar.

Police and Customs Officers Rescuing

The police station was located to the left of the Shenzhen Hotel. When the fire was discovered, all the police officers were dispatched to rescue and maintain order to prevent criminals. However, due to the lack of fire-fighting equipment, the fire became more intense. They had no choice but to first dismantle the office of the original refugee camp and the sheds and bamboo fences near the original Red Swastika Society, and water the surrounding houses to prevent them from being affected. At the same time, they telephoned the Sheung Shui Police Station and requested that a fire brigade be sent to fight the fire, but due to various reasons, they could not come. At this time, the Customs also received the news and dispatched a large team of customs officers to assist in the rescue. At the same time, the Shenzhen Rural Cooperative, St. John's Temporary Hospital, and staff from the Railway Party Department all came to help. After 9:30 p.m., the wind direction changed to northeast, so the Children's School, Police Station, Tung Wah Hospital office, Shenzhen Hotel, etc., were not affected. Even the refugee dining hall was intact. The fire gradually subsided after 10 p.m., and was extinguished at 1 a.m. yesterday morning.

Most Houses Burned

After the incident, it was counted that the burned houses included the first, second, and third parts of the refugee dormitory, including the former Sino-Youth Relief Team office, refugee dormitory, kitchen, lighting room, and female restroom. Only a small part, such as the office of the refugee management office, the Chinese office, and the Taiping Bridge male restroom, were not affected. The local refugees had already been evacuated, so there were no casualties. As for the mad woman, the authorities have detained her and interrogated her. It is said that the woman's condition is neurological, and she has confessed to starting the fire. In addition, Xu, acting director of the Central Relief Commission, and officials from the Relief Federation have dispatched personnel to investigate the incident in order to report it truthfully.

Tsuen Wan Sheds Burned Down

Also, at around 3 a.m. yesterday morning, the Kowloon Fire Brigade received a telegram from the Fen Wan Police Station saying that a fire had broken out on Shing Mun Road. After receiving the news, the school immediately dispatched a No. 7 fire engine to fight the fire. The fire was extinguished at around 5 a.m. yesterday morning. It was found that the fire occurred in the workers' dormitory shed of a construction company on Shing Mun Road in Tsuen Wan, which was about 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. At 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the fire broke out for unknown reasons, causing it to be burned down. Fortunately, the workers noticed it early and fled far away from the shed, so there were no casualties. After burning for about two hours, the entire shed was burned down, and the workers' luggage and the shed's losses amounted to over a thousand dollars.

### The Joint Association of Education and Conservation Societies Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Fundraising Methods for Children's Day; It Was Decided to Hold Indoor Flag Presentations and Cash Donations at That Time; The Funds Raised Will Be Used to Set Up a Mechanical Workshop

This year's April 4th Children's Day is approaching. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Joint Association believes that many refugee children have fled to Hong Kong and urgently need relief and education. It is specifically planned to hold a memorial meeting in theaters in various districts on this day, as well as indoor flag presentations and cash donations to raise funds for relief and education. The association held a talk with the Hong Kong Wartime Children's Conservation Association yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. to discuss fundraising methods for that day and the distribution of the funds raised. As a result of the discussion, it was proposed to allocate all the proceeds to set up a mechanical workshop as a place for the refugee children to study, so that each refugee child can support themselves after graduation. As for the size of the workshop, it will depend on the amount of money raised from the flag presentation that day.

### Four Men Attempted to Rob a Taxi Driver on Pok Fu Lam Road Early Yesterday Morning; Tang Bin Escaped Cleverly, and the Car Was Driven to Aberdeen

Taxi driver Tang Bin, residing on the fourth floor of No. 447 Hennessy Road, parked his car near Central the night before. Four men, all dressed neatly, boarded the car and asked to go west, but did not state where they were going. Tang drove as ordered. When they drove to Pok Fu Lam Road near the Milk Company, it was 1:15 a.m. yesterday morning. The area was remote and sparsely populated, and unusually quiet. The men in the car suddenly ordered to stop. Tang stopped suddenly. The four men got out of the car in succession, without paying, and surrounded Tang from all sides. Tang, seeing that the situation was not good and fearing that he would be attacked, suddenly jumped out of the car. The four men rushed forward, attempting to capture him and rob him. Tang, unable to defeat them due to their numbers, abandoned the car and ran away wildly. The four men chased him for a while before giving up. Afterwards, Tang went to the Sai Ying Pun Police Station to report the case, describing the situation in detail as above, and said that he speculated that the four men intended to rob him. The police immediately dispatched detectives from the Central and Western Districts to investigate the whereabouts of the bandits and track down the location of taxi No. 409. At the same time, they telephoned the Aberdeen Police Station and sent a team to intercept them. Later, the car was found on the left side of the road in Aberdeen, but the men in the car had disappeared without a trace. The car was driven back to the Sai Ying Pun Police Station, and Tang was summoned to identify it. The case was filed for investigation and arrest of these four villains.

### Great Development of Broadcasting Industry; The Number of Radio Households Now Reaches Over 10,000; An Increase of Over 19 Times Compared to Ten Years Ago; The Number of Short-Term Licenses Issued Also Reaches Over a Hundred

The broadcasting industry in Hong Kong has made great progress in recent years. In the past ten years, the number of households with radio licenses has increased from over 500 to over 10,000. The progress is truly amazing. Yesterday, the Broadcasting Station released its business report for the past year, which provided a detailed description of the broadcasting industry in Hong Kong. The report stated that as of the end of each year, 10,605 radio licenses have been issued. In order to meet the needs of tourists temporarily residing in Hong Kong, a three-month short-term license was specially set up. The number of such licenses issued also reached 131. In May last year, a new transmitter was installed at the ZE station, specifically broadcasting Chinese programs, so that it can broadcast simultaneously with English programs. The amount of Chinese programs broadcast last year totaled 2,354 hours and 45 minutes. In addition, from April 1 last year, Reuters news messages were translated into Chinese every day and broadcast in Cantonese and Mandarin, which is convenient for residents from the north. In addition, there were many novel programs broadcast last year. At the request of the National Broadcasting Company of the United States, it participated in this year's New Year's Day world broadcasting program through the American Broadcasting Network. This move has achieved quite satisfactory results. As for the number of licenses issued by this station in the past ten years, they are as follows: 545 in 1929, 1,596 in 1930, 1,788 in 1931, 2,466 in 1932, 3,278 in 1933, 4,201 in 1934, 5,104 in 1935, 7,036 in 1936, 8,539 in 1937, and 10,605 in 1938. The broadcasting time for English programs on ZBW broadcasting station is 2,601 hours and 45 minutes, and the broadcasting time for English programs on ZEK is 100 hours and 45 minutes. The broadcasting time for Chinese programs is 204 hours and 15 minutes on ZBW station, and 2,354 hours and 45 minutes on ZEK station. The current list of all members of the station is as follows: Rong Zongshi (Chairman), Zhou Junnian, Liao Yali Ma Da, Qi Dachen, Lai Fu, Morris, Bintelifu, Light Raigent Pastor, Sik Ling, Deckergu, Cao Junan.

### Dissection of the New Central Market

— Aspiration

If a clean and modern market is a perfect symbol of the city's excellent or advanced sanitary administration, then Hong Kong's vigorous construction or reconstruction of markets in recent years is worthy of showing off. Like the Central Market, which is scheduled to open in early May this year, few can add such fresh lustre to Hong Kong's sanitary administration achievements!

This market was still an old building of several decades a few years ago, dark, dirty, and with a fishy smell permeating from the inside, causing everyone who walked past its door to hold their breath and rush past. I am afraid this situation will no longer exist! It has now become a new and clean large building, and people passing by its door at this time are looking at it with "new eyes."

The construction of this new market not only takes into account the convenience of transactions for both vendors and customers, but I believe that no other market in the world is as particular about public health as this one.

This market has four floors, and its exterior is edged with delicate green beauty, which can well express its internal cleanliness. Yes, its interior is inlaid with milky white magnetic tiles, which is easiest for washing work. The current plan is to make the top floor the Cleanliness Bureau and staff offices, and the remaining three floors are used for trading places. It is estimated that there are fifty fish stalls and forty-five chicken and duck stalls in the basement. Behind each fish stall is a scientific double-layered fish pond. The chicken and duck stalls have facilities for slaughtering and a small storage for chicken and duck feed. On the second floor, there are fifty pork stalls and thirty beef stalls. On the third floor, there are fruit stalls and vegetable stalls, the former occupying fifty and the latter occupying thirty.

The stalls here are all for retail trade, and wholesale business will be left to the Kennedy Town Market. However, in terms of transportation, I will not forget to tell the reader that it has four large entrances. The south faces Queen's Road and the north faces Des Voeux Road. These two entrances are for customers to enter and exit. As for the west side Caine Road and the east side Wellington Street, there is a horizontal door for goods to enter and exit, and the platform in Eastern District is designed to facilitate car unloading. The car also has a very large ladder that can accommodate twenty people. This elevator is located next to the north Dou Kongdao.

In short, the entire market is a new type of building. In terms of hygiene, trading convenience, and even city appearance, it can add a lot of luster to Hong Kong. In terms of management, the Hong Kong government wants to thank the Municipal Health Bureau, and in terms of design, it is attributed to the engineer Hershes of the Public Works Department. In the pouring of cement engineering, the engineer Warnor is promoted, and the piling project and decoration are carried out by the Wen Hualu Company and De Xing Company. The other changes in the social scene of the Hong Kong Society during the new transition of this market cannot be ignored, and this change is also quite chain-linked with commerce. So, let's recall that two years ago, when this market was demolished, its meat and fish stalls were all moved to the Sheung Wan Market. As a result, the original fish stalls in the Sheung Wan Market were forced to move to the Western District, and the vegetable stalls were forced to move to Hollywood Road. Later, many newly opened fruit shops were found on Market Road and Avenue Middle.

Now, the new Central Market is about to open. We can all imagine doing a "restored" cycle according to the above-mentioned transformation method!

### Relieving the Grain Shortage; Hong Kong Rice Merchants Plan; Transporting Foreign Rice Back to Guangdong; A Large Amount of Grain Has Been Ordered from Annam and Siam; Cooperating with Industry Peers in Australia and Mainland

The rice shortage in Chaozhou, Shantou, Panyu, Zhongshan and the Five Districts is now becoming increasingly acute. The authorities of various counties and the overseas Chinese groups from various counties in Hong Kong are all disturbed and are trying to find ways to provide relief. On the one hand, they are repeatedly sending telegrams to the central government to request exemption from import tax on foreign rice, and on the other hand, they are actively raising funds to purchase large quantities of foreign rice to return to the various rice-deficient areas in the mainland to hold fair sales, so as to save the tens of millions of people who are about to become starving people from falling into hunger and cold. Yesterday, according to news from the Hong Kong Central Rice Trade Association, the relief of the rice shortage in various counties in the mainland cannot be delayed, and it is also a good opportunity to develop the industry. Therefore, under the rush of various overseas Chinese groups, people in the industry have also risen up to plan to take the opportunity to transport a large amount of foreign rice back to the mainland for sale, hoping to quickly replenish the rice supply in various counties, so that it will not be taken advantage of by one or two profiteers to manipulate and profit, and to give the general public great pain. Regarding the promotion of this plan, it has now been decided to handle the entire steps separately. First, personnel will be dispatched during the day to Macau and the important cities in the Five Districts to contact industry peers there to implement cooperation and plan to promote foreign rice sales, hoping to make a considerable contribution to the food of the people in the mainland. At the same time, they will also consult with the authorities of various counties, so that they can get some help in transportation and reduce various obstacles and difficulties.

At the same time, it is planned that the Macau industry association will jointly consult with the leaders of the Macau overseas Chinese groups to the Macau authorities, requesting permission to transport foreign rice through Macau in the future and to handle it with flexibility. On the other hand, it will begin to order a large amount of grain from Annam, Siam and other places to be transported back to Hong Kong and transferred to the mainland in batches. In the past few days, several large rice shops have sent telegrams to Annam and Siam to order a considerable amount of grain, preparing to start transporting it in a short period of time.

### Strengthening the National Salvation United Front: Unite All Hong Kong Women! The Women's Four Associations Will Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss Expanding the Organization

[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, various women's national salvation associations in Hong Kong have been established one after another. However, due to various reasons, they have been isolated from each other, and there have been few opportunities for connection, which has caused much inconvenience in carrying out work. At the March 8th International Women's Day commemoration meeting, Ms. He Xiangning publicly proposed that the women's groups present immediately establish the Hong Kong Women's United Congress. The Hong Kong Comforting Branch also sent a letter to the Women's Four Associations yesterday, proposing to expand the organization of the Four Associations, include various women's groups in Hong Kong and China, and establish the Hong Kong Women's Joint Council. Since the announcement of this news, people from all walks of life have paid extraordinary attention. Yesterday, our reporter specially interviewed the persons in charge of the Four Women's Associations and various women's groups in Hong Kong to inquire about their attitudes towards this matter.

### Smuggling Is Becoming Increasingly Rampant: Open Armed Smuggling, Equipping Firearms and Running Rampant on the Hong Kong Border, Smuggling Large Quantities of Tungsten Sand, Raw Silk, Etc. from the Mainland to Hong Kong

As the coastline of Guangdong extends, and due to its relationship with British-ruled Hong Kong, smuggling activities are particularly rampant. Especially after the outbreak of the war in South China and the fall of Guangzhou, the customs offices in the war zone have been abolished, and many coastal ports have also been destroyed by gunfire, making it impossible to handle official business. Therefore, smugglers generally regard this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and become even more rampant, openly engaging in armed smuggling, transporting goods back and forth between Hong Kong and the mainland in an endless stream, running rampant without restraint, and significantly affecting national tax revenue.

A Shortcut for Smuggling on the Shenzhen River

At present, there are many smuggling routes in South China, the most prominent of which is the Baojia County border between China and Britain. Baoan is adjacent to the New Territories, separated only by a deep river. The river is shallow in the upper reaches and can be crossed on foot. In the past, smuggling on this route was already very rampant. Smugglers generally take advantage of the slight negligence of the guards during the night to secretly cross the Shenzhen River from the Baoan side and enter British territory. Even if our customs officers and military police discover it afterwards, they have no way to pursue and arrest them. It is estimated that the most smuggled goods to Hong Kong are sand, followed by raw salt, tobacco, and alcohol. As for the goods smuggled from Hong Kong to the mainland, they are kerosene, sugar, and foreign goods.

Armed Entry and Exit, Running Rampant

Recently, smugglers have become increasingly fierce, openly equipped with firearms, and smuggling openly. Sometimes there are no less than twenty or thirty guns, and at least ten or eight guns. Sometimes, even if discovered by customs officers, they are not afraid, and will shoot back if necessary. The audacity of these smugglers is evident. It is reported that most of these smugglers are bandits and local bullies, and many are scattered soldiers. Many of the firearms they use are from the hands of the (text missing) army, so they can run rampant without restraint.

Large Quantities of Raw Silk Smuggled to Hong Kong

As for the Pearl River Basin, Zhongshan, Puhai, Shunde, and Dongguan counties are also channels for smugglers to enter and exit. If the places they pass through are occupied areas, they obtain passage permits from the Guangzhou (text missing) military authorities and the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong, and use small boats to transport goods through the occupied areas to the outer sea of Lingdingyang, where they are transferred to barges and transported to Hong Kong. The goods smuggled from Hong Kong to the mainland are transported by civilian ships to the vicinity of Lingdingyang, where they are transferred to small boats and transported to the mainland for sale. It is learned that the most smuggled goods from this area are raw silk from Shunde. It is learned that the current price of raw silk in the mainland is only HK$100 per picul, while the selling price in Hong Kong is over HK$300. The depth of the profit can be imagined.

Tungsten Sand and Salt Smuggled Continuously

In addition, there is another route for smuggling goods to Hong Kong, which is the Hailufeng County of eastern Guangdong. This area is close to Hong Kong's territorial waters, making entry and exit convenient. Moreover, most of the local customs posts have been destroyed by (text missing) military artillery and no longer exist. Therefore, smuggling is also very serious. The most smuggled goods from Shanwei in this area to Hong Kong are tungsten sand and salt. Smugglers generally move the goods to ships at night, hoist their sails, and transport them to Hong Kong. The goods transported from Hong Kong to that area are mostly daily necessities and foreign goods.

### Special Horse Racing Today: The First Race Starts at 2 PM, with a Total of Nine Races

After the end of the Spring Horse Racing Meeting, there has been a two-week break. Today, the first special horse racing will be held at Happy Valley, starting at 2:00 PM, with a total of nine races. If the weather can be sunny, it is believed that the excitement will be almost the same as during the main meeting. However, affected by the heavy rain in the past few days, the overall time for the horses to race will definitely not be too fast, and it may not be easy to create a new record. There are a total of thirteen special horse races this year, six in the first half of the year until June, and seven in the second half of the year until December. Five of today's nine races are for unwanted horses, limited to horses that have not won once in the main meeting. The remaining four races are handicap races for new and old horses. After this race, the Jockey Club will classify the horses according to their performance. Chinese horses will still be classified into five classes, and Australian horses will still be classified into three classes. The program for future special horse races will mainly be handicap races. It seems that this year's new horses are mostly formidable fellows. When they are mixed with old horses for racing, it will be even more interesting and exciting.

### Many People Still Come South to Make a Living: Singapore Ship Tickets Rise to $200, Cargo Ship Tickets Also Rise to $180

In recent years, many Chinese workers have gone to Singapore and its dependencies to make a living, and have not been significantly affected by the sluggish local rubber and tin industries and the large number of unemployed people. In order to maintain unemployed workers, the Singapore authorities issued a series of orders last year restricting the import of Chinese workers, stipulating that no more than 500 new male and female passengers should enter the country each month. However, this is still not enough to curb the influx of Chinese workers. Each month, the number of people leaving Hong Kong for Southeast Asia still exceeds the quota, and there are still countless people who have obtained exit permits and are waiting for ships to go south. As a result, businessmen involved in this matter recognize this as an opportunity to make money, and ship ticket prices have repeatedly risen, breaking all previous records. It is learned that Singapore passenger tickets are cheap, and the shipping company originally set the price at $80 per ticket. Due to the restrictions on entry by the Singapore authorities and the large number of people going south, and at the same time, some people are manipulating the situation, the price has repeatedly soared. Recently, the market price has reached over $200, setting an unprecedented high. In addition to passenger ships, cargo ships between Hong Kong and Singapore, which have more than a dozen passenger seats, have recently seen many Chinese workers taking advantage of the lower prices due to the rise in passenger ticket prices. Cargo ship passenger tickets, which have never had a fixed price, have also recently seen a rise to over $180 per ticket due to the large number of people switching to cargo ships. Due to the small number of passenger seats, supply and demand do not meet, and purchase is also extremely difficult.

### Hong Kong News Briefs

Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, received a donation of HK$1,000 from overseas Chinese in Sandakan a month ago to subsidize the China Defense League. Madame Sun believed that refugees in various places were displaced, so she specially handed over the total amount to the Relief Federation for the relief of refugees.

The charity ball and dance organized by the Women's Comfort Association is now scheduled to be held at the Hotel Metropole on the afternoons of March 31st and April 1st. It is said that the entertainment program at this charity ball and dance is extraordinarily rich.

The China Youth Relief Association has scheduled a general membership meeting for 2:00 PM on Sunday at Ling Dao Girls' Middle School to discuss the organization of a return-to-China military service team, the 'Review' and 'Training' Committee, and the progress of the research committee's singing class and symposium.

He Hing Peanut Oil is manufactured in a grand factory built by itself on Castle Peak Road in Kowloon. The raw materials are all purchased high-quality peanuts. After production, the latest machines separate and seal them in cans. It is pure, hygienic, nourishing, and rich. Since its promotion, food merchants such as liquor stores and restaurants have adopted it.

### Japanese Cotton Yarn Shipped to Hong Kong for Mixed Sales: Many Factories Adopted the Practice of Shipping It Under Altered Trademarks; The Manufacturers Association Has Stopped Signing Certificates of Origin

Hong Kong's cotton yarn was repurchased from the United Kingdom, Japan, and Shanghai. Since Central China became a war zone and the United Kingdom amended its preferential tariff rules, the amount of Japanese and Shanghai cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong decreased significantly last autumn. However, it has recently shown signs of recovery. According to industrial sources, a large amount of Japanese cotton yarn is being shipped to Hong Kong for sale under altered trademarks in Shanghai. Due to its low price, many weaving factories here have adopted this practice. The reporter further learned that some cotton textile manufacturers have been obtaining certificates of origin from the Manufacturers Association in recent years in order to ship and sell their products to various ports in Southeast Asia. However, the association recently announced that it would temporarily stop issuing them. It is rumored that the Chinese Manufacturers Association is also taking similar steps, but the association authorities deny this. However, when obtaining a certificate, it is necessary to have an inspector check and approve it, and it must be signed by the chairman. According to sources familiar with the matter, it is currently difficult to distinguish the source of cotton yarn, which is mixed. It is believed that the reason for stopping the issuance of certificates of origin is based on this.

### The Situation in Southern Guangdong Has Become Stable; (Japanese) Warships Still Cruise and Spy Along the Coast; The People's Strength Is Sufficient, and the (Japanese) Dare Not Act Rashly; Six or Seven (Japanese) Warships Shuttle Back and Forth Along the Coast

[Southern Guangdong Quick Report] After the (Japanese) invaded Hainan Island, (Japanese) warships in the coastal waters of southern Guangdong moved to Leizhou to spy along the coast. For a time, it was rumored that the (Japanese) would land in Leizhou, so the situation in southern Guangdong became increasingly tense. However, since the military authorities strengthened the defense of southern Guangdong and various counties mobilized the people to fight, the (Japanese) knew that our strength to defend the territory was sufficient and did not dare to act rashly, so the situation has become more stable. In the past ten days, (Japanese) warships have been discovered in various counties along the coast of southern Guangdong from time to time, but they come and go不定, so it is impossible to count their exact number. The following is a summary of information received from various sources in recent days: (1) In the Fangcheng area, two (Japanese) warships are anchored in the Qisha sea area. There were originally two in the Bailongwei sea area. At 4:00 PM on the 10th, a (Japanese) warship with two smokestacks suddenly increased, but there was no unusual movement. (2) In the Beihai area, three (Japanese) warships were anchored in the Guantouling sea area on the afternoon of the 10th. By 7:00 AM on the 11th, all of them had sailed away. There are currently no traces of (Japanese) warships in the nearby sea area. (3) (Japanese) warships still cruise back and forth along the coast of Xuwen from time to time. Three (Japanese) warships were discovered in the Haian sea area on the afternoon of the 12th and immediately sailed east. At present, only six or seven (Japanese) warships are anchored along the coast of Xuwen, all of which are of a patrolling nature, and there is no large-scale invasion action.

### (Japanese) Will Send Matsui to Southern Guangdong to Mediate; (Japanese) Army and Navy Fight Internally; Actively Plan Southern Invasion to Eliminate Internal Conflicts; Our Authorities Have Received Reports and Have Ordered Strict Prevention

[Northern Guangdong Quick Report] The (Japanese) army invading Southern Guangdong has made no progress in the northeastern, western, and western routes after more than four months. Internally, they are threatened by our guerrilla teams, their soldiers are old and tired, and the army and navy are flaunting each other, jealous of each other's merits, and therefore hate each other, resulting in internal conflicts. The (Japanese) chieftain Ando is helpless and telegraphed the General Staff to find a way to mediate and suppress the situation. According to reports from (Japanese) country, Matsui Iwane was dispatched to Southern Guangdong to mediate and suppress the situation. This news has been very noisy recently. According to military news obtained from a certain agency, Matsui indeed took a ship secretly from Shanghai on the 6th of this month, twice convened the invading (Japanese) army, navy, and air force generals, held military meetings, and in addition to instructing new strategies for invasion, he also tried his best to mediate and suppress the internal disputes of the (Japanese) army, navy, and air force. He stayed in Guangdong for several days and was accompanied by Ando to inspect the lines in Guangdong Province and Hainan Island. The content of this meeting is very secret, but according to the investigation by various spies, the main points are: (1) Decide to implement a sweeping policy, with several regiments responsible for completely suppressing our local guerrilla teams to avoid threats and constraints and to stabilize the occupied areas to promote the puppet regime. (2) Increase the strength of the troops in the northwest and east routes, consolidate the defenses of each point and line, so that they can attack when advancing and defend when retreating, and wait for the opportunity to stop advancing. (3) Actively promote the military affairs of Hainan Island, and strive to occupy the entire island in the spring to complete its ideal Pacific military base. For the military affairs of each route, if necessary, do not hesitate to risk expanding the Southern Guangdong military operations to end the war in Southern Guangdong. The above three points are military issues, and there are also discussions on other economic invasions, roughly increasing the transport of (Japanese) goods to Guangdong, establishing factories and households, manufacturing and dumping as much as possible, and implementing economic aggression. After receiving this news, our military authorities have ordered their subordinates to take strict precautions.

### Most (Japanese) Soldiers Are Against the War; They Surrender or Defect One After Another; More Than Eighty (Japanese) Soldiers Mutinied in Shiwan; (Japanese) Chieftains Are Helpless About the Problem of (Japanese) Soldiers' War Weariness

[Nanhai Quick Report] The (Japanese) army stationed at the Shiwan Taoist Temple in Nanhai, including a group of about one hundred Taiwanese and Korean soldiers, suddenly mutinied a few days ago due to lack of food and unpaid pay. The (Japanese) military police in Foshan dispatched a team to execute the ringleaders. Recently, it has been found that since the (Japanese) army in Foshan experienced a mutiny by Taiwanese and Korean soldiers, they have paid close attention to the actions of Taiwanese and Korean soldiers and have been under strict surveillance. Recently, Taiwanese and Korean soldiers have been prohibited from asking for leave to go out in groups of three or five. It has also been found that the (Japanese) army has always treated Taiwanese and Korean (Japanese) soldiers and Northeastern puppet soldiers very harshly. Recently, Taiwanese and Korean soldiers and Northeastern puppet soldiers fighting in Guangdong have been weary of war due to lack of food and pay. Recently, some have sincerely surrendered to our guerrilla teams, and there have also been many who have defected to resist the (Japanese). At present, the (Japanese) chieftains in Foshan have no other way to control the problem of Taiwanese and Korean soldiers' war weariness except for strict surveillance. It has also been heard that the eighty Taiwanese and Korean soldiers who mutinied in Shiwan a few days ago and were intercepted by the (Japanese) military police were escorted back to the Guangzhou (Japanese) military police headquarters for interrogation on the 12th and are now imprisoned at the old site of the Japanese military school in Shahe awaiting execution.

### The Movement of the (Japanese) Army in Sanshui; Add Construction Works at the End of the Old Sanshui Cape; 700 (Japanese) Soldiers Transferred to Hekou

[Xijiang Quick Report] The recent movements of the (Japanese) army in Sanshui are as follows:

One

The (Japanese) army in Hekou, Sanshui, has continued to increase in recent days. Yesterday (14th), six or seven hundred infantry and artillery soldiers were transferred from Guangzhou to Hekou, along with twelve steel cannons, twenty-two light machine guns, and forty or fifty military technicians, distributed in Hekou, Sanshui. A wooden bridge was added to the Hekou pier to facilitate lotus transport.

Two

The (Japanese) soldiers in the old Sanshui Village and Jiaowei area have continued to increase by two or three hundred people, building fortifications. They are currently stationed in the old Sanshui area, about 2,000 meters away from our army's sentry posts. Yesterday (14th) morning at about 8:00, about 70 or 80 (Japanese) soldiers opened two electric boats from Hekou, landed in the old Sanshui Village, and sent more than 20 soldiers to harass the village. More than 20 people were building fortifications on the side of the old Sanshui Village. Among the more than 200 (Japanese) soldiers from Hekou to the old Sanshui Village, half are engineers.

Three

On the morning of the 15th, about 100 (Japanese) soldiers from the (Japanese) army of Matsuo opened three electric boats from Xinlu and went to the old Sanshui area to guard. At about 11:00 AM, a (Japanese) officer and an interpreter (that is, a translator) led more than 20 (Japanese) soldiers from Xinlu to Jiaowei and gathered villagers in the old Sanshui Village to discuss matters such as compiling household numbers and issuing good citizen certificates. At 2:30 PM, the (Japanese) sent fifty or sixty people to guard in the Sanzhurong area, set up canvas tents, and requisitioned our original telephone lines for the purpose of drawing trenches. The rest retreated to the old Sanshui.

Four

On the morning of the 15th at 10:30 AM, more than 100 (Japanese) soldiers stationed in Mumian opened machine guns and fired at our Zao Gang area. We also returned fire with machine guns. It stopped after about half an hour. We suffered no losses. At 12:20 PM at noon, seven (Japanese) planes flew to the Zao Gang Qingqi area to bomb, dropping two bombs, killing and injuring several villagers.

### Guangzhou Women Soldiers Completed Training in Lian County; Each Team Member Possesses Excellent Tactics; Now Changed the Number to the Women's Work Corps

[Lian County Quick Report] Before Guangzhou was lost, the National Army Training Association had concentrated women soldiers from the entire city to implement military training. There were 800 women soldiers who had received considerable training, including young ladies from boudoirs, female workers from restaurants and teahouses, and technicians from women's hair salons, all of whom were able to stand on the front line of the War of Resistance and received strict military training. When Guangzhou was lost, most of them still retreated with the army to the area between Xijiang Guangning Gushui. They were incorporated by the Xijiang Eight Counties Guerrilla Headquarters and renamed the Eight Counties Women's Guerrilla Team. At that time, about 500 people were incorporated. They continued to train guerrilla tactics in the Gushui area. Each team member can display the best tactics. Later, due to the cold climate in Xijiang, more than 40 team members suffered from illnesses and were discharged from the army. Now this group of women soldiers, led by regiment commander Chen Mingshu, has traveled from Gushui to Lian County to listen to training. There are a total of 400 people who arrived in Lian County this time. They were warmly welcomed by all walks of life when they arrived in Lian County. They have now changed their number to the Women's Work Corps and will engage in replenishment in Lian County before being sent to Shaoguan and various townships to guide women's wartime organization.

### The Movement of (Japanese) Aircraft and (Japanese) Warships in the Chaoshan Sea Area

[Shantou Communication] No air raid sirens have been issued in Shantou City for two days. Yesterday, the 14th, at 2:35 PM, a (Japanese) aircraft took off from the sea, circled once over Nan'ao, and then flew diagonally into the high altitude of Shantou City. It did not drop bombs when passing by and flew towards Chaoyang Guangao. It went through Haimen Longtoushan, spying on Chaoyang County. In the Houxi area of Chaoyang, it dropped four bombs, mistakenly thinking that the open-air shed factory was guarded by troops. The bombs landed in the open space and caused no damage. After three o'clock, they fled to the national border. In recent days, the Chaoshan Sea area has been calm. There are very few (Japanese) warships coming and going. On the evening of the 14th, a (Japanese) destroyer was discovered on Longtoushan, Chaoyang, sailing from east to west. There was no unusual movement.

### The Third District Commissioner's Office Strictly Investigates Unscrupulous Merchants Who Manipulate Finance

[Zhaoqing Quick Report] The invasion of (Japanese) is doing everything possible. Recently, they have attempted to disrupt our finances, instigate traitors to infiltrate the mainland, incite the people to discount national currency at low prices, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to manipulate the situation. There are even corrupt financial personnel who have taken the opportunity to squeeze out expenses. Li Leifu, the administrative commissioner of the Third District, has found that the ratio of national currency to cent banknotes in each county under his jurisdiction has mostly fallen to between 1:35 and 1:40. It is not uncommon for traitors and gangsters to be used by (Japanese) in an attempt to undermine national finance, which is extremely hateful. A ban is reiterated that the ratio of legal tender to cent banknotes must be uniformly implemented in accordance with the regulations, and that private discounting and high prices are not allowed. In order to prevent them from disobeying in secret, he has ordered each county to send personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished severely on charges of undermining finance. As for the various institutions under his jurisdiction, if there is a situation of fabricating names and discounting national currency at low prices, the people are allowed to report at any time in order to warn against illegal activities.

### A Visit to New Tamsui (Continued)

— Fu Ran

(4) Those Who Sink, Defeatists

In this turbulent era, the brave, determined, and politically aware Guomindang members are constantly advancing. However, the timid, wavering, and those with a vague understanding become pessimistic, despairing, and cry in confusion before this great era, losing their courage to fight. Not to mention the general public, even among the youth, we often find such dregs of the times. They are pessimistic, they run away, they treat their jobs as idols, they use pre-death revelry to numb themselves, they consider themselves as not fitting in with the times, wanting to sink downwards, they are defeatists. This is a serious problem during this important period of the War of Resistance, causing a massive depletion of resistance forces.

Increasing New Strength on the Foundation of Victory, Overcoming New Difficulties

In summary, we can reach this conclusion: Tamsui is breaking through to a new path. However, on this new path, there are many difficulties hindering it. Undoubtedly, if we do not overcome the current difficulties with the greatest effort, the new Tamsui cannot grow.

(1) Placing Armed Work First

The situation is tense. Those engaged in national salvation work should place armed work in the first position, raising the slogan of "everything is for resisting Japan, for organizing the armed forces of the people." Mobilize members of the Comrade Association to participate in armed organizations, and implement strict political education and military training under the unified name of the Social Training Corps.

(2) Consolidating and Expanding the Organization of the District Anti-Japanese Comrade Association

Although the People's Anti-Japanese Comrade Association now has more than 10,000 members, it is still not enough. The district association has not been established, and many township branches are just starting. The district government should assist the support association in preserving and promoting its valuable work experience, and earnestly consolidate and expand it, organizing it extensively and deeply.

(3) Intensifying the Work of Eliminating Traitors

Expand and consolidate the traitor-punishment committee affiliated with the support association and the traitor-apprehension teams of the various township anti-Japanese comrade associations, announce regulations for punishing traitors, and universally discuss the issue of eliminating traitors in various mass meetings, and clear out the Tamsui puppet Security Maintenance Association.

(4) Intensifying the Establishment of an Intelligence Network

In addition to reorganizing and adding telephone services, township Comrade Associations should also intensify the establishment of relay outposts and communication teams to transmit accurate intelligence from various locations.

(5) Closely Linking District Administration and National Salvation

District administration work and national salvation work not only cannot be separated but must also be closely linked because politics and national salvation are the same thing. The development of politics and the development of national salvation should be coordinated. To put it plainly, all national salvation organizations, such as the Anti-Japanese Comrade Association, the Anti-Japanese Support Association, the Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps, the Rescue Team, the Social Training Corps... should assist the development and consolidation of district administration as much as possible. Similarly, the district government should also provide mutual assistance as much as possible.

(6) Implementing a Grand Alliance

Political newcomers and those engaged in national salvation work should urgently change their past practices, actively strive for alliances with gentry, celebrities, and people from all levels and classes, striving for their guidance and assistance in work, and mutually supervise and encourage each other under the principle of mutual assistance and concession, developing in a balanced way.

(7) Consolidating Lower-Level Organizations

The district government should earnestly consolidate the organization of the pao-chia (neighborhood units) in each township, and the support association should earnestly consolidate the organization of each Comrade Association, so that the lower-level organizations can truly implement all the tasks of politics and national salvation on the same front, so that actions are unified and responses are interconnected.

Final Few Words

New Tamsui is progressing, but heavy difficulties lie ahead of New Tamsui. Those who should be responsible for resolving these difficulties are not only those engaged in national salvation work, and not only district government personnel, but all the people of Tamsui. Moreover, those engaged in national salvation work and district government personnel alone cannot resolve them no matter how hard they try! We must rely on the power of all the people of Tamsui.

Here, we would like to pay our respects to the work of those engaged in national salvation work and district government personnel in Tamsui. However, we hope even more that they will not succumb to the difficulties, and that they will fight well for the anti-Japanese national united front. Furthermore, we hope that all the people of Tamsui will think about the future of Tamsui and the future of the nation during this difficult time of the War of Resistance, abandoning narrow-minded ideas, letting go of prejudices, and uniting together. "Unity is victory."

Tamsui is the frontline facing the river. I have described the outline of this new Tamsui, not just to make people understand her posture. I am hoping that New Tamsui can strive for victory on the basis of progress, and hoping that enthusiastic compatriots can pay special attention to her progress and help her progress.

### New Trends Among Shanghai Moviegoers:  Talks Given by Cinema Managers

Recently, in order to find out the Shanghai moviegoers’ preferences, dislikes, and general attitudes, the Shanghai Continental Daily visited managers of various major cinemas. The news obtained can be introduced to readers.

Favorite Male Star is Errol Flynn

Among Hollywood male stars, Shanghai moviegoers currently like Errol Flynn the most. The movies he starred in, “Robin Hood” and “Dawn Patrol,” were the most popular. Following Errol Flynn, Shanghai moviegoers expressed their preference for Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, and William Powell.

Favorite Female Star is Deanna Durbin

Among Hollywood female stars, just like Errol Flynn, the most popular with Shanghai moviegoers is Deanna Durbin. The Asian Cinema Company printed 10,000 photos of Deanna Durbin, but within three days, everyone had asked for them.

Shirley Temple is Also Still Strong

In recent years, Hollywood has been predicting the decline of Shirley Temple. However, as far as Shanghai moviegoers are concerned, they still welcome this child star as before. It is said that whenever a film starring her is released, it will definitely be full. Therefore, a cinema manager stated that Shirley Temple's box office performance in Shanghai has not declined.

Norma Shearer Remains Popular

Norma Shearer, especially after the public screening of "Marie Antoinette," is particularly loved by Shanghai moviegoers.

"Snow White" is the Most Popular

In addition, Hollywood film companies generally use great scenes to produce magnificent blockbusters. According to a cinema manager, the length of a film's run depends on this point. Films with great scenes and magnificent settings will definitely have their runs extended. In the past year, the most popular film among Shanghai audiences was "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." Even in second-run cinemas, it was shown five times a day, and each show was packed with audiences, with many people being turned away at the door. The second most popular film behind "Snow White" was "Robin Hood." In terms of the producer's profit, the latter actually exceeded the former.

New Trends in Chinese Films

Regarding Chinese films, one manager pointed out that the popularity of historical films also has its reasons. Under the current tense situation, only this type of typical film can be unobstructed. Compared to current films, they are less subject to censorship. The main reason is the attitude of the producers, who believe that a film will not make money if it encounters obstacles during censorship. Therefore, they no longer produce films that will be censored. Most of the films that are censored are afraid of offending "certain countries" when they are publicly screened in the complex city of Shanghai.

The Problem of Charlie Chaplin's New Film

Finally, regarding the problem of Charlie Chaplin's new film, cinema managers cannot predict whether this film will be publicly screened in Shanghai in the future. However, they all affirmed that Charlie Chaplin has always been welcomed by Chinese audiences. Chaplin's films, and those co-starring Laurel and Hardy, can always get good box office results. As for the issue of Laurel and Hardy splitting up, one manager believes that after the split, Laurel should join Chaplin's team. They are both comedians and should work together. Chaplin's new film will feature him speaking for the first time on the screen. The reason he avoided speaking before was because he thought his language was too refined and not suitable for his cane. But now, in his film depicting dictators, it is naturally more appropriate for him to speak the language of "educated" people.

### Public Performance of Anti-Japanese Entertainment in the Guerrilla Zone of Suburban Shanghai

After the westward withdrawal of the National Army, important points and lines in various counties in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Shanghai, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Baoshan, Jiading, and Songjiang, successively fell under the iron heels of the Japanese army. However, most of the political power is still under the control of our mobile troops. It is reported that the Shanghai suburban guerrillas, in addition to occasionally attacking Japanese strongholds using the method of making a feint in the east and attacking in the west, have specially organized an anti-Japanese mobile theater troupe to perform anti-Japanese dramas in order to increase the anti-Japanese sentiment and spirit of the people in the guerrilla zone. The troupe is headed by Mr. Li, and the actors are all selected young patriots who love art. Their debut drama, "Thieves of Peace," has been completed and is currently being actively rehearsed and will soon be performed in rotation in various towns and villages.

Hollywood dance instructor Le Roy Prinz, whose life's work is selecting and training women for the screen, said, "If you want to know a woman's identity and character, you don't need to take her to an astrologer or a palm reader. Just look at her legs and you can tell. If a woman has long kneecaps, she will definitely be not only amorous and considerate, but also loyal and reliable. You can also see a woman's character in the way she walks. Smart and sophisticated women lift their legs high when they walk. Women with confidence and boldness must have an unrestrained attitude when they walk. Coy women walk with timid and unsteady steps. Frivolous and lazy women often walk with uneven, suddenly long and suddenly short steps. Women with hard knees definitely have a strong character. This is my experience. If you don't believe me, you can try it."

Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine, don't let their faces fool you, they're direct sisters. But they're always going their separate ways, never going on trips together, and their friends are separate too, each making their own friends. And on the contract Joan signed for her first film, there was a clause that she could never say that Olivia was her sister. Although they may have different opinions due to their different personalities, it's a bit too much to not acknowledge their sisterhood.

After Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone's divorce became a reality, Hollywood was in an uproar, and everyone was talking about Joan and Richard Cromwell's romance. Richard is also considered a dashing young man in Hollywood. He and Joan have known each other for almost ten years. He also visited Joan and Van Heflin's home. Later, he also became friends with Franchot Tone. He certainly has a great admiration for Joan. Recently, he even sculpted a bust of Joan and keeps it at home. Joan, on the other hand, acknowledges that Richard is a handsome, capable, and rare man. Therefore, according to general observation, it would not be unexpected if there was a feeling beyond friendship between them.

One night, Robert Young's neighbors saw someone trying to open the door to Robert Young's house. They knew that Robert Young was not at home that night, and his servant was on vacation. Without a doubt, the person at the door late at night was a "thief." Robert Young is usually very friendly, so how could they not help when they saw that his house was about to be robbed? So, they immediately reported it to the police. Suddenly, police sirens blared, and many police officers arrived, shining their flashlights everywhere. Sure enough, the "thief" was climbing on the kitchen window, trying to jump inside. The police rushed up and caught him. But he opened his mouth and said, "If someone forgets to bring their key when they go out, can't they think of a way to get into their own house?" Needless to say, Robert Young was performing his usual absurd style. But since so many people had been busy for half the night because of him, he felt a little embarrassed, so he invited them all into the house and treated them to some tea and water to express his gratitude.

### Li Wah Cup Finals Next Weekend;  Civil Servants Team Decides on Lineup, Hope Chinese Team Sends Best Players to Compete

(Reported by this newspaper) We still remember the Li Wah Cup Preliminary Football Game held on February 18th at the Hong Kong Stadium. At that time, the selection of players for the Chinese team was quite difficult because South China had recruited Gong Wo. Fortunately, Li Huitang spared no effort to contribute his services and led a group of young players to compete with the Navy team. Because all the soldiers fought bravely on the battlefield, they finally eliminated the Navy with a large score of four to one and won the right to the final.

On the other hand, the Civil Servants team defeated the Army team and also won the final spot. The final date was originally scheduled for April 2nd. As it happened, the Singapore Chinese team came to Hong Kong to compete, so this championship battle was brought forward to March 26th (Sunday).

Now that the war period is near, the General Association responsible for selecting the Civil Servants team has already selected the players yesterday. Although the entire front line is not very complete, the strength is still not weak. The front line has Gao Shanhong, and the central defense has Purvis. Both are people who have experienced many battles. It is hoped that the Chinese team will select the best players to play, and it may be a good idea to invite Li Huitang to participate again. Since he made a great contribution in the previous match, he can be re-elected as the team leader for this final. At that time, if he fights and wins the championship, he will naturally be happy to personally accept the glory of the award. However, it is not known whether he is willing to contribute his services again. (Dong Lang)

### Important Football Match Today;  South China and Eastern Fight Strong Teams;  Victory or Defeat Matters Greatly for Championship

(Special Report from this newspaper) The championship account for the First Division Football League only owes the final calculation of "one in two in each encounter". Whether it belongs to South China or falls into the hands of the Navy will be guaranteed to be revealed by the end of this month. But for fans who want to know what happens next, please do not neglect today's several important games.

Today, the attention of general fans will of course focus on the two matches between South China vs Police and Eastern vs Navy. However, they should respond in different ways. What is their intention? However, do as you please.

In the four games of the group, in terms of strength, South China should beat the Police. The Eastern and Navy game will be a fierce battle, and the outcome cannot be predicted. Mito will definitely lose to St. Joseph's, and South China will have a fierce contest with Kowloon Club.

One point worth noting is that all three Chinese teams are guest teams tonight and play their matches on the opponents' home ground. This home advantage may lead to unexpected results. It is hoped that the three Chinese teams will work hard to overcome their difficult situations and bear the profit themselves.

Driven by the hope of winning the championship, South China will send its original lineup to play. Liu Qingcai, who had a foot injury, can play, so the overall strength is strong. On the Police side, there will be changes in the lineup, with Jia Da playing on the inside street and Gordon playing in the middle field with a very unfamiliar name. In the future, the Police will ultimately not be South China's opponent. The two teams are as follows:

South China

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan

Li Guowei Lei Rongzhao Liu Qingcai

Luo Yao Wen Guo Yuanqi Feng Zhongxiang Li Zhaorong Zheng Guangsen

Police Association

McHardy

Parker Bullock Brown

Burton Gordon Naifu

Morse Flower Leah Fan Guicai Watts Huang Wengui

Eastern's hope of winning the runner-up has become increasingly faint. They must win against the Navy today and win all the subsequent matches in order to compete for an equal position with the Navy. If there is another loss, they will not be able to climb to second place. It is said that Hou Chengtou and Song Lingsheng of Eastern will rest due to foot injuries and will not participate in the war. If this is the case, it is not very optimistic. The Navy's personnel are no better than before. If all the members of Eastern are of one mind and one heart, they may be able to win two points. The Eastern formation is as follows:

Eastern Association

Liu Xianhan

Miao Huaguo Xu Buyun

Luo Weiquan Zeng Zhongyun Liu Shizan

Yu Qiaxing Xu Jingcheng Li Deqi Wu Qixiang Chen Bingtou

The South China vs Kowloon Club game will be held at the Kowloon Club, and the home advantage is more important than anything else. Kowloon Club has never failed when playing at home. Therefore, it is difficult for South China to win today. Perhaps the members will perform as they did when they defeated the Navy, and then there is still hope. Work hard and break the Kowloon Club's unbeaten record at home. The two formations are as follows: (Taisui)

South China

Tan Junkun

According to the General Association Reporter, it was discovered at last week's Silver Shield semi-final that someone was selling fake tickets outside the stadium. In order to prevent this abuse, spectators tomorrow must purchase tickets from the ticket office before being allowed to enter the stadium, and children are not allowed to enter without a ticket. Ticket sales are also limited. If the limited number of tickets is sold out, all doors will be closed. Spectators who want to avoid missing out due to being full, please arrive early.

### Tonight's Basketball Game;  First Division Eastern Meets South China

There are two public men's basketball games tonight at the basketball hall. The first game (6:30 PM) is the Second Division International vs Taikoo. The second game (7:30 PM) is the First Division Eastern vs South China. The last game (8:30 PM) is the Second Division Hua Xiong vs South China. The game between Taikoo and International is evenly matched, and the outcome cannot be predicted. The game between Yinfang and South China is a First Division game and is sure to attract attention. Moreover, the fighting power of both sides is extremely strong. Eastern's lineup includes Xu Heng, Huang Dingfen, Feng Nianhua, and Chen Qizong, all of whom have good skills and are excellent materials for the front line. Sun Baoqing, Luo Jian, Wu Huaxiong, etc. are stationed on the border and defend with skill. On the South China side, the Shi brothers are known for being agile, and Xiao Jiemin, Lu Enjing, Chen Bangzhen, etc. also have the ability to overcome obstacles and defeat generals. Meeting in the arena tonight is sure to be a fierce battle. Hua Xiong vs South China B. Hua Xiong's team has Yao Junjie, Lu Bin, Li Rumin, Huang Zhaopan, etc., who are not weak in combat power. South China has Wu Haifu, Deng Lianhong, etc., but the talents of the entire army are not evenly distributed, and I am afraid they are not Hua Xiong's enemy. The players of each team are as follows:

First Division

(Eastern Society) Feng Nianhua, Xu Heng, Huang Dingfen, Sun Baoqing, Luo Jian, Wu Huaxiong, Tie Guoneng, Wu Guoxiang, Chen Qishi, Lao Tao,

(South China) Xiao Jiemin, Lu En, Qian Jinghui, Shi Zhen, Shi Zhenda, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xinqu, Chen Bangzhen,

(Second Division)

(International Team) Li Guoqi, Li Bonian, Li Yue, Huang Guoyi, Zhang Guangze, Hu Guangwen, Guo En, Chen Zihua, Yuan Fang, Chen Yongfa,

(Hua Xiong Team) Yao Junjie, Hong Xiaotai, Huang Zhaopan, Li Yumin, Lu Bin,

(South China B) Wu Haifu, Deng Lianhong, Huang Haitang, Liu Bingshuo, Chen Jinghui, Wei Enrong, Lin Gou Xian, Chen Chuli, Deng Yaoming, Lin Zhishu,

### University Hall Athletic Meet Held Today

### Da Linzhen's Majestic Demeanor Undiminished: Easily Defeats Yi Yunshi Yesterday with Scores of 6-1 in Two Straight Sets

The open lawn tennis tournament held only one singles match yesterday, between Yi Yunshi and Da Linzhen. The match was quite exciting, with Linzhen repeatedly using left and right-hand smashes to attack his opponent. Yi Yunshi was frequently under threat. In the first set, Linzhen won 6-1. In the second set, Linzhen continued his momentum, winning again with the same score.

Yesterday's Results:

Da Linzhen defeats Yi Yunshi, 6-1, 6-1.

### Volleyball Match: South China versus Bai Lu

The Dasheng Cup volleyball tournament will be held today at 3:00 PM, with South China playing Bai Lu at the Bu Qiu court. South China boasts players such as Zeng Quan, He Peigen, Hu Yaodong, and Li Zhenzhong, making their team quite formidable. Bai Lu also has players such as Chen Moji, Ma Quandong, Deng Xichou, and Yu Tingqi, but their team coordination is not consistent, so they are likely no match for South China. The lineups for both teams are as follows:

South China

First Row Second Row Third Row

Yu Junrui Xu Zijun Chen Jirao

Li Baotian Yu Qien Wu Xiangbai

Liang Xihong Hu Yaodong Li Zhenzhong

Bai Lu

### Li Huitang and Tan Jungan Can Both Go to the Philippines for Competition; Parker Will Return to England and Cannot Accompany

[Our Report] The Hong Kong football team going to the Philippines for recruitment soon has already finalized a list of fifteen players, with Li Huitang as captain. According to Huitang, the issue of his and Tan Jungan's leave still depended on the return of the manager of the Rui Team Foreign Firm (where both Li and Tan work) to Hong Kong for confirmation. Yesterday, Li and Tan informed the General Association that they could both make the trip. Also, Parker will be returning to England during the day and cannot join the team in the Philippines, and has informed the General Association, requesting that they select someone else to fill his position.

### Also Talking About Children's Sports (II)

— Chu Fa Lu

Again, there's the singing game, usually used for kindergarten teaching materials. Its composition is rigid and adheres to old methods. There is a lot of singing and little movement, and the movements are mostly dull and lacking in interest, insufficient to meet the needs of children's physical and mental development. Facts tell us that only larger kindergartens can use this type of material. Smaller schools either incorporate these soft materials with older children or lack materials suitable for younger children.

The main reason for this disparity is that everyone sees physical education as too easy and is unwilling to study it diligently. Secondly, elementary school physical education teachers lack formal professional training and do not know what teaching methods and appropriate materials are. Asking them to do something beyond their capabilities is like a fool's dream.

The scope of physical education not only includes exercises that directly affect children's physiques but also indirectly affects hygiene matters. Exercise and hygiene are truly interdependent and closely related. Those who advocate military physical training should not only pay attention to exercise and neglect hygiene. If one trains on one hand and becomes ill on the other, then the benefits gained from exercise will certainly not compensate for the harm caused by poor hygiene. This is an obvious fact that needs no further explanation. Our country's physical training for children focuses on direct exercise, while indirect hygiene is not even discussed.

As mentioned earlier, children's lives, besides movement and sleep, also include eating, one of the three parts, especially during infancy, when their appetite is even stronger. We can see that whenever they get something, regardless of whether it tastes good or not, whether they can eat it or not, they put it in their mouths. However, because their intelligence is underdeveloped, they lack judgment and therefore do not know restraint. As long as they can eat, they eat everything, not caring about the capacity of their stomachs or their digestive abilities. Children eat unlimitedly like this because they are ignorant. Parents are knowledgeable and should guide them to restrain themselves, but they often ignore everything. As soon as they hear a child wants to eat, they immediately give them food, even when the child is crying not for food. They need to know that a child's stomach is not bottomless, and their digestion is not unlimited. Giving them food without limit will only fill their stomach, forcing them to digest faster, and what cannot be digested will be expelled through the anus. The result will inevitably lead to the digestive organs being overworked and exhausted, eventually leading to eating only what is excreted, unable to be transformed into nutrients to nourish the body. This is the same as not eating, and at the same time, it will cause malnutrition and postnatal deficiencies. (To be continued)

### Say What You Think

— Wei Fei

Nothing to do at night, sitting idly on a chair thinking: "When a person reaches the point of shamelessness, they really have lost their humanity." Suddenly, there came a burst of barking, very strange, as if very sad. My thoughts were also shifted to remember that there are some very peculiar, rare, and quite clever "dogs" in the world.

Some gluttonous dogs, as long as someone has given them something to eat or raised them, will wag their tails a few times in front of the person, jump a few times, sniff around the person's feet, or make various gestures to please the person, maybe even do something for the person, guard the door; if they meet a stranger, they will bark or bite, if they are given more food and raised well, they will become the master's attendants, follow the master on the street, sometimes when the master needs them to do something, they will tell them to do it, because they have no humanity, they are dogs, people will not blame them, say they are despicable, cheap, maybe even give a slight smile from the nostrils; and themselves? They also do not feel despicable, cheap, nor do they care about (or are not afraid of) people's laughter, and feel that they are very loyal and diligent in serving the master, very great, loyal, and capable, often walking with a sway, however, they are also quite clever, although they know that they are so capable, but they never leave the master's heels a step, because they feel that when they leave, it is like a baby losing its protective mother, although they cherish their lives so much, they sometimes, because companions do not share food clearly, they will disregard their lives, barking or biting each other, this is their characteristic.

There are also some dogs that are not very gluttonous, but in order to be loyal to the master, when the master is speaking or about to speak, they will chime in or bark a few times in advance, but unfortunately, people get impatient and drive them away together. Even children feel that "dead dogs" are coming. Originally, they could always walk to the master's side, but the master also happened to be frustrated, he felt very bored, maybe the master no longer had the strength to care about them, so they quietly slipped away to another place, although in the middle there was still a faint and sad barking, but no one cared about them anymore, because the master's frustration was a small matter, their own expulsion was a big matter, becoming even more boring. For their own sake, for the master's sake, from any point of view, it is necessary to find a way to save this critical situation, first, to praise themselves, not to be driven away so badly again, second, to confuse a group of wavering people at the crossroads, and further pull back a group of like-minded and loyal servants of the master and buy a group who only hope to get more to eat, although there is also this need or plan, it is too inappropriate for them to do it themselves, so a group of small dogs with missions went to various places to mingle or bark, verbal barking is of course ineffective, to be more effective, widely publicized, they cannot escape from blowing in newspapers and publications, however, it is impossible to blow in the place where they were driven away, and it is not very useful to blow in the master's place, only in the place between the two, there are many of his × people, and those × people have no power to drive him away, scolding or laughing, he "does not care about (or is not afraid of)", then, he loudly promotes it in a certain daily newspaper, a certain weekly newspaper, and two obscene tabloids.

Perhaps dogs are always dogs, and the sound of the drums is indeed difficult to hear, maybe that is why there are not many readers, and they gradually feel bored, but not barking is not an option, when bored, they can only bark randomly, or deliberately reverse people's right and wrong, accuse people falsely... in short, they themselves have become a drowning dog, and also want to pull people into the water together.

Generally, the more they bark randomly, the fewer listeners and more beaters there are, and in the end, there will be a day when everyone shouts to beat them.

### On the Lake

— Peng Chenghui

It is a vast expanse of white, a silver lake of ten thousand acres, the shore is covered with dense reeds, and flocks of gulls occasionally fly up from them. On the mountain side across the lake, there are many sparsely scattered houses, and the smoke from cooking is rising from the chimneys of every household, a wisp at a time, deeply into the clouds.

The rising sunlight shines brightly, like the ancient "Liangshanbo." The gentle morning breeze blows lightly. On the surface of the lake, there are constantly thousands of ripples, the colors of the lake and mountains, in this bright morning light, are fully performing their magnificent, natural beauty.

At this time, Mei and I are standing on a corner of the lake, admiring this beautiful water and mountain scenery. We gaze at the changes in the morning glow in the sky and look down at the ripples of the waves. We are stunned, as if we have stepped into a poetic dreamland.

Suddenly, from the reeds about a hundred yards away from us, a small boat glides out. On it, there is only a girl rowing with a single oar. The sound of the oar rises and falls rhythmically, and the boat sails towards the center of the lake like an arrow following the sound of the oar. Mixed with it is a sweet singing, breaking the silence of the air:

The sun rises, the morning breeze is cool,

Ah Nong rows her oar,

To meet my love,

The government's military orders are issued,

Sending my love to the battlefield—

My love has the ambition to serve the country.

Hearing the news, I am as happy as mad.

From now on, he will have the chance to kill the Japanese pirates,

Not failing the good times for brave men.

My love should know,

The Japanese pirates are very cruel,

Our land is invaded year after year,

Cities are burned day by day,

How many millions of homes have been destroyed?

How many millions of lives have been killed?

If this revenge is not avenged today, when will it be avenged?

If this hatred is not eliminated today, when will it be eliminated?

My love! Grip your gun tightly, run forward

Drink the blood of the Japanese devils,

Eat the flesh of the Japanese devils!

My love, remember,

Do not hesitate on the battlefield,

Under the overturned nest, there are no intact eggs,

Men serve the country at this time,

If the country is broken and the family is destroyed, there will be no peace,

Only to be slaves for generations to come,

My love, advance bravely!

Do not sadly bid farewell to Ah Nong!

The sun rises, the morning breeze is cool,

Ah Nong rows her oar,

To see off my lover,

I wish my love to advance bravely,

Grip your gun and go to the battlefield,

Kill all the traitors and then stop,

Recover our land and promote our country,

My love, advance bravely,

Do not chatter about your hometown to Ah Nong.

The boat gradually moved away, and the singing gradually became weaker. Finally, the shadow of the boat and the singing disappeared into the scenery of the lake and mountains.

"You should learn from her," I said to her with a smile.

"You also have to have his courage!" She replied coquettishly.

We smiled at each other. On our way back, we both had the belief of final victory in our hearts.

### Morning Song

— Lin Ling

Dawn swallowed the night,

Sunlight melted the gloom:

The church bells broadcast a loud sound,

Awakening the sleeping hearts in the city.

Fog shrouds the peaks,

The crucifix stretched out in mid-air,

Kneels devoutly to the Holy Lord

To offer peaceful morning prayers.

Little birds dance on the branches,

Singing the hymns of dawn.

But the lingering haze,

Why does it hinder the universal light?

Go away, haze!

I want light!

### "Warming a Cold Stove" and "Beating a Drowning Dog"

— Mo Xie

Both are frustrated people, some are regarded as "cold stoves" and constantly "warmed," while others are regarded as "drowning dogs" and beaten by the crowd. It can be said that some are lucky and some are unfortunate.

"Stove" is "dog," and "dog" is "stove," two in one, one in two. I do not know whether those who "warm" or "beat" have the Dharma eye to distinguish them. However, there is one thing I do know, that is, those who "warm" can also "beat," and those who "beat" can also "warm." The two can be combined, just like those who are good at "blowing" are also good at "flattering," and those who are good at "flattering" are good at "blowing," coming together so perfectly.

Generally, people think that warming a cold stove is accumulating virtue and doing good deeds. Although it is not certain that it will be like Han Xin's cold stove, which has a thousand gold reward, helping the frustrated and pitiful is a good thing. Only beating a drowning dog is truly adding insult to injury and is not worth learning from. Anyone who has a little bit of benevolence and a slight concern for charity should not take this action. Therefore, although the social view equates "stove" and "dog," it transforms those who "warm" and those who "beat" into two different kinds of people, treating them differently. Those who are good at "warming" have the good name of philanthropists, while those who are good at "beating" often have the evil epithet of mean ghosts.

However, upon careful reflection, there are "stoves" that should not be "warmed," and there are "dogs" that must be "beaten." I am afraid that saying this is too abstract and difficult to understand. It may be helpful to give an example to clarify it.

"Mr. Dangji" becomes a "three-no-ism" person, living in seclusion at home, and becomes such a "stove" or "dog" himself. — The so-called "again" is because he has been honored as such a "stove" or "dog" several times — if someone goes to "warm" him, wouldn't it increase his evil power? Suppose you go to "warm" him, and he becomes "prosperous" because of it. The "salary" price he will repay you in the future is considerable, but once the situation becomes a prairie fire, exploding, what about the people of the world! I think such a "cold stove" should not be warmed. It should be allowed to be covered with clear water to extinguish it, so that it is cold and collapsed, which is the best possible outcome.

Based on the premise that "spoiling" is "dog," he is now also a "dog" in the "river." According to legend, he does not seem to be reconciled to his fate and regards water as his home, but intends to climb ashore. And his "claws" are indeed active, wanting to promote his "shore up" movement. If he comes ashore, who can guarantee that he will not become a "mad dog" and harm people? Then, now that he is still "in the river" and has not landed, when should we beat him if not now!

Therefore, warming a cold stove like "a cold volcano" does not count as doing good deeds, but is doing bad deeds; similarly, beating a drowning dog like "a mad dog" does not count as doing bad deeds, but is doing good deeds. Today's "warmers" and "beaters" should think twice.

There is also a reason for the so-called combining "warming" and "beating." Generally, the purpose of both is not necessarily altruistic, but to benefit oneself. He wants the warmed person to become successful one day, so he can get assistance, and the beaten person, of course, is someone who hinders him. Once beaten so that he cannot rise again, he can sleep soundly from now on. So, such a person will both "warm" and "beat."

Similarly, "warming" and "beating" out of a sense of justice, so that good people prosper and bad people drown, also have the wonder of complementing each other, and can be integrated into one person.

"Perhaps someone wants to ask me personally about my attitude towards this matter, then I can say that I very much admire Liang Boluan, who "does not warm because of people's popularity." "Warm stoves" should not be warmed, let alone "cold stoves"! I also very much admire Zhou Xiaohou, who eliminated the three harms. A great man shoots tigers in the southern mountains and kills long-tailed dragons. What is a "drowning dog"!

### Black Hero

— Translated by Dun Sheng

Milton Herndon, 29, a black captain of a machine gun company of the "Lincoln Battalion," and the brother of the famous American revolutionary activist Angelo Herndon, died in battle on the Saragossa front in Spain during a decisive battle against fascist forces.

Milton was a member of the Young Communist League (his brother was a leader of the YCL). Two and a half years ago, he went to Spain to join the International Brigades, composed of anti-fascists from various countries. Soon after, he was appointed commander of the "Douglass" machine gun company and participated in many battles.

He is survived by his mother, two sisters, and five brothers.

His brother, Angelo, said, "My brother's death proves that black people are now beginning to understand that only by uniting with all progressive humanity can they win freedom for themselves and ensure their protection from lynching. He, along with other black people who went to Spain, helped write a glorious chapter in the history of the struggle for progress."

According to soldiers of the "Lincoln Battalion" who returned to the United States, 40 percent of the American black people who joined the International Brigades were promoted to officers.

Milton Herndon was the third American black person from the "Lincoln Battalion" to die in battle. Before him, Aronsa, Witteson, and Olfero Luo of the "Muni" machine gun company were killed in action.

The young Milton Herndon worked in hardware factories in Toledo and Chicago and joined the labor transport in 1935. He was arrested once when he served as a picket during a major strike at the "Georgia" factory. Later, he joined the Young Communist League.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

She continued excitedly, "Sir, I'm telling you, I have an advantage—that is, I listen. If you want me to beat the dog, I won't scold the chicken. If you want me to kill the chicken, I will definitely kill it cleanly. When you eat it, you definitely won't find a single feather. Don't you believe me?"

"I believe you, I believe you. In the future, if I want to kill a chicken, I will definitely ask you. But, now I want you to invite the young lady."

"Yes, I'll go find the young lady. Have I talked too much, sir? Don't you think so?"

"Not much yet."

"Sir, then we'll talk again next time."

He almost trembled. He thought:

"You killed me! I didn't commit a crime!"

After the servant left, the one he was waiting for arrived. He hid by the door, secretly grasping the doorknob with one hand, smilingly watching the person who came—a young girl. Her beautiful face was more beautiful than her photo; she didn't need rouge, her cheeks were the color of rouge; on the fair skin between her eyebrows was a small mole like a black pearl, darker than the ink that vain coquettes used to draw; her eyes, set off by a drop of holy water, were sharp and agile. Agile enough to stir a man's settled desires. In short, her face possessed all the symbolic—typical—beauty of the universe. She wore a light blue silk shirt embroidered with small rose and snow-white flowers; the former could symbolize her beauty, the latter could represent the color of her heart; although her father was a traitor to his country. She wasn't flustered when she saw the stranger; while putting down the sheet music in her hand, she said:

"Who is it? Coming into the house and not taking off your coat, really, still wearing a fur hat!" She walked closer to the stranger and asked, "Take off your fur hat and let me see who it is."

Seeing that the other person stood blankly by the door, without a trace of a response, she felt even more estranged. Following that, her question changed to a stranger's tone:

"Who are you looking for?"

"Looking for you!"

"I don't know you!"

"But, I know you, you are Zhu Lin!"

At this time, she was somewhat suspicious. Could there be people who knew each other without ever having met? Therefore, she hurriedly walked closer to him, wanting to re-examine his face; while searching her memories, she looked at him thoughtfully and said:

"Who exactly are you?" (10)
