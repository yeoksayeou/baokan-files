### Japanese Troops Land on Hainan Island

Japanese ×× troops landed on Hainan Island in large numbers before dawn yesterday. The exact landing location is still unknown, but it is expected that our troops stationed in Qiongya and the local people are bravely resisting. Although our senior military authorities have not made any announcements regarding this matter, general observations indicate that they are paying close attention to the future trend of the South China war situation.

The Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island is by no means a trivial matter. It will have a very significant impact not only on the South China war situation but also on the overall situation of China's war of resistance, as well as on the international situation in the Far East and the future of the current world war—the two-front war. We would like to express the following points based on our usual observations to draw the attention of our countrymen and friendly nations.

Hainan Island is an important stronghold on the front line of our national defense in southern China, the most important shield for our southwestern anti-Japanese base, and an important gateway for countries such as Britain and France to maintain their interests in the Far East. At the same time, it is also a key area that Japanese fascists must occupy first in order to complete their continental policy and launch their maritime strategy. Therefore, the Japanese ×× have been plotting to invade Hainan Island for a long time. Since the full-scale outbreak of our country's anti-Japanese war, young military leaders in Japan, especially naval leaders, have repeatedly advocated that "to conquer China, we must first implement the South China strategy, and to perfectly execute the South China strategy, we must first occupy Guangzhou, especially Hainan Island." Before Guangzhou fell last year, the Japanese × launched the so-called 'attack on the Soviet Union' at Zhanggufeng to divert the world's attention, while secretly attacking Hainan Island in an attempt to occupy it in one fell swoop. At that time, fortunately, our side paid close attention, aroused international attention, and the Soviet Union resolutely and bravely crushed the Japanese military's provocative plan, exposed the Japanese smoke screen plot, and the French authorities were also able to quickly make strong representations, causing the Japanese adventurous plan to fail completely. However, the Japanese ×'s conspiracy has been going on every day since.

After the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese ×'s plan to blockade our country's coast and cut off our transportation, trade, and commerce with foreign countries was nearing completion. The Japanese military authorities believed that the only regret was the failure to occupy Hainan Island, which allowed our country to maintain a considerable degree of initiative and advantage in the southern battlefield, and also allowed Britain and France to maintain a considerable degree of initiative and advantage in their Far Eastern relations, hindering the implementation of the Japanese ××'s westward and southward invasion plans. Therefore, the Japanese ×'s current strategy for South China, in addition to trying to consolidate the occupation of Guangzhou, is to devote all its efforts to arranging the seizure of Hainan Island and the spying on the southern route. Regarding this point, we have repeatedly pointed out in "World Trends in a Week" in order to arouse the vigilance of all parties.

The Japanese × had been planning for a long time but still did not dare to launch a military operation against Hainan Island, partly due to the lack of their own troops, and the military leaders had no confidence in the steps to be taken after forcibly occupying Hainan Island. On the other hand, it was due to spying on the attitude of the British and French authorities towards the Far East. However, now the Japanese × have finally launched a military operation to forcibly occupy Hainan Island. Have the Japanese × side's two difficult problems been resolved? We can answer in two points: First, the recent continued compromise between Britain and France on the Italian invasion of Spain, the "victory" of the Italian invaders in Spain, and the serious situation in Europe it caused, first emboldened the Japanese ×× to take risks in the Far East, especially towards the southwest; second, the exhaustion of Japanese military spending is a serious problem at present. The huge military budget of 730 million yen for the next fiscal year, which will begin on April 1, will be submitted to the parliament for approval in the next few days. The Japanese army and navy authorities must rush to create a serious situation in order to ensure the smooth passage of the huge military budget. Judging from the Japanese ×'s provocations against the Soviet Union on the Japanese-Manchukuo-Soviet border in the past few days, followed by the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island yesterday, we can clearly understand their motives and intentions.

The importance of Hainan Island to our country's southern anti-Japanese war is a well-known fact. The importance of Hainan Island to Britain, the United States, and France in maintaining their interests in the Far East is also recognized by all discerning people in the world. If Hainan Island is forcibly occupied by the Japanese army, it can not only be used as a base to attack Guangxi, cut off our only international passage in South China to the west, and bypass Xianggui in the north to open up the entire Yuehan line, but also serve as a base for Japanese fascists to implement their westward and southward invasion strategy based on the maritime strategy. In this way, it will not only affect the entire coastline of French Indochina, but also threaten the shipping and all trade interests of Britain, the United States, and other countries east of Singapore. I still remember that in March last year, the French government sent a note to the Japanese side because the Japanese army attempted to spy on Hainan Island, stating that France had a treaty with China, in which France had the obligation to prohibit foreigners from landing on Hainan Island. Later, the British authorities also expressed their agreement with this attitude of France and warned Japan. Therefore, the Japanese ×'s current landing on Hainan Island is actually ×××××××××, actually ×××××× and other countries related to the Far East ××××. The reason why we should especially point out that the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island is a serious international event is also because of this.

The seriousness of the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island is what we must point out and arouse the attention of our countrymen and friendly nations. However, we not only do not feel the slightest fear about the Japanese ×'s move, but also make us more excited to persevere in the courage of unity and resistance. Because first, from a military point of view, although our past deployment in Hainan Island was not completely satisfactory, and the number of troops stationed there was greatly insufficient, especially in terms of popular mobilization and political propaganda, it was not enough. However, the island already has experienced and well-organized guerrillas, and the people who are full of patriotism and national consciousness will, under the leadership of the revolutionary army reorganized from the Red Army, launch a battle to defend their homeland and country, and give the Japanese × a heavy blow. Secondly, in terms of terrain, Hainan Island is an area of ​​overlapping mountains, and the Japanese ×'s activities are extremely difficult. The Wuzhi Mountain, which is up to 5,000 feet high and rich in products, has always been a strong base for the Red Army, and will surely become an anti-Japanese base, making it impossible for the Japanese × to have a foothold for a long time. Finally, we should not ignore the difficulty of the Japanese ×'s insufficient troops, which still has not been resolved. Perhaps this landing by the Japanese army will once again stage ××××× a farce. However, we still cannot but ask our countrymen and friendly people to pay attention: First, the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island this time, regardless of whether its intention is to threaten internally and provoke or test ××, or both, the Japanese ×'s adventure of invading westward and southward in the future will inevitably become more rampant as the German progress in Europe; therefore, we must not only strengthen the national defense of the southwest, but also urge Britain and France to adopt a more active policy, using further action to aid China and contain Japan to respond to the Japanese ×'s unreasonable provocation. Second, the Japanese × have a conspiracy to take advantage of the appeasement policy of some British and French rulers. They will use the forcible occupation of Hainan Island as a condition to strive for favorable terms when holding international conferences. They will use it to coerce British and French rulers to come forward to mediate the "Sino-Japanese conflict." They will use it to coerce France to block international routes for transportation to China, and facilitate the implementation of their southwest strategy. The British and French rulers, based on not very accurate observations, do not want our country to be destroyed by Japan, and even more do not want China to defeat the Japanese × and achieve liberation with the help of the Soviet Union. Therefore, preparations for mediating the "Sino-Japanese conflict" have never been relaxed. Now we should more clearly advise friendly people who hold this erroneous view, point out the new situation in which the interests of Britain, France, and China are consistent, and demand that they not be deceived by the Japanese conspiracy and jointly and effectively sanction the Japanese × in order to maintain Far Eastern security.

### World Trends in a Week

— Lang Pan

From February 4th to 10th, 28th Year

It's springtime! Although the international situation is so dangerous, and the flames of war in the motherland are so rampant, the blood flag of resistance has been raised high among the masses who have been invaded and oppressed all over the world! The victorious horn is encouraging every daughter who seeks freedom to fight more bravely and move forward!

The current events of the first week of the Spring Festival tell us: The fascist invaders, the rulers of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, are preparing even more frantically for internal repression and external expansion; democratic countries such as Britain and France have shouted out the roar of resistance to hegemony, but they still have more illusions than determination; only the Soviet Union, the socialist motherland, has once again demonstrated in Europe and the Far East the determination to defend peace and the independence of all people with strength. Looking back at our motherland, it is still under the haze of × people's artillery fire, but the × people's power has gradually declined, and the × people's crisis is becoming more and more serious. On the contrary, our power is becoming more and more vast, and our crisis is turning sharply. Therefore, we believe that whether it is the world or China, the fascist invaders are preparing for their final show of strength, and our forces of resistance still need to redouble their efforts to increase fear and develop!

Taking advantage of the arrival of spring and everyone's spirit, let's put in more effort for the liberation of the nation and the freedom of mankind!

A Bird's-Eye View of the War Situation in a Week

Although the × troops in various places have begun to move on a larger scale, the war situation this week has remained relatively stable. The main plan for spying on the × troops is to confuse our army with chaotic movements on various lines, while stepping up the consolidation of the rule in the occupied areas, 'cleaning up' the guerrillas, and at the same time mobilizing considerable troops to prepare for a large-scale offensive. First, let's talk about North China. The × side has recently expanded its propaganda to launch a large-scale offensive against the Northwest. The × troops in various places in Central China and North China have also indeed transferred some brigades to Yuxi. At the same time, one route in the north is plotting to invade Ningxia and Gansu from Chahar and Suiyuan, and one route in the east is once again forcibly crossing the Yellow River from Yu and Jin. Therefore, fierce battles broke out in various places in Suiyuan and Shanxi this week, especially in Fenglingdu and eastern Jin. The result was that the two routes of × troops collapsed one after another under the joint operations of our army and air force. On the 5th, our air force bombed the Yuncheng × airport, and more than a dozen × aircraft were destroyed. In addition, in the Zhongtiao Mountain area in southern Jin, 7,000 to 8,000 × people have been wiped out in the past two weeks. Our army in central Hebei, eastern Henan, and the border between Hebei, Chahar, and Jin launched a fierce counteroffensive, and also gave a major blow to the × who came to support. Now the relationship between the military and civilians of all ethnic groups in the Northwest is becoming more and more harmonious, and the internal conflicts of the × army are fierce, so the so-called general offensive against the Northwest is difficult to achieve for a while. As for South China, × Commander Ando held a military conference of the army, navy, and air force in Guangzhou on the 2nd. As a result, he had no confidence in the battle to open up the Yuehan Road, so he decided to first launch a large-scale westward invasion. He has transferred 24 warships from Taiwan to cooperate with the air and land forces, using the island as a base and Beihai as a gateway, and the first step is to occupy Hainan Island and actively promote the westward and southward invasion plan. Therefore, in the past week, the × troops in Dongjiang and Beijiang have only been making a show of strength, while the situation in the Xijiang Southern Route has become increasingly tense. Now our Guangdong military has a new deployment. Yu Hanmou is responsible for the northern route and implements offensive defense; Wu Qiwai commands the eastern route and launches guerrilla offensives; Xia Wei is responsible for the western route. In recent days, our army in the northern route has launched a three-way counteroffensive, and fierce battles have taken place in Taipingchang and Chibaini. The preparation for the counteroffensive in Dongjiang is also largely in place. Guerrilla troops in Dongguan, Baoan, Huiyang, Boza, Heyuan, and Zengcheng are actively strengthening. The Xijiang, with close coordination between our army and air force, will advance in three routes. The right wing will take Heshan as a base, seize Jiujiang, and sweep along the Jiangfo Highway towards Lianglong and Foshan. The left wing will take Lubao as a base, cut off the Guangyun Chantan Road, and cooperate with the right wing to surround the Guangsan Road and cut off the connection between Guangzhou and the front-line × troops in Xijiang. The southern route has been reinforced by elite troops. Although the situation in the southwest is tight, there is no need to worry about the overall situation. (While writing this draft, I learned that this morning, the 10th, a part of the × army landed on Hainan Island, and I will write another editorial for this, please refer to it.) As for the × army in Central China, although it is active in central Hubei and the border between Hunan and Jiangxi, it has made no progress. Since the Nanchang military conference on the 2nd, our army has been fully confident in preventing the × army from peeping into Changsha and Nanchang. In addition, in response to the × army's plan to 'clean up' the guerrillas, the guerrilla battles in the northern and eastern battlefields have also made greater progress in the past week. On the eastern battlefield, our army recovered Luodian and Baoshan, while the New Fourth Army attracted 50,000 × troops on the Jinghang Road; on the northern battlefield, fierce battles took place in various places on the border between Hebei and Chahar and northeastern Shandong, which contained a large number of × troops on the PingSui, PingHan, PingShen, and JinPu lines, giving our army on the front lines of the north and south battlefields a greater opportunity for development.

Our Military, Political, and Diplomatic Situation

In the past week, our country's military, political, diplomatic, rear-area construction, and the combat and construction work in the occupied areas have made considerable progress. First of all, our army's combat power is growing stronger.

Growing Strength

General Feng Yuxiang emphasized this point in his report in Chongqing on the 4th of this month, and listed the following facts: (1) Currently, in Hebei Province alone in North China, our side has 200,000 troops, ruling more than 80 counties, and killing an average of 300 to 400 × people every day. (2) The guerrilla work and political work in the Northeast will have further progress. General Bai Chongxi also gave a speech in Kunming on the 6th of this month, proving with the experience of 19 months of the war of resistance that our army's combat power is becoming stronger and stronger. We are absolutely advantageous militarily, politically, economically, and internationally. More than 10,000 listeners at the entire venue applauded and cheered enthusiastically. On the 7th of this month, the Soviet Union's Pravda even used the headline "New China is Growing Up" to discuss the strengthening of our country's military strength, the progress of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the optimistic prospects for the war of resistance. Reuters reporter Sassoon also sent out an important telegram after entering Sichuan from Vietnam via Guizhou and Yunnan, pointing out the prospects for our country's victory.

Military and Political Unity

The organization of the Supreme National Defense Council was announced on the 7th of this month, with Mr. Chiang, the president of the Kuomintang, concurrently serving as the chairman. The 11 standing committee members are also concurrently served by the ministers of various ministries and other positions, and Zhang Qun is the secretary-general. Although its organization and mission are quite different from what was reported by foreign media before, first, this meeting will inevitably unify the national military, political, party affairs, and mass movement, which will greatly benefit the war of resistance. Second, in this new stage of the war of resistance, only by making politics more progressive and consolidating the unity of all parties and all sectors of society can we guarantee the smooth progress of the war of resistance and national construction and strive for final victory. We believe that the government's efforts in this regard will certainly be demonstrated by facts.

International Assistance

There have also been many expressions of international assistance to our country this week. What is particularly worth reporting is: First, a telegram from Washington on the 4th stated that Chen Guangfu, the representative of the Chinese Silver Group, was in negotiations with a certain consortium for a credit loan, and as a result, a credit loan of 15 million US dollars was established to enhance our country's currency. Second, a telegram from London on the 8th stated that the British financial community had a good response to our country's maintenance of creditworthiness, and that further financial assistance to China was being carefully considered. At the same time, British government officials who are most directly related to discussing China's needs are also discussing granting our country a credit loan to develop the southwestern economy, and plan to use actual loans to support our country's currency system. Third, there is further cooperation in Sino-British aviation, and the Hong Kong-Yunnan-Burma-New Air Line is about to be established. In addition, such as the Hong Kong English South China Morning Post on the 7th published that the leaders of the US government unanimously warmly assisted China, such as Reuters London's 8th telegram stating that the British House of Commons urged the British government to put more pressure on Japan, which can prove that the international situation continues to be favorable to us.

Japan in the Midst of Four Crises

In contrast to the situation of internal unity and external assistance in our country, the internal and external crises of the Japanese fascist invaders have entered a greater stage of outbreak. Just from the publicly published news in various newspapers this week, we can see that the ×'s invasion of China is certainly not sure of victory, the so-called large-scale general offensive has not been implemented immediately, and the so-called political offensive has also failed again due to Wang Jingwei's escape and Wu Peifu's decision to maintain his integrity in his later years. The domestic and international crises in Japan are becoming more and more serious. Here are a few pieces of evidence:

Exhausted Source of Troops

Since the outbreak of the all-out war, up to the end of January this year, the × army has suffered at least 700,000 casualties. There are about 1,020,000 × in China, including 400,000 in the Northeast and 620,000 in North China and Central China. If the × army wants to continue to invade China or fight against the Soviet Union, the current force is obviously not enough, and the most that can be transferred from the country is only 400,000, which will make the × afraid of being empty in the country!

Economic Crisis

Also, from the outbreak of the war to January this year, according to various statistics, the Japanese military expenditure has reached at least 8.8 billion yen, while our military expenditure is 2 billion yuan, and our expenditure is only a quarter of that of the Japanese. If the war continues in the future, our country's consumption will increase, and the increase in the ×'s expenditure will be doubled. The special budget for the Japanese navy and army expenditures for the next year, which is scheduled to begin on April 1, will be submitted to the parliament for approval in the next few days. The total amount is about 730 million yen, of which the army's military expenditure has increased from 382.1 million to 540 million yen, which has led to a conflict between the navy and the army over military expenditure, and this huge budget is too much for the entire Japanese country to bear, and the bankruptcy crisis is imminent.

Anti-War Rage

The Japanese people deeply feel that this war is only a war for the interests of a few monopolistic capital leaders and military figures, and they are on the verge of despair under the heavy burden of the war. Therefore, the anti-war rage is surging, and the × army is mutinying loudly, and the puppet troops are defecting one after another. Just based on this week's telegraphic news, countless examples can be cited: (1) Central News Agency Chongqing telegram on the 5th, on the 21st and 22nd of last month, 3,000 × troops mutinied in Dagu, and as a result, they were transported to the front line of Jin and Sui in two batches. (2) The same telegram from Tunxi on the 6th, a few days ago, more than 500 × soldiers in Jiangyin mutinied against the war, and the × commander was killed. (3) The same telegram from Shanghai on the 6th, more than 100 Japanese workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai were arrested for anti-war activities. (4) The same telegram from Huaiyin on the 7th, Xu Yankun, a puppet army general in Jiangsu, led more than 1,000 of his troops to defect, and the puppet troops of Li Guanying in the north and Liu Fulong in the south also defected. (5) The same telegram from Chongqing on the 9th, the × army in Hankou established a large anti-war organization and carried out a major riot, echoing the × army's riot in Tianjin a few days ago. Unfortunately, it was detected, and more than 100 leaders, including military police officers and army officers, were arrested. (6) The same telegram also stated: The left-leaning ideology of the × army in China is increasing, and various secret organizations are developing very quickly. A certain party's Hongkou branch in Japan has advanced anti-war propaganda to actual actions. (7) The same telegram also stated that anti-war sentiment is widespread in Japan, and a large number of officials from the Ministry of the Army have secretly participated. Currently, there have been many cases of exposure, such as the theft of information by Machijiri, an official from the military department, and the actress Ms. Tanaka.

Revolutionary Movement

The anti-war and anti-fascist people's front movement, under the leadership of the weak but hardworking Japanese Communist Party, has recently seen dramatic development in Japan. The above examples are just a few. For the Japanese people to seek their own liberation, for the liberation of all nations and for world peace, this heroic struggle of the Japanese people and the hardships they have suffered are worthy of everyone's emotion and reflection! Now this struggle has spread to Taiwan, Korea, and various parts of the Northeast. Central News Agency Chongqing telegram on the 3rd stated: Taiwan ×× patriots sneaked back to their hometowns to work, and Korean Jeonju workers revolted on January 28th, which are the latest examples.

Aggression Conspiracy

From this we can know that the Japanese × cannot fight again and has no strength to fight again! From this we can know why the Japanese × is carrying out bombings and massacres more frantically, and from this we can know why the Japanese × is trying to buy off rebel parties and bandits in China and internationally by threatening and enticing, and propagating anti-communism, propagating peace, and mediating! The facts are already clear: China can and must defeat the Japanese × and obtain true peace, freedom, and happiness only by persisting in united resistance to the end. If anti-communism and peace negotiations are implemented today, regardless of whether this movement is initiated by traitors and pro-Japanese elements, or advocated by a few bureaucrats and politicians in the country, or if there is coercion from foreign countries, the result will only save the Japanese invaders, only wrong our heroic struggles and heavy sacrifices over the past 19 months, only make the Chinese nation and the Japanese nation perish forever, and only make the world war spread even more! The Reuters telegram from Chongqing on the 9th reported that Chinese "political figures" discussed China's reiteration of its determination to resist the war, and among them, they all claimed that "only by convening a Far East international conference similar to the Second Washington Conference can the existing Sino-Japanese conflict be resolved." If this news is true, it cannot be considered as the attitude of our authorities, and it is even more unacceptable to the Chinese people!

The Fall of Catalonia

After the fall of Barcelona, ​​Catalonia is already on the verge of falling as a whole! The fall of Catalonia is not because the Spanish government army cannot resist the war and has no strength to resist the war, nor is it because the Spanish people cannot resist the war and has no strength to resist the war, but because of the unscrupulous assistance of the Italian and German invaders to the rebel army and the large-scale offensive, especially because of the British and French rulers' "non-intervention" policy, which on the one hand condoned the Italian and German crazy offensive, and on the other hand prevented the Spanish government from legally purchasing military supplies from foreign countries and obtaining assistance. After the fall of Catalonia, the Spanish government's situation is certainly more difficult, and the threat to France and Britain is even greater. Because now the Italian and German invaders can establish air force bases on the Spanish coast to cut off the transportation lines from Britain and France to African colonies, and make the British Gibraltar completely lose its military value. Moreover, France is now under the three-sided encirclement of the Italian and German invaders. Furthermore, Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea has become a thing in Italy's pocket, and Mussolini is already preparing to make new colonial demands and control the Suez Canal. In the future, it is inevitable that Italy and Germany will cooperate to further threaten Britain and France to divide the colonies! The total outbreak of world war

### × Landing on Hainan Island: All Nations Feel a Grave Threat; France Will Lodge a Serious Protest

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tokyo dispatch: According to Japanese official sources, Japanese troops have landed on Hainan Island. It is claimed that elite Japanese naval and army units launched a sudden landing on Hainan Island this morning and are now jointly advancing inland.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tokyo dispatch: Japanese troops attacked Hainan Island this morning. France regards Hainan Island as a shield for protecting Annam. The western end of the island is only 140 miles from the Annam coast. The Japanese General Headquarters issued a communiqué this morning stating that Japanese troops suddenly attacked Hainan Island at dawn and landed on the island. Elite Japanese naval and army units are now jointly advancing inland. Details are unknown. (Note: Some factions within the Japanese military have long advocated occupying Hainan Island. One faction advocates occupying the island as a base for Japan to advance towards the Annam border, so as to prevent military supplies from being transported from Annam to our inland areas.)

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch: According to neutral observers, the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island will have a significant impact on the Philippines. This is because the Philippines originally intended to create a neutral status after achieving independence. Hainan Island was also guaranteed neutrality by the Franco-Japanese agreement. Today, the Japanese army has launched a large-scale landing. If the Japanese army establishes naval and air bases on Hainan Island, then the area is only 500 miles from the Philippines, which will pose a great threat to the safety of the Philippines.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch: Naval figures from various countries returning to the East are closely watching the development of the Hainan Island issue. Various parties here believe that Hainan Island has the potential to become the "Mallorca Island" of the Far East. (Note: Mallorca Island is one of the Balearic Islands belonging to Spain in the Mediterranean Sea. Together with Minorca, it is the center of the Balearic Islands and is now in the hands of the Spanish rebel army, controlled by Italy for some time). Naval figures state that Hainan Island is a militarily important island in the Far East. This is not only because the island is only 70 miles from the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay and 160 miles from French Annam, but also because the island is conveniently located between the Singapore-Hong Kong shipping route. The island, along with Taiwan and the Japanese mandated territory of the Caroline Islands, forms a semi-circle surrounding the Philippines on its east, west, and north sides. Hainan Island has two deep-water ports, Haikou and Yulin. Haikou is at the northern end of Hainan Island, and Yulin Port is at the southern end of Hainan Island. Although the island has not yet been fully developed, it can become a very important naval base in the future. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1895, the entire Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet, after being transferred to the Sea of Japan for combat, once anchored in the Hainan Strait.

Our Government Is Not Surprised

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] Various parties in Chongqing have learned of the landing of × on Hainan Island and generally believe that it includes the intention to demonstrate to France. According to Gui telegrams, ×'s deployment in South China seems to be complete, attempting to launch another invasion. Fierce battles on various fronts will begin shortly. We have long prepared heavy troops on all fronts, waiting in strict formation. The eastern disturbance of × will surely suffer heavy losses.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 10th] Official sources here do not express surprise at the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, but they pay close attention to the international implications of this matter in the South China Sea. Chinese and foreign figures generally believe that: (1) The Japanese occupation of Hainan Island is actually an infringement on the interests of Britain, the United States, France, and China in South China, and does not directly harm China, because the importance of the island has been greatly reduced since the fall of Guangzhou. (2) Because Hainan Island is located near Annam's Tonkin Gulf, the Japanese occupation of the island poses a threat to France, whether from the sea or the air. (3) Isolating the connection between the French port of Guangzhou Bay and Annam. (4) Placing the Japanese army in an advantageous position to attack Bataan Island. (5) Endangering the future of the Philippines. (6) Directly violating the Franco-Japanese agreement of last year.

× Has Violated the Franco-Japanese Agreement

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch: According to neutral observers, France will lodge a very strong protest against the Japanese army's attack on Hainan, because the Japanese army's actions are actually violating the provisions of the Franco-Japanese agreement, which designated Hainan as a neutral zone. Britain is also very concerned because this move by the Japanese army will threaten the traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore. Moreover, neutral parties state that the Japanese occupation of Hainan poses a great threat to the Philippines because the Japanese side has not indicated that it will withdraw from Hainan in the future. In addition to being an important strategic location, the island is also the largest producer of raw materials in South China.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tokyo dispatch: According to legal experts, in March 1897, the Chinese and French governments exchanged official documents, declaring that the Chinese government would not cede Hainan Island to other countries. In 1907, Japanese and French representatives signed an agreement in Paris, stipulating that the two countries should respect China's independence and territorial integrity. At the same time, regarding the Chinese territory and the parts adjacent to the two countries, the two countries should mutually guarantee the safety and peace of the area. Although Hainan was not explicitly mentioned in the text, it was intended to refer to the area.

The British Side Will Take Decisive Action

[Reuters, London, 10th] British officials are awaiting further reports on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island and have not commented. It is generally believed that since the Japanese side claimed in June of last year that it wanted to land on the island, it has repeatedly hinted that it may land at any time to meet military needs, so this is not surprising. However, although the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of occupying the island for a long time, the House of Commons will inevitably oppose it. It is believed that as a result of parliamentary inquiries on Monday, the government will be ordered to take decisive action to fulfill the joint warning of Britain and France in June of last year.

× Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Deceptive Talk

[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] The spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared at a reception for reporters today that the Japanese attack on Hainan Island is entirely a military necessity and that there is absolutely no intention to violate the Franco-Japanese agreement of 1907.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th] The Japanese government spokesman did not answer the question of whether the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island was intended to prevent military supplies from Annam from being transported to China. The Japanese government has not notified the French authorities of the purpose of this move. It is generally believed that the purpose of the Japanese army is to cut off the traffic of military supplies to China.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th] A Japanese naval spokesman stated that the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island has two purposes: (1) to prevent military supplies from being transported to China; (2) to quickly defeat the "Chiang regime," end the war, and improve Japan's relations with third countries. The spokesman also said, "The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is a 'military necessity.' It is hoped that foreign countries will not misunderstand, because the island has a base for transporting military supplies to China, enabling General Chiang Kai-shek to wage a long-term resistance."

### Our Army Counterattacks in Eastern Jin: Over 7,000 × Soldiers Fall into Disarray; Our Army Captures the Puppet Chief of Staff in Yongcheng

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] Our army counterattacks Heshun, taking Xiyang on the north road. Over 7,000 × soldiers have fallen into disarray. The battle situation in Hanwang Village is very fierce, and it has not stopped as of the 9th.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The war situation in North China: Shandong is still fierce. Our army is launching large-scale guerrilla warfare from various places in the east, west, south, and north. The Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are sometimes cut off by us. It is reported that Feixian has been recovered. Linqing × is under our control and attack. We attacked Huimin, killing over a hundred × soldiers. The Ji-Cha × has been replaced and moved in many ways. There are still local fierce battles from time to time in various places in southwestern Shanxi. The river defense is consolidated.

[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 10th] There are no changes on the front lines of Jingzao. Our army is still taking a monitoring posture. × has recently been continuously reinforcing Jingmen. Yesterday, 500 × soldiers from Songhe escorted over a hundred laborers to Jingmen. Seven to eight hundred × soldiers from Yingcheng also passed through Zaoshi to Jingmen yesterday, along with a artillery company. Currently, there are over a thousand × soldiers in Yongxing Village, southwest of Jingmen, forcibly recruiting laborers to rush to repair the Zaoshi to Tianmen highway, claiming that a large army will arrive soon to invade the west.

[Central News Agency, Zaoyang, 10th] The × army in Yingshan and Anlu has recently withdrawn a portion back to Wuhan. As a result, the × army in the Yihe area has been constantly patrolling with tanks in recent days and firing artillery at us, making a show of force and feigning an attack.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 10th] After the puppet army Li Ying's troops opened from Shuiye to Anyang, they divided into three routes to attack Chuwang Town, Liuyuan, and other places in the east. They are currently being blocked and suppressed by our army.

In this battle, over three hundred × soldiers were killed, and over four hundred rifles, three light and heavy machine guns, and many military supplies were captured. We also suffered over a hundred casualties.

### World Trends in a Week (Continued from the Second Edition)

The crisis that is developing has been brought closer by the hypocritical compromising policies of Britain and France! As for the Spanish government forces, although they are encountering even greater dangers and the future of the war of resistance is even more difficult, they still have the possibility of a final victory over the × people. The first is because Spain is currently engaged in a strategic retreat, and it still has 500,000 elite troops who can continue to resist. The second is that Spain still possesses more than one-third of the country's vast territory, which can be used as a base for continuing resistance. The third is that all the Spanish people, including the people in the areas forcibly occupied by the fascist bandits, still support the democratic government. They are determined to fight against fascist aggression. The fourth is that the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world, in the Soviet Union, in the United States, in Britain and France, and even in Italy and Germany, are using various different forms of struggle to realize "Aid Spain!" The Western government also resolutely rejected British and French mediation and compromise, and the government moved to Valencia to continue the war, breaking the shameless rumors of the aggressors about the Western government and people not long ago, forcing Britain and France to show a little toughness towards Italy. If we can remember the poor Chinese Red Army of the past, who guarded the poor countryside of Jiangxi and were finally able to resist the continuous encirclement and suppression of large armies, we can believe that Spain is definitely not the Czech Republic, and Spain will definitely defeat the × people under the leadership of the People's Front with the Communist Party as the base.

The Trends of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union

Britain and France

The Spanish question has already pushed the world war crisis to the ignition point of total explosion. Europe, Africa, the Americas, and even the Sino-Japanese war cannot but be greatly affected. Now let's first look at Britain and France, the two countries directly affected. According to the facts of the past thirty months since the outbreak of the Spanish War of Resistance, we can prove that the ruling classes of Britain and France have always sympathized with the Western rebel army, and they even sympathize with the atrocities of the Italian and German aggressors in Spain. Based on the class interests of their own financial capital, they implemented a non-interference policy on the one hand, believing that they could stay out of the war, and could prevent the Soviet Union from aiding the Spanish government, and avoid the rise of the revolutionary wave in Europe; on the other hand, they condoned the military actions of the Italian and German aggressors in Spain, believing that after Italy and Germany conquered Spain, they would inevitably rely on the strength of Britain and France to carry out construction due to economic exhaustion, which would be a great opportunity to profit. Now Britain and France are eager to mediate the Spanish War, because they want to profit sooner. But how this will threaten Britain and France's own position in Europe, and even force Britain's Eurasian transportation to have to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope, is something that every British and French patriot sees in common. Therefore, the recent movement of the masses of people in the two countries against compromise diplomacy and against fascism has been raging like wildfire, becoming more and more intense day by day, and it is bound to become the main force in changing the policies of Britain and France.

United States

Secondly, the victory of Italy and Germany in Spain also threatens the safety of South American countries and the interests of the United States. Therefore, in recent days, the United States has been chanting "Aid Spain!" and "Abolish the Neutrality Act!" President Roosevelt openly called for aiding democratic countries and resisting fascist aggression, winning the response of the Soviet government's severance of relations with Hungary as a fact of striking aggressors, and also winning the response of the British Prime Minister and the French Foreign Minister one after another. Even the speech of the aggression ringleader Mussolini on the 4th was kept secret and not published. This policy of the United States against aggression and upholding peace is obviously the result of the mad actions of the Japanese, German, and Italian aggressors harming the United States, and it is certainly the preliminary success of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement of the American people, especially the vast number of working masses.

Soviet Union

This result also helped the unity of the forces of peace and democracy, especially the Soviet government was able to smoothly promote its policy of maintaining peace and protecting national independence. In Europe, the Soviet Union is preparing to launch a treaty on the Black Sea, based on the three countries of the Black Sea coast, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, and invite Greece to participate, to establish a collective security system and prevent Germany from advancing eastward again. In the Far East, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japanese aggressors has also become tougher. On the one hand, it resolutely rejected Japan's unreasonable demands regarding the maritime treaty, and on the other hand, it actively strengthened its Far Eastern preparedness. It is particularly noteworthy that on the 6th and 7th of this month, Japanese troops attacked Island No. 227 on the Erguna River in the upper reaches of the Soviet Union's Heilongjiang River and were eventually repelled by Soviet troops. The Soviet Union has lodged a serious protest with Japan, and the situation on the Soviet border has become tense again. The manifestation of the Soviet Union's power in the Far East not only restrained the Japanese defense forces that had been lingering for thousands of miles in our country, but also attacked the Southward and Westward plans of Britain, France, and the United States. It can be seen that "The Soviet Union is a pillar of world peace" is by no means a slogan! An impossible fantasy.

### Patriotic Youths in Our Country Demonstrate in Western Shanghai; Distribute Leaflets and Shout Slogans; Open Fire and Attack the Puppet Police Station

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai Dispatch: At about 9:00 a.m. on the 10th, five young men from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Assassination Group suddenly appeared near the triangle of Caojiadu in Western Shanghai, each holding a Mauser pistol and hand grenades, parading and demonstrating, and shouting slogans such as "Kill all traitors and recover lost land." Then they went to the front of the puppet police station and opened fire more than ten times with Mauser pistols, and threw a hand grenade. At that time, the puppet police guarding the station all fled in panic and did not dare to go out. The doors and windows of the station were broken. After completing their mission, the five young men dispersed to other places.

### College Graduates: An Opportunity to Devote Themselves to Serving the Country; Take the National Military Training Instructor Exam; Chen Cheng Sends a Letter to the Ministry of Education Ordering All Schools

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] Chen Cheng, Minister of Political Affairs, sent a letter to the Ministry of Education to forward to all colleges and universities in the country, stating that graduates who do not yet have a job may be allowed to take the National Military Training Instructor exam, and all procedures will be waived.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] The Education Department of the Hubei Provincial Government stated that the number of primary and secondary school teachers from the war zones inside and outside the province scattered in various counties of the province is increasing day by day, and work supervision is quite difficult. It is specially organizing a "Wartime Education Personnel Hubei Service Group." All teachers from middle schools in the war zone, teachers from primary schools in the war zone who have not been assigned work, surplus teachers hired in the province, and teachers from the war zone who have withdrawn from the province who have been registered and qualified should report and participate. A number of teams will be formed according to the actual number of people, and the service group measures promulgated by the Ministry will be followed, and the actual situation in the province will be considered.

### Tokyo Newspapers: Promote Xenophobia

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, August 8th] Tokyo Dispatch: Local newspapers have recently published a lot of xenophobic texts. This type of text opposes Japan's intentions towards the great powers. All newspapers believe that the recent speech by Navy Minister Yonai in the Diet to expand the navy explained that Japan is also able to compete with the military preparations of Britain, the United States, and other great powers. The Kokumin Shimbun stated that US President Roosevelt is currently conspiring to aid the Soviet Union against Japan. The Mainichi Shimbun criticized Britain and France for aiding China, saying that the opposition between the British and French lines and the Italian and German lines is natural, but the United States should not intervene. The Asahi Shimbun advocated a tough stance against the Soviet Union on the fishing issue.

### × Side × Forges Central Bank Banknotes; Transported to Occupied Areas; Forcing the Public to Use Them

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The Japanese side has recently forged Central Bank banknotes, transported them to the occupied areas, and forced the public to use them. The central government has recently ordered local authorities and chambers of commerce to strictly prevent this, so as to avoid the public being deceived.

### The Ministry of Finance Issues a Circular to the Whole Country: Unifying the Standard for Foreign Exchange Settlement

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance has unified the standard for foreign exchange settlement and issued a circular to the whole country, stating that foreign exchange will be calculated at the legal price from now on. Yunnan has also set a date to implement it next month.

### Supplementary Clothing for New Recruits: Regulations Stipulated by the Ministry of Military Administration

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Military Administration has been ordered to stipulate supplementary clothing regulations for recruits and new recruits in each province, and has telegraphed to all military districts, setting a deadline to complete the supplies by mid-February. Those who fail to implement this will be punished for deducting military pay and mistreating soldiers.

### How to Overcome the Current Difficulties

……Expectations for Overseas Chinese……

[Manuscript from the National Salvation Society] On the day when the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee was held, our supreme leader gave us a very precise analysis of the overall situation of the War of Resistance in his opening remarks. The leader revealed to us that "If we recognize ourselves, recognize the × people, and recognize the inevitability of the development of the environment and things, then we can understand the number of successes and failures." The inevitable defeat of × and the inevitable victory of our country, this situation has already been determined; but if we want to strive for the glorious final victory, there are still many difficulties along the way. Therefore, the leader said: "First, we should use our unity and solidarity to deal with the arrogance and disorder of the × people, and to overcome the enemy from below; second, we should give full play to the special characteristic of our agricultural country of being thrifty and persevering, and deepen the weakness of the × people's industrial country; third, we should use our advantages of favorable climate and geographical location, step up all wartime construction, and promote the crisis of the collapse of ×'s society; fourth, we should truly practice the Three Principles of the People and overthrow the militarism of the × people."

In the past year, the unity within the country has reached a degree that ×× could not have imagined. All of the × people's provocations and discord have failed. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the army and civilians across the country are united in good faith and fighting to realize the new China of the Three Principles of the People. This unity has been further strengthened as the war enters a new stage. This can be known by simply looking at the rapid strengthening of forces in the military, political, economic, and cultural fields. Glorious victory is just around the corner, and this is what we can report to our compatriots who live abroad and are struggling hard with joyful and inspiring hearts.

But on the one hand, we must recognize the difficulties of the × people to strengthen our confidence in victory, but at the same time, we must also recognize that there are still difficulties existing in ourselves, and use all possible efforts to overcome them.

The difficulties currently faced by the × people, as the leader said in his opening remarks at the Fifth Plenary Session, cannot be overcome. But our difficulties are entirely dependent on whether we have the belief that we will win the War of Resistance, and whether we are willing to sacrifice ourselves to overcome these difficulties. Because our difficulties are all difficulties in terms of enjoyment, and they are temporary. The Chairman has given very clear instructions on this point, saying that those in front should take the lives of soldiers as the standard, and those in the rear should take the lives of ordinary people as the standard. This is a creed that every patriotic compatriot should follow very carefully in their personal lives.

We are a country with backward industries. Since the War of Resistance, we have lost some important seaports and cities, and we have also lost some transportation routes. Naturally, people feel a lot of inconvenience in their lives. But these inconveniences in personal life are precisely the reason for promoting national progress. When the seaports are lost, we can get rid of the shackles of foreign goods and put the old and new industries in the interior in a state of protection without competition. China is currently in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rid of ××'s economy.

In the country, for the victory of the War of Resistance, whether in the front or in the rear, a thrift campaign is being vigorously carried out, and the creed of reducing living standards has been earnestly implemented. Strict rules have also been set for those who do not follow this creed and are indulgent and unrestrained. We believe that in the iron fire training of this holy war, we will definitely be able to completely burn away all the bad habits that our nation has always had!

Now, we can't help but think of the compatriots fighting for the country overseas. The hard work, perseverance, thrift, and generosity of our overseas compatriots are well known to the world. Therefore, overseas compatriots are the pioneers of our domestic compatriots in reducing living standards and practicing thrift. However, recently, since the War of Resistance, a decadent atmosphere has emerged in Hong Kong, the Shanghai Concession, and some other places. Regarding this point, we are here to convey the news from the country. We hope that the vast majority of struggling compatriots can arouse the attention of the few compatriots who are accustomed to enjoying life in the place of residence, exercise self-restraint, and save useful gold and goods for long-term ×× and increased production. The Chairman's words, "Using our advantages of favorable climate and geographical location, stepping up all wartime construction," we hope that overseas compatriots will bravely take on this responsibility.

When this short article meets our overseas compatriots, it may be the lunar New Year. We would like to convey to you the news that the motherland is thriving and getting stronger in the war, as a happy New Year's message. At the same time, we hope that our compatriots will be as thrifty as possible in the difficult New Year, and use the money saved from unnecessary expenses to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and the wounded soldiers in the rear, as your New Year's gifts to them.

### Italy Announces Accelerated Military Preparations Supreme National Defense Council Holds Meeting France Also Discusses North African Defenses

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 10th] The Italian Supreme National Defense Council held its fourth regular meeting of the season yesterday at the Palazzo Venezia.

Presided over by Prime Minister Mussolini, the meeting discussed various construction plans that began on the 6th of this month. It is reported that the content includes revisions to various laws and regulations on national military organization, civilian and industrial, and economic mobilization.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] With the existence of a true Anglo-French military alliance, Italy has announced accelerated defense preparations. It is reported that the authorities have ordered reserve officers to enlist. The Diplomatic and Political Correspondence published an article today in response to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement, stating that although the Anglo-French alliance is for self-defense, Italy should not be confused by the word "self-defense." It is widely rumored that Italy, due to French troop movements in Tunisia, has also concentrated 50,000 to 80,000 troops in certain areas. Prime Minister Mussolini will hold a third meeting with the Defense Committee this Tuesday and has scheduled a National Defense Conference for Friday, lasting three days.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] The Italian political and diplomatic newspaper Corriere della Sera today disclosed various news items regarding Italy's accelerated military preparations. According to the newspaper's correspondent in London, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement is not enough to change Italy's established policy. Foreign Minister Ciano's newspaper, Il Telegrafo, stated, "We acknowledge that the Anglo-French military alliance was promoted by various fascist circles, and we also acknowledge that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States intend to end the Axis. However, we can already discern the final outcome of the current crisis. This outcome will lead to a major restructuring of the world."

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] The French Senate Defense Committee held a closed-door meeting yesterday. It is reported that the meeting discussed issues related to the defense of the North African coast. Naval Minister Campinchi declared that the execution of the naval plan has been very successful and is progressing rapidly, and that the situation of the navy has improved compared to last year. Other matters discussed included methods for attacking submarines and seaborne aircraft on warships. It is understood that the senators expressed great satisfaction with the words of Naval Minister Campinchi and the Senate rapporteur.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 9th] Today, the government issued a notice to the whole country, summoning reservists of the 1906 and 1907 classes for training. The official announcement claimed that this summons has no special significance and is "proceeding as usual." These two classes of reservists had previously not received training due to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. This treaty has now been completely destroyed.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th] A large number of young men here are being conscripted into the army or engaged in labor, resulting in a considerable shortage of labor. As a result, laundries have decided to implement austerity measures, switching to washing once a week for regular customers and generally refusing new customers.

### Rebel Troops Reach French Border Completely Occupy Le Perthus Rebel Troops Also Land on Minorca

Major Powers Begin to Compete for Position in Spain

[Associated Press, London, 10th] As the Spanish government forces debate whether to surrender or continue the war, European powers are beginning to compete for positions in Spain. Governments are attempting to gain advantages through words, coercion, intimidation, and persuasion. The recent secret mission of the British warship "Devonshire" to Minorca was intended to negotiate the handover of the island as a basis for diplomatic mediation in the war. In Paris, the French parliament also secretly convened to discuss strengthening national defense. The Italian authorities convened the third National Defense Conference, and Germany mobilized reserves. The Soviet Union also intends to sign a Black Sea agreement with related countries to obtain guarantees for its sphere of influence. These are all forms of power struggles among the major powers. The United Kingdom and France have intensified negotiations on the Spanish war in an attempt to achieve a diplomatic victory. It is understood that the British warship "Devonshire" is now hurrying to Marseille. It is reported that the ship has not returned to Mallorca, which proves that Mr. Sanluis, the governor of Mallorca, who took a warship to Marseille for a meeting, has now arrived in Mallorca. It is generally believed that Mr. Sanluis declared that Minorca should only be garrisoned by Spanish troops.

[Reuters, Le Perthus, 9th] Spanish rebel troops arrived here at 10:45 this morning and raised the rebel flag. Government ministers and other leaders had left beforehand, including Prime Minister Negrín, Foreign Minister Del Vayo, Chief of Staff General Rojo, and many other staff officers.

[Associated Press, Toulouse, 9th] It is reported that Spanish Prime Minister Negrín arrived here at 6 PM via private plane from Pamiers. His whereabouts are extremely secret, and confirmation is impossible. However, the airport in this town was indeed under heavy police guard for a time.

[Reuters, Le Perthus, 9th] The occupation of the Spanish part of Le Perthus by Spanish rebel troops has shocked the military authorities here, as government troops were still passing through the town safely in trucks just ten minutes earlier. The town is now completely occupied by rebel troops, without a shot fired. Three rebel flags are flying on the Franco-Spanish border, and the original government flags have been torn down. Three rebel generals are walking slowly on the streets, and citizens are hanging rebel flags from their windows and cheering. The rebel generals shook hands with the French commander defending the French border. The rebel troops shouted "Long live France!" and "France and Spain are brothers!" The rebel advance has plunged the citizens here into great confusion. The houses within the Spanish border are uninhabited, as the armed personnel crowded inside have all fled into the French border. Afterwards, the streets were quiet, with French troops guarding every fifty yards.

[Reuters, Burgos, 9th] Spanish rebel troops have occupied San Juan de las Abadesas, an industrial town fifteen miles from the border.

[Reuters, Burgos, 9th] It has just been announced here that Spanish rebel troops landed today in Ciudadela on the west coast of Minorca and joined up with local guards who support the rebellion. Many government military leaders have fled, and the island is almost entirely in the hands of the rebels. The landing force consisted of two infantry battalions, one artillery company, and their support units. The rebels have also redeployed a division from Barcelona to the island.

[Reuters, London, 9th] Reuters' foreign affairs correspondent, discussing the Spanish rebels' demand to control Minorca (one of the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean), pointed out that France is particularly concerned about the future of the island, as its occupation by an enemy would greatly threaten communication between France and its North African territories. Both the United Kingdom and France demand that the occupation of the island be managed solely by Spain. The British government's dispatch of an envoy aboard the cruiser "Devonshire" to discuss the peaceful surrender of the island with General Franco aims to achieve this goal.

[Reuters, London, 9th] The cruiser "Devonshire" left Minorca yesterday, carrying 450 refugees. It has been learned here that Colonel Sanluis, the rebel commander of Mallorca, arrived in Minorca yesterday aboard the "Devonshire." British officials stated that the British government dispatched the "Devonshire" at the request of the rebel authorities to transport Colonel Sanluis. It is still unknown whether Colonel Sanluis has left the island again.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] According to newspapers here, General Miaja, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish government forces, is consulting with General Franco in central Spain on the issue of a ceasefire. "Le Matin" also reported that, according to reliable sources, General Miaja has decided to abandon continued resistance. It is said that this decision was encouraged by the British and French governments, who intend to recognize the Franco government and are therefore advocating for reconciliation with Miaja. "Le Journal" stated that the Spanish Republican government has begun negotiations with the Franco government on the surrender of Madrid and the cessation of hostilities.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The Spanish Embassy in France has denied that France and Spain are currently holding talks to discuss ending the Spanish war and signing a ceasefire agreement.

### French Cabinet to Recognize Rebel Government in Spain Italy Also Discusses Spanish Affairs

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] The French cabinet meeting, originally scheduled for the 11th, has been postponed to the 14th due to new developments in the Spanish situation. It is generally believed that the French government hopes to resolve the current diplomatic dilemma in which the country finds itself, and hopes that by the 14th, it will be able to remove the last obstacles preventing the dispatch of a French envoy to the Spanish rebel zone. Furthermore, sources close to the French Foreign Ministry have refused to discuss the possibility of joint Anglo-French mediation in the Spanish conflict.

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Well-informed political circles believe that the French government will decide to recognize the Franco government at the cabinet meeting, but certain conditions must be met, the most important of which is the withdrawal of the Italian army from Spain. Left-wing figures believe that the French government is preparing to recognize the rebel government based on Franco's agreement to withdraw Italian troops, without demanding any guarantees. At the same time, the British and French governments are maintaining close contact and coordination on this issue.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] Yesterday afternoon, French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Ambassador Coulondre, the ambassador to Berlin. It is reported that the French ambassador conveyed to Bonnet the conversation he had with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and special information from the German Foreign Minister. It is generally believed that this meeting was related to the Spanish issue.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Responsible sources have stated that the US government has no intention of recognizing the Franco government in Spain at this time. The issue of recognition will not be considered until Franco has control over the majority of Spanish territory and the Republican government has completely surrendered. It is generally believed that the end of the Spanish war is still far off and has only reached its most critical stage.

[Reuters, Rome, 9th] The Italian Fascist Grand Council will hold its second meeting tomorrow. It is expected that not much discussion will be devoted to foreign affairs, as the previous meeting discussed them extensively. However, the Spanish issue, especially Minorca, will be discussed. It is anticipated that no sensational communiqué will be issued.

### Schacht to Tour the World

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 10th] It is reported that Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, the former president of the German Reichsbank, will embark on a private world tour during the day.

### Jones Praises China's Credit in US House of Representatives $25 Million Loan Stipulated Not to Purchase Arms

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Jesse Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), reported today to the House Banking and Currency Committee on the situation of the RFC, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and the Export-Import Bank. He stated that he is confident that China will be able to repay the $25 million it borrowed from the United States. Jones said, "I know China is willing to pay off its debts, and I also express my trust in the integrity and honesty of the Chinese people." Members of the House Banking and Currency Committee then inquired whether the $25 million loan was or would be used to purchase arms. Jones replied in the negative, stating that the agreement stipulates that this loan cannot be used to purchase arms. Jones further stated that he has no intention of providing loans to China at present. According to the law, he cannot do so. This loan is guaranteed by China, and as the bank is semi-governmental, the United States has loaned money to the Chinese government, and China will certainly be able to pay on time. China's repayment of debts is very creditworthy, and my view of the Chinese people is also very good.

### Britain Boycotts Japanese Goods Passes Additional Import Duty Act Retaliating Against Japan's Disregard of Far Eastern Interests

[Reuters, London, 10th] The British House of Commons passed an additional import duty act yesterday, targeting Japanese steel products. Opposition Labour MP Mr. Baker said that the government's claim that this measure would reduce the sale of Japanese goods is the least credible reason. Mr. Cross, who proposed the bill, said that the reason we want to exclude Japanese goods is because Japanese goods are manufactured by exploited labor, and that this action is to retaliate against Japan's disregard of British general interests in the Far East. We should be even more sympathetic to this bill and said that we previously advocated a united international exclusion of Japanese goods and hope that the government will also support this move.

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the quantity of frozen eggs produced in China and exported has fluctuated from time to time, and the impact has been that the market price is extremely unstable. The House of Commons recently passed a bill today to amend the existing import tax on frozen eggs, changing the original specific tax to an ad valorem tax.

### Pope Pius XI of Rome Dies of Heart Attack Testament States There Is Still Work to Be Completed Successor to the Pope is Bishop of Chieti

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] Pope Pius XI of Rome died at 4:31 AM (Greenwich Mean Time) this morning.

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] Pope Pius XI suffered a sudden heart attack yesterday, with his heart beating rapidly twice in one day. His condition worsened in the evening. When his heart failed for the second time at 8 PM, he was unable to speak. His attendants were quite worried. Although no official report on his condition was released, it is understood that the Pope suffered from cardiac asthma and inflammation of the bronchial tubes. After each heart failure, he was unconscious for more than half an hour. The Pope has now been moved to a bed, and his condition is extremely dangerous. The successor to the Pope, Bishop Chieti of Milan, arrived here last night.

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The serious illness of the Pope of Rome has caused concern in all quarters. The Pope's attendants said that the Pope deeply hoped to deliver an address to 200 Italian bishops this Saturday. His strong desire to do so may prolong his life. The Pope has been seriously ill for several years and has repeatedly given up hope of recovery.

[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] According to semi-official sources, the last words of Pope Pius XI were, "We still have some work that needs to be completed." Those standing by the Pope's bedside said, "The Pope was still conscious at the time of his death and automatically tilted his head on the pillow."

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] After the death of Pope Pius XI of Rome, the publication of newspapers here was advanced by four hours compared to normal, with three or four pages of mourning texts. People everywhere are discussing the Pope's death. Thousands of people went to the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. All government agencies and public buildings are flying flags at half-mast to express mourning. This Sunday, St. Peter's Basilica will hold a 10th-anniversary celebration of the agreement between the Pope and the King. King Emmanuel and Prime Minister Mussolini will send representatives to participate in the ceremony.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 10th] After the death of Pope Pius XI, people across Italy expressed grief. Pius was born on May 31, 1857, with the childhood name of Achille Ratti. His father, Francesco Ratti, was the manager of a silk factory. After graduating from the St. Charles College in Milan, Achille was guided by the Bishop of Milan and sent to the Lombard College in Rome for further study. He was ordained as a priest on December 20, 1879, and three years later became a professor of theology at a university. In 1912, he was summoned to Rome as the Deputy Director of the Vatican Library. In 1919, he was promoted to Papal Nuncio to Poland and Archbishop of Lepanto. When the Communist uprising in Poland occurred, he remained in Warsaw. On January 22, 1922, after the death of Pope Benedict XV, Achille Ratti was elected as Pope, taking the name Pius XI. Since then, he has devoted himself to Church affairs, eliminating various obstacles between the Church and the government, and signing Church agreements with Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, and Germany.

Note: Pope Pius XI of Rome, aged 82, was born in 1857 in a rural village in the territory of Milan, Italy. After growing up, he worked as a manager in the Vatican Library. Because of his intelligence and fluency in more than 20 languages, he spoke in English with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax during a meeting last month. During the Great War, he was the Papal Nuncio to Warsaw. In 1919, he was promoted to Archbishop of Lepanto, and the following year he was appointed Archbishop of Milan. In 1922, after the death of the previous Pope, he was elected to succeed as Pope. During his pontificate, his greatest achievement was resolving the Roman Question with the Italian government. He was a staunch anti-communist and therefore strongly supported the rebels in the Spanish Civil War. He was also very concerned about the Sino-Japanese War, as it greatly affected the affairs of the Shinto Church in Liaodong. Pius XI was the 260th Pope of the Holy Roman Catholic Church and currently has 400 million followers.

Brief Commentary

### Cherishing Talent!

In order to strive for the complete liberation of the Chinese nation, no Chinese sons and daughters should be abandoned outside the cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction! Furthermore, no specialized talents should be abandoned outside the cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. This newspaper's special dispatch from Chongqing on the 10th states that Minister of Political Affairs Chen Cheng sent a letter to the Ministry of Education, which was then forwarded to all specialized schools above the college level, stating that graduates who do not yet have employment may be permitted to apply to become military training instructors in the National Army, and that all procedures will be waived, etc. General Chen's order can be seen as a major indication of the authorities' cherishing of talent, and we should support it with both hands.

However, we still cannot fail to point out that in the nineteen months since the War of Resistance, although our country's politics has made considerable progress, and specialized talents from all fields have repeatedly been given opportunities by the government to display their strengths, the efforts and advocacy of the highest leaders in this regard are especially moving, but mid-level and lower-level leaders still fail to faithfully implement them. As a result, corrupt and incompetent individuals, conservative and stubborn elements, and opportunists who take advantage of the times are still able to muddle along in positions of authority, while patriotic, responsible, and nationally conscious youth, experts with rich experience, knowledge, and noble character, and talented individuals with the determination to resist the war and prestige among the masses are still mostly idle and discarded, or even destitute and displaced, unable to fulfill their national duty even if they desire to do so. Other instances of talent being buried in trivial tasks, and incompetent officials holding high positions, are particularly common everywhere. At this turning point in the nation's destiny, we sincerely hope that the authorities will build on their achievements and take a further step, eradicating the remnants of feudalism, strictly prohibiting partisan prejudices, and ensuring that all talents in the country are given opportunities to apply their skills and abilities to the fullest. At the same time, we also hope that those who are lamenting their misfortune of not being recognized for their talents will not remain aloof and self-admiring, blaming others and the world. Those who have the opportunity to dedicate themselves to the country and the people and can display their talents should step forward enthusiastically and set an example for the masses.

Finally, we should be aware that the cause of national liberation has only just begun to show a glimmer of light, and the future is fraught with difficulties and hardships that may be beyond our imagination. Even with the full mobilization of national talents, there may not be enough to cope with the arduous tasks ahead. Therefore, we must promptly and properly prohibit certain localities from persecuting capable youth due to partisan prejudices, and a small number of individuals from inciting internal divisions under the pretext of anti-communism based on personal biases. Otherwise, it would be a great disservice to the authorities' great intention of cherishing talent, sharing national difficulties, and saving the nation!

### "The Most Wonderful Program"

The local ZKW broadcasting station broadcast last night a piece of news from London about the Spanish "Civil War." The sound of marching soldiers and vehicles could be faintly heard. It is said that residents who heard this news on the radio considered it the most wonderful program since the establishment of radio stations in Hong Kong. We hope that those who hear this kind of wonderful program in the future should take a few minutes to:

(1) Think about how the Spanish democratic government and its people are fighting for their country's freedom and world peace. How are they, under the ravages and massacres of the German and Italian aggressor armies, and under the hypocritical betrayal of weak democratic countries, helping us to resist and weaken Japanese aggression?

(2) Hearing the broadcasting of the Spanish war from thousands of miles away should make us think even more about how, just dozens or hundreds of miles away from us, the war of Japanese ×× and their aggression against our motherland is being staged. What is being ravaged and massacred is our farmland and homes, and our elders, relatives, and friends!

The Lunar New Year is approaching soon. Do not let the sounds of firecrackers, laughter, and lewdness cover up these wonderful programs! Do not deprive yourselves of a chance for the best blessing! We must use donations, participation in the "One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement," and participation in the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees to bless the health and victory of our motherland and our Western comrades!

### Smuggling Across the Sino-British Border Becomes Increasingly Active; Kowloon Customs Expands Armed Anti-Smuggling Team; Large Quantities of Tungsten Ore, Silver, and Copper Coins from Occupied Areas are Smuggled into Hong Kong; Tungsten Ore Exported East Reaches Over 1,500 Tons in the Past Ten Days Alone

Since the change in the situation in South China, smugglers who only see profit have become very active, colluding with × people to search for military raw materials, mainly tungsten, and scrap copper and iron in the countryside, smuggling them into Hong Kong in large quantities, selling them to × merchants, concentrating them for export to the East. For more than three months, these smuggled goods have been arriving continuously. Recently, it has become even more rampant, and under the instigation of × people, they have even started to collect silver and copper coins, hoping to disrupt our country's financial structure. After the anti-smuggling network on the Sino-British border in Kowloon and Shenzhen resumed its work, the authorities, seeing the increasing rampancy of smugglers, planned to expand the anti-smuggling force to take meticulous preventative measures on both land and water along the Sino-British border. However, smugglers are cunning and have the protection of × people, so they have not been deterred in the slightest, and continue to smuggle rampantly. Large quantities of tungsten ore, silver, copper coins, and scrap copper and iron are still being smuggled out.

Strengthening Forces, Intensifying Anti-Smuggling Efforts

According to news from Kowloon Customs yesterday, the authorities are aware of the increasing activity of smugglers, so they have decided to make a large-scale expansion of the anti-smuggling force on the Sino-British border in Shenzhen. After careful planning, a detailed plan has been completed and submitted to the Central Ministry of Finance and the Inspector General of Customs for approval, and implementation has begun in sequence. The main focus is to increase the number of personnel in the anti-smuggling team. Currently, two special anti-smuggling teams and three bicycle anti-smuggling teams have been organized. The members of each team are also equipped with new weapons to give them sufficient ability to deal with smugglers at any time. Recently, it is planned to organize several machine gun teams to join the anti-smuggling efforts. Currently, the Customs authorities have ordered border anti-smuggling detectives to intensify their work, in addition to constant day and night patrols, and to cooperate with village self-defense groups and the people along the border to investigate smuggling. In late last month, with the help of villagers, more than 20 smuggling cases were uncovered, and several hundred tons of tungsten ore were intercepted. At the same time, in order to achieve quick results, the Hong Kong Customs anti-smuggling officers will also cooperate to find clues and indirectly uncover the Chinese border agencies and routes.

Smugglers Advance on Land and Sea

According to those who know the inside story of smuggling, the most common routes for smugglers to export are the land and water routes on the Sino-British border. They have many accomplices and are exceptionally well-informed, often making it difficult for customs officers to cope. They have fixed goods storage agencies in villages near the Sino-British border, where they first transport the goods collected from the countryside in the mainland to the Chinese border village agencies, and then take the opportunity to transport them into the British border for storage, and then hire trucks or local people to transport them to Hong Kong. This is the situation of land smuggling. As for water smuggling, it is mostly carried out by cargo boats, which take the opportunity to cross the British border from the Chinese border and transport them directly to Hong Kong. The most active areas for smugglers are the seas bordering Castle Peak and Baoan, and the Dapeng area is also their lair. The Customs anti-smuggling force's scope of influence only extends to the Chinese border, so once smugglers' goods are transferred to the British border, there is nothing that can be done, and they can calmly transport them to their destination.

The Amount of Tungsten Ore Exported is Astounding

According to investigations, the largest category of goods smuggled into Hong Kong is tungsten ore, and the profits are also the highest. Every 100 catties can often earn dozens of dollars in profit. The next largest category is silver and copper coins, which also have significant profits to be made. Although the central government has been buying silver, there is still a huge amount of silver used and collected by the people in the countryside. Copper coins are even more commonly used as auxiliary currency. They are now urgently seeking to absorb our silver and copper coins to disrupt our financial economy. They are intensifying their efforts in the occupied areas and are enticing smugglers to collect silver from the countryside in our mainland. After collecting the silver, they melt it into ingots of various sizes before smuggling it into Hong Kong. Copper coins are stored in wooden boxes and straw bags for smuggling. Once they arrive at their destination, they are bought by × merchants at high prices, and then exported to the East in batches. According to investigations by reporters, in the past ten days, three batches of sand, totaling more than 1,500 tons, have been moved from a certain ×× street and ×× store to a certain ship anchored on the ×× sea, and over 300 bags of copper coins have been hired to be transported to the seaside at night and transferred to a ship, approximately every four or five days, a batch is transported to a certain ship for export to the East, and this has been uninterrupted for the past two or three months.

### Hai Long Sailing Ship Returns to Port After Encountering a Hurricane Immediately After Leaving Port; Will Cross the Ocean Again in Ten Days

Boatswain Harry Bolton and eleven companions recently sailed from Hong Kong in the Chinese sailing ship Hai Long, intending to make the grand journey across the Pacific to America. However, after sailing for several days, not far from Keelung, a storm suddenly arose. The ship's engine was not suitable for long-distance navigation, and because crew member Potter was seriously ill, they decided to return to port. They arrived at 11:10 pm last night (the 11th) and immediately sent Potter to the European War Memorial Hospital for treatment. According to Bolton's statement to reporters, although his companions have suffered setbacks, their ambitions have not been extinguished and they will continue their second voyage. The ship is currently being repaired and should be able to cross the ocean again in ten days. Potter has decided to stay in Hong Kong for treatment and will no longer depart with the group.

### Chen Lianbo Promotes Guangxi Mining Industry; Personally Supervises Workers After the War of Resistance to Work Hard; Rumors of Returning to Hong Kong for Medical Treatment a Month Ago are Untrue

Chen Lianbo has been managing gold mines in Guangxi in recent years and has achieved considerable success. Several months ago, he contracted malignant malaria in Guangxi and returned to Hong Kong to be treated by doctors Ye Dazhen and Hu Huide. He was bedridden for several months and has only recently recovered. Evil people have taken this opportunity to spread various rumors in an attempt to undermine and divide the unity of the War of Resistance. Those with discernment know that their plan will not succeed. Yesterday, reporters met with Mr. Chen and asked about the industrial situation in Guangxi Province. According to him, since the War of Resistance, the mining industry in Guangxi Province has continued to advance as usual. The only difficulty is that the implementation of conscription in Guangxi Province has made it slightly difficult to recruit workers. At present, our country has decided to persist in the War of Resistance and especially to develop agriculture as soon as possible to increase production and strengthen the War of Resistance, which can also be used to settle refugees, achieving two goals at once. Therefore, the Guangxi Provincial Government pays special attention to promoting the agricultural and mining industries in the province. Since the War of Resistance, I have personally gone to the mines to supervise the workers, encouraging them to work bravely and normally to increase national income and fulfill a citizen's duty. Mr. Chen also stated that during the "January 28th" Nineteenth Route Army's War of Resistance in Shanghai, he raised funds in Hong Kong to support the Nineteenth Route Army, and as chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, he worked hard to provide relief to refugees. Last year, his friend Chen Jintao was used by × people to act as a puppet in the Nanjing puppet organization. Mr. Lianbo once sent a telegram to severely rebuke him. This letter was published in the newspapers at the time, which shows his character.

### Two Major Armed Robberies Occur in Kowloon and the New Territories; Robbery in a House in Ho Sheung Heung Results in Loss of Over Two Thousand Yuan; Revenue Collectors Robbed on the Road in Yau Ma Tei

The rampancy of bandits has been shocking and horrifying. Those responsible for maintaining law and order have paid attention, but it is impossible to prevent everything. Yesterday morning, between 12:45 AM and 1:00 AM, two robbery cases occurred in succession in the New Territories and Yau Ma Tei, resulting in significant losses. The details of the robberies are recorded below:

Breaking in Through the Roof

In an unnumbered house in Ho Sheung Heung, New Territories, a young woman named Hou Jinsheng and her husband, Mr. Liu, lived together. The Liu couple made a living by farming and had some savings, which made them the target of bandits. At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Madam Hou was fast asleep when she heard the sound of tiles being removed. She quickly got out of bed and listened quietly, and lit a lamp to see what was happening. Before long, she saw a hole open and heard someone jumping down. She then saw seven bandits come down from the attic, one holding a sharp sword and one holding a pistol, and they began to threaten Madam Hou.

Entering in the Dark, Exiting in the Light

One bandit kept watch over her, while the rest searched the house thoroughly. About an hour later, they left shouting and hurriedly. When the bandits left, they exited through the front door and locked it from the outside to prevent Madam Hou from reporting the crime. Afterwards, Madam Hou managed to open the door and arrived at the police station at 3:00 AM to report the crime. According to Madam Hou, the bandits robbed her of HK$1,100, CN$900, six gold rings worth $48, three gold butterflies and 344 pieces of coral pearl jewelry worth $175, and one gold-inlaid jade bracelet worth $40, one pair of rattan bracelets worth $25.

Robbing Revenue Collectors

Also, Mr. Qiu Rong, the owner of Yiu Kwong Mirror Shop, went to Sham Shui Po the day before yesterday to collect old debts from customers, totaling $280. Mr. Qiu returned home late at night. When he passed near Pak Street and Jordan Road in Yau Ma Tei, he was suddenly rushed out of a building by three bandits. One bandit pointed a gun at him and ordered him to hand over the money, otherwise he would be killed. Under the threat, Mr. Qiu was forced to obey, as the night was late and quiet and he was afraid of being harmed if he shouted. The bandits fled after getting their hands on the money. Mr. Qiu then went to the police station to report the crime.

### Saving Money for Donations and Group Travel; Spending the Lunar New Year in a New Way; Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Amateur Social Club and Others Advocate

— Ji Zhuo

As the Lunar New Year approaches, the custom of celebrating "Lunar New Year" is still deeply rooted, and habits cannot be changed overnight. ——This is an undeniable fact.

It is said that in Hong Kong, the customs and habits of the Lunar New Year are extremely elaborate, labor-intensive, and costly, and cannot be compared with those of other places. If the world were peaceful and the economy were prosperous, it would be forgivable to have a carnival after a year of hard work. However, this New Year's Day is descending upon the world amidst the flames of war and the wails of refugees. Can we still bear to follow the old customs, burn the firecrackers of New Year's Eve in vain, and waste valuable wealth at will? This is a serious question that is worth our careful reflection.

If we are not blind, we can see how the 800,000 newly arrived compatriots in Hong Kong came to be; if we are not deaf, we can hear what kind of life our compatriots are living after half of our motherland has fallen; if we have thoughts, we can also understand who gave us our suffering. In the face of this serious misfortune, looking at the afflicted compatriots and thinking about our future, who can bear to indulge in pleasure as in the past?

According to custom, we must drive away the entanglement of "evil spirits" and pray for the blessing of "gods" during the Lunar New Year. From the blood-like lessons, we have realized that the greatest evil spirit is the Japanese warlords; the only thing that can truly protect us is the nation! Since the fall of Guangzhou, the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have experienced this conceptualized theory with 120,000 points of sincerity. The auspicious words that are mutually blessed on New Year's Day can only be realized when the War of Resistance is won, and there can be no luck.

In response to this fact, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has launched a campaign to promote a thrift movement for the Lunar New Year, which is clearly a very meaningful and urgent task at present. It is reported that the association has drafted a small notice and measures, printed in the form of invitations, and distributed to all trades and businesses for unified implementation. The main points are: The dates of the Lunar New Year thrift movement are from December 20th of the year of Wuyin to January 16th of the year of Jimao. The funds saved will be used entirely for the relief of war refugees and will be paid by January 16th. This simple invitation is printed in pink and lists the types of savings in addition to the small notice and measures, which are to be filled in by the savers themselves.

Any compatriot with a little bit of blood will feel deeply gratified after hearing this news, and pray that it will expand like wildfire.

This is a gratifying and comforting piece of information. Yesterday, when reporters met with Mr. Wang Junheng of the Hong Kong Amateur Social Club, they learned that the Amateur Social Club also responded to this thrift movement and proposed measures to contribute to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce for adoption. In order to spread this movement to every corner of Hong Kong, the club is also working with the Reporters Association, the Youth Reporters Association, the YMCA, the Women's Association, and other groups to jointly undertake the task of promoting it. The club's views on this matter will be published in a statement during the day. This is naturally something that everyone is happy to raise their hands in support of and cheer for without reservations.

Mr. Wang also enthusiastically told reporters that during the Lunar New Year, everyone is on vacation and there is no proper recreation. Therefore, they are either bored or distressed, or they are tempted by improper entertainment. Therefore, the club plans to hold group travel during the Lunar New Year. On the one hand, they can enjoy the pleasure of sightseeing in the beautiful nature, and they can also take this rare opportunity to connect with the members of the society. There is also a more important task, which is to launch a discussion on how to save money for donations. ——Lively and serious, it is naturally the group life that is needed today.

The association is a healthy group organized by professionals from all walks of life in Hong Kong, and its sister organization of the same nature, the Hong Kong Bankers' Amateur Social Club, also has similar actions. The future impact is expected to have good effects.

It is also reported that the Reporters Association also plans to hold group travel on the Lunar New Year's Day to live a meaningful and collective life that needs to be promoted.

It is further reported that timber, cloth, foreign goods, and other business houses are also responding to the suggestions of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and have decided to first forgo the Spring Festival banquet. Mrs. Liang Pei, director of general affairs of the Hong Kong Women's War Relief Association, recently saved the expenses for her husband Liang Pei's birthday and donated CN$1,000, which was remitted to the War Relief Association for distribution. The association also received CN$100 from the workers of the Taikoo Western Warehouse, surplus profits from Chen Xin's charity sale of HK$30, and 19 bags of flour from the Huaan Guesthouse. The movement to save money to save the country is gaining momentum.

Come on! Enlarge your vision and promote this movement! As long as we act in good conscience and save within our means, the wounded soldiers, refugees, the country, and the nation will benefit greatly! Changing the perception of international friends will also increase our dignity in living in Hong Kong. Come on! Promoting this movement is the unshirkable responsibility of the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. We are all Chinese, don't be dazed anymore! Get up, dear compatriots!

### Governor of Hong Kong to Build a Beautiful Yacht; Allocation of $400,000 Proposed; To be Discussed at the Next Legislative Council Meeting

According to reliable sources, the authorities will submit a request to the Legislative Council to approve an appropriation of $400,000 to build a small 120-foot-long launch, the uses of which will be (1) the Governor's yacht, (2) a training ship for the Naval Volunteer Force (which will be renamed the British Naval Reserve), and (3) a supply ship for lighthouses. Since the sinking of the rescue launch Jiuxing in the typhoon disaster of last year, Hong Kong has lacked the equipment for a rescue launch. Therefore, it is the opinion of the general public that the launch should be equipped with rescue equipment to replace Jiuxing. However, the design of the launch has already been drafted, and although its equipment can withstand hurricanes, rescue equipment such as towing boats is still lacking. The launch is very luxuriously decorated, in preparation for the Governor to sail out to sea for leisure during his spare time, so the equipment is very complete. When the plan is submitted to the Legislative Council for a vote in the future, if it is considered necessary to add rescue equipment, it will be necessary to make major changes. The old Jiuxing launch is no longer suitable for rescue work, and it is extremely difficult to fire up the launch. During the typhoon season, it is necessary to keep the fire burning all day in preparation for departure, so the annual cost of maintaining the launch is very high, and its use is limited and cannot be used to supply lighthouses, so it is equivalent to being abandoned. Now, if the new launch plan is approved by the Legislative Council, a tender will be invited immediately. In addition, the authorities may build two more launches for general purposes.

### One Page of Brilliant Broadcasts in Hong Kong: Broadcasting Station Received Western War News Yesterday; Sound of Military Footsteps and Vehicles Faintly Audible

Hong Kong's ZBW broadcasting station yesterday (10th) received news from London regarding the Spanish Civil War. The news was relayed by a BBC war correspondent, who connected from Li Bao-de, on the Spanish border, via telephone to England, and then rebroadcast it globally. Wireless radio users in Hong Kong all received the news, which was very clear. When it was announced that Franco's troops were only three miles from the border, the sound of advancing military footsteps was faintly audible. At that time, the government troops had already entered French territory, and the rumbling of military vehicles vibrated in the ears. According to the correspondent, these were Russian troops, heavily laden with military equipment, and the Spanish government's prime minister and foreign minister were holding an emergency meeting a few yards from the correspondent. Hong Kong residents who listened to this news on the radio all agreed that it was the most brilliant program since the establishment of radio stations in Hong Kong.

### Overseas Filipino-Cantonese Chinese Donate Two Thousand Dollars to Relief Efforts for Distressed Fishermen in Hong Kong; Fishermen's Association Sends Letter of Thanks Yesterday

The Philippine Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association, recognizing that our country's fishing boats have been repeatedly robbed and killed by × ships, leaving tens of thousands of fishermen displaced and destitute, and that assisting those in distress is a shared responsibility, raised one thousand dollars and remitted it to the Hong Kong Relief Federation, requesting it to be transferred to the Fishermen's Association for use in relieving distressed fishermen. The Fishermen's Association deeply appreciates the Philippine Association's assistance and yesterday entrusted the Relief Federation to send a letter of thanks. The letter is recorded below: "To the esteemed members of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association, We, the Fishermen's Association, received a letter from Mr. Cai Chusheng on the 4th of this month, along with an official letter from the Hong Kong Joint Relief Committee for South China, stating that the Philippine Cantonese Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association has donated two thousand national currency dollars to the Fishermen's Advancement Association for the relief of fishermen, and entrusting Mr. Cai with the responsibility, and requesting a detailed plan for distributing the relief funds. We immediately drafted a plan for industrial relief cooperation and construction, emphasizing collective economics to promote both charity and production, and replied to Mr. Cai, who agreed. Yesterday (7th), our association issued a receipt and received the two thousand national currency dollars. Now, we can only ask the Hong Kong Relief Federation to convey our sincere gratitude to the Philippine Cantonese Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association, and express our association's willingness to do its utmost to serve the fishermen. If our strength is insufficient, we will rely on the assistance and encouragement of enthusiastic members of society. If you do not forsake us, we implore you to provide guidance. We thank you in advance and will report further on our progress. Sincerely, we extend our best wishes to the esteemed members of the Philippine Cantonese Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association."

### Ample Supply of Firewood Arrives From Various Ports; Firewood Shortage Crisis Over; Firewood Prices Will Gradually Decline; No Possibility of Skyrocketing; Over 100,000 Piculs of Singapore Firewood to Arrive Soon

The supply of firewood to Hong Kong has been cut off for many days, and firewood prices have soared. As of last month, the supply was still scarce, and the situation of expensive firewood had not improved. During this difficult time, with the Lunar New Year drawing to a close, firewood consumption is expected to increase by 500,000 to 600,000 piculs compared to usual. Housewives generally worried that firewood prices would continue to rise. The reporter specially visited Mr. Fang Meiquan, chairman of the Firewood Industry and Commerce Association, to inquire about the source of firewood from various rivers and whether the firewood shortage issue had been resolved. He said that with the shipping routes from various rivers now somewhat open, Hong Kong merchants are competing to purchase from other ports, and the difficult situation has been overcome. The supply of firewood from various places is continuous, and firewood prices will only gradually decline, with no possibility of rising. Judging from the current situation, the amount of firewood stockpiled in Hong Kong is even greater than in the same period last year. Since last week, firewood prices have decreased by about ten catties per dollar compared to before. Singapore, Sandakan, Shantou, and Guangzhou Bay firewood is priced at 80 catties per dollar, Haikou firewood at 90 catties per dollar, and Annam Haiphong firewood averages 150 catties per dollar (all wholesale prices), but there are few buyers, because the goods are not dry and difficult to burn. The American West America is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow, carrying about 100,000 piculs of Kuala Lumpur firewood, with a wholesale price of about 115 catties per dollar, so it is expected that firewood prices will fall even further.

### Governor to Hold a Festive Banquet for Hong Kong Justices of the Peace and Members of the Legislative and Executive Councils

After the abandonment of Guangzhou, the publication moved to Guilin to prepare for resumption of publication. The current re-launch issue has arrived in Hong Kong, with an article by Liao Bingzhi refuting Wang Jingwei and his followers' traitorous theories after Wang's departure, which is worth discussing. Other articles include Pu Te's "Current Issues in Defending Dongjiang" and Pan Lang's "Calling on Overseas Chinese to Develop Western Economic Construction," all of which are quite excellent.

Special Feature

### A Meeting with Ms. Huang Xiuji, Executive of the National YMCA, Regarding Relief for Refugee Students

— Qiao Ren

The flames of invasion have reached every corner of the land, and the people have tasted the bitterness of displacement and hardship. They have nothing to eat, nowhere to live, and even everyone's career has been ruined, starting their lives of wandering and fleeing. But the motherland is fighting to resist unreasonable aggression, and is firmly prepared to endure any difficulties and hardships to support the long-term war of resistance, as long as the goal of freedom and liberation is achieved. When will the refugees stop wandering, and where will they flee to? We really cannot continue to wander, and we really cannot continue to flee. Each of us is needed by the motherland! Especially the countless students who have fled from the war zones to various places, abandoning their studies, is simply a great loss to the foundation of the country!

The Student Department of the National YMCA, in order to provide relief to these out-of-school youths, has specially organized the National Student Relief Association. It has received enthusiastic sympathy from the Student Mutual Aid Association and the Far Eastern Student Relief Association, and has promoted these relief affairs to various places. With the financial support from enthusiastic people at home and abroad, the work has been carried out smoothly, and local committees have been established in various places. In Hong Kong, Ms. Huang Xiuji, an executive of the Student Department specially dispatched by the National YMCA, is in charge. Ms. Huang has been in Hong Kong for a long time and has achieved considerable success in her work of providing relief to refugee students. The reporter heard that Ms. Huang was about to leave Hong Kong, so yesterday I specially visited her to inquire about the recent progress of the relief effort for refugee students.

The reporter met Ms. Huang in the reception room of the YWCA. Her simple and unadorned clothes and kind attitude gave me the impression of a typical woman of the era. After explaining my purpose, Ms. Huang gave me a detailed account of the progress of the relief effort for refugee students.

"Since the war in South China broke out and Guangzhou unfortunately fell, many students from the mainland have fled to Hong Kong. Therefore, providing relief to refugee students in Hong Kong is an urgent task. The headquarters has extended this work to Shanghai, Beiping, Wuhan, Xi'an, Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places, where local committees have been established. I was commissioned by the headquarters to come to Hong Kong and, together with the YMCA and YWCA, and leaders enthusiastic about student affairs, to organize the Hong Kong Student Relief Committee, which specializes in handling this work. I am very grateful for the help of the gentlemen of the press, who have worked hard to publicize this matter, making the promotion of the work very smooth. At present, the relief work for refugee students in Hong Kong can be said to have achieved unexpected success. There are already more than 200 students registered, and the first batch of applications for subsidies for travel expenses to go to school in the mainland, more than 120 have been approved, and many more are being registered.

"The relief measures for these refugee students generally include six items: (1) loans, (2) tuition subsidies, (3) student dormitories, (4) travel expense subsidies, (5) special training classes, and (6) job placement. The method of relief will be decided based on their individual circumstances. Most of the students registered in Hong Kong are willing to return to the mainland to study, so requests for the fourth type of relief measure are the most numerous. As Mr. Xu Shiying said well: History tells us that there are often great thinkers or writers in times of turmoil. As long as we can work harder to seek knowledge in the midst of difficulties and hardships, the future will be bright. Therefore, we must bring many refugee students back to the motherland, so that they will feel closer to the motherland and have easier access to opportunities to serve the country."

Finally, Ms. Huang told the reporter that she had decided to leave Hong Kong for the mainland this afternoon (i.e., yesterday) to continue the relief work. Her itinerary is to take the Guangdong steamer to Haiphong first, and then transfer to Guilin, Kunming, and Guiyang, and at the same time, she will discuss the resettlement of refugee students returning to the mainland from Hong Kong in detail with the local education authorities. Because Ms. Huang was busy preparing for her trip, the reporter bid her farewell.

Transportation and Travel

### From Shantou to Saigon (1)

— Hua You

The Dark Side of the Passenger Trade

If you have ever paid attention to the Shantou newspapers, then you will understand how the Shantou passenger agencies have manipulated Singapore ship tickets in the past year. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, a ticket to Annam (first-class cabin) could be bought for just over ten yuan in Shantou currency. After the war broke out, many wealthy families and ignorant young men from all over the Chaozhou region avoided conscription, so there was a particularly large increase in the number of people going to Southeast Asia to be exploited by foreigners. Tickets to Singapore, Siam, and other places cost no less than three or four hundred yuan. How could ordinary families raise so much money for travel? They had no choice but to go to Annam. Although Annam has import taxes and head taxes, they total only thirty or forty yuan in Vietnamese currency, and even with travel expenses, it should not exceed eighty yuan (in national currency). Of course, it is much cheaper than going to Singapore, Siam, and other places! Therefore, the three steamers going to Vietnam—the Pacific, the Li Men, and the Great China—were always packed like pig transporters (according to a purser on the Li Men, whenever the steamer approached the Saigon River, the ×××× Bureau's ×××× could not help but ask the ship owner, "How many pigs have you brought this time?"). The Shantou inns (except for Wu Shunxing Inn) usually wanted to extract a large profit from passengers going to Singapore, and at this point had to shift their focus, extorting from those going to Annam. Now I will write about my personal experience of being exploited at the time, so that those from the Chaozhou region going there will know what to avoid.

Because I had not been to Annam for six years, everything felt unfamiliar to me. In particular, I found it very strange how the price of ship tickets to Annam had risen after the war of resistance. This time, I bought tickets to Annam at a certain address in Chaoan City (I will conceal the name for now). When I first asked them, they said it was 27 yuan in national currency per ticket, but the next day, I saw them holding a telegram from a certain passenger agency on Ronglong Street in Shantou (their affiliated company), saying that there were many passengers and the ticket price had risen to 30 yuan! Although I am not a cunning merchant, I also understand that there is such a thing as "prices fluctuating from morning to night" in the business world, so I mistakenly assumed that they had so-called morning and evening prices, and without thinking, I booked two tickets.

Since Chaozhou and Shantou were bombed by × planes at the same time on July 2, the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway also changed its train timetable to twice a day, morning and evening. We took the night train to Shantou on July 17. Because an air raid alert was issued in Shantou that evening, we waited at the Caitang station for a full hour before we could rush south. When we arrived at the Shantou station, illuminated by several large floodlights, we could not help but sigh at the ruins left behind by the × aircraft at the beginning of the month! When we took a rickshaw into the city, we saw the entire Shantou city buried in the black dawn of the night god, which could not help but remind us of Shantou before being destroyed by × aircraft, when the myriad electric lights illuminated the entire Shantou city, making it so beautiful and lovely! And thinking that tonight, my wife and I were embarking on a journey to a dark land, preparing to flee overseas, made us hate the inhumanity of the × people even more!

After entering the inn, everything was unpleasant—their rooms and their bedding were as dirty as their personalities, making me want to vomit for three days! We had no choice but to temporarily leave our luggage there and take a car to the Overseas Chinese Hotel to open a room.

The inn's business was terribly bleak! This made us feel very lucky to have such a quiet place, because there were no electric lights. The room had only a bean-sized kerosene lamp and a three-inch-long, pen-like hole of white light. Fortunately, the place was quiet and the bedding was clean, which gave us, a couple about to flee overseas, a lot of comfort. Speaking of the price, the rent, including tips, was only a little more than one dollar, which was exceptionally cheap!

Early in the morning, two rickshaws were waiting for us at the door of the hotel—we had told them in advance last night. Everywhere the rickshaw passed, the shops were tightly closed. When you looked closely, you could see that many shops were guarded by iron generals. The police patrolling along the way constantly questioned the rickshaw drivers, "Why haven't you gone to Zhongshan Park for training?" The rickshaw drivers replied, "We'll go after we finish this business." According to the rickshaw drivers, today was the first day of training for rickshaw drivers in Shantou. After hearing their words, I was glad that I had called them to wait at the door of the hotel last night, otherwise, I don't know how I would have reached the Dehexing Inn this morning, as I am so unfamiliar with the streets of Shantou.

After arriving at the inn, we began to go through the formalities for leaving the country. The so-called formalities involved filling out an emigration application. I dare not say that this procedure is wrong, but when it is not handled properly, it becomes a nuisance to overseas Chinese. For example, the four-inch headshot photo affixed to the application form could have been taken freely at any photography studio, as long as the face matched. However, the Shantou inns stipulated that the photography fee was collected by them, and they casually took us to a quick-shot studio on the street to take a photo, charging six dimes in national currency. In addition, the vaccination fee at the Shantou Customs Epidemic Prevention Center was two yuan in Shantou currency, equivalent to more than eight dimes in national currency (it used to be free), but the inn charged an additional two dimes for some kind of handling fee. After the emigration application was filled out, the inn's clerk would usually advise you not to go to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau for questioning, saying that it would save you the trouble of this procedure for just two dollars. Unfortunately, I am not a trafficker of people and do not need to pay the two dollars. Writing this makes me very sad! The establishment of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau was originally intended to prevent criminals from trafficking in people or abducting women, and its intention was very good! Unexpectedly, it has also become a way for people to make money. With two dollars, you can take a woman out of the country, which is not even the price of a pig!

We insisted on going to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau for questioning, and the people in the inn always tried to deceive you with all kinds of words, saying that the seaplane of the × warship parked outside the island had already taken off, or that an air raid alert had been issued in Chenghai, and they would definitely deceive you into paying them two dollars. Helpless, we were determined to be bombed to death by × planes rather than spend the two dollars unjustly, and went to the city government. In this way, the inn sent a clerk to follow us. The reason why they sent this clerk was not to help you, but to instruct you, "When the interrogating officer asks you how much you bought your ticket for, please tell him twenty-four yuan." After hearing this rare instruction, I was extremely angry! Because the inn acted as an agent for the ticket, charging 30 yuan in national currency per ticket (some even extorted nearly 40 yuan). It has already been taken by them, and to report it would naturally delay the trip. On the one hand, the questioner only asks you how old you are and then tells you to leave, which gives the inn an advantage. After getting off the boat that day, I inquired of the purser of the Pacific, and learned that their company stipulated that each ticket should be sold for 20 yuan, and the city government explicitly ordered that the ticket price sold by each inn should not exceed 24 yuan. They are actually extorting at will, which is inexcusable—After the boat had set off, I inquired around and learned that the passengers staying at the Wu Shunxing Inn in Shantou were all sold tickets for 24 yuan, which really made me feel that the person in charge of that inn was commendable! While other inns are "taking advantage of the fire to rob," they are able to show conscience. Is it any wonder that their business accounts for 60% of all Shantou inns!

Although I have never stayed at the Wu Shunxing Inn, I have done a lot of voluntary publicity for them. Whenever there are travelers coming to the West to buy tickets to Vietnam, I always introduce them to Wu Shunxing to buy tickets! This means "those who have the Tao are helped by many"! You innkeepers who "take advantage of the fire to rob," do you also know the principle that "those who have lost the Tao are helped by few"?

From Shantou to Saigon, the journey takes 96 hours. At 5 p.m. on the 22nd, the boat docked at Pier No. 8 in the drizzling rain (there were a total of 12 piers). But we could not go ashore, because the customs officers had already stopped working, so everyone had to sleep on the boat for another night. In the evening, people on the shore were constantly swarming, looking to see if their relatives and friends had come from the south. Some bought bread and sausages and threw them into the boat (because people coming to inquire about their relatives and friends could not stand close to the edge of the boat under the strict surveillance of the police). Seeing others eating bread, I really felt a bit envious. Unfortunately, I had not informed my family in advance, otherwise, my younger siblings would have been among the people swarming on the shore!

### A Journey in Northern Fujian (3)

— Recorded by Wang Qixi

Yanping was formerly the name of a prefecture. It was established as a military post in the Tang Dynasty, changed to Nan Jian Prefecture, Nanpu County in the Song Dynasty, Yanping Circuit in the Yuan Dynasty, and a prefecture in the Ming Dynasty, belonging to Fujian. The Qing Dynasty followed this system. It was abolished in the Republic of China. Today, Nanping is its former seat. The area is extremely rugged and adjoins Shaowu Prefecture. It is said that "One Copper Yanping, Iron Shaowu County" means that it can be defended. Nanping is located by mountains and streams, and has natural defenses. Currently, many of the residents have built air-raid shelters on the mountain walls, which is similar to the ancient cave-dwelling people. A famous scenic spot here is Cuige, which houses a very exquisite Buddhist temple. There is a stone stream that is several hundred steps long. From a high vantage point, you can see the Jianxi River, and the scenery is very beautiful.

Day Nine: Nanping to Fuzhou

At 7:00 a.m., we boarded a small boat along the Jianxi River. Nanping is about 420 li from Fuzhou. It takes 10 hours to reach Fuzhou downstream, and more than 20 hours upstream. There are many hidden reefs in the stream, so it is not possible to travel at night. Therefore, it takes two days upstream.

It rained heavily that day, and the stream flowed like a torrent. There were many mountains on both sides, and many beaches in the stream. Looking back, we saw the folk boats sailing upstream. In deep water, they sailed slowly with their sails up. In rapids, they pulled the cables to climb. It was said that they could only travel fifty or sixty li a day. The boatmen wore straw raincoats and bamboo hats and waded through the water to row the boat. Occasionally, reefs protruded from the stream like mushrooms. They braved the rain to look for fish. The scenery was natural and picturesque.

Along the way, we passed Xiadao, Jixi, Xiexie, Hulushan, Yuexi, Taiping, Youxikou, Zhanghuban, and arrived at Sandukou. This is a small village with more than 100 households. A water police team is stationed in the village, so upstream ships all spend the night here, while downstream ships stop and then leave immediately.

We then passed Huangtian and arrived at Gukou, which is under the jurisdiction of Gutian County. Small steamers from Fuzhou go directly here. Further down is Wankou. Another 20 li is Shuikou, which reaches the town of Erzhong, with hundreds of households and shops. Most of the timber transported downstream is first parked here and then transferred to Fuzhou.

Below Shuikou are Daren, Hongzhenxi, Daruo, and Xiaoruo, and the road to Minqing from Minqingkou diverges here. From here, the beaches and currents gradually become gentler. After passing Shangxikou, Guanyinqi, Xiaqi, Yuankou, Jinzhongge, Baisha, and Zhuqi, we arrived at Houguan City. There are many olive, longan, and lychee trees on both sides. The greenness in the rain made it even more beautiful. As dusk approached, we looked at the houses on both sides and saw wisps of smoke rising from the chimneys.

At 7:00 p.m., we arrived at Hongshan Bridge, which was already lit up with thousands of lights. We had personally experienced the so-called "Night Mooring at Hong Bridge." There is a customs and water police checkpoint here. After inspection, tourists from the city all go ashore from here. The small steamer continued to sail forward, passing through Sanxian and stopping at Longtan Jiao, opposite Nantai Island. Zhao and I then hired a car back to Cangshan, south of the bridge, and our ten-day journey came to an end.

### Answering Chen Tianru in Singapore

Question: I, your humble brother, am going to Singapore to do business, but have some questions about the procedures for obtaining a permit and travel expenses, which I list below:

(1) Does the Singaporean authorities' restriction on the entry of Chinese laborers refer to un-passported steerage passengers?

(2) Ship tickets have risen to almost three hundred dollars. Does this refer to the price of a steerage ticket without a passport? If so, how much would the fare be for someone who has already obtained a passport? (Calculate the cheapest possible.)

(3) I have heard that traveling by postal ship does not cost much. Is this true?

(4) If a passport has already been obtained, which company's ship is the cheapest to travel on, approximately how much would it cost, and what class of accommodation?

(5) What are the entry procedures for passport holders when they arrive in Singapore, and what are the procedures for those without?

(6) What are the procedures for obtaining a passport, and how much does it cost?

Answer: To go to Singapore, you must obtain an exit passport in advance and have it endorsed at the Hong Kong government passport office. Each ship is limited to only twenty-five new passengers. Steerage tickets without a passport are sold by hotels, and the selling price is doubled. If, upon arrival in Singapore, one is unable to disembark, the return fare to Hong Kong has already been collected. Please follow the procedures for going to Singapore, and do not attempt it rashly.

(2, 3, 4) If you have already obtained a passport, take a second-class seat on a Great Britain Company or Duck House Company ship, which costs seven pounds. However, it is quite difficult for new passengers to book a seat because old passengers' seats must be reserved first.

(5) Passport holders have no other procedures to follow when arriving in Singapore.

(6) The cost of an exit passport is a total of twenty-one Hong Kong dollars.

### Important Information on the Interport Game: The Chinese Select Team Was Selected Yesterday. There Are Many Famous Players in the Philippine Team, and Their Strength Is Quite Strong. The Hong Kong Select Team Will Have Another Practice Match with the Army League Next Wednesday.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Recently, Hong Kong's football fans have been paying close attention to the Hong Kong-Philippines interport game. The scene of scrambling to watch the practice match between the select team and the league team on Thursday, and the congestion of Chinese and Western people rushing to Qianghua Sporting Goods Company and Moutrie Piano Company yesterday to pre-purchase tickets, all prove how deeply football has penetrated people's hearts. The writer spent a day yesterday running around to various parties to investigate, and learned that the preparations for this important match by both Hong Kong and the Philippines, as of yesterday, can be considered a complete success. Various pieces of information are recorded separately as follows:

The Chinese Team Was Selected Yesterday

According to our Chinese mentality, the selection of the Chinese team is as important as whether the players are satisfactory. Everyone is eager to know its lineup as soon as possible. It is now known that representatives from various associations held a meeting in the office of lawyer Luo Wenjin yesterday to discuss the matter. The result of the selection was satisfactory and can be called the standard Chinese team lineup in Hong Kong today. The list is as follows:

Tan Junqian (South China Chinese)

Li Tiansheng (South China South) Mai Shaohan (South China South)

Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Liang Rongzhao (South China South) Song Lingsheng (Oriental Club)

Hou Chengtuo (Oriental Club) Li Zhaorong (South China Chinese) Li Huitang (South China Club) Feng Jingxiang (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)

(Reserves) Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua) Liu Qingcai (South China South) Chen Dehui (South China Chinese) Yang Shuiyi (South China Chinese)

Many Capable Players in the Philippine Team

According to a telegram sent by the Philippines to the Hong Kong Football Association yesterday, many wealthy businessmen in the Philippines, upon hearing that Hong Kong's famous player Li Huitang had been invited out of retirement, were preparing to jointly charter a ship specifically to come to Hong Kong to watch the excitement, and requested that the Football Association reserve 150 first-class seats for them. At the same time, it was also stated that 15 players have been selected, led by volunteer coach Jia Erwo, to come to Hong Kong, and will arrive early on the 14th on the Russian Empress. The list of players is as follows:

Yao E (La Salle College) Wei Lannuohua (Lie Dilun Team)

M. Molanda (La Salle College) Xiang Nanatas (Thomas University) Ba Weigao (Lie Dilun Team)

Hua Lisi (La Salle College) Yao Jidi (La Salle College) Jia Balas (YCO Team) Nie Du (YCO Team)

Bi Zhi (YCL Team) Bao Seli (YCL Team) Ding Molan (All-Philippines Representative) Wang Xias (Lie Dilun Team) Xia Lidia (La Salle College) Li Yesi (La Salle College)

It is found that these fifteen strong men are all famous players in the Philippines. Goalkeeper Yao E is five feet ten and a half inches tall and has been selected as an All-Philippines representative for four years, with the nickname "Iron Gate." Left inside E. Molanda is a handsome young man with agile movements, and is said to be the best inside forward in the history of Philippine football. Defensive midfielder Yao Jidi is good at the third inside forward tactic. Left forward Hua Lisi is known as the "airbag." Left inside forward Bao Seli is a Frenchman, a former star player of the Shanghai French Concession team, who has been selected as an interport representative many times, is good at passing, and is very skilled. Many others are famous players who have attended the Far Eastern Games. It is said that the Philippines considers today's team to be the best representative team in recent years.

Select Team's Second Practice

Since the first trial match on Thursday, the first team failed to defeat the Hong Kong League team, which was hastily assembled due to a lack of coordination, public opinion has expressed dissatisfaction. People in the Football Association are also deeply worried that if the team does not focus on coordination, it will be difficult to win. Therefore, it was decided yesterday that the first team will have another practice match next Wednesday, and it was agreed that the army and navy would send a strong league team to compete in order to review their strength. It is said that the army and navy have agreed to send a team to the match at that time. The competition venue is still the Navy Stadium in Liuluowan, and it is scheduled to start at 5:00 pm. The entrance tickets are still only 2 hao each. The directors, in view of the congestion of the audience the day before, have decided to start opening the four gates at 4:00 pm to sell tickets.

### Special Silver Plate Muddled Account: South China South vs. Kowloon. There Are Also Important Battles in the Second and Third Divisions.

[Special Report from This Newspaper] During the great Spring Festival, there are many football events. The general public living in this "Shangri-La" would rather ignore the chaos and not hear about promotions and demotions, but they are particularly concerned about football.

Today's football is another good program. Special Silver Plate and League matches will be held, and the most upsetting scene for the football kingdom is the third match between South China South and Kowloon. This is the Silver Plate quarter-final. The two teams have gone through two bitter battles without determining the winner. Therefore, today is the third time to settle the score to determine the winner.

The Kowloon Association is full of ambition and really wants to defeat South China. In the previous big interport practice match, the team's players (Lie Zhi, Zuo Zhi, and Yachen) were originally Hong Kong League representatives, but they selfishly refused to play for the Hong Kong League and only prepared to fight South China. It seems that this selfish behavior has stained sportsmanship, but their determination to win today's match is obvious.

The team also realized that Peel, who played as center forward in the second match, performed poorly and lacked leadership. Today, Shen Dushi has been specially transferred to replace him. In addition, all the players are fully prepared and determined not to stop until they win. It is hoped that the South China players will cheer up and not let the villains succeed.

It is heard that there have also been changes in the South China lineup. Zhang Rongcai will be used as the goalkeeper. Rongcai had a very good performance during the expedition. The South China people have great confidence in him, so it is absolutely no problem to use him today to replace Bao Jiaping. However, there is a very surprising news that Zhang Manrong, who has not participated in the Xing Xing due to a foot injury for a long time, will be used as the left wing instead of Luo Douwen. If this is true, it is really unpredictable.

The reporter learned from other sources that Nan Su's plan to abandon Luo and use Zhang was based on the opinion of a committee member of the Football Department. This official was dissatisfied with Douwen's recent deteriorating performance, and also thought he was too lazy to practice. He also had the same dissatisfaction with Guo Yingqi, and may use Li Enliang to replace the left inside forward.

Many changes internally before the war are definitely not a good sign. It is hoped that the officials of the Football Department will not overdo things in this important match of life and death.

Most people predict that South China has a higher chance of winning, and the reporter also thinks so. However, I am not worried about South China's defense, but only about their weak offense, because the front line only has the "single-taste" short pass technique. If it is played well, it can definitely win, otherwise it may be difficult to achieve results. Moreover, the Kowloon Association's defenders can effectively break South China's strategy. I think that while the short passes of the Chinese front line cannot be dispensed with, it is best to also make more use of the crosses from both wings. If so, then the semi-final right should be considered South China's.

The second division Silver Plate is the semi-final. The match between West Engineering and Midu West is also a stimulating scene. Let's see who wins and gets the final right.

In the third division final, Skat has already defeated the plane once last week. If Skat wins again today, they will win the championship.

In the first division league match between the Tukat Army League and the Hong Kong Club, the victory or defeat does not affect the overall situation. It is expected that Skat can win two points and return. The lineups of South China and Kowloon are recorded as follows. (Stadium Taizui)

### YMCA Fitness Group Performs Gymnastics

Gymnastics is gradually attracting the attention of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong because its various movements are very suitable for military purposes. The YMCA Fitness Group has been established for more than ten years. Recently, the group believes that during this period of resistance against Japan, front-line soldiers often lack medicine. It is the duty of the people to hold a gymnastics performance in the group's gymnasium at 7:00 tonight to raise money to buy medicine. Tickets are 2 jiao each and have already started selling. Buyers are very enthusiastic. All the proceeds will be used to buy medicine and hand it over to the Guangdong-Hong Kong YMCA's Anti-Japanese Service Group to take to the front line for use.

### Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Game: Date to be Held After the Lunar New Year; Men's Open Tournament Registration Starts Yesterday

The 1938 Women's Basketball Tournament ended a long time ago. The champion was Mei Fang Team and the runner-up was Pui To Middle School. However, the date of the award ceremony has not been decided yet. After the re-election of the committee members of the Basketball League this year, the league has been selecting important items for various measures, so this event could not be realized in a short time. The association is now seeking to complete the procedures as soon as possible. The award ceremony can be held on a suitable date approximately after the Lunar New Year. As for the Shenbao Cup charity game, a meeting was held a few days ago to discuss its organization. However, since the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the league committee members have just been selected, there are still many association affairs to be handled. Therefore, the date of the Shenbao Cup will have to be decided at a meeting after the Lunar New Year. In the future, women's basketball teams participating in the competition will be selected by the league from the stronger teams as the main force. The competition will adopt an elimination system. In addition, registration for the men's open tournament started yesterday and will end on the 28th. As for the charity game to be held at the YMCA at 7 pm on the 13th of this month, the first game is scheduled to be between the women's team Zhi Xing and Pui To Middle School, and the second game is between the men's team Xing Huang and Oriental. All the ticket revenue will be allocated to the YMCA Agricultural College. The league has sent a letter to Zhi Xing, asking them to send a team to help with the charity event at that time. The team expressed great sympathy for this and agreed to send a team to compete at that time. However, the Pui To Middle School team is on winter vacation, and many players have gone elsewhere, making it difficult to gather them. Moreover, this matter is being carried out hastily, making it difficult to do. The league wanted to ask the Chinese Overseas team to participate, but they also declined for this reason. Therefore, the women's game at that time will be cancelled. The match between Xing Dao and Dongfang will be held as scheduled. Xing Dao does have many strong players, and their strength is exceptionally strong. The Oriental team also has many talents, such as Xu Xiang, Huang Dingfen, and Huang Jiliang, who are all basketball experts. The competition between the two teams will definitely be wonderful. The selected players from both teams are listed below:

(Oriental Association) Feng Nianhua, Xu Heng, Wu Huaxiong, Qiu Yongheng, Huang Dingfen, Lao Xiong, Luo Ji'an, Sun Zeqing, Zhong Guoneng, Chen Xianglin, Wu Guoxiang, Hu Bi, Wu Huaying, Huang Jiliang, Zheng Zaichun,

(Sing Tao Team) Li Peiyan, Li Pei Chi, Li Shijie, Dai Fucheng, Xin Yalang, Liang Guojing, Pan Yaojun, Lu Zhenxuan, Xiao Dianqing, Chen Shihong,

### Inter-School Table Tennis Tournament: Awards Ceremony Last Night

The inter-school table tennis league organized by Huaxiong Association has been completed after a month of fierce battles. The champion was Kowloon College, the runner-up was Fanglin Middle School, and the third place was Guangda Association. The association held an awards ceremony at the Confucius Society yesterday afternoon at 7:00. At the same time, the Anti-Japanese Resistance to the End Cup donated by the reporter was also awarded. The attendance that evening was extremely enthusiastic, and the awards ceremony was extremely grand. After the awards were presented, the champion team played a demonstration match against the select team. Both sides had wonderful performances. As of press time, the winner had not yet been determined. Details will be reported later.

### Football Briefs

In the Rongxing brand small football match, Huaxiong played against Datong at Shaudon Stadium yesterday afternoon at 4:00. Huaxiong won the game by a score of 1-0. There was also a final in Japan, but it was postponed due to stadium issues.

The Sing Tao basketball team held a friendly match with the South China team at the Youth Basketball Hall yesterday (10th) at 6 pm. After the start of the match, the two sides were evenly matched. Xu Heng, Luo Ji'an, Huang Dingfen, and Feng Nianhua of the Sing Tao team all made contributions, while Chen Xinqiu, Shi Zhen, Shi Zhenda, Qian Jinghui, and Xiao Jiemin of South China were not to be outdone, and made progress in separate attacks, also with repeated gains. However, the three armies of the Sing Tao team were brave and fierce, and South China finally lost due to its slightly weaker defense, giving Sing Tao an opportunity to take advantage. At the end of the game, the South China team lost to Sing Tao by a score of 48 to 49.

All matches of the Dasheng Cup volleyball tournament today and tomorrow have been postponed.

The Runzai Liuguo Qiqi football team will have a friendly match with the Wing On Company team at the Copper Gong Football Stadium tomorrow morning at 7:30, as agreed by the Wing On Company team.

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment...Triangle Love

Three Loves Has Nancy

This is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. The film features witty and lively dialogue, plenty of laughs, vivid and lively performances by the actors, plus a very interesting love quadrangle, making this film a perfect and extremely entertaining comedy.

The story tells of a country girl who goes to the big city in search of her fiancé, causing a series of farcical events. Later, under special circumstances, she becomes involved in a crazy and hilarious love affair with a writer and the publisher of the writer's works.

The film captures and develops a fragment of modern urban life, presenting it in a very brisk manner. Director Richard Thorpe has a wealth of experience in handling comedies. He not only outlines a hilarious style for the entire film, but also fills every shot with a strong sense of humor. Every inch of film shown gives the audience no chance to stop laughing.  Janet Gaynor, playing the village girl in the film, displays a very lovely personality. She vividly portrays the pure and peaceful heart of a country girl and her distrust of urban friends, making her the most outstanding character in the film. Robert Montgomery and Franchot Tone, who play the writer and publisher respectively, also give wonderful and excellent performances. This film can be said to be their first collaboration and a successful work for the three stars.

Queen's Peace, shown with...Youth Takes a Fling

Youth Takes A Fling

The film depicts a lovelorn female clerk who pursues the man of her dreams. Unfortunately, the man is a bit dull-witted and is only interested in nautical pursuits, with nothing else worthy of his attention. Naturally, women are no exception. Even the tender affections offered by the female clerk fail to win his favor. In the end, he is determined to avoid her entanglement. However, the pain of seasickness shatters his nautical dreams and cures his heartlessness.

Although the film tries its best to enrich the content with various scenes, such as fashion shows and public swimming pools, it still fails to completely conceal the emptiness of the plot. As for the actors, Andrea Leeds gives a charming and touching performance. As for Joe McMichael, who plays the young man obsessed with sailing, although his portrayal of the character is a bit exaggerated, he is the central source of humor throughout the film.

Oriental...You're A Sweetheart

You're A Sweetheart

Produced by Universal Pictures, starring two singing stars, George Murphy and Alice Faye, and several comedy stars, the old rogue Charles Winninger and the silly Andy Devine. There are plenty of laughs and the songs are also very pleasant to listen to.

Great China...Three Sisters

Sally, Irene, and Marg

Alice Faye, Joan Davis, and Marjorie Weaver, here are like three close sisters. Because of the economic depression, they have worked as manicurists and cigarette girls in dance halls. As a result, they meet the singing star Tommy – Tony Martin – and Sally – Alice Faye – falls in love with him at first sight. After several twists and turns, they acquire a dilapidated yacht. To renovate it into a floating nightclub, they need a large sum of money. Sally and Tony are both determined to sacrifice their happiness and are willing to marry two wealthy people who love them, as long as they can provide the money. The floating nightclub opens, and by a stroke of luck, the two male and female investors fall in love with each other. Everyone is happy, Sally and Tony get married immediately, and even the cleaner Jimmy Durante and Irene – Joan Davis! – are overjoyed.

The story is obviously a comedy. Jimmy Durante and Joan Davis are the central figures of the laughter. The former star Fred Allen is also coldly humorous and interesting.

New World, Continuing "Seven Fresh Roses"

Cantonese film

The previous episode of "Seven Fresh Roses" ended with Ma Loufen marrying Lin Meimei. This episode begins with Lin giving birth to a child, and the relationship between Ma and Lin deteriorates. At the same time, it also recounts that Feng Feng and Xu Manli's marriage leads to conflicts due to their poor relationship, and they go to extremes. It further narrates that Ma Loufen accidentally encounters Xu Manli, and the two fall in love. The old couple discovers this, revealing that Ma and Xu were originally engaged. As a result, both sides realize their mistakes, and Ma flees far away. Eventually, he is moved by his son and returns home, where he and Lin are as loving as before.

To cater to a lowbrow audience, the plot is far-fetched and the acting is poor. The outdated approach makes the audience dislike it.

Central...Dreaming of Wonderland

Cantonese film

"Alice in Wonderland"

Adapted from "Jing Yuan" (Tales from the Flowers in the Mirror), but it goes a step further. The entire play starts with New Ma Sze-tsang as the main character. He plays a waiter at a tea shop. One night, in a dream, he meets the God of Longevity, who takes him to various places, such as the South Heaven Gate, the North Heaven Gate, the Land of Giants, and the Land of Little People, where he sees all sorts of miracles he has never seen before. Watching this film is really like being in a dream.

From beginning to end, the entire play is exceptionally scattered, and the plot has no central point. I believe that progressive audiences will not welcome such a film. The songs sung are still a few old tunes.

Lee Theatre and Ko Shing Theatre, showing with...Hua Mulan

Cantonese film

The plot depicts a modern woman who, because she once performed in the stage play "Hua Mulan", always wants to be a modern "Hua Mulan". Sure enough, when the country is in serious trouble, she realizes her ambition. The reason is that she discovers a well-organized traitor organization, so she and her lover Kwong Shan-siu jointly try to crack this secret organization and steal documents. After countless difficulties, they finally achieve their goal. Even the clever and foolish traitors are moved by their great spirit and set off to the front lines together.

We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot utilize film techniques. The acting skills of Kwong Shan-siu and Chan Wan-sheung are mediocre.

Tai Ping...The Four Knights of the Wang Family

National film

Converted from a silent film to a sound film and colored from monochrome, the film has made a lot of progress in terms of material. The male lead is Wang Yin, but the female lead is a newcomer, Zhang Cuihong. The grandeur of the scenes is its improvement.

### Understanding Physical Training for Children

— Wang Xuezheng

Parents should bear the greatest responsibility for the strict physical training of children. Parents must not only bear the responsibility of guidance, but also lead by example. They must have a deep understanding of health and exercise, and carefully observe the impact of exercise on children's bodies and their different reactions. In the family, the training of children should never be forced. The most effective methods are guidance and leading by example. If parents can lead by example, this idea will easily penetrate the minds of their children, thus stimulating their curiosity and interest.

It is always most difficult to start any undertaking. After stimulating interest, we must also pay attention to how to help them overcome difficulties and maintain their interest. Engaging in freehand gymnastics and apparatus exercises also has the same feeling at the beginning, but after practice, one does not feel bitter and instead feels comfortable.

Implementing this kind of exercise is even more effective in families with many children, because there are opportunities for comparison and competition.

The spirit during exercise is closely related to the results of the exercise. If "spiritual strength" is lacking during exercise, it is not only useless but often harmful. Therefore, when children feel tired of this kind of exercise or temporarily lose interest, do not force them to continue. In fact, this kind of exercise is no different from children's daily hygiene habits. If they have a sufficient understanding of exercise, they will not suddenly interrupt or engage in it perfunctorily. Therefore, the spirit of children's exercise often increases with age, so the older the age, the better the spirit. Although there are exceptions, they are very few.

As mentioned earlier, the purpose of children's exercise is to make the body develop evenly and promote health. Developing muscles is secondary. Exercises that focus on developing muscles are very suitable for adults, but for children, their effectiveness is far below exercises that focus on making the body develop evenly.

If exercises that focus on developing muscles are applied to children, there may be no harm at present, and there may even be very good results. After a certain period of time, progress will suddenly slow down or stop completely, and various drawbacks will emerge in an endless stream. Various exercises that are most suitable for children may not have significant results at present, but amazing progress will be seen soon. The final results will definitely be far above any other exercise.

The scope of physical education is very broad. Exercise can only be said to be a small part of it. Nutrition, sleep, bathing, and body posture are all essential elements of physical education. If these elements are ignored, exercise will not only be useless but harmful. Habits become natural. During childhood, good habits should be developed for these elements. Otherwise, it will be difficult to correct them when they reach adulthood. Therefore, parents should not only guide children in exercise, but also pay close attention to these elements and common sense of hygiene.

The most suitable time for children's exercise is after getting up early in the morning and before bathing or washing up. Exercising early in the morning not only provides fresh air but also enables children to develop the habit of going to bed early and getting up early. You must bathe after exercise. Cold water baths are not suitable for children, but splashing the body with cold water after a warm water bath should not be regarded as a cold water bath. This method is not only harmless for children with sound bodies, but also very beneficial. There are countless methods of training children's physique, but not all of them are suitable for every child. They must also be implemented according to the individual.

Children are no different from adults. If they are not fully awake after getting up early in the morning, they should not exercise. The less clothing worn during exercise, the better, but be careful not to catch a cold because of this. If exercising indoors, the windows must be fully opened, after they are fully awake.

In the afternoon, you can do some more beneficial physical and mental games or ball games to increase interest, so that children do not feel bored or monotonous with exercise and become tired of it. But it should be noted that the exercises or games done in the afternoon should not be too strenuous. Ball games are often too strenuous for children, and it is difficult to adjust the degree of intensity. Especially for children who are not very healthy, they are even less able to cope with this kind of excessive exercise, which has already caused great damage to adults, and it is even more unthinkable for children.

Finally, there are different interpretations of the word "child" in general, but the children referred to in this article are those between the ages of seven and sixteen. (Central)

### Collective Creation and Reality

— Jie Ru

In the ever-changing reality of China's War of Resistance at this stage, what writers can grasp is often only a fragment, a side of the reality of the War of Resistance. Only when writers are organized in collective creation, jointly under a theme, each developing his grasp of a corner, a side, a fragment of the reality of the War of Resistance, and collectively incorporating each person's work, can they capture and reflect the entire rich content of the objective reality of the War of Resistance in a work. When a writer is creating alone, it is always difficult to absorb and express the essence of reality in its entirety. Usually, they can only absorb and express a small part of it, or one aspect of it. However, in collective creation, because each writer brings his cognitive and expressive abilities to bear on one side of reality, recognizing and expressing it together, it is often easier to absorb and express all the rich and multifaceted content of the essence of reality. Therefore, the literature of the War of Resistance needs to especially emphasize and focus on collective creation in order to obtain the most complete and precise creative method.

We know that the literature of the War of Resistance is the most familiar weapon for writers to participate in the national revolutionary War of Resistance, and the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance is the most scientific method for writers to use their weapons. A writer of the literature of the War of Resistance who participates in collective creation is like a person who, in addition to having a sharp blade, has also learned the purest swordsmanship. He can exert a greater effect on striking the enemy. Moreover, the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance can not only become a weapon for Chinese writers to participate in the collective struggle of the War of Resistance, but it can also become an opportunity to improve the writing skills and subjective consciousness of writers, because in the process of collective creation, it is necessary to go through many repeated collective discussions, research, criticism, and modification procedures. Writers inevitably have close corrections, criticisms, and influences on each other. Under the constant influence and training of this collective creation process, firstly, the writer's writing skills can be improved, guiding the writer to a higher level of writing skills that can correctly understand reality, skillfully handle the subject matter of reality, and maturely express reality. Secondly, the subjective understanding of the writer can be corrected, unifying many writers on a common understanding—a correct worldview, and improving his subjective consciousness. Therefore, the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance can also be regarded as an opportunity for writers to improve themselves.

The collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance is fundamentally a category of the creative method of moving realism. Its practical process is inseparably unified with the practice of concrete reality. From all the activities of collective creation, the writer must inevitably combine with the practice of reality, and cannot just shut himself up in a house and write blindly as in the traditional writing method. Therefore, the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance is not only to organize writers to engage in the practice of the War of Resistance (the practice of the War of Resistance is the most important form of practical practice at this stage). The collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance and the collectiveist national revolutionary War of Resistance have an inseparable and close relationship. Writers throwing themselves into the torrent of the collective struggle of the War of Resistance is caused by the technical organization of collective creation.

Although the collective creation method is a category of the creative method of a kind of moving realism, we certainly need to require all realistic literary workers to widely apply this practical way of creation, but the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance should not be limited to realistic literary workers. It can and should be widely developed in the practice of the War of Resistance literary creation of literary workers of various schools, so that it becomes one of the sharpest ways for them to use literary weapons, and more powerfully carry out their own combat tasks.

Collective creation is a tie that connects the literature of the War of Resistance with the War of Resistance, and a bridge that connects writers with the mass life of the War of Resistance. All literary writers standing in the torrent of the War of Resistance reality must reflect on this epoch-making historical change, express their own and their group's combat actions and real life in this War of Resistance reality, and promote the War of Resistance reality to a glorious and victorious future. They should immediately and universally practice this new type of collective creation to match their own War of Resistance practice and express the truth of the War of Resistance.

### Unrequited Love

— Lishi

Love between two sexes must be based on mutual relationships.  Mutual love can only come from mutual attraction.  And only through mutual attraction can mutual love arise.  Otherwise, no matter how desperately you pursue, you cannot escape the tragic fate of failure, and you will end up with a "single-sided love" reputation.

The taste of longing is the bitterest, and the situation of unrequited love is even more awkward.  The death of Jia Rui in "Dream of the Red Chamber" at the hands of Wang Xifeng is the most tragic ending for a friend who is in unrequited love.  Some say: Wang Xifeng's teasing of Jia Rui was too vicious.  This statement seems right but is actually wrong.  They only see Wang Xifeng's poisonous trap of love, but they ignore the fact that Jia Rui's "toad wanting to eat swan meat" idea and behavior are the factors that led to his death.

A friend in unrequited love is blinded by lust, and his reason is also obliterated. He forgets objective facts and subjective conditions completely. Even if he doesn't get a response from the other party, he still "talks to himself" and is pleased with himself.

Stories of unrequited love are not only common between the sexes; even international conspiracies now feature unrequited love events. For example, our "friendly nation" to the east had the idea of turning to Wu Peifu a year ago. Recently, it has become even more lively and seems to be a serious matter. However, according to the Associated Press: The claim that Wu Peifu is actively participating in the so-called "peace" movement is actually a single-sided affair by one party.

In fact, Wu Peifu's participation or non-participation in the so-called "peace" movement has no major impact on China's future in the war of resistance. The reason is: Wu Peifu can still be worshiped as an idol by some Chinese compatriots today because he has an aura of integrity. If he were to brazenly serve the enemy, then he would lose the conditions for being worshiped, and he would not be able to produce the effect that the neighboring "friendly nation" wants to produce. But General Wu Peifu, who prides himself on being Yue Wumu, will not give in to power, wealth, or persuasion. How could he ruin his reputation in his later years and fall into the trap of the neighboring "friendly nation", making himself a puppet on the stage? The "friendly nation" to the east knows this, but because it cannot make military progress, is isolated in the international situation, and its people are full of complaints, and it has repeatedly failed in its political conspiracies, it comes up with this inferior strategy. To its dismay, it hits a blank again, and it is still a single-sided love.

The evolution of unrequited love can lead to "flower madness". Flower madness can be divided into literary and martial types: the literary type is foolish and ignorant of human affairs; the martial type is crazy and reckless. As a result, they either become useless or die. It is said that the neighboring "friendly nation" wants to change its methods and adopt tough measures because it failed to befriend Wu Peifu. Then the friend in unrequited love will succeed in becoming a martial flower madman. How sad.

### Propaganda Techniques

— Latt

In the cause of resisting the enemy and saving the country, everyone has deeply understood the importance of propaganda work. Similarly, everyone today has felt that stepping up the disintegration of the enemy's propaganda is an extremely urgent task. However, how can propaganda work achieve positive results? Many patriotic people have already conducted rigorous explorations and correct displays of this. But sometimes we also see self-proclaimed enlightened people, when expressing their views on dismantling the enemy's propaganda, often cause regrettable phenomena of counter-effect because of their unclear understanding of the issue and their personal prejudices being too deep. This is something that should be alerted.

Now, in order to intensify the work of the party and government in the occupied areas and to carry out propaganda to the enemy soldiers to disintegrate their strength or reduce their fighting morale, this is naturally an important aspect. In fact, the purpose of our propaganda to the enemy is also this. To achieve this goal, we should use various methods, either with words or directly, to contact the enemy's front-line soldiers, inciting their determination to oppose the war, and inspiring them to understand China's position in the war of resistance, to understand the aggressive purpose of their country's government, and the future of China's victory and Japan's defeat. Because in recent times, anti-war thinking has become widespread among the enemy soldiers. If we do not grasp this point correctly, but still mark out our own kind of incorrect propaganda topics for the sake of factional prejudices), that will not only lose the task of disintegrating the enemy's propaganda, but will produce a joke that runs counter to the purpose of propaganda. This is something that cannot be ignored.

The main propaganda used by the Japanese militarists for the soldiers coming to China is still to say that they are coming to conquer uncivilized, uncultured, anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese China, and that they are coming to develop the vast resources of East Asia and permanently lay the only foundation for Japan's strong country and rich people to dominate the world. If we do not understand from this aspect, but insist on factional prejudices and create propaganda materials that do not match the anti-war psychology of the enemy soldiers, this will only confuse the enemy's views and will not meet the psychological needs of the enemy soldiers. Such a propaganda method is the most undesirable thing and should not be insisted on.

### Ruins and Gunsmoke

— Written by Shiro Ozaki, Translated by Huanping Lin

It is considered extremely difficult to complete reconnaissance missions in the guerrilla-infested riverbank areas. Although Corporal Hiwei eventually returned safely to headquarters, it seemed that quite a few brave men who went out as scouts never returned. Initially, the defense of Hukou was the responsibility of a certain unit, which had its headquarters there. To defend against guerrillas, they deployed one-third of their forces in the mountain shadows a few meters from the city. However, a crack guerrilla unit sensed that the Japanese army's headquarters was lightly defended. So, under cover of darkness, more than four hundred men waited in the mountain shadows. At dawn, they skillfully crossed the sentry lines and approached the headquarters. By the time they were discovered, it was too late. The headquarters, caught off guard by the × people, had fewer than a hundred men and had no choice but to immediately prepare weapons and prepare for battle. At this moment, the × people's footsteps, rushing down the slopes between the valleys like rapids, suddenly stopped. It was only four or five minutes, but these four minutes were of paramount importance to the Japanese army. In the dim darkness of the night, it was impossible to see the enemy's form, which was fortunate. The Japanese army, having established a favorable position, began a vigorous attack. The × people, caught off guard, were somewhat flustered when a large unit of the Japanese army rushed from the front-line mountainous area, threatening their rear. The × people, unknowingly caught in a pincer movement, ended the battle in less than an hour. But why did the enemy's advance, rushing in one breath, suddenly stop at the entrance to the narrow road leading to the headquarters? — This remained a major question. As time passed, a fact was later discovered. The first person to know of the × people's attack was a private first class who was walking the same road from the opposite direction to relieve the sentry. The man, the bald-headed man walking at the front of the enemy unit, approached stealthily and bumped into him. Needless to say, he didn't seem to imagine that such a large unit would launch a sneak attack. At the time, he thought it was a Chinese scout who had lost his way. Private First Class so-and-so immediately raised his gun and shouted loudly:

"Do you know Kanbei of Asakusa?"

Kanbei of Asakusa—such strange words, of course, could not be understood by the Chinese soldiers. If Private First Class so-and-so had fired a shot or stabbed the opponent with a bayonet, such a result would certainly not have occurred. By saying "Kanbei of Asakusa" and raising his gun, he psychologically believed that he had a magic spell to ward off the enemy. In the valley behind the city, I saw houses with red-tiled roofs.

"What are those?" I asked.

"Ah, that's the problem." Colonel Inoue replied, "It seems that someone always lives there, but we're too busy and haven't been to that place yet. We say we'll go today, then we say we'll go tomorrow, but we've decided that there probably aren't any big shots there, so we've just left it at that, and haven't gone."

I imagined in various ways the figures of the people who were left behind to live in that valley. At that moment, suddenly, from the darkness of the inner hall of a civilian house where the pillars and walls were all destroyed, something that was peeling and shaking moved. Peering out timidly, a shadow gradually approached along the ancient wall. It was a woman in her sixties—probably the only old woman left in this city. She fixed her eyes on us, with a gaze that was half pleading and half contemptuous. Colonel Inoue spoke to her, and a self-deprecating and ingratiating smile appeared on her oily, glistening face.

"I heard that this is the old woman's home." (To be continued)

### Encirclement

— Jin Ge

Thousands of small boats were moored in the pond, densely packed, looking like fish scales from a distance. Hundreds of large fishing boats were also moored outside the harbor, their sails resembling a beautiful and lush bamboo forest.

The sun climbed out of the sea, stirring up surging waves that crashed into the pond, causing the thousands of fishing boats to sway non-stop, alarming the young, strong fishermen. They jumped up in one motion, rubbed their eyes, reeled in the anchor ropes, and sang cheerfully: "...The foundation left by our ancestors, we rely on it to survive the summer and the winter. Yellow croaker is better than gold; ribbonfish, like jade rings... We're not afraid of many bandits, we're not afraid of their fierceness if we're of one mind, we are brave fishermen!..." They hummed like that, and they began their work.

The large fishing boats that went ahead formed a long line, truly like a long string of ribbonfish. The majestic singing filled the entire sea. In the sea, it brought back empty echoes from afar.

After leaving the harbor, the boats dispersed in all directions, each going to net fish, casting their large fishing nets, quietly.

The harbor surface was very calm, as if it had fallen asleep.

In a corner of the sea, a small warship with a poultice flag suddenly appeared, heading straight for the large fishing boats.

"Ah; bandits are coming? Are we waiting to die?... No! No! Strike first, Little San, blow the horn, let them come to help: Hai Gen, you guys prepare the cannons, quick! Quick!" the boat boss called out excitedly. He himself also ran to the cannon side, helping to load gunpowder.

"Dada... dada..." the horn sounded.

"Boom!" The boss personally fired the first cannon, the shell flying over and hitting the stern of the Japanese devil's ship, the bow slightly shaking forward.

"Boom!" The bandit ship also returned fire, the shell flying over, not far from a fishing boat, stirring up waves several feet high.

"Rat-a-tat-tat..." The bandit ship fired a machine gun.

"Guys, fire the guns, quickly, quickly, what are you dawdling for, damn it, fire the guns, fire the guns, quick, quick," the boss stretched his throat and shouted loudly, snatching a clay cannon from the hands of a crew member, aiming and firing.

"Boom... boom..." The bandit's cannons and the clay cannons.

"Rat... rat-a-tat-tat..." Machine gun.

"Bang—crack-bang—... crack-bang...!" Clay guns.

Soon, many other large fishing boats sailed in following the sound of the horn. Discovering the danger here, they immediately surrounded the bandit ship from the east and the west, like many starving fish competing for a large piece of bread.

"Boom! Boom!..." Shells flew towards the bandit ship like raindrops, it was under fierce attack and began to tilt slightly.

"Ah!" A bullet. Hit the boss's raised arm, bright red blood oozing from his sleeve, he couldn't help but shout.

"What's wrong? Boss? You? You?" the crew gathered around.

"Are you crazy? Never mind me? Fire the cannon? Fire the gun? Fire quickly? Quick? Quick..." the boss's eyes bulged, clenching his teeth.

"Boom—boom boom—... Bang—crack-bang—crack—..."

The bandit ship couldn't stand it anymore, the stern sank into the water first, then the middle..., and finally the bow, thick white smoke rising on the water surface, gradually dissipating, and finally, the poultice flag on the bandit ship's mast also disappeared into the water.

"Boom... boom boom boom—" The last few funeral salutes were fired at the water where the bandit ship sank.

The boss raised his blood-soaked arm, and everyone sang together excitedly... "...We're not afraid of many bandits, we're not afraid of their fierceness if we're of one mind—we are brave fishermen!..."

The faces of the wounded were reflected with the glory of honor, having long forgotten the pain. They finally annihilated the invading bandits and avenged the great hatred of the sea and sky!
