### The Second Anniversary of the War of Resistance and the Embarrassment of the Japanese

Our all-out war of resistance against Japan has yesterday marked two full years. We have used heroic sacrifices to shatter the Japanese bandits' delusion of "conquering China in a year and a half, and then settling the post-war situation in a year or half a year." Looking back on these two full years, the rise and fall of the Japanese bandits' operations in China, and their political and diplomatic changes, the process of the Japanese bandits from flourishing to stagnation, and then to decline, are all clearly visible. From the perspective of the general trend, whether military, political, economic, or social, they have all reached a state of embarrassment.

The period of the Japanese bandits' military gains was the coastal warfare period after the occupation of Nanjing. However, since entering the Battle of Xuzhou, the progress has been quite slow. After we abandoned Guangdong-Hankou Railway, they almost completely stagnated, and are increasingly declining. From last year, the month of to the present, more than eight months have passed. The Japanese bandits have failed to occupy more strongholds as scheduled. Even in Changsha, which suffered an unexpected fire, the Japanese bandits were unable to take advantage of the situation to occupy it, with only Nanchang as the city they occupied. Afterwards, although the Japanese army also [illegible characters] on the northern and southern battlefields, they did not achieve much success, only wasting manpower and money in vain.

In the political aspect, the Japanese bandits' situation has also become increasingly chaotic with the decline of the military. Since the "July 7th Incident" led to our all-out war of resistance, the Japanese bandits have focused on strengthening their internal affairs institutions, hence the "Cabinet Council System," "Planning Board," "Ministry of Health and Welfare," "Planning Secret Council," and even the establishment of the "General Headquarters." The Konoe Cabinet also underwent two strengthened reorganizations, especially the major reorganization in May of last year, which supplemented considerable strength in both essence and form. The Japanese government could only be considered to have truly become a wartime cabinet at this time. However, due to the stagnation of the war of aggression against China, which was expected by all parties, Prime Minister Konoe, who possessed the most subjective conditions, finally had to decisively submit his resignation, and was succeeded by the "least popular" Hiranuma Cabinet. After the Hiranuma Cabinet came to power, the situation was completely different from that of the previous Konoe Cabinet. Not only were no specific policies announced, but it was also caught between the veteran senior officials faction and the young military officers faction, making it difficult to please both sides. Its political efficiency can be said to be completely equal to zero. Recently, although they have tried to cope with the internal and external crises with some kind of "molting strategy," the result still cannot avoid the political contradictions inherent in Japanese capitalism [illegible characters]'s dominance.

In diplomacy, its embarrassing situation is even more obvious. The conflict of duality has evolved to the point where it seems similar to the previous example, and the government finally tends to run behind the [illegible characters] of military power... This is the peculiarity of the inverted relationship in the development process of Japanese capitalism... But it can be asserted that it will inevitably encounter internal and external obstacles and re-ignite the contradiction and crisis of the military. The negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo may not go smoothly, and the attempt to please the United States, as claimed by the Japanese side today, may not be effective. It goes without saying that the threat to the Soviet Union will be met with "double retaliation." Although Hitler's warnings to Japan are extremely earnest... due to the result of observing Japan's war power—but Japan's incompetent politicians and warlords are unable to shoulder this heavy responsibility and break their own deadlock. Although the naval aspect is flattered by the award, the harassment of the South China coast is just harassment; the army aspect is quite depressed because of Hitler's criticism that "it will take seventeen or eighteen years to restore vitality," and wants to superficially cheer up with reckless actions against the Soviet Union, but the result is just hitting a wall and making a fool of itself.

We commemorate the second anniversary of the War of Resistance. We must also deeply face the embarrassment of the Japanese bandits in military, political, economic, and social aspects.

### Strategic and Tactical Issues in the Sino-Japanese War

— Report by a Senior Member of the Military Commission

(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) A senior member of the Central Military Commission recently inspected various war zones. Before Spring, in a certain location, he delivered this report to combat commanders after a certain area [illegible characters]. This is a brief record. The committee member has personally reviewed it. After a partial deletion, it is specially published to the people of our country:

Introduction - War is a continuation of policy, so strategy is subordinate to policy. The policies of the two countries, [illegible character] to the highest stage of development, will lead to war. Therefore, the relationship between policy and strategy is even closer. The success or failure of strategy will inevitably affect policy.

(1) The Japanese Side

[1] The Historical Stages of the Japanese Aggression Policy

Annexing China and monopolizing East Asia is a consistent national policy of Japanese aggression against China - especially the only national policy advocated by Japanese warlords. This has developed from the strategy of Emperor Meiji of Japan to the present.

1.  After the Sino-Japanese War, the first stage was to implement the divide-and-rule policy of using Chinese to control Chinese.

2.  After the September 18th Incident, the second stage was to implement the policy of gradual encroachment without fighting to win.

3.  Starting with the July 7th Incident, the third stage was to implement the policy of swallowing China whole by winning in one battle.

Although the above policies have different stages, the basic policy of state affairs is consistent. Therefore, in coordination with these policies, there are also different stages in various aspects. A. On the Chinese side

In the first stage, economic aggression was the main focus - a movement mainly based on boycotting Japanese goods arose in China.

In the second stage, political aggression was the main focus; in China, a national salvation movement arose, mainly based on political struggle that did not recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo and the puppet regimes of Eastern Hebei and Chahar in order to resist Japan.

The third stage is military aggression - the War of Resistance broke out in China.

B. Internally

In the first stage, capital outflow was encouraged - economic development and the formation of conglomerates resulted, arousing the jealousy of warlords.

In the second stage, secret service agencies became active - military personnel became tyrannical and murdered ministers, arousing resistance from conglomerates?

In the third stage, the navy, army, and air force took joint action - warlord autocracy and conglomerate vassals aroused popular dissatisfaction. C. Foreign policy

In the first stage, there was competition with various countries - resulting in the Nine-Power Treaty restricting Japanese development.

In the second stage, the interests of various countries in China were rejected - causing dissatisfaction among various countries and gradually leading to isolation.

In the third stage, an attempt was made to monopolize East Asia - arousing opposition from various countries. (2) Japanese Military Policy for the Aggression of China

The first stage was the period of developing national strength - the purpose was to be on par with the great powers.

The second stage was the period of strengthening national strength - the purpose was to surpass any country in the East.

The third stage was the period of using national strength - the purpose was to quickly conquer China, use China's national strength to monopolize East Asia, and prepare for the Pacific War, resulting in the consumption of national strength. (3) The Strategic Policy of the Japanese Aggression War

Based on its national policy and general policy, the Japanese [illegible character] strategic policy of aggression is undoubtedly to fight a quick battle to achieve a quick victory. There are three conditions for realizing this strategy:

1.  Reduce Main Force - The main reliance is on frontal firepower to inflict casualties in order to weaken our main force. Nothing more than relying on outflanking our main force in an attempt to annihilate it.

2.  Occupy Territory - Seize large cities and implement economic blockade.

3.  Lose Our Side's Will to Fight - Create puppet regimes to isolate our country, provoke internal strife, and spread an atmosphere of peace.

However, the first phase of operations proved that these policies failed. Why? Because: 1. Basically, the Japanese lacked self-awareness and misjudged us.

2.  Although the Japanese army is strong, it is small and lacks sufficient capital. The Japanese are also reluctant to use it. Although we are weak but large, with a large population, we are the only ones who can sacrifice, preserve, and continue to fight against the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to lose our fighting ability has failed. Our land is large, and the Japanese cannot occupy much. They only occupy points and lines. Moreover, we are an agricultural country, and even if we lose many cities, we can still be self-sufficient, and external routes are still open. It is difficult to blockade the economy, and the Japanese themselves are also eager to trade.

3.  The Japanese are too barbaric, degenerated, and cruel, with everyone seeking profit. Therefore, the puppets and traitors they create are useless. Our unity and solidarity are becoming stronger, and national consciousness is increasing. The atmosphere of peace is difficult to succeed. The international community is not isolated, and foreign aid is increasing day by day.

Since the Japanese policy of fighting a quick battle to achieve a quick victory has failed, do they have the determination to fight a long-term war? Even if they talk about it on paper and write about it, it is still not enough, and they will not do so, because:

1.  They do not want to consume too much in China.

2.  They are eager to digest what they have gained in China.

3.  They are anxious to prepare for a world war, attempting to end the war against China during or shortly after the start of this war.

What the Japanese continue to do is the policy of quick peace and quick resolution. This policy is a continuation of the policy of fighting a quick battle to achieve a quick victory, but it has also been severely refuted by our supreme leader and cannot be realized. Therefore, the Japanese have to consider changing their policy.

(4) The New Policy of Japanese Aggression Against China - That is, a comprehensive expansion. This policy is a supplement to and development of the third stage of aggression, the policy of winning China in one battle. The policy of the third stage has already been overturned and has become a policy of protracted war. The Japanese still do not dare to comprehensively invade and have been trying it out here for the past four or five months.

1.  In the military aspect, sweeping is more important than offense.

2.  In the economic aspect, development is more important than blockade.

3.  In the political aspect, both utilization and provocation are used.

4.  In the spiritual aspect, appeasement is more important than brutality.

In short, focusing on managing the occupied [illegible character] area, thinking of using China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to fight China.

(5) The International Policy of the Japanese - Differentiation is more important than confrontation.

1.  Using both hard and soft tactics against Britain.

2.  Courting [illegible character] America.

3.  Easing relations with the Soviet Union.

4.  Threatening France.

5.  Utilizing and coordinating with Germany and Italy.

In a word, they want to isolate us with the international situation, and everything in the East must go through them.

6.  The New Offensives of the Japanese - This demonstrates the variability, opportunism, and contradictions of their policies.

The Japanese do not implement the above policies in an unchangeable way because: 1. Their goal is still to win China in one battle.

7.  The core is comprehensive aggression.

8.  The international situation is changing rapidly, stimulating their opportunism and coordinated action.

9.  There are three kinds of opinions within the country.

10. Stop attacking and manage the occupied [illegible character] area:

11. Continue to attack directly to the southwest and northwest.

12. Emphasize the management of the occupied [illegible character] area while not abandoning the mutually argumentative offensive. As a result, a conciliatory policy was adopted, hence the trial campaign in Nanchang. This includes the meanings of military occupation, political attack, economic tightening, and traffic disruption. It is estimated that in the future, the Japanese will attack in the following areas:

13. Four directions in the Yangtze River Basin,

14. The northwest, 3. The southwest,

Estimate the basis of the dynamics of Japanese political affairs:

1.  Under favorable conditions - I have weaknesses exposed, and [Japanese]'s donation is not large,

2.  Under necessary conditions - [Japanese] believe that it is necessary to comprehensively invade:

3.  Austria, Germany, and Italy coordinate and support actions,

4.  The most important thing is the change and increase in the [Japanese]'s troops.

In short, the Japanese take a step and stop, which exposes the basic weakness of the [Japanese] – insufficient troops, which forms the opportunism and contradictions of its policies because its policies are still being tested, but its basic policies - swallowing China and monopolizing East Asia, and the policy of winning China in one battle in the stage of aggression, are still a consistent vein and have not changed, but have been deepened. However, this is the expansion of comprehensive aggression, with politics above military. Therefore, is there a possibility of a new stage transformation of aggression in this, please talk about the future problem

(7) The Future of Japanese Aggression Policy,

To talk about the future, we must first talk about the Japanese's attempt and the possibility of its realization. The Japanese's attempt:

1.  A quick battle and a quick decision on the military - failed,

2.  A quick peace and a quick decision on the expansion - we refused, and were not fooled;

3.  So, a comprehensive invasion was launched - to try to win the upper hand, to strive for advantages, to oppress us, and to defeat us (this includes fierce offensives before and after the outbreak of the war) - this general policy is still to win China in one battle, that is, this stage is still military-oriented, although it has entered a stage where politics is more important than military affairs, but it is still attempting to end the war and the battle situation. However, if we do not let him, and strive for a period that is favorable to us, that is, the stalemate stage, to prepare for the counter-offensive, then the Japanese's attempt will not be realized. Today is the beginning of this struggle. Generally speaking, the Japanese attempt is not possible to be fully realized at present, the condition is that the war cannot be finished and cannot be reconciled, so the battle situation will not end. However, because this is a complicated situation, a complicated war, it is possible to have two aspects, both possibilities have not been fully achieved and entered the second possibility, that is, a situation of no war and no peace, so the conditions for realizing this situation may exist,

4.  The front line has choked our important traffic routes, and there is a considerable area in the [Japanese] area that can be ruled?

5.  The puppet government merges, and even changes its form and uses the name of the National Government to confront us, and the puppet army has a considerable development,

6.  Economically control all of us, and foreign trade, and all countries must go through his hands, and attract a part of our economic traitors to merge with him,

7.  Internationally, use the opportunity that countries have no time to ask about the East Asian war,

8.  Spiritually, restore ancient times and insult the Chinese culture, and even use the Three People's Principles to deceive.

If this situation is realized, it will become the fourth stage of Japan's aggression against China, and its policy will be to stop offensive without war and no peace on the front, and focus on operating the [Japanese] region in an attempt to force us to be safe, trap us in the interior, and wait for the outbreak of the world war, which can fight against me again, so this is not a completely favorable stalemate situation for me, but a situation created by [Japanese], when the possibility of realizing this situation is not very great, but the main thing is still determined by the war between the [Japanese] and me, so currently, in terms of the Japanese, the Japanese are launching a comprehensive invasion but still cannot achieve the expected goal, he will turn to the stage of the no-war-no-peace aggression policy, and we not only cannot allow the arrival of the no-war-no-peace situation, but also do not allow any success in the development of the comprehensive invasion, and strive for the arrival of a stalemate situation that is favorable to me in preparation for the counter-offensive, and bury the third stage of the Japanese invasion of China.

Therefore, at present, it is in a transitional stage and the new policy of the [Japanese] contains two futures, or it will be defeated by us, or it will turn into a new situation.

In short, on the overall route of the Japanese policy strategy, the basic policy of the Japanese annexing China and monopolizing East Asia is adventurous, just like Germany and Italy, and because their country is small, with few people, few products, not a long history, too many enemies, and few helpers, etc., it may be an even more adventurous national policy, but the Japanese take advantage of the opportunity, take advantage of my weaknesses, take advantage of the international situation. Taking advantage of his military advantage, he often changes his policy and strategy, so he will not fail all at once, but he is also unwilling to fail, and is even more striving for a change that is beneficial to him

But no matter what, his policy and strategy are subject to variability, that is, uncertainty, contradiction, and speculation, which is a factor that leads to the failure of his adventurous national policy. As long as we adhere to the national policy of resisting Japan to the end, we will be able to make any attempt by the [Japanese] fail.

(1) Our Side

(1) Three Stages of the Chinese National Liberation Movement.

I. Before the September 18th Incident, the national movement was tied to the civil rights movement - overthrowing the Qing Dynasty [illegible character] and warlords to overthrow the imperialists, and was carried out in many ways to the outside world:

II. After the September 18th Incident - the anti-Japanese political movement - the unification and resistance movement moved towards convergence - to the outside world it was focused, but tortuous and complicated, resulting in peaceful unification and unity to resist aggression;

III. The July 7th Incident - the limit of this national policy of unifying resistance to the end;

9.  The Japanese war of aggression has failed,

10. The revival of the Chinese nation,

To achieve the goal of resisting the war and building the country and establishing a new China of the Three People's Principles, the specific content of this slogan is as instructed by Chairman Chiang:

We must affirm that the Republic of China of the Three People's Principles, which will be established after the victory of the War of Resistance, must be a new country that has surpassed the world, is a truly progressive country that is truly owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people, and is used to contribute to the world's human well-being, 28, 4, 17 broadcast

(2) Our Policy and Strategy for the War of Resistance

Under the national policy of resisting the war to the end, our policies are

1.  Protracted war of resistance time

2.  Comprehensive war of resistance - a war of the whole people, space, and people;

3.  Strive for initiative - regenerate through eyesight, active diplomacy; the strategic policy under this policy,

4.  Protracted war - defeat the Japanese quick war and quick resolution!

5.  War of attrition - defeat the Japanese in their quest for advantage and the upper hand.

However, the protracted war is not to drag on, but to fight on, and the war of attrition is not to fight each other randomly, but to eliminate the [Japanese]. (3) The Policy and Strategic Focus of Our Three-Stage War of Resistance,

I. Launch a comprehensive war - mobilize, fully follow the people, mobilize the rear and the front, mobilize the entire line, use all strength, unify will and unify strength.

II. Focus on [illegible character] - politics is more important than military affairs, spirit is more important than matter, guerrilla [illegible character] is more important than regular [illegible character], propaganda is more important than combat, the people are more important than soldiers, and thrift is more important than production.

This is a struggle, a long-term struggle, and a difficult struggle, aimed at the new policy of the Japanese "[Now is the time of a thousand pieces of gold for a moment before the War of Resistance, we are not allowed to re-make empty talks and fantasies, and we are not allowed to spend a minute of time and energy" (Chairman Chiang Si, 17, Broadcast) "Why does the Chairman say this, because,"... The closer we get to victory, the more difficult, more difficult, and more dangerous our environment will inevitably be - (Ibid.) Therefore, we must carry out fierce resistance against the [Japanese] with concrete struggles, and not allow his attempt to be realized.

(4) Launch Struggles in All Aspects - Launch a Comprehensive War and Focus on [illegible character]:

I. Mobilization in the spiritual aspect - this is basic, Chairman said, "If we want to repel the [Japanese] in this war of resistance and succeed in building the country, the other half is to develop the spiritual power of every member of our nation" (Ibid.) How to carry out spiritual mobilization? Chairman said, "We should aim at the current strong [Japanese], face the national difficulties squarely, reflect on our responsibilities most importantly, and earnestly review all our shortcomings [illegible character] weaknesses. On the one hand, we will quickly and practically transform ourselves, set an example, and at the same time, lift up our compatriots across the country and help our compatriots who have not yet woken up to rise up together to correct the life of being drunk and dreaming, self-defeating, develop an enterprising and progressive spirit, eliminate the habit of perfunctory survival and obeying in public and disobeying in private, break the attempt of selfishness, surrender, and submission, correct the deviations from error, mislead the country, and mislead the ideological thoughts, tense our emotions, unify our actions, so that our Chinese spleen can be enriched and concentrated, and truly achieve a total spiritual mobilization of unity and play this "supreme and strongest spiritual power to complete our single inheritance and inheritance"

According to the specific work of needle spirit total mobilization should be:

I. Oppose the attempt of compromise and surrender,

II. Oppose the habit and life of perfunctory peace,

III. Oppose erroneous thinking that violates the interests of the War of Resistance and national construction,

IV. Oppose empty talk that only talks but does not do and empty fantasies that deviate from the reality of the War of Resistance,

V. Implement total spiritual mobilization and the oath of national publicity.

VI. Promote national culture and excellent traditions.

VII. Arouse the comprehensive and most wide-ranging awareness of the masses and the masses with lower levels of knowledge who have not yet awakened,

VIII. Strengthen unity - aim at the strong [Japanese], face the national crisis squarely, reflect on the responsibilities, and review the mistakes,

II. Military party:

I. Frontal combat - mainly military warfare, and advancing the frontal decisive battle, giving the [Japanese] step-by-step casualties and [Japanese] counter-war and counter-attack,

II. Rear preparation - to create a positional warfare capability to establish a national defense force to make it mechanized and modernized,

Invasion after [illegible character] - mainly guerrilla warfare,

A. Establish a guerrilla base in the strategic outer money,

B. The structure of the unit is based on political work to create everyone as a combatant and also a political worker,

C. The use of tactical activities - never withdraw from entanglement warfare, and small wins are big wins, (to be continued)

### Chairman Chiang's Radio Address Encourages Comrades in the War Zone to Help Themselves and Save Themselves, Intensify the Battle Behind the Enemy Lines, and Continue Their Efforts

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 7th] Chairman Chiang gave a radio address to the people in the war zone on the occasion of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. The original text is as follows:

Compatriots in the war zone, today is the second anniversary of our War of Resistance and National Construction, and also the first day of the third year of the War of Resistance. How should we inherit the glorious struggle of the past two years, exert all the strength of the War of Resistance, and achieve our goal of recovering lost territories, expelling the Japanese bandits, and building a new China of the Three People's Principles? This is the common task of the people across the country, especially our comrades in the war zone, who bear a major appointment. Our comrades in the war [illegible character] are suffering from such heavy persecution, oppression, deception, and humiliation by the Japanese bandits, and are living such a painful life of darkness and despair. I miss and grieve for you all the time. I am always concerned about all the comrades, and I always take the task of relieving your pain as my own. However, all comrades must also help themselves and save themselves, and must be more heroic and active in uniting together and fighting alongside the military and civilians across the country.

Compatriots in the war zone, the past facts of your perseverance, courage, and resistance against the Japanese are all reported to me in detail here, which really makes me infinitely excited. Your loyalty and bravery are really the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance. Although the Japanese bandits are all kinds of fierce, you always swear to die without regret, maintain the greatest personality of our Chinese nation, and promote the highest morality of our Chinese nation. Thanks to your proportionate struggle, the effectiveness of our army's comprehensive war is strengthening day by day, and the base of the guerrilla area is expanding and consolidating day by day. Our strategy of "transforming the enemy's rear into the front line" can be fully developed. In the past year, all our actions and deployments in the enemy's rear have achieved close coordination with the comprehensive War of Resistance. Today, our vast war zone has in fact become a situation of heavy encirclement and attack from all sides against the enemy, making the Japanese unable to attend to one thing and lose sight of another, not only making no progress, but also suffering the greatest casualties. These are all the results of the arduous struggle of our comrades in the war zone. If we can redouble our efforts and continue to do so more bravely in the future, we will be able to give the enemy a fatal blow, making the large and small areas occupied by the enemy become large and small bombs, exploding one after another in the enemy's belly, and finally bringing the Japanese to their death.

The result of the two years of the War of Resistance is indeed that "the more the Japanese fight, the weaker they become, and the more our country fights, the stronger it becomes." The Japanese, whether in military, political, financial, economic, transportation, or transportation, none of them do not show a state of distress and exhaustion. It is precisely because of this that they themselves feel that they are at the end of their rope and cannot help but make a final [illegible characters]. The current plan is to use political offensives and spiritual aggression, and the second is to carry out their so-called construction and development in military and economic terms, vainly trying to complete their so-called "using war to support war" poison plan. These two major poison plans are also the last tools for the Japanese to struggle before death. As long as we break these two major poison plans, it will be the death date of [Japanese][illegible characters], and it will be our final victory.

First, let me talk about the conspiracy of the Japanese political offensive. I have explained it in detail in my rebuttal to the Konoe East Asia New Order statement at the end of last year, but there are still shameless traitors who are insane and respond to [Japanese] [illegible characters], selling out the country and seeking surrender. These traitors have already been spurned and sanctioned by the entire nation. However, his conspiracies have not stopped, and the Japanese so-called appeasement policy and deceptive propaganda are also being intensified to our war zone at this time. We must especially reveal the situation of traitors and Japanese colluding. To be honest, since the Japanese published the New Order of East Asia, he has very clearly stated that there is no more true harmony with our country. We also know very clearly that the Japanese are poisonous. He will never realize the dream of the "New Order of East Asia" unless he destroys our entire country and nation and enslaves our generations. The Japanese are now thinking wildly and want to destroy our country at all times. He is afraid that it is too late. How can he have the mind to talk about peace with our China? (To be continued)

### Telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Comfort Families of Fallen Soldiers in the War of Resistance

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram on the 7th to comfort the families of fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance. The full text is as follows: To the Commanders-in-Chief of all war zones, the Commanders-in-Chief of all war zones, the Provincial and Municipal Governments of all provinces and cities, the Party Headquarters of all provinces and cities, and to be forwarded to the families of fallen soldiers throughout the country: Today marks the second anniversary of the War of Resistance. With the utmost sincerity and respect, Zhongzheng extends his deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen soldiers who have died in battle throughout the country. Over the past two years, thanks to the great benevolence and courage of our fallen soldiers who sacrificed their lives for righteousness, the enemy's illusion of a "quick victory" has been completely shattered. The spirit of the Chinese nation, which cannot be humiliated or destroyed, has been illuminated to the world and filled the heavens and the earth by the sacrifices of our fallen soldiers. The foundation for final victory has been laid by the lives of our fallen soldiers. Our fallen soldiers shed their blood on the battlefield and sacrificed themselves to preserve the five thousand years of heritage left by our ancestors and to protect the survival of our four hundred and fifty million compatriots. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy of "I die so that future generations may live" is truly worthy of our fallen soldiers. Although the bodies of the fallen soldiers are gone, their heroic and magnificent spirit has become the sacred national soul, deeply rooted in the hearts of our people for generations to come, and will forever receive the reward of fragrant reputation and respect, never to be erased or disappear. Furthermore, the great achievements of our fallen soldiers are due to the daily teachings of their parents, who encouraged them to be loyal and filial, or the wholehearted support of their wives, who urged them to uphold righteousness. With innate qualities and established foundations, they were able to become more courageous in the face of adversity and treat death as a return home. Therefore, the loyalty and heroism of our soldiers not only adds glory to the national history, but also honors their ancestors and elevates their families. This is why Zhongzheng and the people of the entire nation express their infinite respect to all families.

I still remember that during the first anniversary of the War of Resistance, Zhongzheng paid special tribute to the families of fallen soldiers, saying that Zhongzheng and the people of the entire nation must inherit and strive to complete the unfinished cause of those soldiers. He also said that the parents, wives, and children of those soldiers are also the common relatives of Zhongzheng and the people of the entire nation, and all should fulfill their responsibilities to care for and support them. Now that the War of Resistance has passed another year, the number of families of fallen soldiers has increased even more than last year. Zhongzheng is increasingly aware of the depth of his own responsibilities. Regarding the promotion of the former's achievements, thanks to the perseverance and efforts of the people and soldiers of our country, the light of final victory is getting closer and closer. We pledge to work together to achieve this goal and comfort the glorious spirits of all the fallen soldiers. Regarding the care of the latter's relatives, Zhongzheng is even more mindful at all times, and he has instructed the relevant relief agencies to handle the matter with diligence and care, striving for comprehensiveness, in order to alleviate the pain of displacement and suffering of the families.

However, this War of Resistance covers a vast area, and the origins of the fallen soldiers span all provinces of the country. It is inevitable that there will be omissions in comprehensive investigations. In addition, some families may be trapped in occupied areas, and rescue and relief are difficult due to geographical barriers. Thinking of this, I feel the suffering of some orphans and widows, the pain of hunger and cold, surges in my heart, adding to my infinite sorrow. Therefore, in addition to the existing relief regulations and procedures, Zhongzheng has specifically established several measures to supplement them:

(1) Commanders of all units must report the facts, origins, and family circumstances of their fallen officers and soldiers to the authorities at any time and promptly apply for relief. They must not suppress the information. If the records on file do not provide sufficient information about their families, they should immediately send a document to the government of their original place of residence to investigate and report in detail. They must not arbitrarily delay the process due to omissions, in order to avoid omissions.

(2) Local governments at all levels, when approving and issuing relief funds to the families of fallen soldiers in their respective areas, must issue the funds at any time and place, regardless of financial difficulties. They must not delay or postpone for any reason. Otherwise, once discovered or reported by the families, they will be severely punished without leniency. The families are also allowed to report this fact to the Relief Committee of this Association at any time to apply for prompt issuance.

(3) If any family knows that their children have died in battle but has not yet received the relief certificate, they can directly report to the Relief Committee of this Association, which will forward the information to the original unit commanders to investigate and apply for relief.

(4) If any family does not understand the written language or the procedures for applying for relief and receiving funds, the local Baojia chiefs, gentry, or educators, if they know about it, should automatically assist them in handling the matter, or, in accordance with the preferential treatment measures for the families of soldiers serving in the war, enthusiastic and capable people in various localities should find ways to maintain their livelihoods. This should be regarded as a supplementary item to the secret telegram sent by this Chairman to the gentry and educators of the country on January 19th, and should be implemented earnestly. If local governments and Baojia personnel deliberately withhold the relief funds due to the families, once verified, regardless of the amount, they will be severely punished.

(5) If any family is in an occupied area and temporarily cannot be rescued and relieved due to administrative limitations, the local Baojia chiefs and fellow villagers should remember that the martyrs died to protect the country and defend the people, and should especially care for the loyal descendants, or jointly collect materials and resources to provide for their livelihood, or take turns to help them with farming, so that they can avoid freezing and starvation. After driving out the tyranny and recovering the lost territories in the future, in addition to the government investigating and providing relief to the original families in accordance with regulations, the families are also allowed to report the assistance provided by the Baojia chiefs and neighbors, and the government will reward them separately to commend their righteousness.

(6) Whenever personnel from central Party, government, and military agencies are sent to the front and rear for inspections and reviews, they should immediately visit and inquire about the families of fallen soldiers in each area to determine whether they have received the relief funds in accordance with regulations and whether the local government and people can effectively comply with the preferential treatment laws and regulations. The actual situation should be reported in detail to the Committee and the central agencies that originally sent them for verification. This should also be included as one of the criteria for evaluating the diligence, merits, and demerits of the dispatched personnel.

The above six points, although concise, are effective measures for implementing the relief regulations and are also the unavoidable responsibilities of Zhongzheng, all levels of military and government officials, and the people of the entire nation. I sincerely hope that you will comply and assist earnestly to make up for Zhongzheng's shortcomings in failing the families of our martyrs, so that all relatives of fallen soldiers can have a dignified old age, that children can grow up properly, that the orphans and widows can be cared for, and that education will not be lacking, comforting the spirits in heaven and further inspiring the morale of the living. I believe that the beloved families of our fallen soldiers will also be able to encourage each other in hardship, work harder, inspire future generations, and continue to serve the country to pass on their glorious legacy for eternity. I express my sincerity and hope for your consideration. Signed by Chiang Zhongzheng, Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, Secret, Chongqing.

### British House of Commons Passes Increase in Export Credit Loans, Totaling £16 Million

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] The British government's Foreign Trade Guarantee Bill was passed on its first reading in the House of Commons yesterday. According to the provisions of the bill, the Ministry of Commerce's foreign trade guarantee funds will increase from £10 million to £16 million to assist countries in the anti-aggression front in purchasing arms and other military supplies to strengthen their national defense.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] According to political sources, the British government intends to allocate a special fund of £100 million for loans to countries in the anti-aggression front. Yesterday, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and Greece all requested assistance from Britain. The British Cabinet has approved the request.

### Minister Weng Discusses Japanese Economic Ambitions, Attempting to Swallow Chinese Resources in One Bite, We Have Formulated Countermeasures

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Chinese Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, in commemoration of July 7th, issued a declaration exposing Japan's economic policies and ambitions to establish a "New Order" in China, stating that Japan's ultimate goal is to establish a so-called "Japan-Manchukuo-China Economic Bloc" to deal with any third country. However, the Chinese National Government has decided to break the Japanese attempt. The Japanese have now established the North China Colonization Company and the Central China Development Company. The former has a capital of 350 million Japanese yen, half of which is invested by the Japanese government, and the other half by Japanese merchants. The plan is to control: (1) transportation, (2) telephone and telegraph, (3) mining, (4) salt production, and (5) other industries that can develop the economy of North China. According to company officials, the company only assists and leads Chinese and Japanese entrepreneurs, and does not implement anything itself. The work of the Central China Company is also the same, with a capital of 100 million Japanese yen. The North China Colonization Company has now established the following companies:

(1) North China Petroleum Company, with a capital of 300,000 yuan, half of which is borne by the North China Colonization Company, and the other half by the South Manchuria Railway Mining Company, with the remainder supplemented by the North China Provisional Government.

(2) Manchuria Telephone and Telegraph Company.

(3) Xingzhong Mining Company.

The Japanese pay special attention to the company in Yu-zhong. Currently, the company is able to control the major mining areas. The Central China Development Company, although not well-capitalized, has the right to issue public bonds of 500 million Japanese yen. The company currently has the following five major organizations: (1) Central China Iron Ore Company, (2) Central China Power Company, (3) Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, (4) Central China Telephone and Telegraph Company, (5) Shanghai Real Estate Company.

From these points, it can be seen that the Japanese goal is to control the entire economy of China.

Minister Weng also pointed out Japan's lack of ore, saying that when the Hanyang Iron Works was established in 1890, Japan issued a large number of public bonds, hoping to control China's iron ore mines. Now, the Central China Iron Ore Company is constantly transporting iron to Japan. According to Japanese plans, the annual transport volume will be 5 million tons, and within the year, all the iron ore along the Changting coast will be completely removed. Regarding the textile industry, Minister Weng said that this is another part of Japan's economic aggression plan. Currently, the Japanese will control Chinese and Japanese yarn factories and weaving factories in the occupied areas, produce large quantities of cotton products, transport them to foreign countries, and dump them at low prices in an effort to seize the foreign merchant market.

### Shanghai and Guangzhou Observed July 7th with Tension

Martial Law in Shanghai Concessions, Wang's Puppet Government Delayed

[Reuters, Shanghai, 7th] Today marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The Shanghai Concession authorities have taken strict measures to prevent accidents. From dawn, British troops, U.S. Navy landing forces, Russian merchant groups, commercial volunteer corps, and Shanghai volunteer armored vehicle teams were dispatched to assist the regular and special police in patrolling the streets. It is reported that the Japanese side hoped that Wang Jingwei could form a new puppet government on this day with surprising methods, but it is heard that Wang has requested a slight delay because he does not want to take this risk rashly before obtaining support from figures other than exiled politicians. Observers report that Han Jingwei intends to form another party called the "Anti-Communist Kuomintang," and will later organize an "Anti-Communist Kuomintang Government."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Luo Bosheng, Director of the Political Affairs Group of the Shanghai Public Concession, recently led translators to various Chinese newspapers to inform the publishers that from today until the 8th, any news articles about the "July 7th" anniversary and the words "July 7th" are not allowed to be published. Violators will be severely punished. Some Chinese newspapers plan to suspend publication on the 8th.

Guangdong in a State of Panic, Patrols Present a Tragic Scene

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] Rumors are rife here that a large number of Chinese plainclothes soldiers have infiltrated the city, preparing to launch an uprising on the "July 7th" anniversary. Therefore, the Japanese side officially announced martial law at 10:00 a.m. Japanese troops constantly patrolled Sha-area. Those who were preparing to hold a "July 7th Anniversary Parade" found it difficult to move.

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] The patrols here were held under strict security, and no incidents occurred. At 11:30 a.m., Sha-area began to return to normal. There were less than five or ten people who passed through Sha-area in the parade.

### North China Raw Material Market Monopolized by Japan, Expanding Export Exchange Settlement Through Puppet Organizations, Rejecting European and American Trade

[Reuters, Beijing, 7th] The North China Provisional Government announced yesterday that the "Regulations for the Management of Foreign Exchange," which were previously proposed on March 1st, were originally limited to thirteen specific commodities, but henceforth, except for the following seven unimportant commodities, the restrictions apply to all exported goods. This measure will be implemented from July 17th. The seven unrestricted commodities are personal belongings, ship supplies, perishable goods, books, pictures, newspapers, and packaging supplies. The general public believes that this move is a major blow to North China's foreign trade. From July 17th, export merchants must provide foreign exchange transfer certificates when exporting goods, except for the above-mentioned seven types. The proceeds from the goods will be calculated at 14 pence per yuan. As for goods transported to Japan and "Manchukuo," they will be exchanged at par. At the same time, a list of import goods with priority rights will be announced. Export merchants can use this to contact import merchants for foreign exchange. Most of the goods on the priority import list are goods that can be supplied by Japan and goods for "developing" the economy and industry of North China.

### Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Last night, Japanese planes made a second night raid on Chongqing. The public hurriedly took their belongings and went to the suburbs and air-raid shelters to take cover. The emergency alarm was issued at 12:30 a.m., but the number of Japanese planes could not be ascertained. At 1:45 a.m., Japanese planes dropped bombs and incendiary bombs over the city, and the losses of people and property have not yet been tallied. The alarm was not lifted until 2:40 a.m.

### Our Large Army Gathers in Southern Shanxi, Fierce Battles in the Shahe River, Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties, Chenghai Abandoned, Chaoan Briefly Entered

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] Although it is certain that the Japanese army has withdrawn a part of its troops and warships from Guangzhou, foreigners believe that this withdrawal cannot be said to be a sign that the Japanese army intends to withdraw from Guangzhou. However, it is true that a large number of Chinese troops have gathered in Guangzhou. Although Japanese sources say that the Chinese troops concentrated in Zengcheng, Sihui, Pijiang, Conghua, and Dongguan are all under the command of Li Han-hun, and 100,000 troops under the command of Bai Pu are prepared to defend the area of Jianxi and Guidong, planning a counter-offensive, Zhang Fakui, the leader of the Tie-leader, has distributed a large army in the upper reaches of the Beijiang River. In addition, Wu Qihui has concentrated two other large armies in the Dongjiang area. Regarding the widely spread news that Chinese guerrillas are active, it is a fact that there are many armed Chinese in Guangzhou, and the Japanese are unable to resist them. They are called "bandits" or "rioters," but when the opportunity arises, these Chinese will all become guerrillas. According to the opinions expressed by foreigners after traveling in various parts of Guangdong, the most important fact in Guangdong is that the Japanese-occupied areas have become a world of bandits, while the areas under the jurisdiction of the Chinese army are peaceful. In addition, there is another fact that is enough to cause rumors of the Japanese army withdrawing from Guangzhou, that is, the small shops opened by the Japanese in Guangzhou have closed down one after another. The Japanese spokesman explained that this was entirely due to the government's policy of treating all businesses equally. As a result, small shops generally feel that it is difficult to maintain themselves under such circumstances, and therefore they have closed down one after another.

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] According to unconfirmed news obtained here, fierce battles have occurred several times in the Conghua area in recent days. It is also said that on the evening of the 5th of this month, Chinese plainclothes soldiers engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the Shahe area near Guangzhou. Although the Japanese spokesman denied that there was a fierce battle, he admitted that Chinese guerrillas were indeed very active. According to a reliable eyewitness, he told the Reuters reporter that he witnessed at least a dozen transport vehicles fully loaded with Japanese soldiers killed in battle coming from the west, preparing for cremation.

[Civilian Revolution News Agency, Wengyuan, 7th] After the arrival of more and more Chinese troops in Chaoshan, we have launched a counter-offensive against the Japanese. On the 2nd, we used a part of our forces to attack the Chaoan military station, and another part of our forces charged into the city from the four gates of Chaoan, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. The fighting lasted until 3:00 a.m. on the 3rd, killing many Japanese. Many warehouses and military supplies were burned by our army. Our army withdrew to its original defense after the goal was achieved. It is also reported that 4500 Japanese troops in Chaoshan launched a four-pronged attack on Chenghai from Guanshan, Tuhao, Fa-hao, and Fa-lu on the morning of the 29th of last month. Our team bravely fought back, and fierce fighting continued until noon. The Japanese reinforcements arrived, and our troops were outnumbered and the terrain was unfavorable. After obtaining a certain price, they retreated to a certain place.

[Civilian Revolution News Agency, Zhaoqing, 7th] After Hecheng was recovered by our army, the Japanese in Jiangmen became increasingly panicked, and most of them retreated to North Street. According to news, on the afternoon of the 3rd, more than 500 Japanese troops in Jiangmen retreated to the North Street area. Currently, there are only more than 200 Japanese troops in Jiangmen, with five tanks, stationed at the Xinhe-Jiang-Fo two highway stations.

### Chiang Kai-shek's Letter to the Military and Civilians

— (Continued from yesterday's edition)

× Rapid Peace and Rapid Conclusion Failed; Buying Out Traitors and Deceiving the Public

In the past two years of the war, everything, including military affairs and diplomacy, has been under our initiative. The × people have almost stepped into the trap and failure we anticipated. The more the × people struggled, the more mistakes they made; the more we persevered, the more determined we became. One of the most important things was the statement made by the × Prime Minister on December 22nd last year. Since the Sino-Japanese war began a year ago, the × side has been seeking a quick end to the war every day. However, the method it used was not to thoroughly realize its past mistakes and fundamentally abandon its aggression. The reason why it wanted a rapid peace and a rapid conclusion was because it could not achieve a quick victory. Furthermore, it wanted to use the most insidious and despicable means, even more vicious and cruel than the methods used against Korea, to fundamentally swallow us up completely. I thoroughly refuted his cunning schemes at the time. Our military and civilians must have thoroughly understood that the failure of his attempts and the exposure of his conspiracy were the greatest blow to × country and a major turning point for × recently in its desperate situation. However, he still has not given up on this delusion. The slogan of the "New Order in East Asia" that he has already proclaimed cannot be withdrawn. The so-called "East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere" and the Asian League, etc., are things that he knows will fail but is unwilling to abandon. The × people's ambitions have not died, and the aftershocks have not subsided. This movement will inevitably continue to unfold. We are determined to resist the war, which is not worth mentioning. What is most heartbreaking is that there are shameless people who respond to this statement of destroying China and openly engage in acts of betraying the party, the country, and selling out the nation. Although they have been severely condemned by the public and sanctioned by the law, it must still be said that this is the greatest stain on our war of resistance, and it is the greatest regret that so many martyrs cannot rest in peace underground. To be honest, these traitors' so-called peace movement is actually a movement to destroy the country. If the × people and traitors succeed in their poisonous schemes, then the day the "New Order in East Asia" is established will be the day our Chinese nation is reduced and enslaved. The day the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere succeeds will be the day China is effectively merged into Japan. After the × country announced the "New Order in East Asia", it is very clear that it has no intention of making peace with us except to completely destroy China and turn us into its slaves. Today, we have only victory over the × people, only the complete achievement of our war aims; apart from this, there is absolutely no other path to take. Otherwise, surrendering to × is "the peace of the traitors". In other words, it is the peace of slaves, the peace of destruction. Unless one intends to sell out the entire China like a traitor, no one will recognize this fact again. Originally, at the end of last year, when the second phase of our war of resistance began, the internal and external situations obviously improved, and the goal of victory was in sight. However, these traitors wanted to undermine the war of resistance at this critical juncture, trying to deceive the public with shameless words, shaking the belief of our compatriots in the war of resistance, harming our soldiers who were fighting bloody battles, and obliterating the achievements of our national military and civilians who sacrificed their lives. We have searched through history and cannot find a precedent for such madness, lack of integrity, and cruelty.

In fact, the × people's declaration of this "New Order in East Asia" is not only a poisonous hand against China, but also tantamount to declaring war on the world. How could the × people ever have thought of a thread of peace? These traitors do not think that the × people have already dug their own graves; these traitors disregard the country and willingly die for the × people. Isn't it madness to the extreme to want to drag the more glorious nation to be buried with them? Our national military and civilians, after such training, can be firm and united, recognize the stakes, and distinguish right from wrong without any hesitation. This is indeed the greatest success of our China this year. From now on, there is no danger in the future. As long as we are determined to strive towards the established goal of victory, it can be said that we have already walked more than ninety miles of a hundred-mile journey. Final victory is approaching. We must use the price of blood and flesh to achieve the purpose of resisting the war, to wash away the shame that the traitors have added to our nation! Those who do not know the great righteousness that "traitors and patriots cannot coexist" cannot be considered Chinese! Those who do not aspire to avenge their humiliation and strive for the independence and survival of the country cannot be considered descendants of the Yellow Emperor!

Strive for the welfare of future generations and do not leave a shame on the nation for all time

All the soldiers and compatriots must know that the most important thing for us today is to be determined to never give up and to maintain confidence in the victory of the war. Any war in the world will deepen its difficulties as time goes on, so the more it comes to the end, the more it is necessary to exert stronger and greater perseverance and courage. I do not deny the pain and efforts of our entire military and civilians, but our determination to endure pain and sacrifice must be strengthened with time, and our degree of struggle must be intensified with the continuation of the war. Our pain and sacrifice have the highest value and the most sacred meaning. We want to preserve the glory for our ancestors and create happiness for future generations. If our generation of compatriots can spare no sacrifice, fear no pain, and always be unyielding and persevere to the end, then enduring the pain now will surely be exchanged for the welfare of future generations. Otherwise, if we are afraid of difficulty and seek ease, and vainly hope to be spared, then one day of our comfort will bring eternal shame to the nation and plunge our future generations into the endless pain of slaves and beasts. The × people have used all kinds of tricks, but we are not afraid of difficulties, nor are we afraid of the invaders. Everyone must know that difficulties and dangers cannot be avoided, but only broken through by effort; invaders and foreign troubles cannot be quelled by surrender, but only overcome by struggle. This is the inherent spirit of our Chinese nation, which is not afraid of the strong, and it is also the integrity that our revolutionary soldiers should have in overcoming the enemy and achieving results. As the future of our war of resistance comes into contact with the light day by day, our responsibilities are also becoming heavier. We must be more persevering, more cautious, more diligent, and more earnestly reflect; see if the efforts we have made on the battlefield of resistance meet the requirements? Has it reached the schedule? At the beginning of the third year of the war, we must be determined to stand on our own positions and make the most intense and solid efforts. I do not need to list the specific items one by one. The most important are the following two points:

Mental Mobilization to Enhance Self-Confidence, Military Training to Strive to Kill the Enemy

First, in terms of spirit, we must implement the principle of overall mental mobilization and fully manifest it in our work. We must consolidate unity, strengthen national unity, promote the spirit of hating the enemy, and enhance self-confidence. We must have the awareness that "I am not afraid of ×, × must be afraid of me," and we must have the determination that "there is me without ×, there is × without me." We must be diligent and hardworking, and sweep away the bad habits of following the old ways and perfunctorily dealing with things. Whether in the front or in the rear, we must quickly and surely intensify our work and complete our tasks. Furthermore, we must know that the basic qualification of a modern citizen is to uphold the absolute nature of national power and laws. Especially in times of war, all national laws are as strict as military orders. No one can be outside the scope of the law. The national military and civilians should share the great righteousness of the sacredness of national policy and the sacredness of national law, and consistently follow them from beginning to end, worthy of being the descendants of our ancestors Yan and Huang, and not disgracing the people of the Chinese nation. Second, in the military aspect, the most important thing is to strive for rectification, enrich the organization, strengthen combat power, and improve combat spirit. The soldiers in the front must be more loyal, brave, and enterprising, kill the enemy and achieve results, use the lessons of blood, plan carefully, strive hard, crush the enemy's attempts to advance, and promote the overall collapse of the × army. The guerrillas in the battlefield must cooperate closely with each other and with the local compatriots, drag down the enemy, and attack the enemy. The people in the rear must enthusiastically respond to the call, receive training and enlist in the army. Young people with aspirations should receive military training, join the army, and practically serve the country. All military and political organs must earnestly complete their assigned tasks and enhance the honorable personality of combat effectiveness. All the people must develop the spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness, loyalty, bravery, and martial arts.

Accelerate the Pace and Strive for Victory, The Coming Year is a Critical Juncture

All the soldiers and compatriots of the country! Today, the sacrifices of our national military and civilians, their perseverance, and their long-lasting battles have broken the × people's plans and laid the foundation for our victory. At this time when the situation is improving, it is also the most urgent juncture of the war. We must exert our greatest efforts, accelerate the pace of progress, and cross to the other side of victory. The × people have dug their own graves, and we must use our strength to push the × people into the grave. The × people are making their last struggles, and we must make the most violent and final blows against them. The × people must share weal and woe, live and die together, do their best, and exhaust their efforts, fight for the life of the nation, and strive for the survival of the nation. We must know that it is better to die than to live a stolen life. The victory of everyone is the permanent destruction of the country. The peace of slavery is the eternal sinking of the nation. It is better to die killing the enemy than to live in submission. The victory of the war is the welfare of future generations for all time. The honor and disgrace of being a master or a slave, the success or failure of rising or falling, depends on our efforts in the coming year. I hope that all the soldiers and compatriots will use their unforgettable feelings, their persevering endurance, their fiery spirit, and their overwhelming power to fight to the death, to complete the great cause of defending the country, expelling the brutal × people, and restoring our homeland, to wash away the deepening shame and hatred, and to welcome the light of final victory.

### British Public Opinion Praises China's War Achievements, Japanese Military Attempts Have Been Crushed, Calls for Increased Aid to China and Sanctions Against Japan

[Reuters, London, 7th] Today marks the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War. Several writers have discussed the lessons of this conflict for the world and made an assessment. Prime Minister Hiranuma's speech is considered to be Japan's acknowledgment that it cannot achieve its original goals and its intention to end the war early has been crushed. This is a warning to ports with aggressive ideas everywhere. The "Daily Express" commented on the Sino-Japanese War, saying that Japan has completed a great undertaking, which is to promote the complete unification of China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. What price has Japan paid, and what benefits has it gained? The "News Chronicle" stated that if the European political situation were not as it is now, we should have given the Chinese government active assistance. The current resolute resistance of China has prevented the Japanese army from advancing. This is the best time for us to provide financial assistance to China, so that China can achieve victory as soon as possible. The beneficiary is not only China, but also the entire civilized world.

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Tonight, Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Wellington Koo hosted a banquet for French President Lebrun and his wife at the embassy. Chinese music and classical Chinese short plays were performed. Guests also included British Ambassador to France Sir Eric Phipps and three French cabinet members.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Chinese people here gathered at the Chinese Embassy this afternoon to participate in a memorial service for the fallen soldiers. In addition, Ambassador Kuo Tai-chi visited the British Foreign Office last night to discuss the situation in Tianjin with Foreign Secretary Halifax. Reuters has learned that the British Foreign Secretary clearly stated to Ambassador Kuo that the British government has no intention of compromising on any broad issues that may be raised in the Tokyo talks.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Wellington Koo today to discuss the Tianjin incident and the general situation in the Far East.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] Ambassador Koo and his wife hosted a banquet for French President Lebrun and his wife last night.

### Japanese × Prime Minister Hiranuma Announces Principles of Destroying China, Intensifies Efforts to Support Puppet Regime, Excludes Powers' Influence in China

[Every Communication Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma gave a speech to reporters yesterday, expounding Japan's foreign policy. Regarding future British-Japanese negotiations, Hiranuma said that the negotiation issues are limited to the Tianjin incident, but a complete solution is impossible unless Japan's "New Order" established in the Far East is recognized as the principle of negotiation. The Japanese Prime Minister also said that if there is any attempt to contain or undermine this "New Order", Japan cannot cooperate with it. Japan will respect the rights and interests of foreigners in Chinese concessions, but the concessions must strictly maintain neutrality and not interfere in Japanese military operations. Hiranuma admitted that most Japanese people demanded a declaration of war on China in order to enjoy belligerent rights, but said that the time was not yet ripe. Regarding the "rumors" that the United States' attitude towards Japan has improved, Hiranuma said that regardless of whether this news is true or not, Japan has no urgent need to send a special envoy to the United States to improve relations. Regarding Japan's policy towards China, the Japanese Prime Minister said that the puppet government now has considerable "consolidated power", and the establishment of a "new central government" is not far away. Once this "new government" is established, Japan and "Manchukuo" will officially recognize it. This new regime will be based on the principle of autonomy of each province, but what has not been decided now is the issue of the rule of this "federal government", which will be modeled on the United States or Germany, while the Japanese army will still be stationed in Inner Mongolia, North China, and other places that Japan believes are threatened by "communists". As for saying that after the establishment of the "new government", the Japanese army will withdraw completely, it is impossible. The Japanese army's occupation of various places will be semi-permanent. Hiranuma also said that the declaration on Japan's policy towards China issued by the former Prime Minister on November 3 last year will still be effective, and the incidents on the Mongolian-Manchurian border are only cooperation between the Japanese and "Manchukuo" armies. The "Soviet troops" that crossed the border will be driven out of "Manchuria". The Japanese government has decided to do its best to seek a peaceful resolution to disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as the problems of Japanese fishing grounds on the Soviet coast and the mining rights for coal and oil on Sakhalin Island. Finally, the Japanese Prime Minister said that the Japanese government will do its best to protect Japan's rights and interests in the Chinese region.

### Japanese × Minister of the Army Issues Absurd Document, Tearfully Persuading Japanese People to Support the Policy of Invading China

[Seahong News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese Minister of the Army Itagaki warned Britain yesterday not to adopt a "pro-Chiang and anti-Japanese" policy again. Itagaki issued a letter to the Japanese people today, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, stating that the Japanese people have not been able to end the "China Incident". Even after the collapse of the "Chiang Regime", Japan must do its best to eliminate the anti-Japanese efforts of third countries to save China, which has become a semi-colony. Japan should stop the "pro-Chiang" actions of various countries. The entire Japan has made a great determination to achieve the goal of "East Asia is for East Asians". Regarding the negotiations between British and Japanese representatives to be held in Tokyo soon, observers believe that this declaration by Japanese Minister Itagaki is more important than those issued by other Japanese dignitaries.

### Japanese × Lack of Raw Materials, People Ordered to Stop Cooking

[Seahong News Agency, Shanghai, 7th] On the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, there were no unexpected incidents in Shanghai until the afternoon. The Japanese military authorities had taken extra precautions to prevent the recurrence of the tragedy of two Japanese people being killed last year on this day. All the concessions were almost completely separated by wooden fences and barbed wire. Armored vehicles patrolled the streets, and the entire special police volunteer army and the British, American, and Italian troops were fully armed. The Japanese people here remained silent about the anniversary. The Japanese people gathered at the Japanese cemetery in Shanghai to observe a minute of silence for the fallen soldiers. Various Japanese groups held meetings in restaurants and implemented the "one bowl of rice movement". Japanese students collected scrap metal from various families and sent it back to Japan as raw materials for military industry.

[Seahong News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Regarding "overall mental mobilization", the Japanese government issued an order yesterday that all Japanese people must share the joys and sorrows of the soldiers on the front line on this day, stop cooking for one day, implement the "one bowl of rice movement", and not hold banquets. On the same day, the Ministry of the Army sent several military aircraft to perform flying and landing demonstrations to express the "spirit of the front line".

### × Newspaper Advocates Military Alliance with Germany and Italy

[Seahong News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] The "Kokumin Shimbun," the organ of the Japanese National Party, published an article today calling on the government to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy, criticizing Britain's Far East policy, and saying that since Germany and Italy are on the front line against Britain, Japan should complete a military alliance with the Rome-Berlin Axis countries and should not delay.

### Japanese × Intensifies Anti-British Sentiment

(Reuters, Tokyo, July 7) Today, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War was commemorated throughout Japan and in Japanese-occupied areas of China. The ceremonies included "a minute of silence for the war dead." The Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and the Prefectural Assembly held a joint meeting and resolved to submit a request to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to change its policy of assisting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

### British-French-Soviet Agreement, Soviet Union Requests to Join Poland and Turkey

[Central News Agency, London, 5th] Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet government submitted a reply to the suggestions of Britain and France on the 3rd of this month. Its content is tantamount to advocating that the scope of this mutual assistance agreement be expanded to include Poland and Turkey and become a mutual assistance agreement. The Soviet Union also agreed to the protection of the independence of the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, but only on the condition that Poland and Turkey give the same guarantees to the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet government also advocated that when a country guaranteed by one of the countries concerned is threatened by aggression, the mutual assistance measures should be automatically implemented. Sources here familiar with the news claim that the British government will give a reply to the Soviet Union within 48 hours.

### Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces Announce Details of Border Conflict, Majestic Power Greatly Shaken, Japanese Puppets Suffer Miserable Defeat, Falsify Victory Reports, Remove Kawamoto from Office

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] According to TASS, Moscow, 6th, according to the official report issued by the headquarters of the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces, on the 2nd, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army, with a large number of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, equipped with about 100 tanks, concentrated in the Nomonhan area southeast of Lake Bel, and under the cover of bombers and fighter planes, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army again invaded the Mongolian border.

At dawn on the 3rd, they suddenly attacked northward from the area outside Nomonhan, penetrated the shores of Yanghu Lake, and attacked the positions of the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces on the east bank of the Halha River, attempting to break through and enter the west bank of the river. The participants in this offensive included the entire 23rd Infantry Division, equipped with an infantry regiment, the 3rd and 4th Tank Regiments, and six cavalry regiments. However, the Mongolian "Soviet" Allied Forces have repelled all the Japanese "Manchukuo" troops who suddenly attacked in the area outside Nomonhan, and caused heavy losses to the × people. To the northwest of that area, the Japanese infantry, equipped with no less than 60 tanks, were also repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian cavalry. The west bank of Halahin Bay was forcibly occupied by a small piece of land. As a result of the vigorous counterattack by the Soviet-Mongolian troops and air force, the Japanese troops who had infiltrated the west bank of the Halha River were repelled. On the evening of the 5th, they suffered great losses in the area on the east bank of the Halha River. In the battles of these days, the Soviet-Mongolian artillery destroyed 50 Japanese tanks and damaged eight artillery pieces. About 800 Japanese "Manchukuo" soldiers died, while the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces only lost 100 people and injured 200 people, and damaged 15 tanks and armored vehicles. At the same time, from the 2nd to the 5th, both sides also used a large air force to participate in air battles. In all the air battles that occurred before and after, the Soviet air force always maintained its victory. In the air battles that occurred from the 2nd to the 5th, 45 Japanese planes were shot down, while the Mongolian-Soviet planes lost only 9. According to reports, Kawamoto, the director of the Kwantung Army News Bureau, was dismissed for publishing fictitious and exaggerated news, saying that the Japanese air force had achieved imaginary victories, and was replaced by Colonel Wafuji.

### British House of Commons Discusses London Fire Cases

[Seahong News Agency, London, 7th] The frequent fires in London recently will again be the topic of discussion in the House of Commons on Thursday.

He also said that under these circumstances, he has not yet been able to publish information about the cause of the fires.

### Opening Trial of British Submarine Case

[Reuters London, June 6th] Mr. Shaw of the LAS Company testified in court yesterday regarding the "Thetis" submarine accident, stating that of the four crew members who initially entered the escape chamber, three perished, while one survived. He stated that the reason the escape door could not be opened was due to a crew member panicking during the escape. Once seawater filled the chamber, the crew members donned their breathing apparatus, but the water had already risen above their heads. At this point, it would have been difficult for anyone to see anything and they would have felt submerged. Attempting to open the escape chamber door under such conditions would certainly have failed, as it was necessary to wait until the pressure inside and outside the chamber equalized. The deaths of the three crew members were likely due to their inability to wait for a sufficient amount of time. Anno, the crew member who was rescued, had no difficulty escaping. He even saw other crew members following him into the escape chamber, but why they could not surface remains unclear. Mr. Shaw also stated that it was inappropriate for four people to enter the escape chamber together, as there was insufficient space for the crew members to move freely. Subsequently, the Director of Naval Ordnance testified, stating that test dives for submarines pose no danger whatsoever to the crew, as such dives are the safest part of a submarine's life, being intentionally and unhurriedly performed. Finally, a technician from the LAS Company completed his testimony, and the court announced an adjournment.

### Summary of Two Years of Resistance

— [Special Report from This Newspaper] Gao Shan (Continued from page 8 yesterday)

Fourthly, the development of revolutionary movements within Japan and its colonies. Despite the cruel oppression by the Japanese, these revolutionary movements have already shown significant signs. Within Japan, individuals arrested and killed in the name of being communists or endangering the empire, especially recently those arrested for disrupting economic controls, obstructing social order, and opposing general mobilization laws, are reported daily even in Japanese newspapers, and their numbers are increasing. As for Korea, Taiwan, and the four northeastern provinces, anti-Japanese united fronts have been established one after another. Soldiers from Taiwan, Korea, and the puppet state of Manchukuo have defected on various fronts. The successive occurrence of "riot" incidents in Japan and its colonies fully indicates that the anti-aggression war movement of the people within Japan and the colonial masses will develop actively!

Fifthly, furthermore, what is particularly serious is the development of labor power in Japan, and the intensifying contradictions and conflicts with European and American powers! Last May, Xiamen was forcibly occupied, Guangzhou in October, and Hainan Island this February. In March this year, the Xisha Islands were seized, in May landings were made at Gulangyu, and in June, Tianjin was blockaded, followed by the seizure of Shantou and the blockade of Fuzhou and Wenzhou, resulting in an undeclared war with Britain! Consequently, the Anglo-French Singapore Conference began, and the anti-aggression front began to extend to the Far East, and Japan's international position became increasingly isolated.

(4) Experiences and Lessons from the Past Two Years

The two years of the great war of resistance have left us with glorious historical achievements, and more importantly, with valuable experiences and lessons. How to accept, study, and apply these experiences and lessons, overcome current difficulties, and strive for final victory is our most fundamental task at present.

The two years of heroic resistance have first and foremost proved that those who suffer from Japanophobia, those who rely solely on weapons, and those pro-Japanese traitors who propagate all forms of the theory that resistance is bound to fail are baseless. Our heroic resistance over the past two years has not only prevented our demise but has also enabled us to become stronger with each battle, with increasing morale and progress in all aspects, while Japan, on the contrary, is heading towards collapse. These facts are the best examples. At the same time, it also proves that those superficial, hasty advocates of quick victory are also unfounded; the Japanese aggressors still possess residual power, landing in Shantou and Dinghai, and are eyeing Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Nanning, Guilin, Weisha, Hanzhong, Xi'an, and other places, which are clear examples. The experience of the past two years tells us that this war of resistance against Japan is being waged with the disorganized, unprepared forces of a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country against the fully prepared offensive forces of a modern capitalist-imperialist state that has been preparing for sixty years. Therefore, achieving final victory requires a protracted war of resistance and a gradual transition from passive response to active resistance, from resistance by the army and government to a sustained resistance by the entire nation.

The two years of heroic resistance further indicate that to ultimately defeat Japanese imperialism, it is first necessary to earnestly and effectively consolidate the unity of the entire nation and to mobilize all the dynamic and material forces of the entire nation. It is precisely because since the "July 7th" incident, all parties, classes, Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and minority ethnic groups in our country have formed an unprecedented unity, enabling us to overcome all provocations, alienations, compromises, and betrayals by Japanese agents and traitors, to resolutely support the long-term war of resistance, and to achieve victories "beyond Japanese expectations" for as long as two years. It is also precisely because the proposition and policy of mobilizing all the dynamic and material forces of the entire nation to assist the war of resistance have been enthusiastically supported and faithfully implemented throughout the country, enabling us to respond to the war with unprepared and disorganized forces in haste, and to replenish our preparations and organize ourselves in battle, thus allowing us to persist for two years, and our strength has grown stronger. Every compatriot who truly loves the motherland and the independence and freedom of the nation should deeply recognize that consolidating the anti-Japanese national united front with the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation as its foundation is the lifeline of the Chinese nation for defending its territorial sovereignty and striving for survival, independence, freedom, and happiness. Safeguarding this lifeline is the central task of every Chinese who does not want to be a slave!

The two years of heroic resistance further indicate that reforming political organs at all levels, improving national mobilization methods, earnestly promoting democratic politics, and genuinely improving the people's livelihood are the fundamental conditions for achieving the unity of politics, the army, and the people, and are also the fundamental conditions for consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese national united front that unites the entire nation and mobilizing all the dynamic and material forces of the entire nation. They are also the fundamental conditions for finally defeating the Japanese aggressors and establishing a Three Principles of the People republic. We have already begun to implement these conditions in the past two years, which is why we have been able to overcome all difficulties and persist for two years; however, because our implementation is not yet thorough, complete, or in-depth, we have suffered unnecessary and cruel sacrifices and setbacks in the past two years in terms of military affairs and political affairs.

The two years of heroic resistance also indicate that without establishing a modern, mechanized national defense force, without cultivating thousands upon thousands of new cadres who support the war of resistance and national policies, and without striving for broader and more effective foreign aid on the basis of self-reliance, we will not be able to prepare for and conduct the future general counter-offensive and decisive battle, we will not be able to eliminate and drive out the Japanese aggressors from China, and we will not be able to build an independent, free, equal, and happy Three Principles of the People republic. At the same time, it also indicates that although we strive to achieve all of the above, if we do not make efforts to increase the difficulties and crises of the Japanese aggressors, if we do not quickly and extensively develop guerrilla warfare zones and anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines to engage the enemy in military, political, economic, and cultural life-and-death struggles, especially if we do not resolutely and thoroughly strike at Japanese agents, spies, traitors, and Wang Jingwei, and strike at their anti-communist and peace talks propaganda, and strike at their actions that divide and split our united front and shake our national perseverance, and strike at their conspiracy activities to consolidate the puppet regime and use Chinese manpower and resources to conquer China, then our resistance and the Chinese nation's struggle for liberation will still suffer great setbacks.

Over One Hundred Members of the "Japanese Patriotic League" Demonstrated in Front of the British Embassy District, with Posters in the Area Bearing the Phrase "British People Withdraw from the Asian Continent"

[Reuters London, July 7th] In view of the upcoming Tokyo conference between Britain and Japan, the Japanese military authorities in North China have recently restricted the export of goods from North China. According to general observations, this move is another attempt by the Japanese to pressure the British side. Reuters has learned that although Britain is willing to participate in the Tokyo conference with the most sincere attitude, Japan still intends to apply consular certification to all British imports from China. In addition, the Japanese have other methods of pressure. If reasonable means cannot be implemented, then they will consider this kind of economic pressure.

### Poland Decides on Danzig Measures; Has Notified British and French Authorities; German Conspiracy Still Underway

[Reuters Warsaw, July 7th] It is understood that after consultations between the Polish government and Britain and France, a decision has been made regarding the steps to be taken to deal with military preparations in Danzig. Although newspapers reported yesterday that Poland would not send a note to Danzig, the Polish Commissioner in Danzig may urge the Danzig authorities to pay attention to the provisions regarding the self-defense of the free city. The Polish government currently has no intention of arguing with the Danzig authorities regarding the nature of the military preparations in Danzig. It is reported that the Polish government has notified the British and French ambassadors here of its decision to deal with the situation in Danzig.

[Reuters Warsaw, July 7th] A Polish official announced today that Germany officially informed Poland that it would send warships to Königsberg and then to Danzig, intending to calm world opinion, but its purpose is obviously to create internal changes in the Free City of Danzig. The Polish people should pay attention. Therefore, although the current situation is calm, we should be extremely cautious, as Germany's intentions will seriously affect Danzig and Poland's access to the sea.

### British Miners' Union Launches Movement; German Workers Resist Aggression; Strengthen International Workers' United Front; Trade Union Representatives Discuss Enthusiastically

[Reuters London, June 6th] The British Miners' Federation held a conference in Swansea today, resolving to send the following telegram, broadcast secretly by an underground broadcasting station, to German miners: "For years, we have worked together to oppose the exploitation of mine owners in both countries. However, since 1933, German miners have been forced to disassociate themselves from their unions with miners in other countries, and dictatorial forces have risen to seize control. Today, we are in a situation similar to that of 1914. The aggressive policies of dictators are driving countries into war. We urge you to help resist aggression launched by any country. We uphold the belief in international solidarity. You strive for freedom in your country, and we are determined to give you assistance."

[Reuters Zurich, Switzerland, June 6th] The International Federation of Trade Unions held a conference today. The leader of the British Construction Workers' Union proposed inviting the Soviet Trade Unions to join the federation. Representatives from Norway and France expressed their support, while the representative from the American Federation of Labor opposed it. This case will be discussed further tomorrow.

Brief Commentary

### For Whom is Japan "Expending Blood and Sweat"?

The Japanese side hoped to make a "sensational move" on the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, establishing a "puppet government" in China with Wang Jingwei as the puppet. Now, it has failed under the united and firm resistance of our entire nation.

However, the conspiracy of Japanese agents and traitors is endless. They are preparing to establish another puppet regime, calling it the "Anti-Communist or Nationalist Party," and in the future, they want to organize an "Anti-Communist Kuomintang Government" (see Reuters Shanghai telegram of July 7th).

It goes without saying that the Japanese are trying in every possible way to scheme against us. What we must be especially vigilant about is those traitors in general, especially those who have not yet become traitors, and even those who are still standing under the banner of "righteousness." These people, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said yesterday to the military and civilians, "do not think that the Japanese are already digging a grave to bury themselves, and they disregard the country and willingly serve as funeral objects for the Japanese!"

The Japanese and Wang Jingwei have now raised the banners of "anti-communism" and "peace," raising the banners of what "Anti-Communist Nationalist Party" and "Anti-Communist Nationalist Party Government" to summon souls! And those crazy people who have lost their self-esteem and self-confidence in politics are also "rejoicing" in their words, jumping around, and doing evil! These kinds of people are not worth pitying if they willingly serve as funeral objects, but as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out in his instructions yesterday, "they even want to use the glorious nation as a funeral object"—this is what our entire nation cannot tolerate—we must unite more strongly, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, give the Japanese agents and traitors and the few crazy and shameless slaves a resolute blow!

Chronicle

### Saving Money

I Am A Confused Fool

I began to stutter when I walked into the bank. The bank clerk made me stutter, the small window on the counter made me stutter, seeing the money made me stutter, everything made me stutter.

The instant I stepped across the threshold of the bank, intending to deposit money, I became a dazed fool.

I knew this beforehand. But my salary had been raised to fifty dollars a month, and I felt that I should save it in the bank.

So I stumbled in, timidly looking at the bank clerks around me. I thought that a new depositor had to talk to the manager.

I walked up to a small window with the sign "Accountant." The accountant was a tall man with a cold demeanor, and I began to stutter when I saw him. My voice was so mournful.

"Can I, can I see the manager?" I said.

"Yes, yes," the accountant said, and asked the manager to come.

The manager was a solemn and quiet person. I clutched the fifty-six dollars in my pocket into a ball.

"Are you the manager?" I said. Heaven knows if I was doubting.

"Yes," he said.

"Can I see you," I asked, "privately?"

The manager looked at me with some surprise, thinking that I was going to reveal a big secret.

"Please come in," he said, leading me to a private room and locking the door.

"We won't be disturbed now," he said. "Please sit down."

We both sat down, looking at each other, and I felt unable to speak.

"You must be a detective sent by the detective bureau, I think," he said.

Seeing my mysterious attitude, he thought I was a detective. I knew what he was thinking, which made things even worse.

"No, I am not a detective," I said.

"To be honest," I continued, as if deliberately lying, "I am not a detective. I am here to deposit money. I want to deposit all my money in this bank."

The manager seemed a little relieved, but still very solemn; he now thought I must be the son of some millionaire.

"It must be a large sum," he said.

"Not much," I said softly. "I want to deposit fifty-six dollars first, and then fifty dollars every month."

The manager stood up and opened the door. He called the accountant.

"Mr. Meng Gaomao," he was really cruel, saying it out loud, "This gentleman wants to deposit money. He wants to deposit fifty-six dollars. Good morning." I stood up.

"Good morning," I said, stepping into the vault.

"Come out," the manager said coldly, pointing at the vault and telling me to go out.

I walked up to the accountant's window and quickly pushed the ball of banknotes to him with a brisk motion, as if doing a magic trick. My face was as pale as a ghost.

"Um," I said, "Deposit it." My tone was as if to say, "Hurry up and get this painful thing over with."

He took the money and passed it to another clerk.

He told me to write the amount on a slip of paper and sign my name in a ledger. I no longer knew what I was doing. The bank was spinning before my eyes.

"Is it deposited?" I asked in an empty and trembling voice.

"It's deposited," the accountant said.

"Then I want to write a check."

I meant to withdraw six dollars for use first. A clerk gave me a checkbook. Another clerk began to teach me how to sign. They must have been thinking that I was a useless millionaire. I wrote some words on the check and pushed it to the bank clerk. He picked up the check and looked at it.

"What! Are you going to withdraw it all again?" he asked in surprise. Only then did I realize that I had written fifty-six instead of six. Now I couldn't think anymore. I felt that this matter was inexplicable, and all the bank clerks stopped writing and looked at me.

At this moment, I was so distraught that I disregarded everything and suddenly said:

"Withdraw all of it."

"You want to withdraw the money deposited in the bank?"

"Every penny must be withdrawn."

"Are you no longer depositing?" the clerk said in amazement.

"Never again."

At this moment, I had a delusional hope that they would think that something had insulted me when I signed the check, causing me to no longer deposit. I desperately tried to look like a very impatient person.

The clerk prepared to pay the money.

"What kind of bills do you want?" he said.

"What?"

"What kind of bills do you want?"

"Um"——I understood what he meant, and answered without thinking——"Fifty dollar bills."

"Miss, I can't tell you what. I clearly saw on the ball that you forgot to put money in your bag."

### One Person One Day

Franklin D. Roosevelt had suffered from severe paralysis. Although he recovered, he remained lame. But he never mentioned his disability. If anyone tried to offer condolences or inquire about his leg ailment, they would be met with an unpleasant reaction.

Once, he was giving a campaign speech in Georgia. As usual, he leaned against the lectern to speak. When he was engrossed in declaring, "If I become president, you will be able to..." he unknowingly moved away from the lectern and lost his balance on the stage. Naturally, this frightened the people both on and off the stage. But when he was helped up, he didn't care at all and continued speaking as if nothing had happened.

### Weather Forecast

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the "July 7th Incident." Flipping through the evening newspaper, I saw the headline: "Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong Enthusiastically Commemorate." Walking on the street, what did I see? Very few national flags, very few blue flowers. On display, movie theaters, Cantonese opera houses, teahouses, and restaurants were still crowded. There were charity sales, vegetarian meals, and anti-war propaganda.

Shanghai, a piece of the Republic of China's sovereign territory, on the occasion of "July 7th," British, American, and French troops were all mobilized, and detectives stood guard as if facing a major enemy. Friends, we are much more "comfortable" in "foreign countries," aren't we?

The Tokyo negotiations are faltering. Originally, the Japanese side wanted to "eradicate" the anti-Japanese elements, but now they also say, "The Tokyo negotiations only discuss issues related to Tianjin." After a lot of haggling, how polite they are! What kind of smokescreen is this? The Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been going on for five months. News has come that they are going to issue a declaration to decorate the scene.

### Be Loyal to the Country, Filial to the Nation, Benevolent to Compatriots

He gave me a fifty-dollar bill.

"What about the six dollars?" he asked indifferently.

"Six dollar bills," I said.

He gave me the bills and I rushed out the door.

As the door turned behind me, I heard an echo of hearty laughter. From that time on, I never deposited money again. I put my cash in my trouser pocket and saved my savings in a sock.

### Lin's Watermelon

Once, a German farmer had a newborn son and wanted to buy a stroller, but he was too poor to afford it. He had a friend who worked in a nearby factory that supposedly made strollers. So he discussed it with his friend, asking him to bring out some parts whenever he could, so that he could assemble them into a stroller.

The friend happily agreed. So, wheels, frames, handles, axles, one by one, were brought out. In just a few days, they were all collected. The friend asked if the stroller had been assembled yet. "No," the farmer said, "I tried to assemble it three times according to what you said, but each time it turned out to be a machine gun."

### Maritime Storms 27

— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi

Summary of Previous Chapters:

In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the wireless operator for the Qiu克斯 shipping company, and Bill, a mechanic, took advantage of a German ship traveling to Europe. Because England and Germany had declared war, British warships were going to intercept the ship. The ship fled frantically. With great difficulty, it escaped the danger and returned to American territory. Jack and Bill returned to New York to see Qiu. Qiu then asked them to take the "St. Mark" to Europe to find his son. On board, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that this fellow was the German spy named Lavicky...

Thirteen - The Burning Ship

"What's it all about?" Bill continued.

"Oh, he came running; offered me a lot of money to send a coded message for him. I imagine it's about the 'Taini' - reporting on her location."

"Is that the trick he's trying to pull?"

"Yes, he didn't succeed. I was momentarily confused and told him to stop pretending in front of me. And, if he bothered me again, the next British inspector to board the ship, I would point him out."

"And then, what did he do?"

"I think, at that time, he swelled up like a balloon," Jack laughed. "Now, as long as we can expose史可志, we can catch them all in one fell swoop when we want him."

"That won't be easy. They're never together. At least, I've been watching. Lavicky hasn't talked to anyone on this ship."

"No, I guess they're deliberately avoiding each other to avoid suspicion. I wish I could have heard them talking that night, and gotten a good look at him."

"Yes, that would be the easiest and best thing. But, like you said, I don't think either of them will bother us again."

The day passed uneventfully. In the afternoon, they saw a British cargo ship sailing west. Later, they overtook a French oil tanker heading towards Poland. Jack, seeing that they had a small radio transceiver installed, went to ask for recent news. They replied that there were two German cruisers nearby, and the French ship was trying to escape being captured.

At dusk, the wind picked up a bit. The waves were also blown higher. Even the "St. Mark," a large ship, was tossed and turned violently. This was what sailors call a "fresh breeze." But, for those passengers unaccustomed to this, it was considered a considerable storm.

Jack and Bill were happy. Under such a monotonous calm, they preferred a bit of bad weather. After dinner, they went to the lifeboat deck, walking up and down, chatting casually. Inside, on the radio base, Mullen was in charge. As they passed the door, they exchanged a few casual words with him. The second time, Mullen excitedly called out to them.

"There's a ship sending a distress signal!" he shouted.

"A British ship?" Jack exclaimed. "But, what danger could there be in such a place?"

"I don't know yet. I'm trying to listen in. Go report to the captain. Should we go to rescue them?"

"Go immediately!" Jack completed his task in a few minutes and returned to the radio room. The order brought back was: "Rescue!" And to quickly await further reports.

### Overview of the Stock Market This Week

Over the past week, the stock market has seen widespread engagement. Shanghai Bank and general public utility stocks have garnered significant interest from Hong Kong investors, though the market remains unstimulating. Stock prices have risen slightly, with purchase prices generally falling just below the listed prices. Due to recent political uncertainties, stock prices cannot consistently remain at these levels. An increase in demand will inevitably lead to a point of reaction, and various factors can influence this.

The work of the Tea Department is nothing more than completing or fulfilling the goals outlined in the wartime tea policy and executing the aforementioned tasks. However, because it is an organization for local and central cooperation, its nature is questionable. Therefore, I will briefly explain our work approach: First, to promote the central government's unified sales policy. This is the foundation of the tea policy. Without unified sales, it is impossible to talk about achieving the goals of "competing for materials and strengthening finance." Nor can the work of "reducing intermediaries and eliminating bad practices" and "increasing direct trade and exports" be accomplished. Second, to safeguard the interests of farmers and merchants in the province. Only by increasing the interests of farmers and merchants can we enhance their love for the tea industry and further increase their faith in the nation. The foundation of "stabilizing rural areas and improving the tea industry" is also based on this. The way to safeguard is definitely not through blind promotion, but through the adjustment of interest distribution among various levels of production. Only in this way can we talk about improving production, benefiting farmers, "overhauling tea factories, and improving manufacturing." Third, to serve the improvement of the tea industry in this province to the greatest extent. As we know, management and administration should not merely be negative restrictions and constraints on the people, but positive promotion and assistance. The Tea Department itself does not directly or indirectly bear the responsibility for business operations (such as purchasing), nor does it charge any fees. However, entrusted by the central unified sales agency and based on the needs of farmers and merchants in the province, we should handle various matters related to tea industry improvement with a service attitude. We should not be confined to one aspect with the passive work of an administrative agency.

(4) Several Tasks

Based on the above objectives, the work content of the Tea Department is extremely complex. In the initial stage of its establishment this year, preparations were rushed, and it is difficult to execute everything. However, the following points will be promoted step by step to achieve some success:

(1) Promoting Tea Farmer Production - This does not only refer to the production of raw tea leaves. The goal of the tea policy, on the one hand, is to achieve large-scale modern tea factories. On the other hand, it is to simplify and rationalize production relations. Before we can develop national capital and modernize all tea factories, it is crucial to focus on tea making among individual tea farmers to increase their profits. The method is to promote cooperative organizations. The Ministry of Finance has promulgated general organizational rules for tea management agencies in various provinces, listing tea farmer cooperation as a major part of the work. Our province has cooperative work teams responsible for this task, so the Tea Department only needs to maintain close contact with them and promote it together to see results.

(2) Balancing Tea Prices - This is the core of the tea industry improvement problem. On the one hand, it is to protect the reasonable profits of tea merchants. On the other hand, it is to increase the profits of tea farmers. The former is easier to achieve, and the method is to establish a tea price guarantee contract with the Trade Commission and organize an evaluation committee for fair agreement to ensure that tea factories obtain legitimate profits. The latter is the most important task, but tea farmers are too scattered.

### Two Years of Literature

— Jie Ru

From July 7, 1937, to today, our motherland has undergone a full two years of battle. For two years, accompanying the real struggles of the motherland, accompanying the great battles of the motherland, our literature has also very powerfully shouldered the mission assigned to it by the times and the nation. In order to awaken the masses from ignorance, in order to strike the enemy from its basic position, it resolutely threw itself into the great vortex of battle, using its various weapons, concentrating various fighters around it, and thus carrying out its arduous and great struggle. Since the May Fourth New Culture Enlightenment Movement, the consistent struggle direction in literature for more than ten years has gained a new development and a new upswing here. Literary struggles in various aspects have been greatly improved, progressed, and achieved more outstanding success and extraordinary expansion than in previous stages. China's emerging combat literature has taken a big step forward in this brand-new era of combat.

The bright battle flag waving in the free sky of the new China is such a powerful call to various types of soldiers in the literary camp. For two years, in the literary struggle, all our literary soldiers have gathered under this great battle flag and completed a more steel-like, stronger, and more consolidated national revolutionary literary united front, absorbing all writers, poets, theorists, playwrights, and the vast number of young literary people, fighting together toward a single goal. The battle slogan and basic creative symbol that form the foundation of a national revolutionary literary united front is "Resistance War Literature." It leads the literary and artistic struggle of the past two years in an agile posture and has become the landmark of the work of all literary and artistic workers, transforming into the most realistic path of today's literary and artistic movement. The Resistance War Literary Movement has already become the most powerful force in our national cultural struggle of the past two years.

The Resistance War Literary Movement is the critical result of the struggle experience of Chinese literature in past eras, and it is an extension of the struggle between "National Defense Literature" and "Mass Literature of the National Revolutionary War" after the "December 9th" Beiping student movement and before "July 7th". It is the purification and realistic deepening of their theories. In other words, it is also a higher and newer stage of Chinese literature. For two years, the increasingly fierce real battles have demanded the continuous advancement of literary battles. The Resistance War Literary Movement has undergone comprehensive development and has many unprecedented achievements in the history of literature, whether in artistic creation or literary theory, poetry, or in content, techniques, forms, popularization, and Sinicization. The combat achievements we have accumulated in the past two years are truly too numerous to mention, and the progress we have made cannot be expressed in a few words.

The development of the Resistance War Literary Movement, like the development of all other literary movements, requires its theoretical guidance. For two years, the new advanced theories of the Resistance War Literature have organically guided it, leading this movement onto the right track of development, and guiding all writers standing at the forefront of this movement with the direction of creation. Therefore, Resistance War Literary Theory has played a major role in the Resistance War Literary Movement of the past two years. Although its own activities are still very weak, and although it shows a great lag compared to the progress of reality and the practice of creation, it has also done a lot of work, such as the promotion of various aspects of Resistance War Literary Theory, the critical review of various aspects of creative routes, the explanation of basic theoretical viewpoints, the liquidation of formalism and formalism, the deepening of the theory of literary popularization, the expansion of the scope of writers' writing, and the critical absorption of local literature, and so on. Of course, these alone are not enough. The deepened and expanded struggles of the past two years can no longer simply satisfy these theories, and these trivial theoretical facts are also unable to meet the needs of today's literary battles. Therefore, stepping forward from the achievements gained in these two years, we need to establish a system of literary theory, establish a complete central method of literary creation and criticism, and need more refined and complete theories.

The main link in our literary struggle in the past two years has undoubtedly been in the aspect of literary creation. Due to the needs of actual combat, our creation has unfolded in infinitely broad aspects in describing the frontal battles. We have produced "A Company Commander's Battle Encounters." In describing the negative decay, we have produced "Mr. Hua Wei." Various pamphlets, novels, poems, and dramas, etc., have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. "Half a Cart of Wheat and Rice," "A Year," "Frontline in the North"... these excellent works are constantly being discovered. All these creative achievements are showing the great struggle we have carried out in literature in the past two years. Although these struggles are a bit lagging behind in the rapid development of reality, more agile and sharper literary creations will undoubtedly continue to be produced in large quantities in the future. The literary struggle in the past two years has well paved the way for our future Resistance War literary creation. Inheriting the development of this road, we should more vigorously strengthen the struggle of our writers' creation and turn our literary mirror towards the struggle for national liberation and the victorious tomorrow of this struggle.

The work of literary popularization is undoubtedly one of the major tasks we have carried out in the past two years. Today, we have seen many achievements in this work. For example, the adaptation of many local operas, drum lyrics, storytellings, and other types of folk songs and children's songs, "old bottles filled with new wine" are all good examples. In the future, we must further expand, improve, and deepen this work, thoroughly refining the essence of literature from popularization, establishing a new type of literature that is completely popular and Chinese, thereby strengthening its combat function.

The two years of literary struggle are unforgettable merits for us. Today, the motherland is still in hardship, and the literary combat mission will not be considered over. Countless missions are waiting for us. Let us fight more bravely! Jin Yi

### Snatching Towards the Motherland - Still a Story of a Girl -

— Jin Yi

"Don't call me that."

"Jingwen, why did you come to my side?" She said halfway, turned her face to look at her, and asked in panic, "What, are you injured?"

"No, I'm not, I want to come to your side, if we die, we will die together, this really took my life!"

"Can't you see the blood on your face?"

"How can I see it?" Jingwen said, touching it with her hand, crying like a child, "How can I bleed so much? I don't know at all, but it doesn't hurt at all."

Qingzhi also wiped her face for her, "There is no wound," she said reassuringly;

"Don't be afraid, you are not injured, you should lie down quietly."

"No, I'm afraid alone, you promised me to be by your side."

Her voice trembled, as if she was about to cry again, Qingzhi was still at a loss.

"Don't be like this, you just lie down here, like me, with both hands flat on the ground."

"It's already on fire over there."

"Don't worry, it won't burn over here."

The plane hadn't left yet, it wasn't dropping any more bombs, it was like it was enjoying the evil it had created.

The winter sun shines warmly, the crops in the fields stand tall without fear, the pond water stirs up a wave, then returns to calm. Everything exists smoothly in the middle of heaven and earth, but the cruel magic hand snatches the lives of the innocent, disturbs the calm air, and sets down the fire of destruction.

The fire burned cracklingly, she thought, "Why doesn't it burn bigger, burn those planes in there too." (To be continued)

Thrown into the Pig Herd - By Remarque

### Reading "Chen Ershitou"

— Han Bo

Serialized in Literary Front No. 23

"Chen Ershitou" is labeled as "speech literature," which is indeed "a fresh thing." In order to avoid all material limitations, and to use the storytelling form, is a light cavalry team of literary popularization. Because this form is easy to understand and close to the people, it will inevitably be accepted by a large number of literate or illiterate masses (because it is a speech, illiterate people can also appreciate the benefits). We analyze its content, etc., in addition to literary evaluation, we should especially focus on its effect, because this is the only "legacy" it inherits from the form.

In the writing process, Mr. Hu Kao undoubtedly spent a lot of effort. There are too many things to consider. The lack of colloquial language (such as "a throat," "Na," etc. are all invented by himself), and the need for a lively and relaxed style to facilitate speeches and attract the masses, are all very obvious. Now, just in terms of creating this kind of "speech literature," it can be said that it has achieved considerable success. It has a beginning and an end, has a gag that can make people laugh, has some unambiguous folk-familiar life experiences, and has vivid colloquial words. The result also achieved the theme and ending of telling this story that is not legendary - Chen Ershitou's house was burned down by the devils, his wife and daughter were bombed to death, and he turned from a farmer to a "team" guerrilla, ending the story.

The full text of more than 20,000 words, just like ordinary storytelling, has one line to the end, without any "twists and turns." Even the little devils will not open their mouths in ignorance. In order to strengthen the tone, it often does not hesitate to repeat sentences to achieve the purpose. This is also a common technique used by ordinary storytellers, like one of the paragraphs: (To be continued) Pearl River

### Starting from "Article Charity Sale"

— Pearl River

Our publication, from the 8th to the 10th of this month, responded to the "Literary Association's" article charity sale donation campaign. All manuscript fees will be donated for the purpose of rescuing wounded soldiers. This movement has two meanings: First, it shows the writers' enthusiastic donations; second, it shows the sincere cooperation between the pen and the gun.

Since the July 7th Resistance War, there has been a most popular and crucial saying, which is "Those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money." Our supreme leader has repeatedly and earnestly explained to the people: "This Sino-Japanese war is a final competition of the two countries' manpower, financial resources, and material resources. If we have the strength to support ourselves longer in terms of manpower, financial resources, and material resources, we will be able to achieve victory." This so-called manpower includes both labor and mental effort. The effort made by writers is naturally a kind of mental effort. Now, writers contribute their mental effort, write articles that are beneficial to the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and dedicate the price they should receive for these articles—manuscript fees—for the purpose of rescuing wounded soldiers. This can be said to be contributing both manpower and financial resources. Therefore, this article charity sale movement can very well demonstrate the writers' patriotic spirit, fulfilling the entire saying of "Those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money."

Secondly, this article charity sale movement has a more profound meaning, which is the demonstration of sincere cooperation between the pen and the gun. Galloping on the front lines and striking the remaining enemies is the mission of the gun; boosting morale in the rear and supporting the war of resistance, this is the task of the pen. Therefore, the gun and the pen each have their own positions in the war of resistance. Now, the proceeds of the pen—manuscript fees—are used to rescue wounded soldiers, so that the wounded soldiers can recover their vitality, re-wield the gun, and fight desperately with the enemy. Isn't this using the pen to support the gun, demonstrating the sincere cooperation between the pen and the gun?

Finally, I believe that writers, in this article charity sale movement, should more thoroughly realize the importance of their own tasks and earnestly carry out their own work. Now, based on what I can think of, I offer the following suggestions:

First, we must severely criticize the pro-Japanese theory. Since the Wang Jingwei clique betrayed the country, some newspapers and publications that spread pro-Japanese theories have been found in the country. This has an unfavorable impact on the future of the war of resistance. I believe that writers should, on the one hand, launch fatal attacks on the theories of the traitors; on the other hand, they should elaborate on the reasons why the war of resistance will surely win and the country will surely be built, in order to strengthen the people's confidence.

Second, we must have a solemn writing attitude. Articles about romance and trivial matters can be avoided altogether. The reason for this is very clear. This era is definitely not for writing articles about romance and trivial matters. For writers, it is misusing their mental effort on useless or even harmful things; for readers, it is wasting their energy, or even demoralizing their will. Therefore, in the process of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, writing such articles is a harmful undertaking, whether viewed from the perspective of the author and reader, or from the standpoint of the country and nation. This is something that writers who generally hold a playful attitude towards writing should seriously reflect on.

Third, the scope of writing should be multifaceted. At present, most writers' themes are concentrated on "War of Resistance," which seems a bit narrow. The "July 7th" incident, which was launched the year before last, was naturally the beginning of the "War of Resistance" on the one hand; on the other hand, it was also the beginning of "National Reconstruction." This "National Reconstruction" is a permanent undertaking, and it must be carried out in many ways. Political, economic, educational, scientific... improvements are all included. Therefore, we should conduct detailed research and elaboration on all social and natural sciences related to national reconstruction. I believe that simply writing about the theme of "War of Resistance" is still insufficient. I hope that writers will put more effort into other aspects.

Merchants dealing in beef, mutton, pork, and fresh fish all closed for one day, all Hong Kong restaurants and teahouses were all vegetarian, some entertainment venues stopped operating, and some performed for one day, saving on food and donating money, and enthusiastically held charity sales and donations. All the Hong Kong opera singers held a charity performance at the Sincere Department Store rooftop and the Wen Yuan Restaurant in the evening. The various parties' savings on food, donations, and contributions were handed over to relief organizations to handle relief or remitted to the central government. It is expected that the results will be considerable. The various situations yesterday are recorded as follows:

Public Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers by All Sectors

Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, community organizations and schools from Hong Kong and Kowloon held a public memorial service for the martyrs and fallen comrades at the Kowloon School's sports field on Barron Road. Those who attended included Xu Shiying, Gao Tingzi, and representatives from community organizations in Hong Kong and Kowloon, totaling several thousand people. The memorial address of the assembly stated, "On July 7th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, the two-year anniversary of the July 7th commemoration and the War of Resistance, the colleagues of the Hong Kong and Kowloon community organizations and schools' commemorative assembly, with incense, flowers, and clear wine, pay tribute to the spirits of the fallen soldiers at the front and the deceased compatriots, and express our condolences. The words say, 'The Yellow Sea is vast, the mainland is boundless, the Lugouqiao incident has not ended, a full-scale war of resistance, our martial might is promoted, the sacrifices are heroic, the righteous spirit shines brightly, for two years now, the public's will is firm, thinking of the deceased, how can we not be saddened, we, the rearguard, strive to contribute, fresh flowers pay tribute, words are heavy with awe, alas, enjoy the offering.' The elegiac couplet said, 'In the dust of four hundred million people, resist violence and exterminate the strong, heroic sacrifice, you are the pioneers,' 'In the history of the Eastern Hemisphere, promote the national destiny of mankind, the responsibility for glorious undertaking lies with future generations.'"

Industrial Groups Hold Flag Ceremony

Dozens of industrial groups held a flag presentation at the Kowloon Jixian General Labour Union at nine o'clock, paying tribute to the soldiers at the front. Those who participated included representatives from the industrial groups, numbering several thousand people. Xu Shiying, representing He Xiaozhen, and Zhang Yimo, representing, came to receive the flags, and He Xiaozhen and Zhang Yimo delivered speeches. The general idea was that when we commemorate the "July 7th War of Resistance and National Reconstruction two-year anniversary," we should recognize the current environment, and shoulder the current responsibilities. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once instructed, "The war of resistance has progressed to today's stage, the rear is more important than the front, the people are more important than the army." It can be seen that the responsibility of us in the rear is important today. I hope everyone will work harder to achieve the final victory.

Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Commemorates Martyrs

The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a "July 7th" commemoration meeting at the association at twelve noon, and commemorated the anti-Japanese war martyrs and dead compatriots. Hundreds of people attended the meeting. After the ceremony, Chairman Li Xing spoke. The general idea was that today we are holding a meeting to commemorate the two-year anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We should express our deep admiration for the national heroes who sacrificed themselves for our country, and we should have passionate hope for our country. Recalling today two years ago, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the enemy always thought that they could occupy our entire country in a short period of time, and subjugate our entire people. How could they know that after two years, the enemy's hopes have become a dream. Although our country is inevitably losing cities and territories, and our soldiers and civilians are dying, the whole country is united and the more we fight, the more courageous we become, and the more we fight, the stronger the anti-war strategy becomes. This is all due to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's effective command and the sincere unity of the people across the country, and it is also due to the martyrs who faced death as if returning home and stepped forward to defend the country, so they could inspire the entire army and people to go to righteousness together without fear, so we can persist in the war of resistance, and victory is more assured. We commemorate the martyrs today and should absolutely abide by their will, concentrate our strength, and concentrate our sincerity. We should recognize the principle that the country is above all and the nation is above all, and then shoulder the responsibilities that citizens should fulfill in order to complete the unfinished work of the martyrs. Then the day of restoring the integrity of today's fragmented mountains and rivers will soon come. I hope that our fellow overseas Chinese will encourage each other.

Various Groups Hold Oaths

The Chinese Women's Association held a meeting at the association at 10:00 am to commemorate "July 7th" and hold an oath-taking ceremony. Madam Luo Wenjin, Zheng Hongnian, Guo Li Furong and dozens of other people attended. After the ceremony, Chairman Guo Li Furong delivered a speech, followed by the oath, which was supervised by Zheng Hongnian. After the oath, Zheng gave a speech, expressing optimism about the military's increasingly brave and victorious future in the past two years of the war of resistance. Finally, Madam Luo Wenjin delivered a speech, saying that after taking the oath, we must actually implement it in order to live up to the good intentions of the leaders.

Special Report from Our Newspaper

### "July 7th" in Kowloon

— Latter

Under the initiative and call of the Cultural Enterprise Society, community organizations and schools in Kowloon, like community organizations in other regions, expressed their ardent feelings and surging emotions to the two-year anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, issuing their heroic roars and promoting their spirit of loyalty to the motherland.

Groups of young men and women, like thousands of soldiers and horses, surged towards the Kowloon Tong School sports ground. This square was surrounded by lush green youths, and the ground was covered with soft green grass. In the not-too-distant distance, rows of green hills and ridges were clearly visible. The historical site was lined with magnificent Western-style houses, like a flock of cranes standing in the wilderness. No miscellaneous people could be found here, which could be said to be a secluded and elegant scenic spot. However, when countless people unprecedentedly caused a commotion and shouted loudly here, it broke through the dull atmosphere of the mountains and fields and forever left traces of commemorating the glorious battle of the nation.

The fiery sun was radiating its golden light on the square, showing a hot atmosphere. People in this hot atmosphere were holding their chests high, raising their heads, and baring their muscles, all for the sake of winning a breath for the country and the nation.

At about 10 o'clock, the bell rang, the music was played, and the meeting officially began. The members of the presidium on the podium and the guests all successively spoke about their support for the great leader, support for the united front, insistence on the war of resistance, and opposition to the language and propositions of the peace advocates. The choir also responded to the entire audience with their loud voices. These young people, with their foreheads covered in sweat, and many frail children, could not withstand the excessive heat of the sun and fainted. They were like wounded little soldiers, and the Peninsula Nursing Team was very busy rescuing them, and they were able to recover their demeanor with great difficulty.

After the speeches and singing ended, an even more solemn ceremony began. It was a public memorial service for the soldiers who died at the front. First, cannons were fired, mourning music was played, wreaths were presented, and then the chairman read the memorial text. A series of loud sound waves, sad but also inspiring and exciting words, deeply struck the hearts of everyone. Finally, a child named Liang Weiwen from the middle school choir sang a solo song called "The Lugou Bridge Song." His pure and loud voice, and his melodic intonation, immediately created a joyful atmosphere around the entire venue. This is precisely the only sign of the excellent children of the Chinese nation, and the new force of the Chinese nation, which cannot be defeated, is being cultivated.

After the meeting in the square ended, people, in groups and teams, did not feel tired at all, and competed with the sun, walking step by step on the road, and like an expedition, went to the Yaumatei First Theatre to hold a "July 7th" vegetarian lunch conference. The hall was full of people. Bowls of sweet potato and mustard soup were carried by many waiters, dripping with sweat, and offered to people to drink and eat. It was a meeting that was more interesting than eating chicken and meat. Without two years of resolute war of resistance, there would never have been a vegetarian conference today. Everyone laughed and drank happily together, but it was also because people had such ardent feelings to write this glorious epic that it embodied the greater promise of the Chinese nation.

After the vegetarian meal, the drama troupe of the Youth Federation, a flower of the youth drama world, set up their formation, sounded the bugle of combat art, and performed a one-act play entitled "Unwilling to be Submissive People." The performance of this one-act play enhanced the solemn, tense, and lively atmosphere of the entire venue, and further encouraged the hearts of people who were hating and killing the enemy. Although the plot was short, the language and actions of the performers were like a storm, like thunder and lightning, vividly portraying the tense situation. The effects it achieved were sufficient to grasp the significance of this day, the "July 7th" anniversary. The central content of this play was that people who were unwilling to be submissive people wanted to continue to kill the enemy. The performance touched the hearts of the audience at the meeting and achieved the effect of artistic propaganda.

At about 3:00 pm, the meeting adjourned, and people happily returned to their respective homes, bringing with them the satisfying, joyful, and glorious fruits of this day.

### Sham Shui Po Children's Summer Camp, Camp Address: Qiangzhong School on Fuk Wing Street, Prelude to the Collectivization of Children's Life

The Sham Shui Po Children's Summer Camp was recently established at the Qiangzhong School on Fuk Wing Street in Sham Shui Po. It uses the children's leisure time during the summer vacation to implement collective training, improve children's interest in extracurricular learning, and cultivate their inherent moral, intellectual, physical, and social abilities. Therefore, the group's outdoor activities are more important than indoor teaching, and practical knowledge is more important than book knowledge. At the same time, it provides group guidance, with each group being responsible by a specialized instructor. The subjects include vernacular Chinese, English, mathematics, and common knowledge (focusing on life and wartime common knowledge). Extracurricular activities include anti-war drama, salvation songs, little teacher service, swimming, ball games, morning exercises, travel, mountain climbing, and various problem seminars. This collective self-education method has been tried in Peiping and Guangzhou with great results, but it is still an innovation in Hong Kong. It is expected that satisfactory results will be achieved.

### The Cultural World in "July 7th"

— Luoxia

Hong Kong's young cultural workers, standing on the same battle line – "Youth Journal," "Cultural Association," and "China Art" – jointly held a commemorative meeting at the Central Theatre at nine o'clock yesterday morning. They used close unity and close cooperation to welcome the arrival of this sacred national liberation.

Time slipped away, and amidst everyone's eager anticipation, Mr. Wang Lengzhai, the fighter of this national liberation revolution, finally arrived. Chairman Xu Dishan and _. 'Stand up and explain the reason for today's meeting;' It is even rarer today for this commemorative meeting to have Mr. Wang Lengzhai, the hero who fired the first shot of the War of Resistance and raised the banner of national liberation in Wanping City two years ago, narrate his heroic story. After an introduction by _You Nu, Mr. Wang Lengzhai stood up amidst applause. He was wearing a white velvet suit and white leather shoes that day, matching his gaunt and square face. The two whiskers on his upper lip _ his demeanor was unrestrained. If _ he had not seen his pair of awe-inspiring and powerful eyes, you would have believed him to be a scholar. He spoke gently and sincerely, and his unwavering and righteous spirit overflowed from his words.

At the beginning of his speech, he spoke very slowly and often made small pauses, his eyes, revealing a majestic light, shot straight forward, as if he was recalling _ the glory and greatness of raising the torch of the national liberation war two years ago today. Against all expectations, two years ago today, he was able to attack the _ people and ignite the raging fire of the War of Resistance. Now the entire Chinese nation is following in his heroic footsteps and embarking on the road to victory. The glory created by this national revolutionary fighter will continue _ for generations to come. _ Then, he said: "Two years ago today. _ People _ fired a cannon into the county government offices of Wanping City. _ A small house, but _ this cannon ignited the raging fire of the Chinese nation's struggle for liberation. Today. I believe that commemorative meetings are being held all over the country, and everyone is filled with fiery passion. This flame will continue to burn until the Chinese nation shines brightly _already."

He continued to explain in detail, "The _ people's conspiracy to swallow the entire China, because of the _ people's arrogance and rampage at Lugou Bridge, fabricated the false claim that Japanese soldiers were missing and used it as an excuse _ , and made various unreasonable demands. _ They _ refused, so the conflict arose. The _ people first attacked _ and fired their guns to sweep at us. The future development _ the result is still unpredictable, but at that time, it was truly impossible to endure and we had to rise up and resist." When he said this, his voice became particularly heavy, as if he was bringing out the resolute attitude he had two years ago.

Then he said, "The _ people's deception _ and blackmail are simply the most cunning and faithless people in the world. Two years have passed since the War of Resistance, and although the _ people's manpower, financial resources, and material resources have been exhausted, their arrogant warlords are still boasting of victory. How could he make peace with us? His release of peaceful air has a purpose: first, to confuse the world's hearing and vision; second, to divide domestic unity; third, to relax everyone's resolve; and fourth, to relax our military preparations. Just like the Lugou Bridge Incident two years ago, so we must not be fooled by him.

"We don't want to be slaves of a conquered nation. Even more, we don't want to be traitors. Being a traitor is more painful and less free than being a beggar!" he said in an alert tone.

"Let us all unite, support our highest leader, revive the nation, and reclaim the rivers and mountains we have lost!" Applause warmly sent him back to his seat.

Then, a telegram to Chairman Chiang and the front-line soldiers was approved, and everyone applauded enthusiastically. Then, the China Choir performed patriotic songs, anti-_ songs, guerrilla songs, and the Song of the Eight Hundred Heroes. "China will not perish! China will not perish!" Will not perish! Will not perish! Will not perish! The song resounded through the sky, and everyone felt their blood rushing.

The "China Art" finale of the play "Dawn" was very brilliant. The intense and solemn emotions filled the scene, causing people to shed tears of inspiration!

### Chiang Kai-shek's Letter to the Japanese People: Announcing the Crimes of the Arrogant Japanese Warlords

— (From yesterday's Second Edition)

When you invade, we naturally resist Japan, and consider you the aggressors. If you abandon the invasion and are willing to reconcile, we can naturally consider you friends. Isn't this obvious? As for creating a pro-Japanese government, may I ask, how can the government of the Republic of China allow foreign troops to forge one? Within the occupied territories, your military can indeed recruit a very small number of Chinese traitors and organize some puppet organizations. But these organizations are, after all, appendages of your invading army, not independent political organs. No matter how your military tries to whitewash and deceive our entire nation, we will always recognize these organizations as belonging to the invaders, and the puppets as traitors. Therefore, they can only deceive the Japanese, but not the Chinese.

The War of Resistance is the Will of the Entire Chinese Nation

Finally, regarding myself personally, I know that you warlords have aimed your arrows at me, which is only natural. Since you want to conquer China, you naturally hate the Chinese commander. Therefore, this matter needs no further discussion. However, I advise you not to think that by defeating a certain person, you can defeat China. This is absolutely wrong. I remember that a few years ago, your warlords distributed pamphlets saying, "Chiang Kai-shek is the greatest obstacle to the Empire's continental policy." That's right, I am indeed resisting those who invade China with all my might, and I am an obstacle. But you must realize that the Chinese nation is truly united and has real talent. I am resolutely resisting the war in my capacity as commander-in-chief. In the future, even if another person, or even a hundred people, are replaced as commander-in-chief, they will also resolutely resist the war. You must know that the great future of the Republic of China is guaranteed by countless loyal and brave soldiers and civilians, and it is definitely not supported only by a few people in leadership positions! I also want to tell you: I am truly full of grateful optimism about the future of our nation. Because after two years of arduous war of resistance, every officer and soldier on our front lines, and every person working on the war of resistance in various places, has mostly reached the peak of morality in their spirit. To be honest, I myself can only be said to be able to represent the spirit and will of the entire army and the people from all walks of life today, to carry out the great task of resisting the war and saving the country. At the same time, I firmly believe that our countless rising talents will definitely be better than those currently in charge in every sense in the future. Therefore, Japanese people, you must recognize the greatness of the Chinese nation and not misunderstand the issue.

(2) Announcing the Crimes of Japanese Warlords Enslaving the Peoples of East Asia

What I have said above has roughly exposed the truth about several types of deceptive propaganda, but it is still not enough, because many Japanese people know that such propaganda is false. However, another point is easier to believe, which is that "Japan can actually conquer China and defeat China's independence." The general Japanese public also knows that invasion is bad, but they believe that no matter what, being able to control China and occupy the mainland is always beneficial to Japan. After two years of invasion war, this delusion has probably awakened a lot, but it is still not thorough—so I think it is necessary to reveal two points to you: one point is that the invasion of your warlords is bound to fail; our self-defense is bound to succeed.

Another point is that our success is definitely not the failure of the Japanese people, but the failure of your warlord policy is the success of your people. This reason requires many words to explain. I will first explain a basic point, that is, your country, under the guidance of the wrong ideas of the warlords, has consistently committed serious crimes against the peoples of East Asia. This is the root cause of the inevitable failure of this war of aggression against China. And you Japanese people are now just beginning to suffer the consequences. To what extent will this retribution develop? It is impossible to predict now.

The Shallowness and Ridiculousness of the Japanese Military's Understanding

The serious error of your warlords' thinking is especially despising the neighboring East Asian nations. After the Meiji Restoration, your country's fortune progressed, and you forgot thousands of years of history and became arrogantly self-important, despising backward neighboring countries. This kind of thinking was especially promoted and encouraged by the warlords, thus anesthetizing the people and creating the idea of ​​omnipotent force and omnipotent invasion. In fact, this is your greatest misfortune! I can tell you that China and Japan are absolutely different. You are guided by the wrong ideas of the warlords, and you only talk about strength and weakness in everything, and don't talk about right and wrong. You look at foreign countries completely using armed strength to calculate. You have the greatest respect for the strongest, second greatest respect for the second strongest, you plan to deceive the weak, and you want to swallow the unarmed in one gulp. This is because the warlords you are obsessed with only talk about force when discussing world affairs. They spend all day calculating who has how many cannons, how many airplanes, how many warships, and how much military industry and resources. They use the amount of military force as a representative to measure the value of each country and nation. In the hearts of your warlords, any nation with weak military force should submit to the strong; if it is a nation without any arms, it is not considered human, and should be a slave. This is the basic philosophy of your warlords. Because the world is too big, and the power of Japan cannot reach the weak and small countries far away, the conquering desire of the Japanese ruling class can only be exerted on the weaker neighbors first, and the tragedy of East Asia has developed in this way. Regarding this point, Chinese thinking is fundamentally different. In our minds, all nations are equal and should be free. For example, the strength and prosperity of the Japanese and Koreans are worlds apart, but in our view, they are all equal people. We cannot fear the Japanese because Japan is a so-called first-class power, nor can we look down on the Koreans because they are people of a weak country. On the contrary, we hate the invaders who believe in omnipotent force, and we sympathize with the oppressed small nations. Simply put, the Japanese only talk about strength and weakness, while we only talk about right and wrong. This point is very important.

The People of Korea and Taiwan Under the Iron Heel

Now let me announce the crimes of your warlords! You tore up the treaty with China that respected Korean independence and swallowed Korea. For thirty years, we have been unable to advise or intervene, but we have coldly watched your country despise Koreans as beggars to this day, without giving them any political freedom, and gradually devouring them commercially, turning Korean rich men into poor households, and ordinary people have fallen into exile. For more than ten years, Korean people have fled to our Northeast provinces to make a living, all because they lost their fields in their hometowns and were forced to flee. There are also many unemployed Koreans who are forced to engage in smuggling in Tianjin and other places, doing all kinds of evil. Although we hate their behavior, we cannot help but sympathize with their situation. As for the enslavement education and severe suppression policies in Korea, there is no need to go into detail. In short, the Korean people are in a state of slavery, and the situation in Taiwan is similar. Your warlords have enslaved Korea and Taiwan, and further want to enslave the great Chinese nation. The first stage is to occupy our Northeast four provinces.

The Tragic Encounter of Compatriots in the Northeast

Japanese people with knowledge can carefully and calmly look at how our people in the Northeast four provinces have been living for the past eight years? In summary, in politics, your Kwantung Army wields the autocratic power of life and death. Our compatriots can only obey and cannot speak. In economics, the large businesses of Chinese people have all been occupied, and many farmers' land has also been confiscated. Our compatriots have completely lost their freedom in law in everything related to trade, production, residence, and transportation. Not to mention political rights and educational rights. In these eight years, I don't know how many good people have been killed arbitrarily. The most cruel thing is that they can kill for no reason, based solely on anger, and call it ideological corruption. Simply put, just because they don't like the way someone looks, they should be killed. Speaking of education! It's even more chilling. Your ancestors of the Yamato nation, in the past two thousand years, once enthusiastically read Chinese history and gained a lot of lessons or experiences. Now your warlords are asking our people in the Northeast to forget Chinese history. Isn't this a kind of repayment? In short, your warlords completely do not regard our people in the Northeast as human beings who should live equally, but completely regard them as lowly and damned slaves. Now they only want them to do hard labor and serve, and in the future they want to make them poorer and more foolish, and finally destroy and oppress them to the point of self-destruction.

The Vicious Conquest Policy of the Japanese Warlords

The crimes of your warlords enslaving the peoples of East Asia, if described in detail, cannot be exhausted in 100,000 words. But I think it is not necessary to describe it in detail, because I believe that the Japanese people with knowledge must know more and deeper than we do. Now I will only explain one main point, that is, what are the consequences of this extremely bad conquest policy for all nations? What impact does it have on Japan itself? First, from the first part, the possible results are indeed very terrible. Because the purpose of this policy is not only to destroy the country, but also to destroy the nation. In other words, even if they are willing to be people of a fallen country, they cannot survive. The most basic element of the survival of a nation is economic freedom; the policy of the Japanese warlords is precisely to reduce the economic freedom of the oppressed nations. Taking our people in the Northeast as an example, if this continues, in a few years, they will be completely reduced to coolies and serfs. After the invaders monopolize industry and commerce, the people's livelihood is only left with agriculture, and the ownership of the land is gradually eroded or confiscated, and the agricultural products of farmers cannot be sold freely, and agricultural products must be sold cheaply, while all daily necessities must be bought back at high prices. This kind of layer-by-layer exploitation, big and small, will completely make ordinary farmers lose their fields and fall into the situation of serfs in a few years. What we are most heartbroken about is that under this policy of Japan, the people of East Asia will gradually become poorer and more foolish, and finally tend to perish. And the foolishness mentioned here is not simple foolishness, but stubborn and shameless foolishness, because the Japanese military and administrative authorities encourage stubbornness and shamelessness in education and administration. They want to make the conquered people only know how to fear Japan, the more shameless the better, the more bad things they do the better, and the more they lose their moral concepts the better. The purpose is to make the people a mass of loose sand, father and son not conspiring, friends not helping each other, only knowing how to kneel to the strong and beg for their lives. In short, the Japanese warlords want to teach the East Asian nations to completely lose the moral concepts of Eastern culture and become a complete slave society. And the Japanese warlords are not at ease with this, and they want to add drug policies and prostitution policies. Because they are jealous of the fact that some of these conquered people still have assets, and they are afraid that these people will have different ideas because of boredom and pain, so the first thing your army does in the places it occupies is to reward or force people to smoke opium, heroin, and opium, and at the same time encourage prostitution and gambling. This is to teach these conquered masses to get poor and die quickly, and at the same time, use the power of drugs and prostitution to anesthetize and soften these people, so that they forget their country and nation, forget everything, and have no energy and spirit to extricate themselves from the darkness. Your warlords' policy, from one point of view, can be said to be clever; but from another point of view, it is really pitifully ignorant.

One of the Japanese Warlords' History of Failure

Please take a look at the impact of Japan's own lowly policies. Then you can know that the ones that suffer the most in the future will be Japan itself! Japan's policy, in a nutshell, is to forget its roots; people who forget their roots are bound to fail. Japan, China, and other East Asian nations were originally equally backward countries from the perspective of modern Western scientific civilization; while Japan's Restoration was half a century earlier, your warlords became arrogant and thought that they were the only superior race in Asia, and regarded other races as inferior races. This is really easy to fill because of its smallness, without the demeanor of a great country. The Chinese Revolution and the Japanese Meiji Restoration are two major events for the East Asian nations, but the Japanese warlords only boast about themselves and obliterate China, regarding China as something that can be annexed like Korea. However, China is a little bigger, so they think that if they use a hand-eating method and divide it into several times, they can continue to annex it. Therefore, the first step is to occupy the Northeast four provinces, and the second step is to invade Hebei and Chahar provinces, thinking that they can succeed without a fight by relying on Japan's military force. Even if China resists, it is very easy to eliminate China's resistance. That's right! The Japanese military experts are very precise in calculating the number of flying cannons. They calculate that China cannot beat Japan, and there is indeed a scientific reason for it. It's just a pity that they can calculate everything, but they haven't calculated people's hearts. They have only read half a century of Japanese Restoration history, at most some Western science books and war history from the past few centuries, and they have unexpectedly annihilated the 5,000-year history of China, which your ancestors have read thoroughly, negated the authority of Chinese national culture, and the development of the Chinese revolution in recent decades. With that little bit of military knowledge, they think that military force is omnipotent, and all problems in the world can be solved arbitrarily. They don't know that what really befriends the world is the power of moral culture, not human cannons and airplanes. Objectively speaking, it is really a misfortune for the Japanese nation! I can point out that your warlords have never had half a point of respect and love for China and other East Asian nations; they will annex whatever can be annexed; they will invade whatever can be invaded. For many years, there have been differences in the speed of progress towards China, but the reason for their slow progress is still calculated from a military perspective. They are polite to the United States and the West, but not to us. Just think, forty years ago, because of the interference of other countries, they returned Liaodong to us. If there was no interference, would they be willing to do so? In fact, they wanted to occupy Beijing at that time. China was really scattered and unable to strengthen itself in the late Qing Dynasty. Under the protection of the balance of power of the powers, Japan did not dare to be unique because of its lack of wings. Therefore, after the Russo-Japanese War, it still returned Southern Manchuria to China. However, as soon as the war started, it immediately took out the Twenty-One Demands. Therefore, the speed of the Japanese warlords' aggression against China completely depends on the international situation. In other words, they are always calculating the comparison between Japan's military force and the military force that the powers can use in East Asia: at the Washington Conference, they calculated that they could not defeat Britain and the United States, so they limited the scope; while the September 18th Incident was because they relied on the progress of their navy, and saw through that Britain and the United States would not unite, so they used poisonous hands. In short, the policy of your warlords to conquer China is consistent, and the speed of implementing their policy is completely calculated based on their own military force and the attitude of Europe and the United States. They have never placed the rights and dignity of this great Chinese nation itself into the calculation. This can be said to be extremely foolish and there is nothing more to add.

The Chinese Nation Fights for True Peace in East Asia

I can tell you clearly that in the past few years, since our Hebei and Chahar provinces have been threatened several times, the Chinese nation has really lost heart with Japan. Our entire army and nation have indeed recognized Japan and recognized ourselves. We all know that unless the whole country unites and struggles to the end, we will really perish as a country and a race. We will not allow ourselves to be slaves of the invaders, and we will not allow the honor and glory of our ancestors to be ruined in our hands, and for our descendants to become a group of poor, foolish, and shameless slaves. At the same time, we have the confidence to know that as long as we unite and struggle, we will be able to shatter the ambitions of the Japanese warlords and finally bring the Japanese nation back to the bright and correct path. We Chinese of this generation are determined to stand up and take responsibility for expelling this great scourge of the East Asian nations, because we deeply know that only the Chinese nation can bear this responsibility. Our ambition is to save China, save East Asia, and save Japan. Japanese people, think about it, you have established your country in East Asia, but you despise the East Asian nations. This has damaged your own foothold first. How can there be good results? The Chinese nation has already made the determination to never yield and never perish. We will make progress every month we fight, and we will make progress every year we fight. To be honest, after two years of war of resistance, China has not only strengthened its spiritual strength and become more unified, but it is also making progress in military affairs every day in practice. Your warlords want to eliminate Chinese military force in order to implement their ambitions to destroy China. They can't do it no matter what. On the contrary, we are confident that we will be able to shatter the delusions of the Japanese warlords and establish true peace among the East Asian nations.

The Actual Commanders of the Japanese Government

Japanese people, evil must be repaid with evil. All your current suffering is the evil repayment of your warlords' policies, and you are only beginning to suffer it now. To what extent you will suffer in the future is really unimaginable. Fundamentally speaking, your warlords want to make the East Asian nations lose their freedom, and the Japanese people have also lost their freedom. You can't take advantage of anything in the world. You invaded and occupied our Northeast and gained advantages, which quickly caused military discipline to decline and evolved into a mosquito bureau of military dictatorship. Your country today is only a group of arrogant and ignorant young military officers who are controlled. The major policies are decided by the military, but in fact they are controlled by a group of young military officers. This group of people is ambitious but has no knowledge, and there are many opinions and factions. Therefore, the result is that those who sing the highest tunes of aggression gain more power. The actions of your country are actually guided by these very few arrogant warlords, who are seizing power and doing all kinds of evil. There is no national system or discipline. The cabinet is just a rubber toy in the hands of these warlords. They can only listen to their manipulations. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident two years ago, after the war started, your newspapers have already proudly admitted that it was a planned action... War is a major event, but your people are only passive, listening to the arrangements of a few warlords, and contributing their property and lives. They also need to sing the praises of the military at all times, and they are only allowed to sing the praises, not to oppose. If they show a little doubt, they will be imprisoned and tortured. In the past two years, haven't the thousands of Japanese intellectuals who have been arrested and imprisoned by military police, and the so-called ideological criminals in our Northeast four provinces, been in the same situation? This kind of situation, to be honest, is not surprising. But look at your original elders and ministers, who have made special contributions to the prosperity of Japan. They stand on the position of planning for the country, but their attitude is only slightly more cautious, and the warlords feel that they are an obstacle and immediately send people to kill them, just like slaughtering dogs and pigs, without any scruples. Moreover, the people who planned and initiated the killings are not subject to legal sanctions at all. The situation of the great figures is still like this, and of course you ordinary people are even more like fish and meat on the chopping board, no different from slaves.

The Japanese Warlords Attempt to Challenge Europe and the United States

The characteristic of your warlords' thinking is that they absolutely do not admit their mistakes. If they are wrong, they hate others, and then they plan to eliminate others. In the past few years, they have not admitted their mistakes in invading China, and they hate China's resistance. Now, after two years of attacking without achieving their goal, they have become angry out of shame and hate the European and American countries. Of course, the ambition of your warlords is not limited to anti-British, but the first step at present is to express anti-British. Because they have calculated it again. Britain has many affairs in Europe, so they will deal with Britain first, and temporarily shelve the United States, which has the Pacific Fleet, as a second step to defeat them separately. They claim that this trick is very clever, but in fact it has long been seen through by the world, and they have forgotten that the countries concerned have common interests and a common position. Japanese people should know that the international policy of your warlords, in a nutshell, is to abandon agreements and break faith. The relations between various countries and China are bound by the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's invasion of China is Japan abandoning agreements and breaking faith. It is natural for major powers such as Britain, the United States, and France not to agree with Japan and to adhere to the position of the Nine-Power Treaty. The Soviet Union is not in the Nine-Power Treaty, but due to the relationship of the League of Nations, its position is completely the same as that of Britain, the United States, and France. These countries respect Chinese sovereignty and do not agree with Japan's aggression. This is only the natural behavior of the international community. However, the Japanese warlords hate all countries and want to eliminate the legal interests of all countries in China under the treaty. This is of course a major provocation to the world. The trend is serious and it is impossible to ask. The Japanese rulers have recently been advocating the "New Order in East Asia." You must understand that the content of the so-called New Order is to conquer the Republic of China and exclude all countries at the same time. Invading China requires war, and expelling other countries also requires force, of course. You can calculate how many strong men and how much military force Japan has? There is a Chinese proverb: "A blind man riding a runaway horse is like going to a deep pool in the middle of the night." You Japanese people willingly follow and allow the blind military to drag the Japanese country to a deep abyss and gallop. Since the September 18th Incident, the real situation in Japan is completely like this, and the root cause of all the endless disasters that the Japanese people are suffering and will suffer is due to the Japanese warlords' thought of despising the East Asian nations. If you don't wake up, you will definitely regret it one day!

### The Situation of the Wimbledon Women's Singles Final is Set: Mabel and Stammers Compete for the Championship; American Players Tend to Win All Five Championships

(Wimbledon, 7th) Yesterday, the weather was alternately sunny and rainy, and the wind was also strong, but the tennis competition continued to be held. The women's singles finalists have been revealed, and the veteran French player in the men's doubles has been defeated. Therefore, according to London's prediction, American players will win all kinds of championships in men's and women's singles and doubles and mixed doubles. The details of each situation are compiled as follows:

### Miss Stammers Defeats Mrs. Van Ryn

The women's singles quarterfinals have also been held. British lady Stammers defeated Mrs. Van Ryn of the United States with 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 in the quarterfinals yesterday, and won the right to play in the final.

This is the first time for Stammers to enter the Wimbledon final. She is the only British player in the men's and women's singles who is still eligible to compete in recent days. Her successive victories have brought some comfort to the general British audience who were disappointed with Austin.

In the first set, Mrs. Stammers immediately took the lead with two to zero, but Mrs. Van Ryn was also quite calm, launching a continuous offensive to create a tie of five to five, but was eventually won by Mrs. Stammers for two consecutive games, and won the victory in the first set.

In the first set, Mrs. Van Ryn took the lead with a score of four to zero. Mrs. Stammers also quickly pulled back two games, but eventually lost with a score of two to six.

In the third set, Mrs. Stammers played very well. After a tie of three to three, she won three consecutive games and won the final victory.

Due to the rain, the game was stopped three times in the middle. The total game time was one and a half hours.

### Mabel Has High Skills and Wields Freely

In another women's singles quarterfinal, Mabel (USA) faced Mrs. Sperling (Denmark). Mabel's technique was obviously much higher than her opponent's. In 20 minutes, she won with two light sets of 6-0 and 6-0. Mrs. Sperling's skills were not her match. She rarely won more than two points in any game. According to calculations, Mrs. Sperling lost only nine points in the first set and only five points in the second set. The competition was absolutely one-sided, which is also a rare miracle in the final stage of Wimbledon.

### Women's Doubles Enter Quarterfinals

In the third week of women's doubles, Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Travis (UK) eliminated Mrs. Hardwick and Mrs. Skynner (UK) with 6-3, 3-6, 8-6. However, in the fourth week, Mrs. Brown's team lost to seeded players Mrs. Nicole and Mrs. Nachar (UK) with two sets of 2-6, so they still failed to enter the semifinals.

Mrs. Nicole and Mrs. Nachar will compete with Mrs. Jack White (USA) and Mrs. York (UK) in the quarterfinals after eliminating Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Travis. The results of the other group's semifinals are still unknown.

### Mixed Doubles - Unexpected Result

The last pair to enter the mixed doubles semi-finals was Keulen and Madame Gremis Tustot (Belgian), who defeated the French team of Bauses and Miss Tingluding by a score of 6-4, 1-6, 6-3. This was also an unexpected result.

### Men's Doubles Exciting - Famous American Players Victorious

In the men's doubles quarter-finals, one pair was Corky and Riggs (American) versus Borotra and Brugnon (French). The latter two are renowned veterans in doubles, known for their endurance, earning them the nickname "taffy." However, Corky and Riggs were both finalists in this year's men's singles. Their technique was superior, and their partnership was particularly seamless. As a result, the French veterans had to concede defeat with scores of 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. This match was very exciting and was one of the most outstanding matches of yesterday's competition.

### British Players - Enter Semi-Finals

In the men's doubles semi-finals, Hale and Wilde (British) defeated Pansek and Mitic (Southern), with a result of 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. This team will compete against their fellow countrymen, Olive and Shieres, for the right to play the American team in the finals.

### Five Championships - America May Sweep

The outcome of the tournament is becoming increasingly clear. The men's singles championship will definitely go to America. Of the two remaining players in the women's singles, one is the British Miss Stanmers and the other is the American Miss Mabel. According to predictions from London, Mabel's chances are stronger than Stanmers'. In the men's doubles, Corky and Riggs are also likely to defeat the winner of the match between Olive and Shayers versus Hale and Wilde to win the championship.

In women's doubles, Mabel and Madame Van Ping are undoubtedly one of the most outstanding pairs in the world, and winning the championship is inevitable. As for mixed doubles, the final will definitely be between Riggs and Miss Mabel versus Ki and Madame Van Ping. Regardless of which team wins, it will undoubtedly be "an American victory."

From this perspective, America will sweep the championships.

### China After the War of Resistance

— Soong Ching Ling

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's first two principles were to strive for national independence and the establishment of democracy. His third principle, the Principle of People's Livelihood, was to improve the living conditions of the Chinese people. In our country, an agricultural nation, the land problem is naturally extremely important. Mr. Sun believed that cultivators should own their land. For the stage of industrial development after political unification, he set the policy of national control of resources, railways, and public utilities, and national regulation of private enterprises. However, this was not to suppress, but to encourage private enterprises to develop within certain limits to suit the needs of national economic construction. Although this progress is still insufficient, in today's War of Resistance, we see that Mr. Sun's economic ideals have begun to be realized. Many places have abolished land rent and taxes, and wasteland is being reclaimed. Our wartime construction is being carried out under the promotion of the state and is organized along democratic lines through organizations such as industrial cooperatives. After the War of Resistance, we anticipate that China's economic development will be in a form where all parts of the nation can share in the benefits.

Many people, either out of malice or ignorance, smear the united front of the Chinese nation with vivid red colors. They should clearly understand that precisely because this national united front represents the genuine common effort of all parties, all national minorities, and all classes towards the goal of national liberation, the Three Principles of the People, which was initially recognized as the program of this common action, has become the true foundation of the united front policy. The Three Principles of the People is a program for national independence and democratic revolution. Within the scope of this program, the principle of private property will not be attacked or abolished. The only inevitable thing is the confiscation of the property of traitors and collaborators.

The same is true for foreign capital. China welcomes foreign trade and investment as long as any country is willing to help China's construction. During his leadership of the Kuomintang, Mr. Sun repeatedly stated that China will strive to promote economic relations with all countries willing to interact with China on the basis of equality, non-aggression, and sympathy for China's desire to improve its international standing.

However, we must tell our friends without concealment that the development of the national united front work in the country currently has serious weaknesses. The main reason is that a small number of conservatives still do not deeply understand the ideals of Mr. Sun's three major policies, and either overtly or covertly use various excuses to be unwilling to strengthen national unity. The implementation of the program for resisting Japan and building the nation cannot be consistent in word and deed. Therefore, the political democratization that should accompany the development of the War of Resistance has not only failed to develop in an orderly manner, but in some places and to some extent, the scope of democracy has shrunk instead. This will not only have adverse consequences for mobilizing the entire people to participate in the War of Resistance but will also make it difficult to eliminate the humiliating thoughts of betrayal and surrender by Wang Jingwei. This is a serious phenomenon in our internal affairs. I believe that our comrades who are loyal to Mr. Sun's ideals will certainly make great efforts to overcome these shortcomings. Otherwise, what guarantee is there for the final victory of the War of Resistance? These phenomena of disloyalty to the national united front and restrictions on the development of democratic politics are not only detrimental to the future of China's War of Resistance but also have no future for the protection of the interests of democratic countries in China. Because insufficient internal unity and slow political reform will inevitably gradually weaken the strength of the War of Resistance, leading to futile hopes for peaceful truce and a path to certain failure. At that time, all the interests and rights of democratic countries in China will also be completely swept away by Japan due to the failure of our War of Resistance midway. Therefore, I hope that everyone will pay close attention to the stubborn elements in democratic countries who, using the pretext of worrying about the spread of communism in the Far East, advocate compromise, mediation, or peace negotiations with China. This activity is not only detrimental to our China's determination to resist Japan to the end but is also a foolish act of sacrificing the interests of democratic countries in China. Hasn't Japanese imperialism already ordered Wang Jingwei to publicly advocate peace and oppose communism? Isn't it also simultaneously coercing the Shanghai Public Concession, blockading Tianjin and the Chinese coastal ports, and forcing democratic countries to sacrifice all their rights and interests in China? Isn't it openly carrying out anti-British movements everywhere? The so-called international mediation is only promoting the development of the aggressor's ambitions and is at the same time an unwise move for democratic countries to destroy their own Great Wall in the Far East.

It is undeniable that the current national war of resistance in China, from the perspective of safeguarding the interests of the democratic world, is an important part of the worldwide struggle between democratic and anti-democratic countries. This is by no means an idealistic slogan. The most practical people in democratic governments, like the US government, especially the naval authorities in Washington, should clearly understand this. Repelling the Japanese on the Chinese front is also protecting the democratic system in the Americas. As far as I know, in the recent Iirna meeting, American isolationism has expanded from its own country to the entire Western Hemisphere. I insist on relying on the solidarity of the world's democratic forces, and I believe that these friends of yours in the United States will also practice well the traditions of democracy and internationalism promoted by Jefferson and Paine. The July 7th Incident happened precisely between July 4th (American Independence Day) and July 14th (French Revolution Day), simultaneously symbolizing these two revolutions, because the current Chinese national war of resistance, spurred by the events after the July 7th Incident, is fundamentally similar to the French Revolution, which overthrew the old system, and the American Revolution, which liberated the American colonies. Unless one-fifth of humanity, China, can be granted national equality and freedom, China's latent great productive forces will not be liberated, and the whole world will not be able to benefit from it. This illustrates that China's current national revolution is necessary and inevitable.
