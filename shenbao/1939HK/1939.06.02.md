### The Role of Japan's Attack on the Soviet Union

Since Japan yielded in the fishery agreement issue, Soviet-Japanese relations had been relatively peaceful for quite some time. However, recently, using the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia conflict as an opportunity, Japan seems to be making a mountain out of a molehill again. In addition to instigating the puppet "Manchukuo" to issue serious protests to the Soviet Union and Mongolia, the Japanese cabinet also held a cabinet meeting to discuss this issue, and reported it specifically to the Emperor. On the other hand, it has launched propaganda campaigns in the media, doing its utmost to provoke the Soviet Union. However, we cannot overlook the internal and external functions of Japan's renewed challenge this time. Here is a brief analysis:

(1) Responding to the international actions of Germany and Italy. The main role of Japan's challenge to the Soviet Union this time is focused on diplomacy, and its most important significance is to respond to Germany and Italy. In theory, Japan is bound to join the German-Italian military alliance. The reasons why it has not yet joined are: (A) to ease the increased vigilance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union against Germany, Italy, and Japan; (B) to ease the conflict between Japan and Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East. However, the development of the international situation has made the cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France a concrete and unstoppable trend. In recent days, the cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France has entered a new stage, and a mutual assistance agreement between the three countries is already under negotiation for signing. Germany and Italy are somewhat alarmed by this situation, and Japan is taking this opportunity to make a gesture of attacking the Soviet Union to please the two countries and make them believe that Japan is still determined to act as their policeman in the Far East.

(2) Japan's pretense of attacking the Soviet Union also has the effect of alienating Britain and France from the Soviet Union. Aggressors often see through Chamberlain's hesitant weaknesses, believing that Britain would not dare to rashly conclude a mutual assistance alliance with the Soviet Union, further offending Germany, Italy, and even Japan. This completely exploits Chamberlain's psychological inability to absolutely trust the Soviet Union. The reason why Britain is concluding an alliance with the Soviet Union is, of course, because of the Soviet Union's military strength, especially the magnificent superiority of its air force, which will be sufficient to contain and destroy Japan in the East in a future war. Therefore, Japan has recently been desperately promoting in the puppet "Manchukuo" border's air battles how many Soviet aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft, how many aircraft, it wants to reduce Britain and France's trust in the Soviet Union. At the same time, it also wants to divert the attention of Britain, France, and the United States by exacerbating the Soviet-Japanese dispute. On the other hand, Italy is also promoting the idea of Britain convening a four-power conference, attempting to arouse Soviet suspicion of Britain and France, and alienate the Soviet Union and Japan. Japan's challenge to the Soviet Union is by no means accidental.

(3) Japan's challenge to the Soviet Union also has another internal function, which is to suppress the "harmony with all nations" proposition of the elder statesmen faction. The elder statesmen faction advocates reconciliation between Japan and other countries in order to save Japan's international isolation. However, what they emphasize is the relationship between Japan and Britain, the United States, and France, so they strongly oppose the reckless actions of young officers towards Britain, the United States, and France. Because of the setbacks in the military invasion of China, young officers need a new development of the situation. The recent attacks on third-country concessions in China and the detention of ships are examples of this. However, reckless actions against Britain, the United States, and France not only encountered strong protests and strong opposition from Britain, the United States, and France, but also deepened the opposition of the elder statesmen faction. Therefore, the young officers changed direction and challenged the Soviet Union, with the same intention: to strengthen Japan's tough stance towards third countries and shift the attention of the elder statesmen faction to Soviet-Japanese relations. The elder statesmen faction sees clearly the fundamental contradiction between the Soviet Union and Japan, opposes the reckless actions of the young officers, and advocates perfunctorily dealing with Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, after the regular cabinet meeting on the 30th, Arita immediately went to the Imperial Palace to meet the Emperor.

Now, Japan has launched a media campaign to expand propaganda about the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia conflict. The "Asahi Shimbun" even considers the incident to be the aftermath of the Outer Mongolian purge, calling it the Second Changkufeng Incident; the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" even says that "the Soviet Union is playing with fire" and that Japan cannot tolerate it and will take decisive action. To what extent this threatening gesture will be played out is still impossible to make a concrete judgment, but the most important point is that Britain, the Soviet Union, and France should have a deeper understanding, just as the opinion of the general public in London, "At this time when the Axis countries are obstructing in every possible way, the most effective way is to establish a three-nation agreement as soon as possible."

### The War of Resistance and the Chinese Revolution

— Liu Yangzhi

Our War of Resistance against Japan this time is undoubtedly a revolutionary war. If we misunderstand this meaning, or do not understand this meaning, then, whether in theory or in practice, we will go in a direction contrary to the War of Resistance, and finally, we will passively or actively obstruct the War of Resistance. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front are resisting the invasion of Japanese bandits with their flesh and blood. Their difficult, arduous, loyal, and courageous emotions have been fully expressed; but in the rear, the general atmosphere is still one of drunken stupor, living for pleasure, and corruption everywhere. Why is this? This is because of incorrect thinking, which leads to the degeneration of life. Furthermore, what is the reason for Wang Jingwei's recent reckless declaration and his tail-wagging plea for peace with the Japanese bandits? It is also due to erroneous thinking, which leads to reactionary actions. And this kind of corruption of life and reactionary actions are all due to erroneous thinking, a failure to understand the revolutionary nature of this War of Resistance, a failure to realize that the War of Resistance is a revolutionary war. On this point, Chairman Chiang has already clearly pointed out at the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress. He said: "This Sino-Japanese War is an unavoidable battle in the process of the National Revolution" (see Chiang Kai-shek: The War of Resistance Against Japan and the Future of Our Party, Central Weekly, Vol. 1, No. 18). This means that this War of Resistance is a revolutionary war in the process of the National Revolution. Moreover, he went on to say: "One does not know that this Sino-Japanese War is not an ordinary international war, but a revolutionary war in which the Chinese nation seeks freedom and equality in order to complete the National Revolution" (see the same source). Here, we can further understand what kind of revolutionary war this War of Resistance is.

Two

The purpose of the National Revolution is none other than seeking internal unification and external independence, just like the national revolutions of Germany and Italy in the 18th century, which, on the one hand, resisted the invasion of foreign capitalism, and, on the other hand, were internal self-reforms. That is, the invasion of foreign capitalism in Germany and Italy caused internal reforms; because of internal reforms, modern national states were established. The purpose of the national revolutions in European countries was like this, and the purpose of the Chinese National Revolution is also the same. Therefore, our National Revolution is a national revolution, and the stages of our national revolution are, first, seeking internal unification, and second, seeking external independence.

The Chinese National Revolution, from the Northern Expedition to the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, can be said to have consistently belonged to the first stage of seeking internal unification. Now, resisting the invasion of Japanese imperialism is the second stage of seeking external independence. However, the purpose of seeking internal unification is to seek external independence, because only by fighting for the survival and independence of the nation can internal unification be completed. Therefore, we cannot mechanically divide these two stages; we must treat them in an organic and methodical manner.

Japanese imperialism deliberately sought to destroy China. It has already been decided in its continental invasion policy. Therefore, the Chinese revolution of the past twenty-odd years has been hindered by Japanese bandits everywhere. For example, when the National Revolutionary Army reached Nanjing in 1927, it used the Nanjing Incident as an excuse to incite various countries, wanting to divide China. After this plan of the Japanese bandits failed, they changed their approach, wanting to monopolize it. And the method of monopolization that was most beneficial to it was none other than the plan of nibbling away, gradually invading our territory and dividing our country. Therefore, when the National Revolution reached Jinan in 1928, it implemented sending troops to Shandong, using violence to obstruct it, creating the Jinan Massacre. The purpose of its creation of the Jinan Incident was to prevent the northward advance of the revolutionary army's forces, not to give China unification. After the recovery of Peiping and Tianjin and the change of flags in the three northeastern provinces, the policy of the Japanese bandits nibbling away at China suffered a great blow. And, seeing that partitioning was not successful and nibbling away was not working, the Japanese bandits instead became even more reckless, recklessly and hastily invading China, thus creating the September 18th Incident. Since September 18th, in these seven years, the Japanese bandits' invasion of China has truly been getting an inch and wanting a mile, without end. Having invaded our Northeast, they then intruded into our North China. Japan's intention to follow the steps of nibbling away to achieve the complete annexation of China has become obvious, and our nation, on the one hand, is seeing its survival become increasingly precarious, and, on the other hand, internal unification is gradually coming to an end. Therefore, with the occurrence of the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, we resolutely and decisively mobilized the strength of the entire nation, resolutely and seriously resisting the invasion of the Japanese bandits. And our War of Resistance against Japan is a war to resist Japanese imperialism, and its purpose is to fight for the survival of the nation. It is obvious that our War of Resistance is a national revolution, that is, a revolutionary movement in which we liberate our nation by overthrowing the invasion and oppression of Japanese imperialism. In other words, this War of Resistance against Japan is the second stage of the Chinese national revolution, a war to seek external independence, and a second revolutionary period of the National Revolution. Therefore, the Japanese bandits fear the success of our initial revolution and the great strength of unification, so they launched a large-scale invasion to eliminate our strength and destroy our country. However, because of the Japanese bandits' active invasion, we have instead shortened the time of our initial revolution and strengthened the strength of our second revolutionary period. In other words, this national revolutionary War of Resistance against Japan, because it is a continuation of the initial National Revolution, already has the foundation of the initial revolution, and undoubtedly, final victory belongs to us.

Three

Our national revolutionary War of Resistance against Japan, whether in terms of the natural environment or in terms of manpower and material resources, already possesses the advantage of victory. But in the course of this revolutionary war, what is our revolutionary way out?

The Three Principles of the People are now the guide for the Chinese revolution, which no one can deny. And the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, what it indicates is the direction of the Chinese revolution: first, to enable the Chinese nation to survive and be independent. So-called national independence is to build a unified and modern national state. Therefore, the revolutionary process of the Three Principles of the People is, on the one hand, to end feudal society, and, on the other hand, to establish capitalism. But this so-called capitalism is different from the capitalism of Europe and the United States, that is, the capitalism of the Three Principles of the People is state capitalism, not private capitalism. Mr. Sun has already clearly said: "Today, merely regulating capital in China is still not enough to solve the problem; it is necessary to add the creation of state capital in order to solve it." He also said: "What is meant by creating state capital? It is to develop national industries." However, the establishment of state capitalism is not the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People revolution. The process of the Three Principles of the People actually contains three practical stages, that is, on the one hand, to negate feudal society through state capitalism, and, on the other hand, to negate capitalism by realizing the Great Harmony of the World, that is, the establishment of socialism.

Now that China is in a situation of active invasion by Japanese imperialism, our revolution naturally has national survival and independence as its sole purpose. But the experience of the War of Resistance against Japan tells us that, in order to achieve victory in the War of Resistance, a protracted war and a long-term war are indispensable. In order to implement the strategy of a long-term war, it is necessary to increase production. We must know that developed production is now the basis of the War of Resistance and the condition for a protracted war, and this developed production is what Mr. Sun said, "developing national industries," which is "creating state capital," which is also the process of practicing capitalism. Therefore, the Kuomintang, which is practicing the Three Principles of the People and leading the War of Resistance, must, in this era of the War of Resistance against Japan, have a planned and methodical way of making it state-owned. But in order to increase wartime financial resources and material resources, private capital can still be allowed to operate under the principle of state-owned enterprises. And this activity of private capital is not simply developing private capital; on the contrary, it is increasing the financial resources and material resources of the country, and assisting in the creation of state capital. Therefore, the declaration of the Kuomintang's National Congress said, "This War of Resistance is for the survival of the nation and the clan, and the interests of the nation and the people are greater than the interests of the individual. We must take the interests of the nation and the people as the common goal." This has determined the principle that the interests of the nation and the family are above all else in the stage of revolutionary war. At the same time, it also said: "During the War of Resistance, regarding economic construction, the government must implement a planned economy based on the tenets of the Principle of People's Livelihood. All undertakings that are suitable for state operation shall be raised by the state with capital and engaged in operation, so as to make them tend towards rationalization of production, and it must be controlled and coordinated, and set an example. Those that are in the form of private enterprises shall be run by private individuals at their own expense, and shall be developed in a beneficial way under the guidance and encouragement of the government under the overall plan of the state." Originally, China's private capital was very fragile. With the Japanese bandits' arbitrary destruction in addition to this, the so-called private capital has become even weaker and more powerless, while state capital is bound to grow day by day with the use of the Four Banks and the advancement of internal and external debts. In the economic law that large capital absorbs small capital, China's revolution, in its path towards capitalism and even its establishment, will never repeat the mistakes of European capitalism, and then reach the stage of socialism after another major bloodshed. In short, the Chinese revolution is to avoid the painful bloodshed of the capitalist revolution, that is, to end the feudal forces in the country and resist the invasion of Japanese imperialism by practicing the process of capitalism, and to use it as a means to achieve the goal of socialism. If we misunderstand this point, or do not understand the particularity of China, or are trapped in the error of mechanical theory in terms of method, and think that class struggle and proletarian revolution will still occur after the Chinese revolution, the Kuomintang, which is leading the War of Resistance, has already clearly pointed out the error in the declaration of the Provisional National Congress. It said: "Before the War of Resistance, the economic situation in China did not yet have the possibility of class struggle. During the War of Resistance, with everyone hating the enemy with the same hatred, class struggle is even more intolerable. After the victory of the War of Resistance, based on the planned economy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, the ideal of common ownership, common governance, and common enjoyment has already been close to realization, and there is even less need for class struggle." This is an established fact, and it is also a future fact. The Three Principles of the People's Chinese revolution is advancing based on this historical process.

The national revolutionary War of Resistance against Japan is the inevitable process of the Three Principles of the People's Chinese revolution. Our insistence on the War of Resistance is an insistence on revolution, and our efforts in the War of Resistance are efforts in revolution. Therefore, in this stage, advocating compromise, degenerating in life, and acting passively are all traitors to the nation and reactionaries of the revolution. In order to ensure that the War of Resistance will be victorious and the nation will be built, we only have to use the spirit of revolution and the means of revolution to remove all obstacles to the revolutionary war.

### Understanding the United Front of Chinese Youth (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent Report from Xi'an

After the start of the War of Resistance, there were hundreds of small groups of young people in Wuhan, each with only dozens to hundreds of members. In order to commemorate the December 9th Movement, the more active Student Anti-Japanese Support Association of Wuhan University, the Fellow Students Association of Wuhan University, the Association of Exiled Students from North China, and the Anti-Japanese Education Research Association, together with small groups such as the Amateur Choir, the Qunsheng Choir, and the Jianyou Society, and students from various universities and middle schools, established the December 9th Commemoration Preparatory Committee. The December 9th Commemoration Conference was successfully held, and the Youth National Salvation Corps, which occupied an important position in the anti-Japanese work of young people in Central China, was thus born. The United Front work should not let go of any small opportunity for unity in action. Jointly holding discussion meetings, tea parties, welcome meetings, and memorial services are all forces that promote organizational unity. Organizational unity also needs to be gradual.

The unified New Life Promotion Association, the unified Zhongshan Hall, the unified Zhongzheng Room, and the unified National Revolutionary Room are all helpful for further unified organization.

Fifth, for the United Front to succeed smoothly, it is necessary to pay attention to the mutual cooperation between the upper and lower levels. All United Front work must be carried out with the assistance of the government or other upper-level figures. Even if it is misunderstood by some local authorities at times, it is necessary to use persistent and tireless efforts to turn misunderstanding into understanding in the end. On the other hand, it is impossible without a mass base at the lower level. This kind of empty United Front work, no matter how beautiful it looks on the surface for a while, will always be difficult to do any practical anti-Japanese work, and it will collapse sooner or later.

Sixth, in order to enrich the mass base of the United Front at the lower level, there must be appropriate improvements in the lives of young people. Only by relieving the suffering of the vast majority of young people as much as possible, generally improving the cultural and educational level of young people, and seriously protecting the various legitimate rights of young people can we consolidate the vast United Front of young people and consolidate the strength of the War of Resistance. Now, the lives of young people in Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces are already in the process of being improved, so the anti-Japanese forces of young people in these provinces are also relatively strong.

Seventh, the United Front must increase its vigilance against traitors and intensify the struggle against them. Because young people lack experience, they often mix into the ranks of young people to reverse right and wrong and create friction, which greatly hinders the work of the United Front. The main slogan of Japanese imperialism now is the so-called "anti-communist extermination of the party," so the main activities of traitors are also nothing more than opposing the Kuomintang, opposing the Communist Party, and opposing Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. However, different methods need to be used to deal with different types of traitors. Some are deceived and used, and these people can still be won over; some are major traitors, who are leaders, and they have already lost their qualifications to be Chinese and are absolutely hopeless. These people need to be severely punished.

Eighth, for some bad people who specialize in destroying youth unity, we cannot but pay attention to preventing and dealing with them for the sake of youth interests and anti-Japanese interests. Those few worst, conscienceless bad people, neither heaven nor earth nor the law nor human sentiment can tolerate them, and we cannot tolerate them either. If you tolerate them, or even help them, they will not tolerate you at all. They will use your tolerance and help to turn around and harm you. If you cannot eliminate obstacles, obstacles will come to eliminate you, annex you, and destroy you. The United Front is not completely without struggle; on the contrary, it develops from carrying out various necessary struggles. By carrying out this necessary struggle, first, we can make the masses understand that we are truly upright, benevolent, and righteous, and understand that those bad people are really evil thugs who are only afraid that the world will not be in chaos, and that they must be attacked by the masses. Second, it can also make these bad people, or get justice after all, and know that the human world will not allow them to run rampant, and that the youth United Front is a force that cannot be lightly humiliated or violated, so they will change their minds. Third, even if they are still unrepentant and willing to be at odds with the majority of people, they have to fail on their own because they are abandoned by everyone. Ninth, we must work harder to overcome various erroneous tendencies in our own youth.

One erroneous tendency is the tendency of closed-doorism and sectarianism. Their manifestations are: unwillingness to specifically analyze the objective situation at that time and place; unwillingness to patiently and humbly cooperate with the vast majority of young people outside their own group or other youth groups; only loving their own group and looking down on other groups; only taking into account local interests and neglecting the interests of the whole; only being obsessed with some beautiful and empty nouns, slogans, and articles, being arrogant, conceited, self-satisfied, not integrating with the masses, not trying to adapt to the environment, not going to work to review and learn, not having the great capacity to accommodate dissidents, not having the spirit of democratic work, and so on.

Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young people do not respect the living habits of farmers in the countryside, but wear straw sandals in the city to show their progress.

Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young officials donated money from a county magistrate to start a newspaper. On the first day, they criticized the county magistrate who donated the money in this newspaper. (Laughter)

Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young people in Shanxi must not establish a National Revolutionary Room, but must establish a National Salvation Room; when it is necessary to establish a National Revolutionary Room, the words "National Revolution" are written on the outside, but the inside is still for the National Salvation Room. (Laughter) Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some youth mass organizations stipulate that the procedures for participation must be introduced by how many people, fill out how many forms, swear to abide by how many harsh laws, and must be reviewed and approved by leadership agencies at all levels, all the way to the approval of the highest leadership agency.

Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young people in Shaanxi even openly pointed out that the slogan of defending Shaanxi is a traitorous slogan, because the government is already defending Shaanxi, and the youth's proposal of this slogan is to doubt the government, which is "traitorous," and they may even be beaten.

But there is another tendency that is also extremely dangerous, that is, the tendency of surrenderism. Unprincipled concession is surrender. If we do not adhere to the correct principles of the United Front, and do not adhere to the correct principles that national rights, civil rights, and people's livelihood are inseparable, then it is shameful surrender. If we do not adhere to the exemplary role and critical attitude of the advanced, and do not adhere to our noble ideals and noble character, then it is shameful surrender. If we are afraid to carry out the necessary struggles with the forces that hinder our work, and waver when we see difficulties and dangers, and waver when we see fame, fortune, and the temptation of the opposite sex, then it is shameful surrender. We must resolutely oppose the tendency of surrender in the same way as we oppose closed-doorism and sectarianism.

We should thoroughly launch the struggle against closed-doorism, sectarianism, and surrenderism among the vast majority of young people. We should carry out systematic United Front education and various correct political theory education among the vast majority of young people. We should use all methods to cultivate the great courage and integrity of our young comrades. Our young people should be able to respect others, and at the same time, they should also be able to respect themselves. We must have the spirit of working together in harmony, and at the same time, we must also have the spirit of "a commoner cannot have his will taken away" and "a scholar can be killed but not humiliated." Only in this way can the future of the United Front be truly consolidated, and only in this way can there be hope for the future of our nation.

(Speech by Feng Wenbin)

### Fierce Battles Unfold Along the Xiang River Bank; Successful Pursuit in Northern Hubei Yields Significant Gains; Enemy Troops Stir and Suffer Losses Near Dongting Lake

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 1st] The enemy has invaded Central Hubei again, but the overall situation is under our control. According to a telegram from Shashi, a certain unit has approached the outskirts of Zhongxiang City. The enemy is stubbornly resisting with reinforcements, and the fighting is fierce. The enemy's attack on Yuekou was intercepted by us, and those invading Qianjiang have been surrounded and are being annihilated. Near Luohansi and Duobaowan, our troops are engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Two enemy regiments that launched a fierce attack on the Shangjiadian line a few days ago were engaged in a bloody battle for five days and nights, and more than a thousand enemy soldiers were annihilated by us. The Jiangxi front is quiet, and we have achieved successive victories on the shore of Dongting Lake in northern Hunan. More than 500 enemy soldiers in the vicinity were killed, with over 200 killed by us.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guilin, 1st] The momentum of our guerrillas near Guangzhou is growing daily. The enemy is transporting supplies to Henan. Fierce fighting is taking place near Niushan in Xijiang, where we have the upper hand and are currently attacking Jiangmen. More than a thousand enemy troops in Beijiang set out from Fengyong and opened up Huanshan Tou yesterday. We attacked them from multiple locations, and they retreated in disarray. The puppet army unit of Li Daoxuan suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by us. The remnants retreated to Jinxi.

Hubei-Henan Front

[Reuters Shanghai Dispatch, 1st] According to a Chinese report, the Chinese army in northern Hubei began an offensive yesterday, making significant progress. It is reported that the Japanese army is now retreating towards Yingcheng and the Pinghan Railway, abandoning a large number of heavy military equipment. It is estimated that over 100,000 Chinese troops are fighting in the Han River area.

[Haitong News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] According to local newspapers, the Hunan-Hubei lines are quiet with no major battles, but there are occasional small skirmishes. Currently, the Chinese army is making every effort to attack Zhongxiang in an attempt to recapture it. The city and its suburbs have been surrounded by the Chinese army on three sides. However, because the highway from Zhongxiang to Jingshan is still in the hands of the Japanese army, they are currently able to send reinforcements to defend it. At the same time, there are still a large number of Japanese troops near Tianmen and Yuekou. Some believe that the Japanese army, which retreated from Dahong Mountain to Xinyang and Anlu, will attempt a large-scale attack on Xiangyang once they receive reinforcements from the rear. However, this speculation has not yet been confirmed.

[Central News Agency Yichang Dispatch, 1st] There have only been small skirmishes on the main Han-Yi road front in recent days. Our army is actively operating east of the Han River. The enemy that invaded Qianjiang a few days ago has now been surrounded by our army, and Yuekou is also under our combined attack.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhengzhou, 1st] Our army is still active near Kaifeng. Yesterday, we bombed the enemy's ammunition depot east of the city and attacked the Liubeikou station on the Bianxin Road, capturing fourteen puppet workers. A part of the enemy in Taikang harassed Lecheng and the Wangtian Li area, but were severely attacked by us and fled to Zhangtianzhuang.

Northern Hunan Front

[Central News Agency Miluo Dispatch, 31st] The extremely tense situation in northern Hunan is currently focused on the original front line. Since the 21st of this month, in retaliation for our army's repeated attacks, the enemy dispatched a brigade of troops and attacked the north bank of the Xinqiang River in four routes: One from Matang attacking Tangjiapai, Yanjia Mountain, and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway; one from Xinkaitang attacking Qinggangyi and Longwanqiao along the ancient road from Yueyang to Xinqiang; one from Linxiang attacking Gengkouchaoxieling and Gantian along the ancient road from Taolin Xitang; and one landing from Dongting Lake at Matang to attack our front. All of these attacks have entered a state of chaos. The fierce fighting lasted until dusk. Except for the attack on the Gengkouchaoxieling route, where a small number of enemies sneaked across the north bank of the Xinqiang River and approached Xian'anqiao, all the others were repelled. On the 23rd, the enemy's full-line offensive suffered setbacks. Only Xian'anqiao was successful. They then focused on attacking Gengkouchaoxieling and Gantian on our right flank. Our army on that flank, relying on the favorable terrain obtained from Yue and Yu, waited for the enemy's offensive to gradually weaken before descending the mountain and engaging the enemy in a close-quarters bayonet fight, winning another major victory. The enemy collapsed completely. On the 31st, they changed their attack again to Tangjiapai and Yanjia Mountain on our left flank, but were once again defeated by a company of our troops in that area with ten times the enemy's strength, creating an unprecedented battle example since the start of the war. On the 25th, the enemy did not dare to continue the attack, as they were reorganizing their remnants all day. On the 26th, the enemy again divided their forces to attack our two flanks, focusing their attack on Tangjiapai and Yanjia Mountain on the left flank, attempting to break through at one point, but were still defeated by us. The line returned to silence on the 28th. As for the enemy ships that came from Dongting, they were suppressed by our firepower, making it difficult not only to achieve their landing attempts but also unable to get close to the shore. In total, the results of a week of fierce fighting showed that the enemy suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and we also suffered considerable sacrifices. We also captured many spoils of war, which are currently being inventoried. The enemy's offensive was originally intended to force our army on the north bank to withdraw south and "mop up" our guerrilla base. After a week of bloody battles, we have shattered their plan. The enemy is now consolidating their strongholds and strengthening fortifications, and are still in a passive position.

[Haitong News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The Yueyang front in northern Hunan is also very quiet, as the Japanese army's attempts to cross the Xiang River have been driven back to the north bank. It seems they will abandon the offensive plan. According to Chinese newspapers, fierce fighting took place in the eastern suburbs of Yueyang, where over 500 Japanese soldiers were killed and the Chinese army captured 20 machine guns. This is indeed a great victory for the Chinese army in that area in recent months. Japanese warships in Dongting Lake have shelled Huarong several times and sent troops to land, but have never succeeded and have now ceased operations. According to military observers, since the Japanese army suffered a major defeat in the offensive in northern Hubei, it is difficult to predict the operational plans of the Japanese army in Hunan and Hubei. However, due to the silence on all fronts, no change in the war situation can be foreseen in the shortest term.

Shanxi-Suiyuan Front

[Central News Agency Yulin Dispatch, 30th] Since our unit launched guerrilla warfare last month, in addition to sabotaging railways and highways, it has also used swift action to attack the enemy's weaknesses. The enemy feels a major threat. Railway stations and key points on highways are only defended by heavy troops and mechanized units. In order to avoid the strong and attack the weak, we have advanced and retreated on multiple routes in the area between Taolin and Wuchuan north of the railway. In a few days, we have completely eliminated the enemy there and made contact with a certain cavalry unit of ours in northern Suiyuan. We are now making every effort to organize and train the masses, unite local guerrillas, and expand the guerrilla base.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Xi'an, 1st] Four enemy squadrons that invaded eastward from Quwo in southern Shanxi engaged in fierce fighting for days near Nanchang Town south of Yicheng, killing more than 1,000 enemy soldiers, including their regimental commander. The transportation near Jiexian has been completely destroyed by us. We captured Tumen, and a certain unit once attacked the outskirts of Linfen, killing many enemy soldiers.

[Central News Agency Xingji Dispatch, 31st] There have been no major engagements near Xijing recently. The power lines in Hongdong Ba'an are often sabotaged by us. The local guerrillas north of Jishan have been successful, and the enemy's invasion of the countryside has been significantly hampered. The enemy's invasion of Zhangquan and other places in Zhaocheng suffered heavy losses from our guerrillas. Hundreds of enemy soldiers from Jingle invaded Yu County on the 21st and were engaged in a stalemate in the suburbs for a day and night, before finally defeating the enemy on the evening of the 22nd.

### Important Talks Held by British, American, and French Ambassadors in Shanghai

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 31st] The British, American, and French ambassadors to China arrived in Shanghai one after another. They paid friendly visits to each other on the evening of the 29th and the morning of the 30th, and held talks at the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. According to sources in Shanghai, although the talks were not in the form of a meeting, their nature was very important. The naval commanders of the three countries also had close contact.

### Measures for Implementing Standard Time in Various Regions

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch] Regarding the measures for implementing standard time throughout the country, the Ministry of Interior previously convened relevant agencies for discussion and decided that the Academia Sinica would be responsible for providing the time signal daily, and the Central Broadcasting Station would broadcast the report using both long and short wavelengths. All regions will implement it starting from June 1st. It is learned that the time reporting measures are as follows: (1) The national time is divided into five time zones: (A) The Central Plains Zone (i.e., Shanghai time) is based on the time at 120 degrees east longitude. (B) The Jinshu Zone (i.e., Chongqing time) is based on the time at 105 degrees east longitude. (C) The Huiqiang Zone is based on the time at 90 degrees east longitude. (D) The Kunlun Zone is based on the time at 82.5 degrees east longitude. (E) The Changbai Zone is based on the time at 127 degrees east longitude. During the Anti-Japanese War, all regions of the country will temporarily use the Longshu Zone time as the standard. (2) The Central Broadcasting Station will report daily at 3:00 AM using longwave with a frequency of 1200 kHz, call sign (XGOA), and shortwave with a frequency of 11900 kHz, call sign (XGOY), so that radio stations in various regions can receive and calibrate the time. Reports will be made at 6:00 PM (same frequency and call sign as above) so that listeners throughout the country can receive and calibrate the time. Reports will be made at 9:00 PM (same frequency and call sign as above) so that listeners overseas and in Southeast Asia can receive and calibrate the time. (All times listed above are based on the Central Plains Zone time).

### Consistent Stance of British, American, and French Ambassadors on Kulangsu Issue; Enemy Claims Improved Situation in the Area

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] According to Shanghai sources, the enemy claims that the submarine telephone cable between Xiamen and Kulangsu was cut by the British Taikang Foreign Company's steamship Anshun. The Japanese Consul General lodged a strong protest with the British Consulate at 10:00 AM on the 31st of last month. However, according to foreign sources, the British, American, and French ambassadors and the commanders of the Far East fleets are currently gathered in Shanghai to discuss the Kulangsu issue and will definitely take a consistent stance. Even if the enemy protests on the spot, they may not get what they want.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Japanese newspapers, the Japanese authorities and various diplomatic consuls have compromised on the issue of reforming the Kulangsu Municipal Council and have adopted a conciliatory attitude. Japanese Consul General Uchida visited the British and French consuls general separately for informal talks. The situation at the time was quite harmonious. Uchida then visited the Director-General of the Kulangsu Municipal Council, and both sides seemed to have begun to hold substantive negotiations on the five points proposed by the Japanese side.

### Japanese Demand Extradition of Cheng Case Murderer from British in Tianjin; British Embassy Military Attaché Detained by Japanese in Chahar

[Reuters Tokyo Dispatch, 1st] According to reports arriving here from Tianjin, Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Tanaka Hikogoro, sent a note to the British Consul General there, Jamieson, yesterday, demanding that the assassin who killed Cheng Xigeng, the puppet superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, be handed over to the Japanese authorities before noon on June 7th. Cheng was assassinated in a movie theater in the British Concession on April 9th. The Japanese side claims that the British authorities have not yet given a formal reply to the Japanese demand for the extradition of the murderer.

This time, he was detained by the Japanese side when he passed through the Japanese army's position.

### Puppet Troops on Hainan Island Suddenly Mutiny

[South Route Express] The enemy implemented a sinister plan to use Chinese to control Chinese on Hainan Island, instigating the traitor Zhang to organize puppet troops. Many ignorant people were deceived into enlisting. After being given short-term training by the enemy, they were sent to various battlefields to fight. It was found that the first batch of more than 200 people was transported to Guangzhou in early May and distributed among various infantry units for replenishment. The second batch of more than 300 people was also continuously transported in mid-May. However, on the night before departure, they suddenly mutinied and mostly dispersed. Although the enemy tried to intercept them in all directions, it was ineffective.

[Xuwen Express] Although most of Hainan Island has ostensibly fallen, in reality, the enemy only forcibly occupies certain cities and towns. Our army and guerrillas are still distributed in the suburbs, tightly controlling the enemy and launching counterattacks at any time. The enemy is very afraid. It was found that on the 21st and 22nd of May, our troops attacked and entered Haikou again. At around 6:00 AM on the 21st, our guerrillas rushed to the outskirts and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Then, as the enemy sent in large reinforcements, we retreated due to being outnumbered. At around 5:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd, we launched a second attack. This time, the arrangements were more thorough than before. A unit of plainclothes soldiers mixed into the enemy's airfield and burned dozens of cans of the enemy's gasoline. The enemy troops stationed in Haikou panicked and mobilized their entire force to search for us in an encirclement. As our objective had been achieved, we made a planned withdrawal. In this battle, more than 20 enemy soldiers were killed, and we also suffered minor injuries to several people. Two brave men sacrificed heroically. The enemy's defenses are now very strict. Also, when we were in fierce fighting with the enemy, clear artillery fire was heard in Xuwen, Beihai.

### Enemy Assists Pirates in Disturbing Chao-Shan; Plots to Establish a Puppet "Overseas Chinese Army"; Bribes Fishermen to Spy on Our Military Situation; We See Through the Treachery and Take Precautions

[Shantou Dispatch] The enemy attempts to occupy Chao-Shan with three parts military and seven parts political, (1) carrying out large-scale bombings to threaten our anti-Japanese spirit, (2) secretly sending traitors to infiltrate Chao-Shan to secretly establish forces to shake the social order, (3) bribing coastal fishermen to corrupt the military strongholds in various ports and bays from within. Our authorities see through their treachery and formulate precautions against it. Various counties and cities are expanding propaganda to strengthen the belief in resistance and deepen the common hatred of the enemy. The military, police, and civilian night meetings held in Shantou every week are used to blend the emotions of the military and civilians and to instill military and civilian political education, which has achieved obvious results. The coastal counties and cities such as Shantou, Chaoyang, Huilai are currently very active in purging the henchmen. Dozens of important traitors have been arrested in Shantou in the past half month and are being interrogated at the Garrison Command. The Raoping County Self-Defense Brigade recently surrounded and arrested bandits on the Fanzhou Houao sea and rescued six kidnapped people. They also seized the wanted bandits Chen Chai, Chen Shaozong, Lin Bing, Lin Shuangping, Huang Lin, and Zhang Yiming at the Jingpo boat. Initially, the crimes of the gangs were considered to be their first offenses. However, after being questioned by Huang 行署主任 Zeng Yeshi, it was discovered that there was a background of Japanese incitement. It has been reported that there have been times when bandit ships smuggled military ammunition from overseas into the Tuolin Haishan area. These people now have a conspiracy to establish a so-called "Overseas Chinese Army." Chen Zhuo, the magistrate of the county, has been informed of the report and has ordered his subordinates to take strict precautions. As for the enemy ships near the coast, they have been using both inducements and threats against our fishermen, saying that those who can exchange military intelligence for gold will enjoy the freedom to go out to sea for fishing, otherwise they will be killed without exception. Our authorities have also paid attention to this and are planning to actively strengthen the fishermen's will to resist the Japanese. The Fishermen's Advancement Association and the Fishermen's Advancement Team in various counties have recently been ordered to step up the organization of fishermen, and the coastal police have been ordered to strictly control the departure of fishing boats.

Starting from Xijing, I went east to Tongguan to inspect the Yellow River defense line; I went north to Yan'an to visit and participate in the achievements of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in resisting Japan and building the nation; and I listened nearby to the vivid strategies and tactics of our regular army and guerrillas in Shanxi working together, as well as the various "Post-Enemy Work" that our heroic soldiers and civilians are vigorously carrying out in other occupied areas - the only conclusion I have drawn from this coincides with what Chairman Chiang pointed out early in the spring when describing the characteristics of the second phase of the War of Resistance: "Changing from defense to offense, and turning defeat into victory." From the opposite perspective, the recent continuous bombings by enemy aircraft of our rear areas, such as Yichang, Fuzhou, Chengdu, and Nanzheng, especially Chongqing, the birthplace of resistance, are wanton acts of burning, bombing, and killing. This is a vicious act by the enemy to cover up their military failures (including the northern and southern battlefields), and it is also a reflection of our "changing from defense to offense, and turning defeat into victory" on the front line! Please see: These few articles that will continue to be published are practical materials that directly or indirectly answer this question.

### Chiang Ting-wen Discusses Northwest Military Affairs

— Special Correspondent on the Front Lines, Geng Ya

We know that the advantage of the Northwest's resistance against Japan, and the dividing point of the situation, lies in whether the hundreds of thousands of National Army troops in Shanxi can maintain their strength for a long time? Can it advance from maintaining its current state to a counter-offensive stage? If so, it will hold the advantage; otherwise, it will be at a disadvantage. This is an immutable principle. Because of the importance of Shanxi's position in the North China resistance, from the Niangziguan Pass eastward along the Zhengtai Railway, it can attack Shijiazhuang; and going north along the Pinghan Railway, it can attack Beijing, and southward it can attack Wuhan; from the Xuangmuguan Pass northward along the Tongpu Railway, it can recover Datong, and then advance eastward and westward along the Ping-Sui Railway, it can attack Chahar and Suiyuan and threaten the Puppet Manchukuo. As for its shielding of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and defending Sichuan and Australia, its significance is no less than the former. Looking back on the Shanxi war results of the past fourteen or five months (counting from the fall of Fenglingdu on March 17th last year), the enemy's so-called "mopping-up battles," "crossing-the-river battles," "attacking Xi'an and Lanzhou," and "cutting off international Sino-Soviet transportation," etc., which they loudly boasted about time and time again, have all been completely shattered by our heroic soldiers one after another. Moreover, recently, good news has been frequently reported, and they (heroic soldiers) have further recovered many cities and towns. In this way, Shanxi, with its advantageous terrain and the general military and civilians in Shanxi who have armored up for war, can be said to have brought their greatest strengths and capabilities into full play.

However, if we want Shanxi to continuously increase its new strength, in order to accomplish its greater mission in the future: to eliminate the enemy's presence within its borders and recover the lost territories of Hebei and Chahar, then the Northwest provinces, especially Shaanxi, which is separated by only a river, must support it and assist it, so that all soldiers and materials have a constant source of supply, and then it can smoothly complete its great mission. Therefore, the historian and geographer Gu Zuyu said: "Shaanxi's existence is crucial to the safety and stability of the nation." Now we can say it more realistically: "Shaanxi's existence is crucial to the victory or defeat of the Northwest war situation."

Since Shaanxi's position is so important, are its current preparations sufficient to shoulder this major mission? I think this is a question that everyone is closely concerned about. For this reason, I went to visit Generalissimo Chiang Ting-wen, Commander of the Xth War Zone and concurrently Chairman of Shaanxi Province - we had originally met in Zhangzhou, Southern Fujian, before the war. After meeting once, we became more familiar. This time, the conversation was very straightforward. His first sentence, "getting straight to the point," grasped the core of the issue and provided a powerful answer. He said:

"The purpose of the Northwest's military preparations at this stage is not only to consolidate the Northwest, but also to prepare for a counter-offensive against North China. A counter-offensive against North China is also a way to consolidate the Northwest. These have a mutually reinforcing effect. Of course, we must strive to make full achievements in reality!"

"To defend the Northwest and counter-attack North China, we must make full achievements in reality." These words, "appropriate and natural," coming from the mouth of General Chiang, who is solely responsible for the Northwest, are truly enough to boost our anti-Japanese sentiment and whip at the invading ambitions of the Japanese.

"Shaanxi has been divided into war zones, and all political facilities are moving in great strides along a bright path that coordinates with the needs of the war of resistance." Chiang, with his calm speaking manner, seemed to have left the high seat of "Commander-in-Chief" and was sitting leisurely in the position of "Chairman of Shaanxi Province" to speak: "In terms of economic resources, we can also support a long-term war of resistance. Daily necessities for people's livelihood, such as grain and fuel, can be self-sufficient. If there is a shortage, it can be imported and supplemented by Sichuan and Ningxia provinces. The production of cloth and cotton is particularly large. In addition to consumption in the province, it can also be exported to Sichuan in large quantities. War refugees are constantly coming to Shaanxi from the Longhai Railway. The Anti-Japanese Support Association is providing relief, and we do not feel any great difficulties. This is also because the daily necessities are locally sourced and readily available. In particular, last year's cotton and wheat harvests were unprecedented in nearly ten years. The Yellow River did not freeze in winter, which strengthened our river defenses. This spring, the rain and snow were well-distributed, which foretells another bumper harvest. Such favorable weather conditions year after year will certainly help enhance our national defense capabilities.

"The Northwest has a vast territory, and the front lines stretch for hundreds of miles. Regarding transportation, although automobiles and gasoline are sometimes scarce, the Northwest has horse-drawn carriages, ox-carts, and thousands of camel caravans. If we organize and utilize them well, we can still cope with military transportation with ease." The reporter often encounters such large military transports of vehicles and horses on the ground. I once thought that if we could have a high-altitude view of the Northwest, we would definitely be able to see on major highways such as Xi'an-Lanzhou, Xi'an-Yulin, Suiyuan-Ningxia, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Gansu-Xinjiang a constant stream of vehicle and horse transport teams, like ants moving house, bustling along. Sometimes, there are also beetle-like cars, speeding in between, working equally hard for the country's troubles. What a great and beautiful wartime military transportation picture! However, if this picture were to be presented to those who "don't give a damn about national affairs" and to traitors and national criminals, it would be a cold and ironic cartoon, because it would make them deeply feel a sense of inferiority!

"Regarding the issue of soldiers, Shaanxi Province has already conscripted tens of thousands of soldiers, but the people have always enthusiastically enlisted without any complaints." Chiang continued, pleased with himself: "For example, in the model conscription experimental zone of Nanzheng (Hanzhong), there are strong men who could not be selected by lottery, and they even jointly submitted a written request to the county government, asking them to be allowed to enlist early and fulfill their desire to kill the Japanese. Also, cities such as Xi'an, Tongguan, Yulin, and Nanzheng have been repeatedly bombed and ravaged by Japanese aircraft, causing heavy losses to the lives and properties of some civilians, but the general anti-Japanese sentiment has been boosted by the bombing, and the confidence in victory has become stronger with each battle.

It turns out that the Three People's Principles, the traditional spirit of the Sanqin people, who have been brave in public warfare since ancient times, has been promoted and developed today to attack the Japanese invaders' attempt to invade the west. This is not an extravagant hope that transcends reason, but a natural product of the marriage of history and reality.

"Furthermore, speaking of the geographical environment of Guanzhong: the Yellow River is a natural barrier, and it is a fact before our eyes. It is really difficult for the Japanese to fly over it. If they use the old trick of Han Xin and Liu Bang entering Guanzhong, they would first seize our strategic location in western Henan, then go north to Luoyang, or west to Jingziguan, and then join forces in Guanzhong. However, using the Luoyang route, there is the obstruction of Mount Song; going west to Jingziguan, there is the danger of Mount Funiu. It is more suitable to defend than to attack, even more so than the Yellow River's natural barrier. Assuming that the Japanese really have a large force and concentrate their attack on the Yellow River or any other route for three or four months, and do not pay a heavy price, and are lucky enough to break through and enter, Shanxi has hundreds of thousands of our troops pressing hard on its tail in the rear, constantly threatening and cutting off its connection. As a result, it will inevitably solve that batch of isolated troops that have gone deep into the distance completely.

"The Japanese naturally deeply feel the greatness of the threat of our army in Shanxi. They cry and shout slogans such as 'mopping up' and 'sweeping away.' But we have already added a large number of reinforcements to the border defenses, and launched attacks on the remnants of the Japanese on all fronts, putting them separately in a passive position. Therefore, the military strategy of the Northwest, which aims to protect the Northwest and counter-attack North China, is not only based on subjective necessity, but also has objective conditions for success."

Finally, judging from the recent avalanche of good news from the northern battlefield, it shows that Chiang's great theory of "defending the Northwest" and "counter-attacking North China" is gradually evolving into gratifying facts there.

### Molotov's Speech: The Soviet Union Earnestly Aids China, Intolerance for Japanese Provocations on the Border, Negotiations with Britain Continue

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st] People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, delivered an important speech to the joint session of the Nationalities Council and the Council of the Union of the Supreme Soviet at 7:00 PM today (local time), mentioning the draft of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement proposed by Britain and France, stating that although its content is further advanced than the previous proposals of those countries, the Soviet Union is still not satisfied. He also mentioned relations with Japan, saying that the Soviet Union has a mutual assistance treaty with Outer Mongolia and will definitely protect it. He also mentioned relations with China, saying that Stalin once stated that the Soviet Union is willing to help countries that have been invaded, and in the case of China, we have earnestly done so.

[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in a speech last night, addressed border issues, stating that the countries involved should know that the Soviet Union will not tolerate Japanese puppet troops provoking on its borders. We must warn them that this also applies to the borders of the Mongolian People's Republic. In accordance with the mutual assistance agreement signed with the Mongolian People's Republic, we consider it our duty to provide the necessary assistance to that country in order to maintain its borders. We attach great importance to the matters stipulated in the mutual assistance pact signed by the Soviet Union. I now warn again that, in accordance with this pact, we will resolutely defend that border, just as we do our own country. The Japanese claim that the Mongolian People's Republic has invaded Japan is absurd and ridiculous. Our patience is also limited, and this is what should be recognized today. Japanese puppet troops frequently violate the Soviet-Mongolian border and should be stopped immediately. We have already issued this warning to the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union. Speaking about the Soviet Union's attitude towards China, Molotov continued, "You are familiar with Stalin's declaration regarding assistance to countries that have been invaded and are fighting for national independence. This declaration now fully applies to China, which is fighting for national independence. We are constantly implementing this policy." Molotov also stated that this is fully in line with the Soviet Union's work in Europe to unite peaceful countries to form a common front against aggression.

[Reuters, Moscow, 31st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech in the Soviet Parliament today, expressing that there are still some points to be reserved regarding the suggestions of Britain and France, as they are sufficient to make the tripartite agreement ineffective. He stated, "The Soviet Union insists that the tripartite agreement must be of an absolute defensive nature, guaranteeing all the neighbors of the Soviet Union, and a substantial mutual assistance agreement when any signatory country is attacked. "The Soviet Union thoroughly advocates uniting all peace-loving countries to resist aggression, but we must keep in mind the warning issued by Stalin, that is, we cannot let ourselves pick chestnuts out of the fire for others." When Molotov spoke to this point, the representatives cheered thunderously. Stalin, Voroshilov, Litvinov, and other members of the Politburo also joined in the applause when Molotov declared that the Soviet Union absolutely insisted on equality, lasting for five minutes. Molotov continued, "Our position has reached the ranks of the leading powers." He also said that the recent suggestions of Britain and France have recognized mutual responsibility, "This is indeed a step forward," but he further pointed out that the Baltic countries have not yet been guaranteed, because the Soviet Union cannot bear any responsibility for those who remain neutral but are unable to defend their neutrality. Molotov said that negotiations with Britain are still ongoing, "Once we insist on our point of view, this is not necessary to discuss with anyone else. Aggressor countries have long recognized the Soviet Union's foreign policy, that is, to oppose aggression, while democratic countries have only recently recognized this. We have recently witnessed a change in Britain's attitude, and therefore accepted its request to conduct negotiations." During Molotov's speech, he extensively condemned aggressor countries, and also mentioned the improved Soviet-Italian relations. He said, "We never refuse to improve our trade relations with Germany." The Soviet-German commercial negotiations that were previously conducted, although temporarily interrupted, now show signs of resumption.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st] People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, made a speech this evening, the main points of which are as follows: Regarding the issue of the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the original suggestions of Britain and France were not based on the principle of equal reciprocity, so the Soviet Union was not satisfied. Although the latest suggestion has been based on mutual principles and is more advanced than before, the various reservations attached to it make the so-called progress still superficial. In addition, if the three small neighboring countries to the northwest of the Soviet Union (probably referring to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) are invaded in the future, and are not strong enough to resist, can Britain and France assist the Soviet Union and protect them together? This question is not explicitly stipulated in the Anglo-French draft. Although our country loves peace and supports resistance to aggression, we are determined not to be used by others, as stated by Stalin beforehand. As far as German-Soviet commercial negotiations are concerned, although they have failed at this time, they may still be resumed in the future, especially in the anti-aggression struggle, our country's commerce should stand at the forefront. As for the Soviet Union and Poland, bilateral relations have been improved, because last year we entered the alliance, and this year we re-signed a commercial agreement to develop trade relations. As for the issue of the fortification of the island of Oland in the Baltic Sea, the armaments that can be placed on that island may be largely used to the detriment of the Soviet Union. This issue should not exclude the Soviet Union. At this point, Molotov explained the conditions advocated by the Soviet Union regarding cooperation with Western European countries as follows: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should conclude a truly effective agreement; (2) Britain and France should provide guarantees to all neighbors of the Soviet Union, regardless of their affiliations; (3) The agreements among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should stipulate mutual assistance measures to resist aggression. Then he mentioned the alliance treaty between Italy and Germany, saying that this treaty belongs to the nature of aggression, and Italy and Germany may incite aggressive wars. In the past, the so-called need to fight against the Comintern is no longer mentioned. Observing the provisions of the German-German alliance treaty, it does not involve the anti-Comintern pact, then this alliance is clearly aimed at the democratic countries. At this time, appeasement should no longer be discussed. Our country does not sympathize with the aggressor countries at all. On the contrary, we believe that the truth and the real situation should be made public, and should not be decorated and concealed, otherwise it will only benefit those who are unwilling to curb aggression. At this time, Britain has established a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, and the Anglo-Turkish agreement will be established. Britain and France are conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union, which shows that the attitude of Western European countries has been improved. If these countries can prove their sincerity in resisting aggression, then the Soviet Union will naturally be willing to establish an agreement with them, but it is also unwilling to be exploited by others. In short, our country should protect its own interests and the general interests of peace, and we also know what to choose between empty words and facts. After Molotov finished his speech, all the parliamentarians cheered and praised, and it lasted for a long time. At this point, the third regular meeting of the Supreme Soviet was declared closed.

### Impression of London: Although there are differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union, they are only formal and not substantial

[Reuters, London, 1st] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has just learned that London has now received the full text of Molotov's speech. The British official impression of this speech is that the differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union are formal rather than substantial. The importance of this formal issue cannot be stated until the Soviet government receives an actual reply from the British side. As for the part related to the League of Nations, it is believed that countries that so enthusiastically support the principles of the League of Nations will not have any serious differences of opinion. Regarding the Baltic countries and the issue of guarantees, Britain believes that every country has the right to safeguard its territorial integrity and independence, and all acts of aggression are abhorred by Britain.

[Reuters, London, 1st] This morning's newspapers published opinions on Molotov's speech, generally believing that the speech did not hinder the final and satisfactory conclusion of the anti-aggression agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The Times and the Daily Telegraph closely noted the points of concern of Molotov, namely (1) the connection between the Anglo-French proposal and the League of Nations Covenant, and (2) the status of the Baltic countries. The Times stated, "Although the British and French governments seek the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, this is not to say that the agreement to be established should be hindered and damaged by any consultations with the members of the League of Nations Executive Council." The Daily News believes that the status of the Baltic countries is the most difficult outstanding issue, but this difficulty, although serious, is not insurmountable.

[Reuters, London, 1st] Today, the diplomatic correspondent of The Times declared that London's impression of Molotov's speech is that the differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union are only formal and not substantial. It is believed here that Moscow has an understanding that London is too confident that its subsequent proposals will meet all requirements. Molotov stated that before the final signing of the agreement, every point of view of the Soviet Union must be carefully considered. The impression here is that Molotov's speech did not mention that the conclusion of an agreement was impossible.

[Associated Press, London, 1st] The Daily News stated today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech "is really disappointing, because the opinion of one insider believes that in addition to some details that still need to be adjusted, the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has actually been completed." The Daily Telegraph stated, "Judging from Molotov's speech, some difficulties and misunderstandings have not been completely eliminated. The Soviet Foreign Minister expressed dissatisfaction because he was still unable to implement the principle of mutual response. His statement is to show that there are still some gaps between Britain and the Soviet Union, which must be filled before a final agreement can be concluded."

### France Remains Optimistic: Believes Agreement Will Ultimately Be Established; Difficult Points Can Be Discussed and Resolved

[Reuters, Paris, 31st] In Molotov's speech, he adopted a reserved attitude towards the recent proposals of Britain and France. Political figures in France are not alarmed by this. They believe that the agreement will ultimately be established. What remains to be discussed is only the details. The Soviet reply is expected to be received this Thursday and will be studied quickly and carefully. People here believe that there are two main difficulties for the Soviet Union with the Anglo-French proposals: (1) The mutual assistance agreement must be in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., the sanctions clause); (2) The Soviet Union hopes to provide protection to its Baltic neighbors. People here believe that it is not difficult to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet government on these two points, so the final conclusion of the agreement is only a matter of time.

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] Since Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered his speech, most newspapers here have expressed optimism about the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The Paris Morning News stated, "Although French officials announced that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have completely agreed on the various obligations involved, there will still be some opposition to the form of the proposed agreement." The Small Parisian Newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with Molotov's overemphasis on various points of difference, which are not fundamentally important. Madame Tabouis, in her article in the "Labor News," welcomed Berlotov's speech and predicted that the tripartite agreement could be signed within the next week. The News also stated, "The difficult point in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is the Baltic Sea issue. Although both sides still need great understanding and concessions, all issues can be arranged and discussed to seek a solution."

### Berlin Newspapers All Express Nazi Views; American Newspaper Reactions Are Surprised and Confused

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin Day] German political circles have not criticized Foreign Minister Molotov's speech, and the newspapers have only detailed the speech without expressing Nazi views.

[Reuters, New York, 1st] According to The New York Times, the first reactions here to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech were surprise and confusion. The newspaper also stated, "The question that Britain and France want to decide now is what else can they do?"

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] This place, "Rome People's News" criticized Molotov's speech today, saying, "The Soviet Foreign Minister's speech and decree were more powerful. Since Litvinov resigned, the actual situation of the British-Soviet talks has not changed. Since Halifax returned to Paris and Geneva, he has not abandoned any point."

### Members of the US Senate and House of Representatives are Actively Discussing the Neutrality Act; Amendment to be Completed Before the Recess of the Two Houses; Unanimously Call for Taking Some Practical Actions

[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] US Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at the request of Senator Borah today, submitted the neutrality bill plan he published last Saturday to the Foreign Relations Committee. The committee is scheduled to meet on June 14, and may begin discussion of the neutrality bill immediately after the meeting until some practical actions are taken. The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee is also scheduled to meet on Thursday.

[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] President Roosevelt arrived here at 8:25 this morning. According to leaders of the Legislative Branch, they will notify the President of the approximate date of the congressional recess. House Majority Leader Sam Rayburn said that the House of Representatives intends to adjourn around July 15, but two matters, the tax amendment bill and the neutrality bill, remain to be resolved.

### German Volunteer Soldiers Return Home: Reviewed by Göring in Hamburg; Italian Volunteer Soldiers Gradually Leave Spain

[Central News Agency, Hamburg, 1st] German volunteer soldiers who participated in the Spanish Civil War arrived in Hamburg yesterday. Accompanying them to Germany were three Spanish general-level officers.

[Reuters, Hamburg, 31st] German volunteer soldiers who recently returned from Spain were reviewed here today by General Göring.

### America Determined to Uphold Far Eastern Interests, Joining Efforts to Restore Balance of Power, Opposing Disruption of Open Door Policy

[United Press, Washington, 31st] According to authoritative sources, as a result of recent developments, the United States will ultimately participate in any effort to restore the balance of power in the Far East. Although most Western nations have passively accepted Japan's Monroe Doctrine in East Asia in the past, there are now signs that third countries (including the United States) will insist on their rights and not relax their grip when concrete final arrangements are made regarding land and commercial privileges. Foreign experts believe that the Gulangyu Incident is the most instructive example. This incident involved Japan undermining international conventions, and the countries concerned took joint action to deal with it. When Japanese troops invaded Gulangyu, the navies of Britain, France, and the United States carried out armed landings. Informed sources believe that the reason why Western countries concerned suddenly took this action was because they believed that the Gulangyu Incident would be used by Japan to test reactions to any future actions regarding the Shanghai International Settlement. Diplomatic circles here believe that after the end of the Sino-Japanese War, a final solution will be reached. Regardless of the outcome of this war, the sphere of influence in the Far East must be re-determined. Issues such as China's extraterritorial rights, public concessions, open door policy, commercial privileges, and Yangtze River navigation will be raised for international discussion. The United States will insist on its position. The general public in the United States has reacted favorably to the Gulangyu Incident, which shows support for the government's current Far Eastern policy. Experts believe that if Japan attempts to undermine the open door policy and extraterritorial rights, it will certainly encounter strong opposition from the United States.

### Japan Withdraws from the International Labor Bureau, Tokyo Branch Closed, Rumor is That It Will Establish Its Own Organization

[Tokyo, 31st] Japan today formally announced its withdrawal from the International Labor Bureau. The Tokyo branch of the International Labor Bureau closed yesterday. The Japanese chief of the branch made a statement, saying that the closure of the branch was not due to any discord with the International Labor Bureau, but was caused by the current international situation. Japan is now in an unavoidable situation and has no choice but to establish its own labor bureau.

[Geneva, 31st] After Japan announced its withdrawal from the International Labor Bureau, the chief of the bureau, Mr. Winant, issued a report, describing in detail the world situation of expanding armaments, stating: "If any country spends most of the income from free production on military expenditures and expansion, the standard of living will immediately decrease.

If the competition continues in this way, the national income will inevitably decline, and people with lower incomes will inevitably suffer from hunger."

The government has now appointed Lieutenant General Liddell to succeed General Ironside as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Gibraltar.

A brief commentary

### Molotov's Report

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reported on Soviet foreign policy at the Soviet parliament on the evening of May 31. First, he loudly warned the Japanese authorities about the provocation of the Japanese puppet troops against Outer Mongolia. Then, he clearly declared that the Soviet Union would actively implement aid to China. These two points are particularly noteworthy. They not only exposed the smokescreen of the Japanese puppet troops' provocation against Outer Mongolia, but also increased our infinite confidence and courage in insisting on united resistance against Japan. Moreover, they clearly declared that the Soviet Union's policy of maintaining peace and aiding invaded countries fighting for national independence is equally applicable to Europe and the Far East. This can be regarded as a major blow to the conspiracies of Japan and other countries to maliciously slander the Soviet Union and alienate the cooperation of democratic and peace-loving countries such as China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.

At the same time, Molotov solemnly stated the attitude towards the negotiations on the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. After acknowledging that Britain and France had made progress on their anti-aggression policies, he clearly pointed out the shortcomings and solemnly declared that "the Soviet Union can never be used as a cat's paw." Molotov's report gave a considerable warning to those who were generally empty, noisy, and optimistic about the anti-aggression front, and at the same time gave a blow to those who were maliciously pessimistic about the movement for Anglo-French-Soviet cooperation. We hope that Britain, France, and other countries concerned will recognize the serious situation of the fascist aggressors' active offensive, recognize that all opportunistic and even hypocritical policies will only increase the current crisis, and quickly take steps to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the same boat, trusting and helping each other, in order to sanction [illegible].

At 7:35, Ms. Liu Qingxuan, chairman of the Women's War Relief Association and organizer of the troupe, took the stage to deliver the opening speech amid thunderous applause. In addition to briefly reporting on the preparations, she also thanked all sectors of society. The original speech said:

Fellow compatriots, [illegible] is deeply troubled, the national crisis is in full swing, and there are more than millions of wounded soldiers and refugees. Relief work should be actively carried out. However, using limited money to run unlimited charities only increases the feeling of a drop in the bucket. Therefore, the charity performance organized this time is based on this broad relief as a starting point. At the same time, we have received enthusiastic support and enthusiastic participation from men and women alike. The formal opening is today. (He or she) sings a loud noise on the stage with effort, simply hoarsely, calling for wounded soldiers and refugees. Entertainment does not forget to save the country, which is our only slogan.

In addition to expressing my deep gratitude for the honor, I would like to pay tribute to all of you on behalf of the wounded soldiers and refugees in the country.

Famous Play "Diao Chan" Shocked the Audience

After the chairman's speech, the drums and music played loudly, and the curtain was raised. The famous play "Diao Chan," which promotes patriotism and eradicates traitors, is very suitable for today's public opinion of resisting Japan. Therefore, when Miss Pang Lian'ai, who plays Diao Chan, prays to heaven, "May heaven punish the traitors and not cause suffering to the living," the audience applauds thunderously. The atmosphere in the audience is extremely tense, and the sound of drums and music is almost covered. In terms of art, it is of course exquisite. At the same time, the audience's [illegible] mood of saving the country is surging. They all hold the indignation of "One day the Japanese bandits are destroyed, and we will perish together." The whole audience is moved. Before long, the applause gradually subsides.

Ms. Liu Qingxuan's younger brother, Sun Jun, plays Lu Bu, with a burly appearance. Not only is his gestures and movements like a dragon and a tiger, but his singing is also as loud as a bell, silencing the clouds. The rest, such as Li Juyang, playing Emperor Xian of Han, Li Zuojun, playing Li [illegible], Zhang Mingjun, playing Li Su, Ruan Qi'shu, playing the eunuch, and Miss Liu Ai'luan, playing the maid, also have wonderful performances.

### Funerals in Hong Kong

— Yu Lang

Funerals in Hong Kong are divided into old-style, new-style, and religious-style. Old-style funerals also vary depending on wealth. Poor people have a simple coffin, carried by four laborers, with two people playing the flute and drum, a "single flute," which looks very pitiful.

The rich, however, hold grand affairs, with extended processions, hundreds of cars following behind, the mourners traveling in a "car river" for the funeral procession, which looks very lively.

For middle- and upper-class families: the procession often includes several mourning pavilions, green pavilions, flower pavilions, two or three roadside offerings, a band of "Rudian music" – adding point music is grand music, each band costing more than ten dollars – or even a foreign band; a "Piaose" float, several foreign bands, monks, Taoists, and nuns in a procession; the "Path Clearing God" is over ten feet tall, a grand spectacle like a parade, taking a whole hour to pass, though these are becoming less common.

The funeral bands are the most mixed, with Western music followed by Chinese music, and also "Ma Bu Chui" (a type of wind and percussion ensemble), head gong, Beijing gong, and eight-sound percussion cabinet, creating a nonstop din, beating loudly enough to shake the town.

Each member of a Western band costs $1.20, and a standard band costs twenty to thirty dollars. They are not necessarily skilled musicians, and being out of sync is common, and in funerals, they often play tunes like "The Merry Widow," which is quite comical!

Of course, there are also very skilled bands, and military bands can be hired to perform, but the cost is staggering, not less than three hundred dollars per band, with specific times and included drinks.

Recently, after the fall of Guangzhou, the "Changjiao Museum National Orchestra" has flowed into Hong Kong, and perhaps out of novelty, funerals are no exception! This type of orchestra is very popular, and many people hire them. Each member costs $1.20, and a team of twenty or more people costs about twenty-four dollars.

New-style funerals mostly use a Western band, with a hearse carrying the coffin, going straight to the cemetery for burial, which is very simple and solemn.

These funeral vehicles vary in size and price, with smaller ones costing twenty dollars and larger ones thirty dollars.

Religious-style funerals are similar to new-style funerals, but often use horse-drawn hearses, and the filial sons do not wear mourning clothes; the burial is in a religious cemetery, without monks, but with a teacher praying.

Funerals in Hong Kong are different in that there are mourning sheds. Many living people in Hong Kong live in four- or five-story buildings, and when they die, they need to invite a carpenter to build a three- or four-story-high shed. This shed has a narrow, sloping path made of bamboo and wooden boards, used to transport the coffin, because coffins should not pass over thresholds; those living downstairs do not like the coffin passing in front of their doors or stairs; and at the same time, the sloping, narrow, dim, and winding stairs of Hong Kong buildings cannot realistically allow the coffin to be carried up and down. This type of mourning shed costs ten dollars per floor, i.e., ten dollars for the second floor, twenty dollars for the third floor, and so on.

The second point is superstition. When someone dies, that evening, Buddhist nuns, monks, or Nam Mo masters are invited to chant the "upside-down scripture," which costs more than ten dollars. Afterwards, every seven days, Buddhist nuns, monks, or Nam Mo masters must be invited to perform a ritual and chant scriptures; usually, the first, third, fifth, and last few "sevens" are performed. Wealthy families perform the ritual on every "seven," so-called "seventy-seven days without falling banners," which means that a "ghost-attracting banner pole" and "ritual crane" are erected on each "seven," and scriptures are chanted to perform "merit."

Performing rituals is known to be "spending money for merit," and monks, nuns, and Nam Mo masters each cost thirty to fifty dollars. The paper offerings are even harder to calculate, because large mansions, steamships, and even the latest 1939 model cars, horses, and airplanes can be made by paper offering shops, and it is common to spend three to five hundred dollars on paper offerings for each ritual. Burning paper offerings requires renting a small iron house, which also costs ten dollars to rent.

Because of superstition, many people who "eat from all directions" benefit greatly. Coffin shops, nunneries, Zen monasteries, Taoist temples, etc., all make a lot of money. Not to mention other things, just take "spiritual placement" as an example! Because in Hong Kong, several families live in one floor, if unfortunately one family has a death, the landlord and other residents on the floor do not like the bereaved family to set up a shrine in the building to perform "seven" rituals. In this situation, people have no choice but to place the shrine (i.e., the spirit tablet) in a coffin shop, nunnery, Zen monastery, or Taoist temple. Each spirit tablet costs at least twenty dollars, and nunneries and Zen monasteries, with more elaborate displays, cost no less than thirty to fifty dollars. In coffin shops, a five-foot-long table can hold five or six spirit tablets, and the shop can easily place seven or eight tables, so more than eight hundred dollars can be earned without any capital, which is the best business possible. In a city with a growing population and high mortality rate, it is their opportunity.

Besides these two points, there is hypocrisy and elaborate rituals not found in ancient rites.

Like hiring "successors to carry banners and buy water" and "professional filial sons"; hiring "wailing women" who specialize in mourning for others… all of which are hypocritical.

Shanghai Special

### A Brief Chronicle of Ten Years of Greater Shanghai

— Xuan Nan

Shanghai was established on July 7th, 1927, initially named the Shanghai Special Municipality, directly under the National Government. Huang Fu was appointed as the first mayor of the city. After assuming office, Mayor Huang followed the "Provisional Regulations for the Shanghai Special Municipality" promulgated by the National Government, appointing secretaries and bureau chiefs to take charge of various agencies. The Secretariat, Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Education Bureau, Land Bureau, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Bureau, and Public Welfare Bureau were successively established to manage municipal affairs. Various regulations were drafted, announced, and implemented for compliance; and the scope of the municipal area was delineated and submitted to the National Government to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to send personnel to jointly survey the area, clarifying jurisdiction and rights. After Huang's service for two months, he requested retirement due to a relapse of an old illness. The National Government then appointed Zhang Dingfan as his successor, who took office on September 16th. For the sake of conserving administrative expenses, Mayor Zhang abolished the Public Welfare Bureau at the end of September, transferring all matters handled by the bureau to other bureaus according to their nature. He then proceeded to delineate the powers of the province and the city, determine the scope of the municipal administrative area, and receive the municipal and rural areas of the two counties of Shanghai and Baoshan, uniformly renaming them as areas.

On July 3rd, 1928, the National Government promulgated the Organizational Law of Special Municipalities, and the municipal government began to implement reorganization in accordance with it from August 1st. In addition to renaming the Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Bureau as the Social Affairs Bureau, the other bureaus remained the same. On December 25th, the Port Affairs Bureau was established to handle matters related to the city's rivers, harbors, coastlines, wharves, and ships.

In March 1929, Mayor Zhang also resigned due to illness, and Zhang Qun succeeded him. After assuming office on April 1st, Mayor Zhang focused on reorganizing and transforming the existing construction of the old urban area and demarcated the central urban area to vigorously promote the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great plan. On May 20th of the following year, the National Government promulgated the Municipal Organization Law, renaming all special municipalities as cities directly under the Executive Yuan. The municipal government began to change its name to Shanghai City in accordance with it from July 1st of the same year and implemented reorganization. Except for the Port Affairs Bureau, which was ordered to be suspended and abolished in December of the same year, the internal organization of the bureaus was slightly changed, but the names remained the same. On July 7th, 1936, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new municipal government building in the central urban area was held, and construction began, originally scheduled to be completed the following year. Later, due to changes in the situation, Mayor Zhang resigned due to illness in January of the following year and left.

On January 7th, 1932, Wu Tiecheng was ordered to succeed as mayor. Shortly after Mayor Wu took office, the January 28th Incident occurred, lasting for more than three months, and the essence of the urban area was greatly destroyed. He then devoted his efforts to relieving disaster areas, pacifying refugees, and struggling through difficulties. At the same time, in view of the vastness of the urban area and the difficulty of maintaining public security, the Municipal Security Office was established on August 1st. The work of reconstruction and completing the construction of the central urban area continued to advance in order to realize the plan of Greater Shanghai. In October of the following year, the Municipal Government Building was completed, and Mayor Wu scheduled the completion ceremony to be held at 10:00 AM on National Day. In December, the Municipal Government moved into the office.

On New Year's Day, 1934, the Municipal Government held an opening ceremony, celebrated the founding anniversary of the Republic of China, and held an enlarged commemorative group and New Year's group worship ceremony. In order to promote the prosperity of the central urban area, the various modern urban facilities began to be implemented one by one. In addition to widening roads and opening parks for the convenience of citizens' recreation, other important projects such as libraries, museums, stadiums, gymnasiums, swimming pools, police academies, health experiment stations, elementary school staff, wireless broadcasting stations, and the Qiujiang Wharf were all built successively.

In 1935, libraries, museums, stadiums, hospitals, health experiment stations, elementary schools, etc., were completed one after another. The elementary schools opened in February, and the stadium was transferred to the Preparatory Committee of the 6th National Games in September. The 6th National Games were held from October 10th to 20th. The central urban area was bustling with traffic and reached its peak. After the closing of the Games, the Municipal Government took over and implemented the opening after verifying the organizational regulations to provide a place for citizens' sports competitions. From 1936 until the fall of Shanghai, the libraries, museums, hospitals, health experiment stations, etc., were equipped and opened one after another. The Shanghai Municipal Sports College was also established in the stadium. The first phase of the Qiujiang Wharf construction project was also completed and opened first. Other construction projects, such as the construction of the Longhua Scenic Area, the establishment of the Pudong Water Plant, and the expansion of the user lines in the central urban area of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, were all being realized or underway. Who would have known that the establishment anniversary of Shanghai City on July 7th would be chosen by the Japanese as the day to create an incident to launch a war of aggression against China, and who would have known that more than a month after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Shanghai War would break out! In March, the chairman of Guangdong Province passed away, and the National Government ordered Mayor Wu to succeed as chairman, and the position of Shanghai mayor was still temporarily held by Yu Hongjun. After the outbreak of the war, Yu was ordered to be the mayor, commanding the citizens to rise up against the Japanese. After four months of resistance, Shanghai was eventually occupied. However, the morale of the Shanghai citizens has not declined to this day. They all believe that the final victory will belong to our country, and Greater Shanghai will eventually be restored by the Chinese people of Shanghai. The revival of Greater Shanghai will still be operated and completed by the Chinese people themselves.

### Flower and Whispers

Japanese Side Claims to Have Confiscated Two Alleys on Yu Yuan Road

The Japanese side hosted Western reporters on the afternoon of the 22nd and was asked to explain the posting of notices in two alleys on Yu Yuan Road (Zhongshi New Village and Siming Villa) prohibiting residents from moving in and out. The spokesperson claimed that the properties were the property of enemy countries and had been confiscated by the Japanese authorities. When asked whether the two Chinese banks to which the properties belonged were government agencies, the spokesperson replied that he did not know but that all properties owned by agencies or individuals working for the Chinese government were confiscated. A similar notice was issued when Chinese properties on Hongkou Road were confiscated. When asked whether residents would be allowed to move in and out after the confiscation was completed, the spokesperson replied that this would depend on the situation. When the matter was inquired about by public concession police officers, they claimed that the area was outside their jurisdiction and therefore had not been investigated.

The First Shanghai Map

This map is from the first Shanghai County Chronicle, the Ming Hongzhi Shanghai Chronicle, so it is also the first Shanghai map, drawn more than 430 years ago.

Monk's Six Senses Not Clean, Iron Window Flavor for One Year

Yingzhao, the abbot of Baobentang on Mount Putuo in the South China Sea, is in his sixties and has extensive social connections, appearing to be the leading figure among monks. The Baobentang on Changsha Road in Shanghai is also presided over by him. Every time he comes to Shanghai from Ningbo, he stays at this temple. In the past, there was a wealthy merchant named Sun who was very devout in Buddhism and had a close relationship with the abbot. In 1935, Sun's business failed, and his family property was exhausted. Helpless, his son Yao bin and daughter-in-law Jiang Meili went to Mount Putuo to seek shelter with Yingzhao. Yingzhao inquired about their situation and generously took them in, allocating a building next to the temple for them to live in. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, Sun Yaobin resolutely joined the army, entrusting his elderly father and beloved wife to Yingzhao. When he took leave to visit his relatives in January of this year, he found that his father was still there, but his wife was gone. He asked his father, only to learn that the great monk's six senses were not clean, and he had been tempted by her beauty, secretly taking Jiang away from the mountain and fleeing to the sea. Yaobin learned that the monk was so shameless and immediately pursued him to Shanghai, repeatedly investigating Baobentang on Changsha Road without success. It was not until noon on May 21st that he learned that the great monk's secret residence was upstairs at No. 48 Wenzhou Road. He reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station, and Chinese and Western detectives went to the address and arrested the two while they were still in bed. They were sent to the First Special District Local Court the next day. Yingzhao still tried to deny the charges and hired a lawyer to defend himself. Sun Yaobin's affection for his wife was deep, and he asked that Jiang be spared prosecution. After Judge Zhong Qing questioned them, he sentenced Yingzhao to one year of imprisonment for adultery with a married woman. Jiang Meili's part was not accepted. Yingzhao, upon hearing the verdict, still asked to be released on bail, but was rejected and taken away by the detectives.

Bodyguard's Gun Discharges, Rumored to Be Wang Jingwei's Residence

A Western-style house at No. 570 Avenue , French Concession, is guarded by twenty bodyguards. Whenever a car enters or exits, several armed men accompany it. At 4:00 PM on the 26th, a bodyguard named Wu Changzhi was cleaning his gun in the bedroom when it accidentally discharged, severing the middle finger of a passerby's right hand. He immediately went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. It is said that the house is the private residence of the traitor Wang Jingwei, who, having been terrified by the failed assassination attempt in Hanoi, moved to Shanghai.

Tragic Car Accident in Hongkou, More Than Twenty Killed and Injured

A fish truck number 23528 belonging to the false fish market of Yangshupu was carrying more than twenty workers. At 6:20 AM on the 28th, after unloading fresh goods at the 16th Pier, it was returning when, while passing through the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Road, a public bus operated by the Japanese side drove eastward at high speed, causing a collision at the corner. The front of the public bus was slightly damaged, while the truck was severely damaged, with its body facing the sky. Three or four people on the truck were seriously injured and died immediately, and eighteen were injured. The Japanese side called ambulances to send them to Renji and Tongren Hospitals for treatment.

Firing Anti-Aircraft Guns in Hot Weather, Truly Inconceivable

On the 26th, anti-aircraft guns were fired on the Jiang. Many citizens were awakened by the noise. However, according to Western observers, there were no Chinese planes coming at the time. Later, the Japanese side explained that because "the weather was hot," the soldiers might not be able to stand it, so they were given some empty bombs and allowed to fire them.

Rumors of War in Wusong, Land and Water Transportation Severed

It is rumored that war broke out in Wusong on the evening of the 27th, and the situation was chaotic, with rampant rumors. Security in the area has been tightened. In addition to the ferry from the concession to Wusong being suspended and not yet restored, the ferry across the river from Gaoqiao to Wusong was also temporarily interrupted yesterday. Those who wanted to go there could only go by land through Zhabei, but the inspection was very strict.

### The Geography and Evolution of Shanghai

— Wei Ran

Shanghai was originally just a coastal fishing village, anciently called Hu Du (滬凟), where "Hu" refers to fishing gear. The reason it was named Shanghai is stated in Volume 1, "Evolution," of the Shanghai County Records of the Ming Dynasty's Hongzhi era: "A place situated above the ocean, hence the name."

Over four thousand years ago, Shanghai was part of Yangzhou. During the Spring and Autumn period, it belonged to Wu, then Yue. During the Warring States period, it belonged to Chu. Legend has it that it was the fief of Lord Chunshen Huang Xie of Chu. The Huangpu River is named after Huang Xie because he is said to have ordered its dredging; hence, it was also called Chun Shen Jiang (春申江), or simply Jia Jiang (甲江). During the Qin Dynasty, Lou County was established, under the jurisdiction of Kuaiji Commandery. Shanghai was likely located in the southern territory of Lou. At the beginning of the Han Dynasty, it belonged to the Kingdom of Jing, then the Kingdom of Wu, and later the Kingdom of Jiangdu. During the reign of Emperor Wu, it reverted to Kuaiji Commandery under Yangzhou. During the Later Han Dynasty, it belonged to Wu Commandery under the Yangzhou Inspectorate. During the Jian'an era, it was Zhu Zhi's fief. During the Three Kingdoms period, Wu was the Marquisate of Lou. During the Jin Dynasty, it belonged to Wu Commandery under the Yangzhou province. The Song and Qi Dynasties followed suit. During the Tianjian era (Liang Dynasty), Lou County was abolished and Xinyi County was established. Shanghai was then part of the southern territory of Xinyi. At the beginning of the Datong era, Xinyi was split to re-establish Kunshan County, still under Wu Commandery. Shanghai became part of Kunshan County again. The Chen Dynasty followed suit. During the Sui Dynasty, it was merged into Changshu, then Kunshan County was re-established under Suzhou, which was subordinate to the Yangzhou Xingtai. In the tenth year of the Tianbao era (Tang Dynasty), the land of Kunshan, Haiyan, and Jiaxing counties was divided to establish Huating County under Suzhou, which was subordinate to Jiangdong Circuit. The northeast of Huating bordering the sea is the present-day Shanghai. During the Five Dynasties period, it belonged to the Kingdom of Wuyue, initially under Kaiyuan Prefecture, then under the Zhongwu Military Commission, and later under Xiuzhou. The Song Dynasty continued the system of the Five Dynasties, under the Liangzhe Circuit. At the beginning of the Southern Song Dynasty's Qingyuan era, it belonged to Jiaxing Prefecture. Shanghai was still part of Huating County. Later, the population grew significantly, and merchant ships gathered, gradually forming a large market. The Office of Maritime Trade and the Office of Taxation were established, naming it Shanghai Town.

In the 27th year of the Yuan Dynasty's Zhiyuan era, at the request of Prefect Pu San Hanwen, the townships of Changren, Gaochang, Beiting, Xinjiang, and Haiyu were separated from Huating County to establish Shanghai County, under Songjiang Prefecture, which was subordinate to the Jiangzhe Province. Its jurisdiction extended east to the sea, south to the border of Huating County, west to Kunshan Prefecture of Pingjiang Route, and north to Jiading Prefecture of Pingjiang Route. It was forty-eight li from north to south and one hundred li from east to west, encompassing five townships and twenty-six bao (units of local administration). This was the extent of Shanghai County when it was first established.

At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, Shanghai County belonged to Songjiang Prefecture, directly under Nanjing. During the Jiajing era, the townships of Xinjiang, Beiting, and Haiyu in the west of the county were separated to establish Qingpu County, which was soon abolished. During the Wanli era, it was re-established, and the remaining parts of Beiting and Xinjiang townships were added to it. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the county belonged to the prefecture as in the Ming Dynasty, under the Jiangnan Right Financial Commissioner's Office. At the beginning of the Kangxi era, it was placed under the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner's Office. During the Yongzheng era, the land of Changren Township in the southwest was separated to establish Nanhui County. During the Jiaqing era, fifteen tu (units of local administration) of coastal land in Gaochang Township were further ceded to the Chuansha Pacification Commissioner's Office. At that time, Shanghai only governed three bao of Changren Township and nine bao of Gaochang Township. The territory continued to shrink until the end of the Qing Dynasty, remaining unchanged.

After the founding of the Republic of China, daos, prefectures, zhou, and ting were abolished, and Shanghai became directly under Jiangsu Province. In the third year of the Republic, the dao system was re-established, and it was subordinate to the Huhai Dao, with the same jurisdiction as in the late Qing Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Office of the Shanghai and Songhu Commercial Port Superintendent was established. The area under its jurisdiction, in addition to the entire Shanghai County, included the one city and five xiang (townships) of Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinhang, Pengpu, Zhenru, and Gaoqiao belonging to Baoshan. All administrative affairs were managed by the Office and were not within the administrative scope of the province.

In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the National Revolutionary Army established Shanghai as a special municipality directly under the central government. The area of the Shanghai Special Municipality, in addition to the original jurisdiction of the Shanghai and Songhu Commercial Port, also included the two xiang of Dachang and Yanghang belonging to Baoshan County, a portion of Qibao xiang belonging to Songjiang and Qingpu counties, a portion of Xinzhuang xiang belonging to Songjiang County, and a portion of Zhoupu belonging to Nanhui County. It crossed five counties, with thirty shi (cities) and xiang, covering an area of ​​2,692 square li, approximately seventy li from east to west and over a hundred li from north to south. Although the boundaries of the municipal area were demarcated, what was actually received in the seventeenth year of the Republic was only the eleven shi and xiang of Hunan and Zhabei belonging to Shanghai, and the six shi and xiang of Wusong and Gaoqiao belonging to Baoshan County, all of which were renamed qu (districts). In May of the nineteenth year of the Republic, the National Government promulgated the Organizational Law, changing all special municipalities to shi (municipalities) directly under the Executive Yuan. In July of the same year, it was renamed Shanghai Municipality, with the same jurisdiction as before.

The four boundaries of Shanghai Municipality are: to the east, Chuansha County and Nanhui County; to the south, Nanhui County; to the west, Jiading County, Qingpu County, and Songjiang County; to the north, Baoshan County, and also bordering the Yangtze River.

The geographical coordinates of Shanghai on Earth are as follows:

According to the measurement by the Dredging Bureau, the longitude and latitude of the Jianghai Customs flagpole are:

East longitude 121 degrees 29 minutes 00.02 seconds;

North latitude 31 degrees 14 minutes 20.38 seconds.

Shanghai is China's only major commercial port, and its harbor is formed by the Huangpu River waterway. According to the port area defined by the Dredging Bureau, the Jiangnan Arsenal is the upper end of the harbor, and Donggoukou is the lower end, with a total length of 54,000 feet, with five bends in between. The distance between the two banks varies from 1,080 feet to 2,000 feet. Except for the Zhoujiazuisha beach, even at the lowest tide line, there is a width of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. However, the average width of the waterway with a depth of 24 feet is only 750 feet. The port's capacity to accommodate ships is over 400,000 tons, meaning that approximately seventy ships ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 tons can be berthed simultaneously.

Ships coming from overseas or coastal areas must first pass through the mouth of the Yangtze River, and then enter the Huangpu River via Wusong. There are no rocks on the northeast sea surface outside the mouth. Thirty nautical miles offshore, there is a deep water depth of 60 feet. The southeast sea surface has many islands and sandbars, which pose a considerable obstacle to navigation, so one must follow the designated waterways marked by lighthouses and buoys between the islands.

Taking the Port of Shanghai as the center, waterway routes can be divided into three routes: first, coastal routes; second, inland river routes; third, ocean routes.

Coastal routes reach various ports along China's coast, divided into two routes: one is the Nanyang route, heading south from Shanghai through Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, ending in Guangzhou, or extending to Haiphong and Saigon in French Indochina; the other is the Beiyang route, heading north from Shanghai to Haizhou, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, Tianjin, Yingkou, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and other places.

Inland river routes, also known as inland port routes, are mainly the Yangtze River route, followed by the Suzhou River route and the Huangpu River route. (1) The Yangtze River route travels from the port of Wusong upstream the Yangtze River, passing through various ports in the Yangtze River basin, reaching Chongqing. The section between Shanghai and Hankou is 592 miles long and is the most scenic. In winter, it can accommodate ships with a draft of 8 to 10 feet, and in summer, it can accommodate ships with a draft of 28 to 30 feet. (2) The Suzhou River route flows eastward into the Huangpu River. Traveling northwest along the river, it reaches Wuxian, a distance of approximately 300 Chinese li. It also connects to the interior of Jiangsu, such as Qingpu, Kunshan, Changshu, Hushu Pass, Wangting, Dangkou, and Wuxi. (3) The Huangpu River route travels south and west along the Huangpu River, connecting to southern Jiangsu and the hinterland of Zhejiang, reaching Hangzhou in approximately 500 Chinese li and Wuxing in approximately 600 Chinese li.

Ocean routes reach major commercial ports around the world, divided into the Sino-American route, the Nanyang-India route, the Australian route, the Japan route, the Siberian route, etc. China's ocean routes originate from the four ports of Dalian, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Hong Kong, with Shanghai being suitably located in the middle of the coastline.

The coastal route southward seemed to have started very early, while the northward route can be said to have started with the Yuan Dynasty's maritime transport. As for the ocean route, the Nanyang route was opened up during the Ming Dynasty's Yongle era when Zheng He was sent to the Western Seas (commonly known as the Three Treasure Eunuch's voyage to the Western Seas), and Chen Changtong from Shanghai was among those who went.

The importance of Shanghai's position today is due to the changing times, but its advantageous geographical location is also the foundation for its development. The Boundary Records of the Shanghai County Records state: "Shanghai is at the tail end of eight provinces, the center of seven coastal provinces, and the focus of Pacific航lines." This truly explains Shanghai's geographical advantages.

### A Discussion on Shanghai's Transportation Costs Many Years Ago

Rickshaws:

50 wen from the Bund to the Racecourse

Trams:

The first line was from the Bund to Rue Cardinal

Buses:

Just an 11-year-old little brother

In Shanghai many years ago, a city universally recognized as "cheap," everything was very inexpensive. Transportation costs were naturally in line with this, fundamentally incomparable to the current phenomenon of high prices for everything. Nowadays, every family includes these previously insignificant transportation costs in their budget. Even some companies are adding to salaries under the guise of "transportation allowances," demonstrating the importance of transportation costs in the 20th century.

On the other hand, many people, due to the soaring daily transportation costs, have naturally moved to the central areas of the city. This is simply a secondary cause promoting urban prosperity!

Of course, the cost of rickshaws (referring to human-powered rickshaws) depended on the time and environment. If it was a quiet time, it was relatively cheaper. Generally speaking, according to several old Shanghainese, it only cost five copper coins to go from the current Waibaidu Bridge to Race Course Road via Nanjing Road!

However, rickshaws at that time did not have rubber tires, and the roads were covered with cobblestones. Under such poor material conditions, speed was naturally out of the question. The same journey that now takes only fifteen minutes took forty-five minutes back then. But, having paid the price of five copper coins, what high price would you hope for?

In March 1908, the first tram line appeared in the Public Concession. At that time, the eastern terminus was on the Bund, and the western terminus was at the corner of Rue Cardinal and Rue Nizan. The fare was four copper coins. Later, to make it more convenient for the general public after the abolition of small foreign silver dollars, it was changed to one cent and three li, which was actually still the same. The trams, excluding the sixty trams used by the Shanghai Electric Construction Company, of which twenty were used, were non-existent. A tenth of the current ones.

Later, the tram fare in the Public Concession was extended, passing through North Railway Station, Rue de la Gare, Quai de la Ligne, Wusong Road, Minhang Road, Seward Road, and reaching the Bund, then returning to the railway station via Guangzhou Road, Zhejiang Road, and North Zhejiang Road. This journey, which began operating in 1909, took about an hour and cost twelve copper coins. As for the later-established Yangshupu Bund line, it also incidentally made it its terminus, with the same fare of twelve copper coins. If you took third class, it would be three cents cheaper. In relative comparison, the current twenty-minute journey in the French Concession costs one dime and one cent, which shows how alarmingly the transportation costs have increased since the war last year!

In 1908, trams in the French Concession also began to operate slightly, with the eastern terminus at Nantou Market and extending westward to the corner of Avenue Dubail and Route des Soeurs.

But cars started running even earlier, around 1905-1906. At that time, gasoline only cost four dimes a gallon, only one-fifth of the current price! Car rentals were discovered not many years ago. At that time, the cost of a five-seater car was three yuan, and a seven-seater car was four yuan. The greatest use of these rental cars was when fathers would take their mothers and children out to get some fresh air after dinner. Because gasoline was cheap, rental car operators made a lot of money. However, on the other hand, the cost of some repairs was particularly high compared to today! By 1910, Shanghai also saw the same type of mobile rental cars as in foreign countries. These cars were mostly parked on the Bund, ready to meet people's needs at any time.

The emergence of buses was even more recent. In 1928, both Concessions began to operate them. Although there have been some changes in the type of cars and routes since then, these are relatively few.

At this time, the price of gasoline had increased to one yuan per gallon. Until a few years ago, a car merchant introduced Soviet gasoline (oil everywhere gasoline) to the market, and the price dropped to six dimes a gallon. However, this situation quickly changed, and now it generally costs one yuan and four dimes a gallon. This result has made the bus and tram businesses more prosperous, and more used cars are being sold!

Generally speaking, the cost of living in Shanghai is indeed somewhat unsuitable for Chinese tastes, isn't it? A worker who earns a few dimes has to take a car because of the distance, and the daily transportation costs cost him several dimes. How is he supposed to live? Therefore, too many people in this city are trembling with worry about making a living.

But if you compare Shanghai with the world's major cities, Shanghai still deserves the reputation of being a "cheap city." But, after all, the environment is different!

### Shanghai is Sinking! The Yangshupu Area Sinks One Inch Every Three Years, While Other Areas Sink One Inch or More Annually.

At a meeting of the Civil Engineering Society on May 22nd, Mr. Watterson, a famous writer and engineer, stated that between February 1934 and June 1937, the area along Yangshupu Road had sunk more than five inches. This is the most severe sinking in the entire Shanghai area. This record was obtained from the Public Works Department's benchmark at the corner of Yihang Road and Yangshupu Road. It is believed that the sinking of the large warehouses on the north bank of the road is the cause of the change in the benchmark in the area. Other areas of Shanghai have also experienced similar changes. The former Bund benchmark recorded a sinking of almost six inches between April 1919 and December 1933, with an average rate of 1.26 inches per year. During the same period, the benchmark outside the Bund Park recorded a sinking of only one-quarter of an inch per year on average. The sinking of various areas in Shanghai's densely built-up areas varies from slightly more than one-third of an inch to almost two inches per year. The classification and analysis are still based on the size of the adjacent loads, the nature of the subsoil (i.e., whether it is on the old riverbed), and the possible influence of nearby deep wells. The sinking on the old riverbed is ninety percent faster than that not on the riverbed. The speed of land subsidence is directly proportional to the size of the adjacent vehicle load and is also affected by the absorption of deep wells within a radius of 400 feet.

### New Film "King of Chinatown" Completed. Anna May Wong Delivers a Patriotic Speech. Eastern Daughter Discovers "Motherly" Love. In Hollywood, She Sells Clothes to Help Refugees

At the celebration banquet for "King of Chinatown," in addition to the male and female leads of the film, Akim Tamiroff and Anna May Wong, as well as the director and other staff members, there were also a few reporters. The focus of the conversation was obviously concentrated on Anna May Wong, because Miss Wong was the only foreigner at this banquet, and her country was at war with another country.

To a reporter's question, "What are Miss Wong's thoughts on China's resistance against Japan?" Anna May Wong gave her high-minded opinion:

"From my point of view, this is not a 'question' because what you call 'China' is my motherland. A person's body may be in another country, but her heart always belongs to her motherland. I don't want to boast that I am a patriot, and I must admit that if I hadn't been to China that time, my feelings for my motherland would still be very sluggish and dull. But that time I went and realized how lovable my homeland and people were. So this time, the resistance against Japan feels to me like something happening in my own home. I should add that the last time I returned to China, it was entirely to see the true face of my motherland. In the embrace of my motherland, I discovered 'motherly love.' From that time on, I confirmed that I am a Chinese woman. Before that time, I was just an Eastern daughter growing up in Los Angeles. My feelings about China's invasion and resistance are the same as the feelings when one's own family is devastated and family members are fighting thugs armed with sticks and firearms. I am sad, I am indignant, but I also feel proud. And what I am most proud of is that my friends in Hollywood are completely sympathetic to my side—they have launched a no-stocking movement and are buying my clothes at several times their original value, so that I can send this money back to help refugees. These great actions and graces are forever worthy of admiration and gratitude! (Anlan)

### The Origin of Mickey Mouse's Name. It Was Originally the Sound of a Train Wheel. Disney Adopted it as the Title of a Cartoon

Mickey Mouse's original name was Mickey Mouse. According to "Walt Disney" by French journalist Medeloine Leeve, the creation and naming of Mickey Mouse was very accidental.

At that time, Walt Disney, like ordinary, unknown cartoonists, was writing the long-running comic book "Alice in Wonderland" in New York, but he felt that he was different from others after all. So he left New York and went to Hollywood to try his luck.

The creation of Mickey Mouse was on the train from New York to Hollywood.

Walt Disney liked to raise mice. He liked their timid nature and timid actions. In his office, he kept a cage of mice. One of them had been tamed. Disney often let her out and let her run on the table. Her slender ears moved uneasily, her tail swayed from side to side, and a pair of red eyes stared at Disney. When he was tired from work, she was Disney's comforter.

This time, Disney also took her on the train. But Disney was pondering on the train. The audience was already tired of Alice and the White Rabbit. What new things could he offer to the audience?

The train sped towards Hollywood. He lay on the train's sleeping chair, holding a sketchbook in one hand and drawing paper in the other, thinking hard...

On the plains of the west, the train rolled forward, and the sound of the wheels was "Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse..."

Disney closed his eyes and thought hard for a long time, but still had no results. So he gradually began to pay attention to the song sung by the wheels: "Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse..."

Suddenly, he sat up, opened the mouse cage next to him, and released the little mouse he had tamed. He immediately picked up his pen and drew on the paper. With a few strokes, a silver screen hero was created. Disney wrote the two words "Mickey Mouse" next to it.

When it came to China, people translated it as "Mickey Mouse." (Chen Xiaobo)

Items for discussion included the case of postponing the Shenbao Cup charity tournament. All parties expressed their opinions. It was resolved that the men's second division basketball league would continue to be held in the YMCA gymnasium starting on June 5th (Monday). As for the women's basketball charity tournament, they will still contact the YMCA to borrow the venue and hold it in the near future. The meeting was adjourned at around 9:00 p.m.

Editor's note: This newspaper has sent out prize money for the women's basketball charity tournament. The League has accepted the sponsorship and the YMCA has agreed to lend the gymnasium for use. The enthusiasm for jointly supporting the charity event is greatly appreciated. However, the venue issue has suddenly been postponed, which inevitably disappoints the players of the teams participating in the charity tournament. It is hoped that those in charge will immediately contact the YMCA to finalize the venue matter and make the competition happen as soon as possible.

### School Junior Volleyball Tournament: Pui Ying and Wah Yan Both Triumph, King's College and Southwest Put Up Strong Fight But Lose; Two More Junior Matches Today

Pui Ying Defeats King's College

Yesterday, two junior matches of the school volleyball tournament were held. In the match between Pui Ying and King's College, after the initial contact, Pui Ying's defense and offense were consistent. King's College's defense appeared disorganized. In the first set, Pui Ying took the lead 21-19. King's College suffered an initial setback. Jiang Yingchao, Bao Jiafu, Liang Shide, Yu Runde, and others tried their best to counterattack. Pui Ying's Zhou Gengshen, Chen Fangyu, Huang Huahan, Huang Jiyao, and others worked together to defend. However, King's College's offense was strong, with frequent spikes. They returned the favor with a score of 21-18. After this, Pui Ying rallied and seized the opportunity to spike. King's College's line collapsed. Pui Ying won the third set 21-14. King's College hoped to recover lost ground. Huang Mao, Chen Lun, Liang Hua, and others tried their best to counterattack, but Pui Ying's team was in full swing, launching volleys of attacks. King's College fought until 5:17 PM, but Pui Ying won 21-17.

Wah Yan Wins Against Southwest

Wah Yan's entire team cheered and launched a fierce attack on Southwest, winning the second set 23-21. Southwest, realizing they needed to act quickly, rallied the entire team.

### The Responsibility of a Football Player

A football team that officially takes the field has eleven players, each with different responsibilities, but all equally important. For example, some say that the responsibility of the defenders is greater than that of the forwards. If this were the case, the team could only defend and not attack. Conversely, if the forwards are good but the defenders are weak, they can only attack and not defend. If the opponent attacks, the result will inevitably be unfavorable. A team with balanced strength can often defeat a team with uneven development, because of the word "balanced." With balanced strength, the eleven players make fewer mistakes when fighting, and can fully demonstrate their skills! However, it is not easy for a person's skills to reach a high level. It requires a long period of practice and understanding to reach this level. Now, let's talk about the skills and responsibilities of each position.

(1) Goalkeeper - He can be considered the soul of the team. A skilled goalkeeper can greatly increase the team's courage. A goalkeeper must be tall, agile, and not sluggish, flustered, or impatient. He must be calm, composed, quick-witted, adaptable, and nimble. In any urgent situation, he must act according to the circumstances and not be bound by one style. When the attacking team shoots, he must observe the direction of the shot before the enemy moves his foot, and quickly prepare, standing upright in his position and posture to receive the ball. He must always pay attention to his position and not be too close to the white line under the goal. He must know that there is a kind of ball that forces you to retreat two steps to catch it. If you are too close to the white line under the goal, then those two steps have already crossed the white line. Even if you can catch the ball, it will be counted as a goal for the opponent. Therefore, experienced goalkeepers usually stand two or three feet or five or six feet away from the goal. But when the enemy raises his foot to shoot, he must retreat one or two steps, approaching the white line under the goal, to narrow the range of catching the ball. The goalkeeper should preferably catch the ball with his hands and kick it out, which is more stable. Kicking with the feet or hitting with the palms are not good strategies, but in certain situations, it is necessary to abandon the hands and resort to fists and feet. That is an exception. For example, if the enemy center sends a high ball from the center back line that falls in front of the goal, and the enemy's forward also rushes to the goal at the same time, if you go to catch the ball, you will inevitably be bumped into the net by the enemy, man and ball together. At this time, it is useful to punch the ball out. Also, if a low ball comes quickly towards the goal, and the enemy is rushing behind the ball ten yards away, although the ball is already out of his reach, it would be terrible if you bend over to catch it. You must know that in the instant you bend down, he has already rushed in front of you, because he wants to shoot the ball into the goal, so he raises his foot regardless of everything. Your face happens to be facing the ground, imagine how dangerous that would be. This kind of ball can only be kicked out with a quick foot. When the goalkeeper catches the ball in his hand, if an enemy blocks the goal, he must use the stealing and dodging method to avoid him. But he cannot carry the ball more than four steps, otherwise it will be a foul. This point should be paid special attention to. When catching the ball, you should follow the momentum of the ball to avoid the force of the rebound, so that there will be no situation where the ball falls again after being caught. After losing one or two goals, do not be frustrated or discouraged. You should be extra spirited to deal with it. After your team has scored one or two goals, you cannot be arrogant and let the ball fall over your head. If you are too hasty, do not reach out to catch it, it is safer to pat it into a corner kick.

(2) The duty of the defenders is more important than that of the forwards when the enemy launches a major attack. The forwards can miss a kick or make a mistake, but the defenders must not make a mistake, otherwise it will be losing a goal. Therefore, those who act as defenders bear a great responsibility that is related to life and death. Those who practice as defenders must have a strong body and strength, accurate eyesight, hard feet, clear head, and courageous spirit. In very urgent situations, they must use great calmness to act, and it is more appropriate to be cautious. The left and right defenders must have considerable understanding and cooperation. When the enemy's forward approaches the penalty area, they should go to steal the ball on the one hand, and fully protect the goalkeeper on the other, and must not entangle themselves unclearly and obstruct his sight. When the forward dribbles the ball forward, they must advance step by step, and must not be complacent, thinking that the ball has been dribbled out by the forward, and that my responsibility has been completed. That would be a fundamental mistake! When the enemy counterattacks and the ball crosses the kickoff line, the center back should go to steal the ball, and the defender must immediately prepare to kick the ball, which should be high rather than low, fast rather than slow. In any serious situation, there must be no deliberate fouls. It must be known that fouls by defenders are mostly sentenced to death (penalty kick). Once a penalty is imposed, it will not only lose a goal, but also cause dissatisfaction among the spectators with their own actions. Those who serve as defenders must not have a strong desire to win or lose, and must not be irresponsible. If they have a strong desire to win or lose, they will foul more often. If they are irresponsible, it is easy to lose the ball. Victory or defeat and responsibility are clearly two different things. May those who serve as defenders appreciate it themselves. The center back is the leader of an army. He can help the forwards attack and retreat to help the defenders defend. The responsibility is great. Only those who have a brave spirit, strong physique, and clear mind can take on this great task. He must have the full skills of heading, kicking, dribbling, and shooting.

### Twenty Tips for Gymnastics

(11) Gymnastics must follow the order of moving from small movements to large movements. Therefore, it must start with gentle movements - limb movements, followed by important movements - torso movements in the middle, and end with rapid movements - jumping movements. The amount of movement should be gradually increased to the maximum.

(12) In recent times, those who practice gymnastics believe that during gymnastics, blood circulation speeds up, and breathing becomes rapid, so there is a natural breathing movement, and there is no need to set up a special breathing movement. However, others believe that after gymnastics, in order to make the body easier to return to its original state, ending with breathing exercises is also in line with the principles of physical education.

(13) The materials for gymnastics must be selected according to the individual's physical condition and the degree of gymnastics practice, from easy to difficult, from shallow to deep, step by step. Do not blindly aim high and far, overestimating your own strength, or reversing the order. Misuse of difficulty can result in little effect.

(14) The so-called difficulty and depth of gymnastics refers to the order between multiple sets of gymnastics, not the order between the sections of a set of gymnastics. Therefore, the degree of difficulty and depth between each section of a set of gymnastics must be equal. Do not be difficult at times and easy at others, or deep at times and shallow at others. Otherwise, not only will the practitioner feel that some sections are too easy and others are too difficult, but also the sudden increase or decrease in the amount of exercise will violate the principles of physical education.

(15) Gymnastics materials do not need to be changed frequently, but practicing one action for too long often leads to boredom. However, the muscles used for the same part of the body often vary depending on the action. If the same action is used all the time, it may not be in line with the purpose of balanced development of the whole body. Therefore, it is still better to have the opportunity to change a set of gymnastics after practicing for a considerable period.

(16) When practicing gymnastics, you must understand the function of each section of gymnastics. Then, even when there is no instructor, you can freely select materials and change them at will. If you just follow blindly, knowing only the "what" but not the "why," then you will not be sure when selecting materials, and you will spread errors, misunderstand each other, and it will be difficult to obtain good results.

(17) When practicing gymnastics, you must understand the depth and difficulty of various actions. Then, you can select materials that are suitable for entering the deeper parts of the body and following the principle of entering from the easy to the difficult, as well as meeting your own physical needs. To distinguish the depth and difficulty of actions, you only need to look at the length of the path of the moving part and the size of the arc. The longer the path of the moving part and the larger the arc that the action passes through, the greater the amount of exercise and the deeper and more difficult the action will be. If you can carefully distinguish the actions, it will not be difficult to understand.

(18) The time spent on a set of gymnastics is at most only a few tens of minutes. No matter how large the amount of continuous movement is, there is no reason why it cannot be supported. Therefore, adding rest time between each section is unnecessary, and the rest time is more than the practice time. Also, limiting the number of actions in each section with a fixed number such as four or eight, regardless of the level of physical strength or the amount of exercise, is also an unnecessary arrangement.

(19) The best time for gymnastics is twice a day, each time from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, after getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night. Performing gymnastics in the morning can promote blood circulation and prepare you for a full day of energy. Performing gymnastics before going to bed can draw blood from the brain to the limbs and eliminate the pain of insomnia.

(20) Gymnastics is best performed outdoors in an open space, so that you can naturally absorb fresh air. However, if there is no suitable outdoor environment, it is also acceptable to perform it indoors. However, you must pay attention to opening the doors and windows so that outdoor air can flow in.

### The State and Economic Undertakings

— Zhang Dechang

Controlled economy and planned economy, from one perspective, have something in common, that is, using political power to dominate and manage the development of economic undertakings. Although using political power to interfere in economic undertakings is popular today, tracing its evolution reveals a historical background of hundreds of years. We can divide this evolution into three stages.

As early as the seventeenth century, European countries such as England, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden, under the ideological domination of mercantilism, all had an ideal of a wealthy and powerful country. In order to achieve this goal, various countries implemented various policies to seek the development of their own industries, commerce, navigation, and agriculture. Among them, the French government was the most enthusiastic. In the era of Louis XIV, there were various decrees to encourage emerging industries and punish industrialists and businessmen who did not comply with the decrees. England was also like this. However, their policies, on the whole, did not achieve the grand results they expected. Of course, there were also successes, such as the development of England's maritime navigation industry, which undoubtedly benefited from the implementation of the Navigation Acts. But from the whole, we can say that the political intervention in economic undertakings at that time was a failure. The main reason for the failure was that the government organizations at that time were not perfect, and they themselves could not shoulder the task of developing the economy. Therefore, the government of the era of Louis XIV of France was the most enthusiastic government in developing industry and commerce, but it was also a failed government. A government whose own organization is not sound, even if it has good intentions, often, in order to develop industry and commerce, ends up destroying industry and commerce.

The precedent of political intervention in economic undertakings in the era of mercantilism is an example of the relationship between the state and economic undertakings that we can find in history, but it is a failed example, and it did not have a direct impact on the modern ideas of controlled economy and planned economy.

The political intervention in economic undertakings in the era of mercantilism failed, so it caused a reaction. This reaction was to explain that the state should not interfere in economic undertakings. This statement not only has historical facts to prove it, but also has a set of academic theories, which is very powerful and popular for a generation. But in the nineteenth century, the facts gave us a major counter-evidence. The state should intervene, and the result of intervention is conducive to the development of economic undertakings. The evidence of the nineteenth century tells us that the state should provide assistance and management to the development of economic undertakings. Not only should it be adjusted in production, but also the scope of state management should be extended to all aspects. The example of the state using political power to dominate and manage the entire economic undertaking is a feature of the late nineteenth century. In agriculture, Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century faced a major threat, namely the invasion of American agricultural products.

### Unprecedented in Decades (Continued): The Japanese Yen Plummets to a Record Low; Japanese Banking Circles Do Not Seem to Support It

Currency in Circulation Not Recovered

When the so-called military tickets that were not in circulation were used, the Japanese army in Central China circulated the Japanese yen to purchase goods and for other transactions. It seemed that the circulation had stopped last autumn, but the Japanese yen banknotes that had already been in circulation at that time were not recovered. As a result, they appeared in the Central China market. It is estimated that the Japanese yen circulating in Central China totaled between 30 million and 50 million yuan. The Japanese side refused to recover the depreciated Japanese yen circulating in Central China by exchanging currency or goods, which resulted in the further depreciation of the Japanese yen. This depreciation, of course, has an adverse reaction to the Japanese yen at home, but the Bank of Japan is unlikely to take action to support the value of Japanese yen banknotes in Shanghai. If they add support, they can only reduce the possibility of recovering the Japanese yen in the showcase. But this is precisely what Japan does not want to do. The way Japan treats the Japanese yen circulating in Shanghai has some similarities with the way the German government treats the marks circulating abroad. Germany does not actually support the circulation of its banknotes overseas, and minimizes the possibility of recovery. As a result, the ratio of German banknotes overseas is only half the face value of the mark. Japan may follow Germany's footsteps.

The Japanese Side Claims That There is Too Much Circulation in Shanghai

The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 23rd that someone questioned the depreciation of the Japanese yen at a Japanese press briefing yesterday. According to the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, this is a phenomenon of economic supply and demand imbalance and is not worth mentioning. According to the spokesman, recently more and more Japanese yen have arrived in Shanghai. Each time a ship comes from Japan, more than a thousand travelers arrive, each carrying a considerable amount of Japanese currency to supply the market. However, the Shanghai market cannot absorb so many Japanese yen at once, so there is an impact on the exchange rate. It is doubtful that this explanation has many points. Tomorrow's newspaper (the French newspaper claims) will examine it. Also, the North China Daily News reported that when reporters were received yesterday (the 22nd), someone asked about the sudden drop in the Japanese yen exchange rate. The speaker replied that this matter had various factors, the main one being the problem of supply and demand, and claimed that a large number of Japanese people came to Shanghai, about a thousand on each ship, which naturally caused the Japanese yen to fall. When asked whether the Japanese people who came to Shanghai were all related to the Japanese army, the spokesman replied that most of them were tourists. (End)

### Difficult to Write About Xianghu

— Cao Ming

One: Xiangxi's Important Town… Yuanling

Today, with the enemy having occupied Yueyang and posing a threat to the northern bank of Dongting Lake, Xiangxi holds a significant position in terms of national defense. The terrain of Xiangxi is so treacherous, and the character of the people is so strong; these are all excellent conditions for our war of resistance needs. However, the low level of culture and the lack of widespread awareness of the war of resistance are serious problems that urgently need to be resolved.

It was during the evacuation from Wuhan and the fear of Changsha that I traveled along the highway from Changsha, passing through Yiyang, Changde, Taoyuan, Guanzhuang, and arriving at Yuanling. I stayed in the Yuanling area for two months. Xiangxi left a deep impression on my mind and filled me with infinite emotion.

When I arrived, Yuanling had already transformed from a desolate and backward county town into a suddenly prosperous small city—the political, military, and commercial center, the important town of Xiangxi.

Yuanling's terrain is long and narrow, located at the foot of mountains. Looking down, one sees the clear Yuan River. The main street is only one, stretching east and west for no more than three or four li. Thatched houses and wooden shacks stand like tumors on the mountainside. The land is barren and infertile, with a lack of agricultural products. Usually, there are only corn, sweet potatoes, and edible jelly. It is said that the population used to be only over 10,000, but since the evacuation from Changsha and the relocation of the provincial government, the population has increased to over 100,000. Yuanling, which was not able to be self-sufficient in daily necessities and food, now presents a scene of hunger and chaos. Inns and residences are filled with government officials and high-class refugees. Shops and mountain-top thatched houses have been occupied or borrowed by the military and various teams. This intestine-like city is so crowded that it is about to explode. The main street is filled with people from dawn to dusk, everyone shoulder to shoulder, nose to nose. If a certain army enters the city, the entire population immediately feels the increased density of the surrounding air. Although the authorities have used many methods to maintain a peaceful state, the continuous influx of outsiders, difficult transportation, insufficient supply of goods, and low cultural level have led merchants to hoard goods and profiteer. As a result, prices are soaring day by day, the population cannot be evacuated, and the market order remains chaotic. People cannot settle down to work, which is a loss for both individuals and the nation!

From Yiyang to Changde, there are no steep mountains, but after Guanzhuang, there are endless mountains. The highway, like a large reptile, arduously climbs over many hills and passes through many barren and severe mountain ranges. After Yuanling, it branches off around Shili Pu, heading northwest past Qian City and Yongshun into Sichuan, and southwest via Zhijiang and Huangxian into Guizhou. In the past, Changde and Taoyuan were prosperous and affluent places, but since Dongting Lake was threatened by the enemy, Changde and Taoyuan have suffered numerous bombings, and prosperity has concentrated in Yuanling. West of Yuanling, such as Qian City and Yongshun, are even more impoverished, and a portion of the people have become bandits due to poverty and inability to make a living.

Speaking of the terrain, west of Guanzhuang, there are high and steep mountains. The mountains on both sides of the highway are simply natural, immovable guards. Not to mention that the enemy cannot deploy mechanized units here, even an ordinary walking traveler feels a bit scared by the barrenness. Looking up close, there are towering giant rocks; looking into the distance, there are lush green forests. Where exactly would the enemy fire their artillery? For dozens of miles, there are only a few scattered thatched houses. Would tank units dare to advance into the desert-like wilderness? Can their reinforcements and supplies be guaranteed not to be cut off? These are all our decisive advantages. If we add appropriate military deployments and widely mobilize guerrilla warfare, then even if the invaders send five divisions to attack Yuanling, the important town of Xiangxi, it would be in vain and would only result in complete destruction.

Xiangxi is barren and often faces famine, so the people mostly live a simple life. Whether in winter or summer, they mostly wear blue cloth shirts and pants. People with a more comfortable life wear a complete set of clothes. If they are from the middle or lower classes, then their clothes are patched and faded. Because Hunan is rich in rice production, people are accustomed to eating three to four meals a day. The main dish for each meal is chili and fermented soybeans, with at most a little vegetable and beans. However, they have developed a strong physique, able to withstand the sun and rain, and climb mountains and cross ridges as quickly as we walk on flat ground. Because of the tempering of the environment and life, they have long developed a strong character and a spirit of adventure. If this power can be properly used and developed, and guided into the scope of the war of resistance, wouldn't it become a great force?

I believe that if the government can systematically develop the various advantages of Xiangxi, then the Guanzhuang and Yuanling area will be an iron-like solid defense line, and the people of Xiangxi will surely become thousands of brave guerrilla teams.

### Sailing

— Xue Ming

On the riverbank, on the golden river water, ripples strings of sails. The evening mist, in this subtropical region, is always like a layer of gauze, covering the fields, and the sailing boats floating on the river slowly disappear into the humid mist. Stars are embedded in the boundless sky, seemingly peering at me. When I dragged my reluctant footsteps back home, the sailing shadows left me with an extremely fond emotion.

In my innocent childhood, immersed in myths and fantasies, sailing gave me countless illusory expectations. The slender, pointed shape slowly glided on the tranquil, stagnant, golden-colored Han River, gradually disappearing into the distant mountain shadows. Throughout the year, the coming and going of sailing boats, and the lives of the boatmen as calm and joyful as the river water in the sunshine and rain, disappeared and reappeared in the river along with rice, grain, local products, and porcelain.

However, since last year, the enemy cavalry invaded Jiangnan, and enemy planes roared over the riverbank, bombs raised flying flowers from the riverbank soil, and the turbid, yellow Han River water was stained with red blood.

Then, the flames of war forced me to bid farewell to my old home by the river.

Having lost a profoundly exciting emotion, the steamship carried me floating on the surging sea waves. The black water supported the arched sky, and the sea waves were more dangerous and fierce than the river tides. Waves constantly slapped against the ship's hull. In the deep blue ocean, in the silvery-white waves, I could never see the slowly gliding sailing boats again, and I never dared to look back, because behind me was a verdant homeland and the sailing boats that left me with fond emotions.

Seagulls and snow-white waves became the companions of the suffering people's journey. The vast sea and sky gave people infinite memories. A general, indescribable emotion surged into my heart, and I exclaimed: "No matter how enemy planes soar over our homeland, who can forget the storms of this great era? The motherland is facing the wind and waves, and we should also muster the courage to ride the waves."

Now, having been separated from my hometown for a whole year, I have not seen the returning sails slowly gliding on the calm river water in the twilight. In the Han River basin, there may only be enemy planes circling, and on the calm river water, there may only be鲜红的血流.

Holding the news sent by a soldier, looking at the starry sky through tearful eyes, the motherland is facing a storm, and we are also suffering in the storm, so tears gradually turned into tearful rain.

### A Trip to Chikan

— Lin Ling

Having traversed over thirty li of muddy road and arriving at Baisha, it was already dusk. This made me very difficult: Should I stay overnight here or rush to Chikan? If I stay overnight, a great opportunity to go to the Jianghui front line would be missed. If I don’t, I won't have the time to inspect the situation here after the major bombing. Then, wouldn't it be a waste of a hard half-day journey?

After struggling for a long time, a local friend finally helped me solve this problem. He first guided me to hang around every desolate bomb crater, and then he called a bicycle for me. He comforted me:

"Lin, take this bicycle, you can still reach Chikan by night."

Looking at my bag, the hour and minute hands were kissing around the position of six. I hurriedly sat on the wooden board at the back of the bicycle, hastily said "goodbye," and the bicycle nimbly went through the road towards the countryside.

The bicycle rider was a strong and healthy youth. From a few special sounds in his speech, I distinguished that he was a local. His surname was Huang. He used to be a partner in a Suzhou-Hangzhou store, and now he earns a living by riding a bicycle for others with his two legs.

In the vast twilight, the bicycle passed over the flat highway. The wheels pressed against the fine sand, constantly emitting a rhythmic, low-pitched chant. The evening breeze gently brushed from the front field, and my two eyes constantly photographed every strange and beautiful scenery. At that time, the distress in my heart was replaced by joy; even the empty stomach was forgotten.

This inch by inch is "Shachi Highway." The road is so flat and complete, why don't cars run on it? I couldn't suppress the suspicion in my heart, so I asked the young man who was riding the bicycle about this question.

He stared intently at the front without looking back or squinting: he said:

"For many years, the traffic here has never stopped. Since the highway was implemented for destruction, although it was not damaged here due to the hinterland, the Chikan section more than ten li away has been destroyed. The route is too short, and the car company lost money, so it no longer operated the car. Later, due to various inconveniences, some people restored the car. But I know that on March 30, when the enemy plane carried out a massacre in Baisha, two cars were also damaged, and no cars have driven since!"

"Now, how do most people here travel?" As the car made a small turn, I asked this.

"Not to say that most of them walk, take a bicycle when rushing, and the rich can take a sedan chair." He still held the handlebars tightly, his eyes looking into the distance, as if he was not talking to me.

"Do women also take bicycles?"

"Yes, most of the ones who ride are the waitresses in the teahouses!" He said, grinning his teeth and smiling, this smile seemed to hide many mysteries.

I also thought of the various closed situations of the country folks, especially the rural women. When they occasionally saw a woman riding a bicycle in the two places, they all regarded it as a miracle. But now, they also come to sit on the back of a bicycle of an unfamiliar man. The changes brought by the war of resistance to the countryside are also very extraordinary!...

The road passed through layers of mountains, and the car glided over the sandy road in sections. When walking to a group of mountains, the young man who was riding the bicycle said to me:

"This is Baizu Mountain, there is Wen Tianxiang's tomb there."

I aroused a string of nostalgic feelings, and felt that Wen Tianxiang's steadfast spirit of sacrifice should be promoted in the war of resistance period, but why are there still so many traitors?

Suddenly, the car stopped in front of a pile of high floating mud. I paid the fare of six jiao and ten fen, and when I said goodbye to the strong and healthy youth, he amiably told me:

"This is Butterfly Ridge, and it is still five li from here to Chikan."

The highway was completely absorbed, and it was not good to walk or could not walk in the hazy dusk, so I had to find a small stone path to walk.

Looking back, the shadow of the strong and healthy youth who sent me along with the bicycle had disappeared. Turning my head again and looking up at the sky, the night was getting darker, maybe it would rain tonight? Just as I was predicting this, I suddenly remembered that I had dropped a "Timely" umbrella in Baisha, ah, what? ——Bad luck——

I hesitated annoyedly for a while, and finally moved forward again in one breath, passing through the deep twilight, and approaching the place that revealed a vague light step by step.

"What's so important? After all, I have arrived in Chikan tonight, and tomorrow I can rush to the front line of Jianghui." I comforted myself like this.

May, 1939, written in Chikan

### Before and After Going to the Countryside

— Zhang Zhenshan

—A fragment of the conscript life

A faint light reflects on the paper screen, and the arrangement of the room roughly shows the outline. Opening the blanket, rubbing the blurred eyes, I quickly climbed out of bed.

Pushing open the window and looking out, the dimness of the remnant night has disappeared into the clear gray dawn. Comrade Li joyfully stretched his head and spoke in Hubei dialect:

"The weather must be good today, the publicity in the countryside must be smooth! Prepare quickly"!

Ignoring the commotion, I busily carried my military blanket and baggage. A group of people, red-faced and high-spirited, walked out of the bedroom and ran into the playground.

The high sky has been replaced with a silver-gray coat, and the morning stars have also faded the last of their light. The sky wind brings a burst of coolness, drilling into our thin uniforms: The night dew on the grass moistens the canvas running shoes, and the bugles and whistles keep ringing, like a fire, intensely burning in the hearts of everyone.

The neat line, in the instructor's strong and solemn tone, was divided into four propaganda teams, sixteen detachments. After dividing the routes and areas, he reiterated the propaganda outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization, and finally encouraged us, saying: "Mobilizing in the countryside is to increase the strength of the war of resistance in the villages. I hope you will achieve the expected goal; so that every farmer or shepherd can understand the effectiveness of the National Covenant, and their own obligations to give the invaders a serious blow... . "

His words ended when the second launch horn began.

Start: Walking on the narrow path, turning into the winding alleys, on the street, the street lights flickered with afterglow, drowsy shops, lowering the door panels... Through the city gate hole, through the electric grid, we rushed to the suburbs.

On the road, the sun had climbed to the horizon, the blood-red soft new rays of the strong first obliquely shone over, like a golden light gauze, dragging down to the edge of the earth, lining the colorful clouds around the morning, decorating half the sky with magnificent splendor, reflecting the horizontal fields and vegetable gardens, the clear morning breath, wandering in between .

Around, the smoke on the roofs of the houses, floating in the air thread by thread.

We looked at the thatched houses, looked at the light smoke, and the lively hearts became more unrestrained and vigorous. Passing through a village, we left a detachment, carrying a small flag, and began to preach to the farmers—National Spiritual Mobilization: Air defense knowledge in war-torn rural areas, and basic guerrilla skills.

Each of them gathered their spirits to listen to us slowly, and more and more people gathered: old uncles and old women opened their eyes, and the children danced, and nodded their little heads.

When we finished speaking, a group of villagers waved their hands and issued a giant roar like a shout:

"We want to cooperate with the National Army, we want to pick up iron hoes and rakes, aim at them, chop them! We want freedom, we want to live, we want to eat, get up and do it quickly!"

This is giving us the propaganda team to return to the village. The sound shook the villages, shook the fields, and also shook the distant valleys.
