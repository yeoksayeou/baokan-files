### Tianjin Incident and the Far East

The so-called concession issues, from Shanghai and Gulangyu to the Tianjin Incident, were originally initiated by Japanese militarists to break through the setbacks in their military aggression against China. However, unexpectedly, they faced setbacks in Gulangyu, and now in Tianjin, they have become "forceful." The reason here is very simple and clear: In the case of Gulangyu, the British attitude was not only strong but also maintained close contact and joint action with the United States and France, such as jointly dispatching marines to land. However, in Tianjin, the United Kingdom did not have close contact with the United States and France, and the British attitude itself was very weak. At first, Britain agreed to extradite anti-Japanese elements, then only hoped that the United States would come forward to mediate. In the end, they hesitated and only considered what retaliatory measures to take, always "a lot of thunder and little rain."

The extradition of Chinese anti-Japanese elements has already encountered a tough stance from Japan. Japan is not satisfied with this extradition; what Japan demands is a so-called "fundamental change" in the British Far East policy. The hope for U.S. mediation also vanished due to Japan's refusal. Hesitant retaliatory measures encountered even more severe threats from Japan: "If the British government takes swift and active steps to protect its interests in China, Japan will be forced to take all necessary measures to deal with the new situation" (official Japanese statement). So, how will the matter unfold from now on? What steps should Britain take?

The Tianjin Incident is no longer just a local issue in Tianjin, nor is it just an issue between Britain and Japan. In essence, it is an issue between all third countries and Japan, the entire issue of the Far East, and also a confrontation between the aggressive group and the anti-aggression group. Therefore, to deal with this serious issue, Britain must pay attention to this major premise. Britain does not need to fear Japan's threats. What Britain urgently needs now is to quickly adjust the pace of the anti-aggression group, especially to effectively unite with countries that have close ties with the Far East. The consultation between the military leaders of Britain and France stationed in the Far East on cooperation methods is certainly important, but this consultation cannot be without the United States. The United States is the country that Japan fears the most. For Britain to impose economic sanctions on Japan, it needs the cooperation of the United States; otherwise, the effect will not be significant.

In addition, the Soviet Union occupies an important position in the Far East relations. Its powerful strength is crucial to the situation in the Far East. The Japanese militarists, who are bogged down in military operations against China and want to shift their focus to third countries, are still only making empty noises towards the Soviet Union, while they are acting recklessly and brutally towards Britain. Japan's recklessness towards Britain is partly to restrain Britain from getting close to the Soviet Union, but it also shows its fear of British-Soviet cooperation. To enhance Britain's position, British-Soviet negotiations should not be delayed, so that aggressors can see the shortcomings of disunity in the anti-aggression group.

Britain has no reason to fear Japan. Although the Japanese government supports the militarists' reckless policy with united opposition, its internal fundamental contradictions will increase further due to the difficulties of military aggression against China. If Britain can increase the difficulties of Japan's aggression against China, the foundation of its Far East policy can be consolidated.

### Northwestern Shandong Correspondence: A Record of Crossing the Yellow River

1.  Departure

Starlight flickers in the deep night sky, its bright edges clean, beautiful, and sharp. On the earth, all is quiet, without a sound. Only the cool autumn wind gently blows against our thin military uniforms. It should be a bit cold, but who among us is so delicate? We are strong, our chests filled with the hot blood of anger and revenge. What is a little cold wind?

Following the winding road outside the city walls, we marched forward with vigorous steps, seemingly forgetting the heavy bags on our shoulders. We cleared our throats and sang aloud:

"The motherland is on the line of death, our compatriots are starving and wandering, the five-thousand-year-old nation must rise, the four hundred and fifty million people must be liberated! Two heavy tasks fall on our shoulders, sisters and brothers across the country, we must bravely undertake them, we must bravely undertake them!"... The song shattered the silence of the dark night and rushed into the vast wilderness.

2.  Stepping onto the Muddy Road

The slumbering city of ××, nestled against the verdant Thousand Buddha Mountain with its ancient pines and cypresses, quickly disappeared behind us. Beneath our feet, it was no longer a flat road, but a muddy yellow path. This is what all roads in the northern plains become after a few days of rain. Traveling on this road is truly exhausting. Because the soft yellow mud will make you sink deep with every step, and when you lift your back foot to move forward, you will have to exert considerable effort. At the same time, a thick layer of yellow mud will stick to the bottom of your shoes. It is undeniable that walking on such a road is difficult enough. However, because the hopes we hold and the ideals in our hearts are so powerful, we seem to be used to marching on this muddy road, without feeling annoyed or painful at all. Everyone looks into the distance, at the distant sky where the silver light of dawn dances, and strides forward with joy! The vast fields are ours, and we cannot let the × people cross the Yellow River to trample them. Don't forget, we have been taking nourishment from it every year – wheat, millet, soybeans, sorghum – nurturing us, and tens of thousands of our compatriots have been able to grow from weakness because of its strength. We must wave our powerful arms to strike the × people and stop them from advancing; we cannot let them cross the Yellow River...

(3) On the Bank of the Yellow River

We walked onto the outer embankment of the Yellow River. Apart from us, there was hardly a soul on the embankment, only a few families of helpless old people who were still guarding their broken thatched huts, half-submerged by the flooded river during the summer, struggling painfully to get through each day. It seemed that all the tragic realities could never trap them.

Turning from the outer embankment onto the inner embankment, people could see the huge, gray-black ×× Iron Bridge in the distance. When we reached the riverbank, we saw the mighty, surging river. How magnificent and beautiful that wide and distant flow of water was! Looking at it, we couldn't help but cheer. Comrade Yi Wu even louder, praised madly:

Yellow River, my dear mother!

You are the birthplace of China,

The heart of our motherland.

Since the time of our ancestors,

– You have nurtured us. Now, for more than five thousand years, when have you ever been humiliated by violence? When have you been harmed by the barbarians? But – now, the × bandits are pouncing on you like hungry wolves, wanting to destroy you. To protect you, we will spare no effort and desperately drive away the × people to bring honor to our Chinese ancestors!

4.  Crossing the River

Sitting on the wooden boat crossing the river, I felt a little dizzy, because the rapid current was shaking the boat too violently. Looking at the water, it was yellow, swirling rapidly and flowing east. Looking at the sky, it was azure blue, as if slowly turning. And the yellow and clear earthen embankments on both sides seemed to be chasing and playing with the swirling water and the rotating sky. Water, sky, and embankment...

When the boat was about to reach the shore, we saw an armed comrade standing under the neatly cut golden poplar trees. We immediately recognized him. It was Comrade Yao Dihong – a very upright, straightforward, and spirited young man. Before the war of resistance, he was studying in Japan. The cannons of Lugou Bridge enraged him, so he left × country and ran back into the arms of his motherland. He joined the Shandong Zhixun Office, nominally serving as a secretary, and he had enthusiasm and perseverance in his work.

"Welcome, comrades! I didn't expect you to come so quickly, you must be tired!" Secretary Yao said to us kindly and smiled happily.

Seeing him, we knew that the main force had not yet set off. Seeing his excited appearance, we all felt infinite joy in our hearts. We sincerely replied to him, "We're not tired. These dozens of miles are nothing. Being able to catch up with the main force is enough to compensate for all the fatigue."

5.  "Boom! Boom!"

The cold wind of late autumn blew down many yellowed poplar leaves. The leaves fell on the ground, weaving a beautiful shawl for the earth. When people stepped on them, they made a rustling sound, a kind of unique and pleasant melody.

In the clear blue sky, a heavy sound of motors suddenly came. Immediately, we realized that × planes were coming to attack. At this time, everyone was not panicked, but anger filled their chests.

"Comrades! It's the sound of bombers! Lie down! Lean against the embankment. Look! The planes are already over our heads."

The motors of the × planes roared like the screams of wild boars. The wings, laden with bombs, vibrated violently, making a piercing sound. The ground, enveloped by this sound, was temporarily silent. Only the anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns of the ×× Bridge were firing like a string of pearls.

I craned my neck and searched for the shadow of the planes following the sound. "Ah! One! Two! Three!... Eight! Nine!" The fire of inner hatred burned fiercely. I felt that my eyeballs were larger than usual.

"Boom! Boom..." A huge, earth-shattering sound deafened my head. The × planes cruelly dropped bombs. Smoke and dust erupted on the embankment, and waves and foam rose several feet high in the river. Two civilian boats, loaded with trucks and crossing the river, capsized in the floating debris...

"Damn it! What a cruel thing. Comrades, did you see that? Those two boats, in addition to the trucks, had dozens of our good people on board. After the × planes left, we patted the yellow dirt off our bodies. Secretary Yao pointed to the center of the river and said painfully and angrily. We didn't bother to look at the deep pit that had just been blasted out not far from us. Everyone looked at the center of the river, where some masts were barely visible, and shook their heads.

"Dear brothers, rest in peace! We will not forget your tragic deaths. We will avenge you."

Secretary Yao said loudly to the center of the river. On his long, rectangular face, which usually wore a smile, floated a kind of unpleasant expression made up of sorrow and anger.

(6) Night March

Near dusk, the air was especially crisp. The sounds from the front clearly reverberated in our eardrums. Yi Wu and I carefully listened and distinguished them. "The heavy and urgent sound is the artillery fire from the × planes." "The slow one is our artillery fire."

All the comrades were in the courtyard, disregarding everything, sitting on the icy ground, forming a large circle, lightly chatting and guessing what Secretary Yao had called everyone together for.

Wearing a long face that was both amiable and very serious, Secretary Yao straightened his slender body and walked from the front courtyard. When he stood still, he raised his pair of not very large hands, looked at everyone very spiritedly, and then began to speak forcefully:

"Comrades! We originally planned to rest here for the night, but things will not allow us to do so. We just received intelligence that the × people's plainclothes team has a plan to attack tonight... We are young, enthusiastic, and powerful, and we should have fought them, but we don't have any weapons, except for this pistol I have." He pulled his pistol out from his waist, raised it for us to see, and then quickly put it back in place. "Everyone thinks, if we prepared to fight the × people regardless of everything, I'm afraid our two hundred and forty promising comrades will sacrifice in vain without any value."

After a brief silence, he decisively continued.

"Comrades, we must die heavier than Mount Tai, not lighter than a feather... The heavy responsibility of developing the twelve counties in the Liberation Area is on our shoulders, so we must avoid this worthless sacrifice. Prepare immediately and set off westward!"...

In the gathering dusk, we walked out of the river and marched forward along the Yellow River embankment. Everyone knew that we might encounter the × people somewhere. The willow trees on the river embankment danced under the bright crescent moon, and the shadows of the trees on the ground also swayed. The river roared mournfully and beautifully.

"Don't worry. Walk forward with peace of mind." Secretary Yao comforted us amiably, "We can get out of danger after walking a few more miles ahead."

Enduring fatigue and hunger, we completed a journey of forty miles and rested in a civilian house on the embankment. Everyone fell asleep haphazardly. The kitchen, the cowshed, the courtyard, and the oxcart were all the sweetest beds. In a low and dirty kitchen, the ground was piled with firewood. I lay down on my military blanket in that kitchen and spent the rest of the night.

"Are you asleep?" It was Secretary Yao's voice. Then, he stepped in with a military mat in his hand. Seeing how I was sleeping, he pulled me up: "Are you still going to walk forward tomorrow? Sleeping like this, the firewood will make your whole body ache. Take this!" He handed me the straw mat he had written on. How could I be so embarrassed to take it? But he personally put it on the firewood for me and said with concern, "Isn't it good to sleep with this?"

"Thank you," I sincerely thanked him, so I didn't know what to say. Finally, looking at his kind and approachable face, I couldn't help but ask, "Then where do you sleep?"

"Don't worry, I have a place to sleep. Okay, see you tomorrow. I have to go see the other comrades."

Soon, that long figure turned from the doorway and disappeared into the darkness through the window.

### Our Fresh Troops Cross the River to Reinforce, Jin × Suffers Nearly 10,000 Casualties, Offensive Exhausted, We Adopt Mobile Tactics, Achieving Repeated Victories

[Special dispatch from our Chongqing correspondent on the 19th] × adopts a defensive posture on all fronts. The major battle in southern Shanxi, with the foothills of Zhongtiao Mountain as the battlefield, continues to unfold. × launched its first offensive and fought bitterly for more than ten days, but its offensive has been exhausted, and it has suffered nearly 10,000 casualties. It is currently awaiting respite. We are adopting mobile tactics, making vertical and horizontal assaults, and coordinating with folk forces such as the Red Spear Society, strictly implementing a scorched-earth policy. Fresh troops continue to cross the river. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented major victory in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, and the defense of Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei will be absolutely consolidated.

Glorious Battle Records of Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] In the recent battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, × has suffered unusually heavy casualties and is now retreating towards Fengxian, Wenxi, and Yuncheng. We are in pursuit. In total, in this battle, × attacked us with three times our forces and a large number of poison gas shells, fighting for ten days and nights. We suffered more than 3,000 casualties, while × suffered many times more. In this unprecedented bloody battle, there are indeed many glorious stories that are worth singing and crying about. For example, in the battle of Maojinbei, Company Commander Yang Shiwu and his entire company, in the battle of Pinglu, Regiment Commander Zheng Peiyuan and all his soldiers, all died for their country. Battalion Commander Fan Wenyin also died heroically in the battle of Guwang. All are worthy of respect and chill the hearts of ×.

[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 18th] On the night of the 15th, our troops attacked Zhangdian East and West, × could not resist and fled westward. We immediately recovered the area and continued to pursue, occupying the line of Guwangdongyan by noon on the 16th. We are still continuing to advance westward. The majority of × is fleeing westward. In recent days, × casualties have reached six or seven thousand.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] In recent days, the fighting between our × and × has been very fierce in the villages southeast of Zhangdian. Yandi Village and Guocun Village have been recovered by our troops. On the 14th and 15th, we killed more than a thousand ×. The majority of × in the area are now fleeing north, and they are engaged in fierce fighting with us in the area of Hetaotu and Yuejiazhuang.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] On the morning of the 15th, the × in Fencheng, together with more than a thousand × from Xiwang Village and other places, attacked the Yanshan area with four cannons attached. Our army set up an ambush in the critical area. From 8:00 a.m., fierce battles broke out between our × and × in Sanguanhuo, Bugu, and other places. Around 3:00 p.m., × gradually moved back. After a fierce attack by our troops, the × formation was thrown into chaos and fled in a panic. In this battle, hundreds of × were killed, and we suffered more than ten casualties.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 19th] After our troops occupied the line of Dachen Village and Pinglu on the 17th, the remaining × fled in disarray towards Zhangdian Town and Houwang, in a very miserable state. They indiscriminately burned and killed along the way. We comforted and appeased the people on the one hand, and actively advanced south of Zhangdian on the other.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 19th] The × in southern Shanxi have been frequently mobilized recently. Up to the evening of the 17th, it was heard that Wenxi had increased × by more than 4,000, and Ji County had increased × by more than 3,000. Cars of × bandits were constantly traveling back and forth between Wenxi and Hedi (east of Wenxi). The × in Xia County are constantly attacking Chuanjia Xie Wende Village (east of Xia County) and other places, attempting to enter the mountains in separate routes.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 18th] The war situation in northern Henan is quite calm. On the night of the 6th, our troops, under the cover of artillery fire, once attacked the × army in Xixiang (about 20 kilometers northwest of Qinyang). Because it was late at night, × was unprepared. One of their ammunition depots was destroyed by us, and many × were killed. On the 16th and 17th, hundreds of × infantry and cavalry, with several tanks attached, were reported to be coming to aid. We briefly contacted them, and because our mission had been accomplished, we safely returned to our defense.

Wounded Soldiers and Corpses Cremated, Transported to Japan in Large Quantities

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] According to military information, the statistics of × transporting wounded soldiers and cremated corpses back to Tianjin and Guandong in late May are as follows: (1) More than 2,400 wounded soldiers and eight cars of cremated corpses, plus 2,000 bags, totaling about 10,000 people, were transported from various counties along the Pinghan and Pingsui lines and southern Shanxi to Tianjin. (2) 1,050 × wounded soldiers and 400 bags of cremated corpses were transported from Shijiazhuang to Tianjin. (3) 100 bags of cremated corpses were transported from Tangguanshan to Tianjin. (4) 538 bags of × soldiers' ashes, totaling 1,614 people, and more than 450 wounded soldiers were transported from Beiping to Tanggu. (5) 338 bags of × soldiers' cremated corpses, totaling 714 people, were transported from Tongzhou to Tanggu. (6) 15 bags of cremated corpses of senior officers, totaling 190 people, 420 bags of lower-level officers, totaling 420 people, and 500 bags of soldiers, totaling 500 people, were transported from the Jinpu line to Tanggu. (7) More than 400 wounded soldiers were transported from Jinan to Tanggu. (8) Corpses cremated officers and soldiers were shipped in 52 bags and 41 bags respectively from Jinan to Guandong. (9) More than 300 × wounded soldiers were transported from the Pingsui line to Dalian. In total, more than 4,600 × wounded soldiers and 14,110 cremated corpses were transported back from various places in ten days. It can be seen that the × army suffered a large number of casualties.

The Situation South of the Yangtze River is Stable

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 18th] On the evening of the 17th, our troops attacked the × west of Beigang, Tongcheng, first using a small number of troops to lure × out and then ambushing the main force at various key points. When × approached, we concentrated our firepower and launched a surprise attack on ×, killing more than a hundred and capturing one light machine gun, eight rifles, one telephone, five helmets, and many diaries and documents. The remaining × fled back to Beigang.

[Central News Agency, Yingde, 19th] On the morning of the 16th, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry fled from Longkou to the vicinity of Shibaling (southwest of Huaxian). After being ambushed by our troops on the left and right, many were wounded and killed. By noon, × had increased to more than 500, and the fighting between the two sides was fierce. Our troops sent out surprise soldiers to cut off the rear of ×. All of × were surrounded by us and are currently being attacked.

[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 19th] The × in Jiangmen and Xinhui harassed Guzhen, Zhongshan, on the 15th and 16th and were repelled by us. They turned to rob grain from villages near Sanjiang and were severely attacked by our local forces, retreating back to Beijie. On the 17th, they sent patrol boats to the vicinity of Sanjiang and shot indiscriminately before fleeing.

### Han × Gasoline is Burned, Anti-War Elements Set Fire

[Central News Agency, Shashi, 19th] A large batch of gasoline, a total of more than 8,000 boxes, was transported to the Jianghanguan Wharf in Hankou by ×. × soldiers guarded it day and night, very strictly. On the afternoon of the 16th, a sudden fire completely destroyed it. After the × Military Police investigated, it was said that the fire was caused by anti-war elements.

### Traitors in Yueyang Executed by ×

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 19th] Cao Zhuru, the head of the puppet maintenance association in Yueyang, and Zhou Mianzhi, the deputy head, acted as accomplices and poisoned the residents. A few days ago, × ordered them to collect strong men within ten days for × to drive. Because the traitors failed to collect and report on time, and because the traitors failed to collect enough gold and silver for × military use, they failed to satisfy × desires, which angered ×. They were shot in the suburbs a few days ago. The fate of the traitors can be a warning.

### Compatriots in Occupied Areas Believe in Legal Tender

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 19th] The Jiaozuo × army recently searched households in the city, strictly confiscating any legal currency they found and arresting and punishing the people. However, our compatriots have a strong belief in the legal currency, which they still secretly use. The price is also rising, but no one cares about counterfeit money.

### Shaanxi Mobilization Committee Expanded, Reorganized, and Established

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] The Shaanxi Provincial Mobilization Committee held its inaugural meeting at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th after being expanded and reorganized. More than 300 people, including Central Committee Member Zhang Ji, Supervisory Committee Member Yang Rentian, Jiang Dingwen, local gentry, and heads of organs, attended. The Director of the Mobilization Committee, Jiang Dingwen, delivered a report on the significance of the expansion, reorganization, and establishment after performing the ceremony. Zhang Ji and others then gave speeches, hoping that all the people of Shaanxi would deeply understand the current situation, actively mobilize and participate in wartime work, so as to achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance and building the country. Finally, the Director spoke of the importance of Central appointment and promotion of Internal & Civil policies to win the war of resistance.

### Meng Shao Yi is Shot, Our Newspaper Telegraphs Shanghai to Express Condolences

Shanghai Shenbao editorial board member Qu Shao Yi was shot by the murderers of the "Communist Eradication Special Task Force Headquarters" organized by Wang Ni. Our newspaper specially telegraphed Shanghai to express condolences. After receiving a reply telegram, it was said that the bullet in the buttocks had been taken out and the condition was improving.

### Zhou Zhongyue, Li Peiji, etc. Sworn in, Wu Jingheng Sent by Central Government to Supervise, Chairman Lin and Others Gave Instructions in Succession

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] The new Minister of the Interior Zhou Zhongyue, Minister of Examination and Appointment Li Peiji, and Deputy Minister of the Interior Zhang Weihan held a swearing-in ceremony at the National Government Auditorium on the morning of the 19th after the Central Joint Commemoration Week. Central Committee Member Wu Jingheng was sent by the Central Committee as the supervisor of the ceremony. Chairman Lin personally led the ceremony, which was very grand. After the oath was taken, Committee Member Wu and Chairman Lin gave instructions in succession, praising the past achievements of the three and expressing the hope that they would support the Central Committee in the future, be more loyal and diligent, actively promote internal and civil policies, adapt to the needs of the war of resistance, and strive to quickly achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance and building the country. At the end, Minister Zhou and Minister Li gave answers, expressing their respect for the instructions, obedience to the leadership of their superiors, and hard work in their duties, so as not to disappoint the good intentions of the Central appointment. After the speech, the ceremony was completed.

### National Government Order

【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 The National Government, on the 19th, issued an order stating that Mr. P. T. Powell, a hydraulic engineering expert from the International League, has been serving in our country for eight years. He has diligently and remarkably assisted in the planning of various hydraulic projects. This time, while surveying water conservancy in the Jinsha River with Zhang Jiong, a technician from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Hu Yunzhou, a member of the Southwest Transportation Administration, they encountered numerous dangers during the trial voyage, but they did not retreat in the slightest. Unfortunately, the boat capsized, resulting in their demise. We deeply mourn their past contributions and feel profound regret. Zhang Jiong and Hu Yunzhou were both courageous in their duties and died in the line of duty, which is commendable. An order should be issued to commend them, and Mr. P. T. Powell should be given a consolation payment of 10,000 yuan, and Zhang Jiong and Hu Yunzhou should each receive 5,000 yuan, to encourage others. This is the order.

### Special Correspondence from Our Newspaper: Travels in Luofu (6)

— Firefly

The night was dark, but everyone's heart was burning with fervor. We first gathered in the building that housed the regiment headquarters, which was packed with people, men and women, talking and laughing. Regiment Commander Chen was very busy, running to the telephone room at one moment and returning the next. Soon, the orderly came again and said, "Commander, please answer the phone." He then ran out again, walking back and forth. Thus, his words were disorganized. The fourth time he returned, he raised his large right hand and said with fervor, "This afternoon at 3 o'clock, over seventy bombs fell on Boluo City, killing and wounding over a hundred civilians, damn it!" "Ah! Another big bombing!" Secretary Zhu exclaimed involuntarily. Colleagues were all concerned about this news, running to the telephone to make calls, making the technicians busy for a while. However, after connecting with Xinzhu Tang, they could not directly communicate with Boluo City due to power issues. They had to ask Xinzhu Tang to inquire about the news. Anger filled this practice room.

The meeting time arrived, and we gathered in a square again. The square was a threshing ground used by the villagers. Two large kerosene lamps were arranged at the east and west corners. A sandalwood chair in the middle was considered the chairman's seat. This was already prepared by Director Cui Zhengxun. Old and young, men and women, villagers had gathered around. The meeting began after we arrived.

Judging from the participants, it could be said to be a carnival for all walks of life, rather than a military-civilian gathering. Wasn't it so? Regiment Commander Chen, Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang, Director Cui Zhengxun, and many armed colleagues were present, along with Staff Officers Lin and Zhang from the General Headquarters, section chiefs and staff from the county government, the secretary of the county party headquarters, representatives from various organizations, and even several representatives from overseas. There were also observers and adjutants from the Zengcheng Guerrilla Headquarters, personnel from other political work teams and combat engineering corps, as well as village chiefs and heads of the baojia system, plus local people. These people, facing the light, facing the fire, were all gathered together in a square.

A representative from the county government was temporarily elected as chairman. Amidst applause, the chairman announced the significance of the gathering. "…At the front line, it is very valuable for our military and civilians from all walks of life to hold a carnival on this line of fire… Here, we no longer distinguish between class, gender, age, or occupation. We have formed a great wall of flesh and blood… Our singing, perhaps, the enemy sentries can hear it, and they will naturally tremble… With such great unity and great spirit of sacrifice, final victory will surely belong to us…" These bomb-like words slipped out of the chairman's mouth, and the applause sent the sound waves of the chairman's speech to the mountain ridges of Luofu. Following that, Regiment Commander Chen, Director Cui Zhengxun, and Secretary Zhu all excitedly delivered powerful speeches. The heads of the baojia system faithfully reported, criticized the army, and expressed their hatred for the enemy. They knew the need for democracy and that the army must win battles. They emphasized the importance of political education and military-civilian cooperation, otherwise, China would have no hope. Their words were realistic and frank.

"Defend South China, on Mount Luofu, young aviators, strike the enemy's rear…" Vigorous discussions echoed from the meeting place to the fields. The brothers of the Special Service Company were urged to the point of being unable to refuse and performed the "hit" to respond to all sectors. They practiced their martial arts, hitting the heads, smashing a thick stack of tiles on their heads with one blow. They also said, "This is how we strike the enemy."

The gathering of strength and fire awakened the quiet countryside, and the lively night meeting ended at half past ten.

Concentrate Strength on Mount Luofu

In the early morning, Mount Luofu was entirely verdant. The sun was still hidden behind the mountain, in the distant clouds. All the people near the villages along the highway, dragging their children and carrying their bedding and livestock, walked towards the highway near Luofu and into the embrace of Luofu. Four or three beasts in the sky belonging to the invaders constantly came to the villages to scout and drop bombs. The sound of bombs constantly exploded around us. The villagers wandered around like chicks encountering a hawk, running around. Luofu was like a powerful hen, spreading its wings to protect the chicks. Groups of chicks burrowed into the vast hen's embrace. This was the instinctive expression of the front-line compatriots who were unwilling to be slaughtered, unwilling to be abused, and unwilling to become obedient subjects.

Our comfort delegation held an emergency meeting and decided that "part of the people would rush through the line of fire to save those comfort goods. A part of the foreign representatives and women representatives, a total of six people, led by Secretary Zhu, would immediately start the journey back to the county seat via the original route. A part of the people would follow the army to Mount Luofu." This meeting was completed in less than ten minutes, and the agenda was implemented. I felt that the greatest thing was the anti-aggression war.

I was one of those who followed the army to Mount Luofu. I immediately went to the regimental headquarters to meet the regimental commander. The regimental commander was waiting for orders. I asked him about the front-line situation. He said with confidence that enemy cavalry had been discovered five miles away from here, and Company XX and Company XX were intercepting them. I explained my purpose, and he said with concern, "We have decided to advance to Chongxu along the highway. This route is greatly threatened by the air. You can go up the mountain on a safer road." As he spoke, he pointed to a grove of trees and explained that it was the gathering place for the radio squad. They had been designated to proceed north to Mount Luofu and could directly reach Suzao Temple if necessary. He urged us to gather quickly. After seeing this situation, we understood half of what the front-line situation was like.

### American Newspapers Suggest the Government Sever Diplomatic Relations with Japan, Strike at Japan's Ambitions to Seize Concessions, Uphold Justice, and Protect American Interests

【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 According to TASS, New York, 19th, "The Herald Tribune" editorial proposes that if Japan continues to blockade the Tianjin and Gulangyu concessions, the United States should immediately sever diplomatic and commercial relations with it. The newspaper strongly argues that regardless of the attitudes of Britain and France, the United States must make a firm statement to Japan that the United States is unwilling to maintain friendly diplomatic and commercial relations with countries that launch wars of aggression and infringe upon their rights.

【Reuters, Shanghai, 19th】 The "China Press," an English-language newspaper run by Americans here, published an article tonight commenting on the situation in Tianjin, urging the U.S. government to take the same stand as Britain and France, and warning that if the United States believes that it has no territorial interests in Tianjin and does not cooperate with Britain and France, it will only encourage Japan to take the same actions in Shanghai.

### Japanese Naval Minister Blatantly Declares Not Afraid of Anglo-French Cooperation, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Visits Japanese Foreign Ministry, Talks on Reopening Gulangyu Negotiations

Tianjin Situation Deteriorates

【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 Tokyo News: Naval Minister Yonai has been inspecting various provinces recently, and has now returned here yesterday after completing his duties. He also made a statement, saying that there are rumors outside that the British and French navies are considering taking joint action. If these rumors are true, Japan has nothing to fear. Regarding the Tianjin incident, Yonai said that the Tokyo government is determined to fully support the position of the Japanese authorities in Tianjin so that the matter can be resolved locally. Regarding the Gulangyu incident, the government's policy has not changed, and it deeply hopes that Consul General Okada will be able to return to his post in Xiamen so that the matter can be resolved effectively. Regarding the opening of China's inland rivers, the government has decided on a basic policy, but this matter must not be handled carelessly.

【Reuters, Tokyo, 19th】 According to a declaration issued by the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, the blockade of Tianjin is entirely directed against the British concession because the British concession serves as "an organization of the Kuomintang." The British side has stated that the Japanese demands affect countries that have treaty relations with China, intending to "lure the United States to pull chestnuts out of the fire." However, the blockade is not aimed at any other country, let alone against the United States. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Japan visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, meeting with Yoshizawa, the Director of the American Affairs Bureau, to exchange views on the situation in Tianjin. According to Domei News Agency, the Japanese Consul General in Xiamen returned to his post from Tokyo yesterday, and it is expected that he will reopen negotiations with the foreign consular authorities on the situation in Gulangyu. The Japanese government will continue to support the attitude of the Japanese authorities in the area. Furthermore, according to the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, the barbed wire surrounding the British concession will be electrified starting tonight.

### Anti-British Propaganda Intensifies, Insults Against Foreigners Continue to Occur

【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 Tianjin Foreign News: The Japanese method of blockading the concession has not been relaxed in the slightest. At the same time, the anti-British propaganda in Japanese newspapers is becoming increasingly intensified. Anti-British leaflets are everywhere, and radio stations are constantly engaged in anti-British propaganda. Loudspeakers are installed everywhere, whether in thoroughfares or remote alleys. The food problem here is more serious than before. The Chairman of the British Concession's Municipal Council told a Reuters reporter that there are currently many rice and flour reserves, but the source of vegetables, meat, and fish has been cut off because Japanese ships are patrolling the river and preventing their import. As for the British in the concession, because two compatriots have been humiliated while trying to go to the British Concession's racecourse, they are determined to stay in the concession. Yesterday, a British national, a male, intended to go to the racecourse, but was ordered by Japanese soldiers to take off his clothes and stand naked for inspection. The cans he was carrying were opened. Another British national, a female, was also insulted by the patrol officers, who slandered her in Chinese. The British national, who had some knowledge of Chinese, was ashamed and indignant upon hearing this and almost became hysterical. Japanese sentries were also present at the time, and she was only able to pass with the assistance of some German nationals. In addition, Mrs. Tangna Lai, a British national, and Mrs. Luo Jie, an American national, found the indoor temperature in the concession to be 105 degrees Fahrenheit, making it unbearable. They went beyond the boundary to breathe fresh air. When they passed through the wooden fence, the Japanese did not stop them, but when they returned to the boundary, they refused to allow them to pass. After much negotiation, there was no result. The two had to walk two miles, detour to another entrance, and were finally allowed to pass. These two are both natives of China. Furthermore, a British national named Smith was previously arrested by the Japanese after arguing with a Chinese constable. Although the British Consul General has lodged a protest, he has not yet been released. The British companies Jardine Matheson and Taikoo have telegraphed their Shanghai headquarters, saying that they can continue to ship goods to Tianjin. Eleven ships from the two companies arrived in Tianjin yesterday and docked at the British Concession's wharves. Japanese cruisers did not interfere.

Electrified Wire Mesh, Tightening the Blockade

【Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 19th】 The Japanese military commander in Tianjin issued a notice stating that starting at 9:00 PM on Monday, the wire mesh surrounding the British and French concessions will be electrified. According to Chinese sources, the wire is 50 kilometers long and has 220 volts of electricity. The notice was written in English.

British Consul General Issues Notice

【Reuters, London, 19th】 The situation here remains calm on the surface. The British Consul General has issued a notice requesting that British nationals remain in the concession and not go out unless absolutely necessary.

British Ships Risking Danger to Dock in the Concession

【Reuters, Tianjin, 19th】 Although the Japanese blockade of food is extremely strict, two large British ships were able to break through the Japanese inspection on the Hai River and dock at the British Concession's embankment. Therefore, the owners of these ships immediately telegraphed their Shanghai offices to resume loading goods for Tianjin. (Note: The British Consulate had previously advised them to temporarily suspend shipping.)

Japanese Threatening Chinese Constables in the Concession

【Reuters, Tianjin, 19th】 Japanese military secret agents, dressed in civilian clothes, distributed leaflets to the Chinese police of the British Concession's Municipal Council today, threatening them. If the Chinese police do not immediately separate from the British Concession authorities, the Japanese side will take "action" against them. Regarding this Japanese action, the British Consul General will lodge a strong protest.

Gulangyu Food Supplies, Escorted by Warships

【Reuters, Seven Seas, 19th】 According to news from Gulangyu, the British, French, and American authorities there have recently formed an International Food Committee, preparing to use foreign ships to transport food into the area because the blockade there has not been lifted.

【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 Shanghai Foreign News: Reliable sources report that the food situation on Gulangyu is deteriorating. The authorities plan to send British and American warships to transport food to Gulangyu to aid the foreigners there.

### New Interior Minister Zhou Zhongyue Announces Internal Administrative Policies: Rectify Discipline, Improve Administrative Cadres, and Strive to Advance Relief and Anti-Smoking Efforts

【Dalu News Agency, Guizhou】 After He Jian was transferred, the National Government immediately appointed Zhou Zhongyue as the new Minister of the Interior and Zhang Weihan as the Vice Minister of Political Affairs. After being appointed, the two arrived at the ministry together at 1:00 PM on the 16th, officially took office, and summoned ministry officials to give them some words of encouragement. At noon, Zhou made a written statement to the press, stating that he considered the training of strong men, charitable relief, and the vigorous implementation of smoking bans to be the important tasks that need to be strengthened and developed. The statement is attached below.

Zhou's Statement

I am weak and lack talent, and I am afraid I will not be able to bear the heavy responsibility. This time, I was ordered by the Central Government to serve as Minister of the Interior. I repeatedly asked to decline, but was not granted approval. I can only encourage myself to serve the country. Today, I am being asked about my political views. I believe that the Ministry of the Interior has been established for a long time, has legal responsibilities, and has plans drawn up by previous leaders. We should follow laws and regulations and implement them effectively. There are no special political views, but there are a few things I should pay attention to now, which can be summarized briefly: (1) Actively promote local government affairs to adapt to wartime essentials. During the war of resistance, the military is the top priority, but internal administration, such as the training of strong men, charitable relief, immigration and reclamation, and local defense, are all related to the military. We should intensify our efforts to implement military service, strengthen mass organizations, and protect the rear to strengthen the war of resistance and achieve the final victory.

Improve Internal Administration

(2) Earnestly improve internal administration to establish a foundation for national construction. Our war of resistance is not a simple military struggle, but a political war to defend the nation's independence. Therefore, we are not only resisting the invasion of Japanese warlords, but also completing the task of nation-building. Nation-building is a vast undertaking, but in the process of the war of resistance, we must start with the most essential and basic parts. Regarding national construction, we have the instructions of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Strategy for National Construction and the Fundamentals of National Construction. Also, the War of Resistance and National Construction Program passed by the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in March 1938, such as improving mass self-defense organizations, completing local autonomy conditions, improving political institutions at all levels, and rectifying the discipline of officials at all levels, are all the responsibilities within the scope of internal affairs. In addition, conducting a census, reorganizing the police, strictly prohibiting smoking, and paying attention to hygiene are all important policies at present. We should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and the Central Government's program, concentrate our efforts and strive to advance to lay a good foundation for politics and society.

Local Politics

(3) Adjust local political institutions to promote administrative efficiency. The War of Resistance and National Construction Program lists the improvement of political institutions at all levels, and the lower-level institutions are particularly important, so I will discuss it in particular. Originally, local governments are institutions that directly govern civil affairs and are also the last institutions to directly receive orders from the central and provincial governments. All national internal affairs laws are to be implemented by the county local governments. If the organization of county local political institutions is not perfect and all government orders cannot be promoted, then the plans and policies of the upper-level political institutions will become empty talk. Since the outbreak of this war of resistance, many unhealthy facts have been discovered in local politics, which are often inflexible and insufficient to cope with the situation in this extraordinary period. Our highest leader has seen this and formulated the "Draft of the Relationship between Party and Government Institutions below the County Level" in 1938 as a preliminary design draft. The County Government Planning Committee was also established to discuss the facilities of local political institutions in detail. In the Party and Government Cadre Training Class, he gave a lecture on "Determining the Issue of Local Organizations below the County Level," which has detailed plans for party-government relations and organizational organizations, which can be used as our preparation for transforming county government. We hope that this plan can be implemented as soon as possible to meet the requirements of the times and be in line with local conditions.

Administrative Personnel

(4) Train administrative personnel at all levels to complete the work of political tutelage. All national laws and regulations depend on the promotion of local governments, as mentioned above. We know that the more human society evolves, the more local public affairs there are. Also, during the war of resistance, the position of local governments is more important. However, national laws and regulations are pushed to the counties, and the counties push them to the villages. Because the villagers do not have political literacy, good gentlemen often shrink back, and there are too few people who advocate public affairs among the masses. Therefore, the lack of effectiveness of local autonomy over the years and the difficulty in implementing conscription and raising public debt are all due to this. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Fundamentals of National Construction require that before implementing party politics, there must be a stage of political tutelage. In recent years, the training of the masses has not been universal, so the work of political tutelage has not yet been completed. Now, when the country is in serious crisis, we must obtain a large number of outstanding elements in society, cultivate practical talents, to lead the masses, mobilize people's power, and concentrate the nation's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to contribute to the country, so that we can complete the great cause of war resistance and national construction. I have just arrived at the ministry and am not yet familiar with the ministry's affairs, so I can only talk about a few points that I have thought of at present. As for the actual situation in internal administration in the future, it must be developed with the national policies at any time, which cannot be predicted at this moment.

### Tianjin Situation: British and Japanese Still Deadlocked; Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons; Roosevelt Closely Monitors Developments

[Reuters, London, 19th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning to discuss the situation in Tianjin. Prime Minister Chamberlain will give a detailed report to the House of Commons this afternoon on the development of the Tianjin Incident.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to a question in the House of Commons regarding the Tianjin Incident, stated today that the Tianjin Incident has become a general policy issue. The request for the extradition of the four Chinese has now been muddled and is no longer of great importance. Regarding this matter, no official note has yet been received from the Japanese government. He hopes that this matter can still be resolved locally.

[Reuters, New York, 19th] According to the Washington correspondent of The Times, the State Department denied today that Britain and France are approaching the United States, offering a plan for joint action between the three countries to deal with Japan's opposition to foreign concessions in China. However, President Roosevelt is closely monitoring the development of the Far Eastern situation at all times.

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] Sources close to the Foreign Office here recently declared that the hope for a compromise solution to the Tianjin Incident is extremely slim. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss various preventive measures and economic retaliation methods. The former is intended to prevent further incidents in Tianjin that could lead to dangerous conflicts. The latter involves implementing the following measures in order within a few days if the current dispute cannot be resolved locally in a friendly manner: 1. Abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911. 2. Impose high import duties on Japanese goods entering British colonies. 3. Restrict the import volume of Japanese goods. 4. Counter Japanese currency with special measures and intensify support for Chinese legal tender. Up to now, the British government has not asked the United States for support to avoid any appearance of coercing the United States. However, it is expected that if Britain takes strong action, the United States will also participate.

Will Japan Soften?

[Reuters, London, 19th] "The Times" published an article today stating, "According to recent news from Tokyo, the Japanese government seems to be beginning to seek negotiations. The Japanese army in North China issued a declaration on the 13th of this month, the threatening tone of which is unacceptable to any self-respecting country. However, the semi-official declaration issued last Saturday and Sunday has gradually softened. It seems premature to think that Japan has used its diplomatic means to deal with this matter. However, if Japan is indeed prepared to seek a solution through diplomatic means, it would be a good thing. Otherwise, the British government should take resolute action to protect its interests in the Far East, as demanded by public opinion."

[Reuters, London, 19th] The "Daily Telegraph" reported, "There are many ways to make Japan lose 'face.' Even with this unwarranted oppression implemented by Japan, there is more than one way for us to implement economic retaliation. But at the same time, most importantly, the residents besieged and blockaded within Tianjin must not be allowed to suffer starvation. If diplomatic channels cannot be used to persuade Japan to stop the transportation of food, then British warships must be responsible for providing relief. American expatriates are involved along with British expatriates. Admiral Yarnell's visit to Tianjin may be a turning point in this matter." The newspaper also stated that it is absolutely unacceptable to abandon the concessions, "The imperialism of the Western powers may have forced China to establish many unfair transactions, but the imperialism of Japan has absolutely no transactions to speak of. Its purpose is to use the intimidation of bayonets to plunder China's resources and manpower."

A Wave of Strong Voices in Britain!

[Reuters, London, 18th] British Admiral Keyes, in a speech to participants in an air defense volunteer parade in London today, stated: "Japan, with the support of Germany and Italy, launched the Tianjin Incident, which is tantamount to declaring war on Britain. This provocative act must be met with resolute retaliation." Admiral Keyes believes that if Britain can make a determination, maintain a strong stance, and show the world that Britain is prepared to fight aggressors with its wealth, industry, and manpower, the result will be victory without moving a single soldier.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Labor MP Greenwood, in a speech in West Bromwich today, said, "Japan, believing it is encouraged by its European friends, has deliberately disregarded Britain and its own international obligations. We urgently need to show countries with dictatorial regimes and military juntas whether Britain and other democratic countries in the Far East or Western Europe can tolerate this organized disregard for the foundations of international law and the attempt to rule the world by force. World peace is now endangered, but this is not what the people of Germany, Italy, and Japan want. It is caused by the ambitions of the rulers of these three countries. These ambitions must be defeated." Greenwood also criticized the British government's policies, asserting that the threatening situation was also caused by British policies.

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Today, all the newspapers here have commented extensively on the Far Eastern situation. "Le Petit Journal" issued a warning, saying that if they continue to amuse themselves by igniting the gunpowder keg next to them, the final explosion in the Far East will be difficult to avoid. The newspaper also said that the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Incident should be resolved, because restoring normal relations between Britain and Japan is in their mutual fundamental interest. "Le Temps" stated, "Effective economic sanctions must have the support of military force. Therefore, the meeting between the British and French commanders in Singapore has special significance." The famous political commentator Patina wrote in "L'Ordre," "It is not difficult for Japan to seize the concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin by force, but sooner or later it will be subjected to the influence of Europe's determination to resist, and it will not be able to withstand the powerful economic sanctions of Britain, France, and the United States."

Attacking from All Sides!

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th] Since Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, newspapers in various democratic countries in Europe have unanimously condemned Japan's barbaric actions and urged the British government to take strong countermeasures. The position taken by Swiss newspapers is the same as that of Britain, France, and other countries. "Tribune de Genève," a major Swiss newspaper, recently published an editorial stating that after Japan encountered heroic resistance from China, it turned to attacking white countries. The League of Nations' protection of individual countries aiding China has already taken effect. The Chinese legal tender supported by Western countries will become one of the most stable currencies in the world, while the Japanese yen has only fictitious value. Japan has suffered losses in Shanghai and Gulangyu, and now it is attacking the Tianjin concessions, its purpose is nothing more than to hinder British and French interests, while hoping that the United States will adopt a detached attitude. However, in order to restore the balance of power in the Far East, the Americans should actively intervene.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 19th] Soviet newspapers remained silent on the Tianjin situation until yesterday, when they published a commentary stating that the Tianjin situation was nothing more than an excuse for Japan to create conflict. This is no different from other recent incidents involving British expatriates in China. The current tense situation in the Far East is due to Japan's intention to drive British and American interests out of China and to seize the public concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other seaports.

### Italian Fleet Cruises off the Coast of Morocco

[Central News Agency, Rome, 18th] The ships of the Italian Navy's First Fleet, including two battleships, ten cruisers, and more than twenty destroyers and torpedo boats, led by Admiral Bigati, are scheduled to set sail from the Port of Naples tomorrow morning and cruise to Spain, Portugal, and the African coast of Morocco for about half a month. In addition, according to the Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma," the Italian Second Fleet will also sail to the eastern Mediterranean Sea for a cruise in the near future.

### The King's Whereabouts: Safe Passage Through the Iceberg Zone

[Reuters, London, 18th] According to a special correspondent of Reuters on the "Empress of Britain" liner today, the ship carrying the King and Queen has safely passed through the iceberg zone. When the ship left the iceberg zone at 3:00 pm, the King and Queen were resting. The King and Queen visited the three escorting destroyers last night. The wind and waves were treacherous at the time, but the King and Queen remained calm.

### German Troops Still on the Move on the Slovak Border; Ten Divisions Concentrated

[Reuters, Prague, 19th] It is reported that a large number of German troops continued to be transferred to the Slovak border last weekend. A large number of tanks, armored vehicles, and transport vehicles drove east through here. It is heard that about ten German divisions are currently concentrated on the border, mostly stationed near Ostrava.

### Vatican Representative Leaves Warsaw; Peace Talks Concluded; No Word on Resolution of Danzig

[Reuters, Warsaw, 19th] The Vatican's special envoy, Monsignor Mattei, left here last night for Rome to report to the Pope on his recent talks with the Polish President and Foreign Minister. He also visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck again on Saturday and Sunday for talks. Officials here acknowledge that Mattei expressed something regarding a peaceful resolution of the Danzig dispute. It is said that if the outcome of Mattei's talks here is satisfactory, the Vatican will propose a motion to Germany.

### On Anglo-Soviet Negotiations

-- Written by Ingram, Translated by Shi Chang

From the recent speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to the Congress, we can see that there are still some obstacles between London and Moscow that cannot be completely broken. Therefore, the great alliance to deal with the Axis powers has been delayed for a long time. Mutual suspicion between Britain and the Soviet Union continues to exist. This suspicion is very dangerous. It can undermine the signing of the entire alliance. We have very high hopes for the Anglo-Soviet agreement, so that the invasion becomes a cleanup operation that even Hitler fears, and avoids a European war.

Hitler is a cunning and arrogant observer. He is closely watching the actions of London, Moscow, and Poland. If these countries do not show trust in each other, then even if an alliance is finally concluded, it will not frighten the invincible Hitler!

He believes that suspicion during the negotiation period can hinder actual actions in the future. Poland and Romania, according to his speculation, can only accept the Red Army's minimum assistance. Moreover, military command cannot be unified, and the forces of all parties cannot cooperate. In this situation, effective results cannot be produced. On the other hand, in the Axis countries, all resources are centrally managed, and rapid surprise attacks can be carried out to destroy the enemy's alliance. Therefore, the danger of the current stalemate in Anglo-Soviet negotiations is very obvious. This will not only fail to stop the enemy's aggressive actions, but will also facilitate the enemy's surprise attacks!

The alliance of Fascist Axis countries is very strong. This is not only a defensive alliance, but also an offensive alliance of aggressors. Unity in peacetime is consistent. Once an incident occurs, the leader's order is the law. In 1934, the Soviet Union learned about the situation in Germany after Hitler came to power, and quickly changed its entire international policy, joining the League of Nations, establishing the Franco-Soviet alliance, and so on. British policy has also undergone a transformation, even negotiating with countries that oppose communism. This is really a miracle, and this miracle has finally come.

Many minor difficulties have occurred in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The main obstacle has now been removed. The three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have jointly recognized equal and reciprocal obligations. The main difficulty raised by Molotov was the guarantee for the three Baltic countries. This guarantee is indirect protection for the Soviet Union. We believe that if Germany is determined to attack the Soviet Union, it will simultaneously advance into the Baltic region with its naval, land, and air forces, and will not hesitate to destroy the neutrality of Latvia, Estonia, and Finland. These weak countries have no power to resist, and perhaps they dare not resist. Then, can't Germany use these countries as bases for attacking the Soviet Union? Regarding the issue of guarantees, Britain and France have already agreed.

Britain and France proposed providing guarantees to countries that have been invaded and are prepared to defend themselves, but the Baltic countries are unwilling to accept guarantees because they are afraid of offending Hitler. In other words, they have seen the seemingly united Axis alliance and the Anglo-Soviet negotiations full of suspicion, and they are wondering which side is stronger. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are firmly united and conclude a mutual assistance alliance, this suspicion can be eliminated. At the same time, joint military actions should be taken to defend the neutrality of the Baltic countries. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland should also have the same treatment.

The Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance can cope with war when war breaks out. But what is more important is that in peacetime, mutual assistance can be obtained.

Many people believe that providing economic benefits to Fascist countries can stop their aggressive ambitions. This is a big mistake. What they want is power, not oil! Their goal is not the welfare of the people, but to seize power, oppress others, and indulge in 'appeasing' Fascist dictators. People seem to have forgotten that Japan continues to invade China, and Germany and Italy have destroyed Czechoslovakia and damaged Spain. Therefore, our military strategy should be to stop Hitler from committing further aggression.

Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should immediately conclude an alliance, including military provisions, so that aggressors have no way to start. This is the only proper way to stop aggression and avoid a European war.

A Short Comment

### A Scholar Cannot Be Robbed of His Will

A Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on the 18th proved that the assassin who assassinated Qu Shaoyi of Shen Bao was instigated by the Wang faction. The telegram also specifically pointed out: "The so-called 'Communist Extermination Special Agent Command' was established by the Wang faction in Shanghai, and the funding was provided by the Japanese. Recently, it has repeatedly sent threatening letters to various newspapers."

It is not surprising that Jingwei and others use the name of "Communist Extermination" to help the Japanese harm and intimidate all of us who advocate justice, love the motherland, support the central government, and call for unity in the media. It is also not worth fearing. Let us look at the statement of the Shanghai Guidance News on the 18th! It said: "Upholding our original intention and moving forward, we cannot be shaken by intimidation and despicable means!" The sage said: "The army can be robbed of its commander, but a common man cannot be robbed of his will." How admirable and inspiring is the media in Shanghai!

### Massive Arrest of Unlicensed Hawkers

The day before yesterday afternoon, detectives strictly enforced laws against hawkers, resulting in the arrest of more than eighty male and female unlicensed hawkers in the central district. The news was reported in great detail by various newspapers, making it worthy of being read as a novel—however, after reading this news, I wonder if the reader will also think about it for a moment? Is the poor business of formal hawkers in the Central Market entirely due to the evil deeds of these "unlicensed hawkers"? Where do these "unlicensed hawkers" come from? After these "unlicensed hawkers" are arrested, will the business of formal hawkers flourish? Also, how will these arrested hawkers be dealt with?

### Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons on Anglo-Soviet Negotiations; Some Difficulties Remain; Germany Intensifies Alienation Conspiracy

[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in answering a question in the House of Commons this afternoon about the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, stated that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations are continuing to progress. MP Adams asked whether there were any other outstanding issues in addition to the status of the Baltic countries. The Prime Minister replied, "Yes, there are some other difficult points in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations."

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow. At that time, in addition to discussing the situation in Tianjin, China, it will also study what methods can be used to intensify negotiations with the Soviet Union so that an agreement can be reached as soon as possible. According to news received by the British government, Germany is making every effort to keep the Soviet Union neutral, engaging in business negotiations with the country and dissolving it with a non-aggression pact. Britain must catch up quickly. The Soviet government has submitted a new memorandum, which British Ambassador Sir Seeds has forwarded to London. It will be submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion tomorrow. The memorandum strongly states that Britain and France should provide unconditional and automatic guarantees for the northwestern border of the Soviet Union. That is, whether the Soviet Union is directly or indirectly attacked, Britain and France should automatically and unconditionally provide assistance. It is heard that the British government has exchanged views with the French government on this issue, and will send a new instruction to Ambassador Seeds by telegram tonight to propose a brief plan for the security of the northwestern border of the Soviet Union.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 19th] British newspapers, in view of the increasingly serious situation in Tianjin, unanimously urged the British government to intensify Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The organs of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have requested the government to make concessions to the Soviet Union in order to consolidate Britain's political and military position in the Far East. The Anglo-Soviet alliance is enough to destroy Japan's policy. The "News Chronicle" stated that once the Anglo-Soviet alliance agreement is signed, it is doubtful whether Japan can challenge Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and even the United States.

### Goebbels Utters Absurdities Again in Danzig; Ambitions Revealed Between Brags

[Reuters, Danzig, 18th] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in a speech at the closing ceremony of the Danzig Cultural Congress today, said that the German characteristics of Danzig are difficult for even its opponents to deny. According to his broadcast speech, Goebbels said, "The most important thing is Danzig's will and determination to return to Germany. Political barriers can be temporarily changed, but race and language are difficult to eliminate. Although I am in Danzig, I am as if I am in Germany." Regarding culture, Germany is a pioneer, something that democratic countries cannot hope to match. Goebbels also said that radio broadcasting is the most effective way to guide the people. "We are now in the vortex of political and economic warfare, so we will educate the people of the whole country in every possible way, unite the hearts of the people at home, and jointly deal with world events. Other countries have resources and wealth, but Germany is an unsatisfied country. German history has just begun today. We are a country where the whole nation is mobilized for war. You can ignore the name of the Free City. The German people will always be with you. Führer Hitler is closely watching the development of Danzig and our future."

### Hitler Celebrates with Arab Envoys; Wondering What Tricks He's Playing Again

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] It was announced here today that Hitler met with Dar El, the special envoy of Arab King Ibn Saud yesterday. This announcement is quite surprising. The two met at Berchtesgaden and had tea and talked for a long time, but the nature of the content is unknown.

### Irish Free State Declares Stance; We Will Not Offend Unless Offended

[Central News Agency, Dublin, 18th] During the recent discussion of the budget in the House of Representatives of the Southern Irish Free State, Executive Council Chairman de Valera made an important speech, stating that rumors that government officials had told people who enlisted in the army that they would fight against Britain and Northern Ireland were nonsense. In fact, our goal in training soldiers is only to strengthen national defense. The policy implemented by the government can be summarized in one sentence, that is, to avoid being involved in the vortex of war within the scope of its power. However, in order to maintain a fixed neutral position, there must be sufficient strength. The task of strengthening the military is precisely for this. In short, we will not offend unless offended. Even if war breaks out, we will still maintain business relations with Britain, because this is necessary for the economic life of our country. If the enemy believes that it is enough to hinder their hope of victory and obstruct it, then we must rise up to resist and ensure that our country can continue to trade with Britain.

### Franco-Vietnamese Commander Transfers to Singapore

[Central News Agency, Saigon, 18th] General Martin, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces stationed in Vietnam, recently flew here from Hanoi and transferred to the Port of Singapore to meet with Vice Admiral Godfroy, Commander of the French Far Eastern Fleet, and military authorities from the British Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in the Far East to discuss military cooperation between the two sides in the Far East.

When it comes to superstition, whether in China or abroad, people always like to put China first. Only heaven knows if that's true. In reality, the most superstitious people in the world are the Americans in the Western Hemisphere. Thus, 'thirteen', 'Friday the 13th', and 'next to the building' are all inexplicable taboos. And the most superstitious place in American superstition is, of course, Hollywood. To say nothing else, in Hollywood, there are thousands of people who make a living specializing in astrology. Every year-end and new year, prophecies come one after another. Major newspapers, tabloids, magazines, and publications are filled with them. And privately, big directors and big stars constantly seek out their astrological consultants to predict the coming year's fortune. Is it a good time to make a film? Or is it a good time to fall in love? Below, we will introduce the standard Hollywood prophecies for 1939. These prophecies are the work of famous Hollywood reporter and prophet, Chris. This forecast was published in the New York Progressive Report in January 1939. It has two special features: First, it talks about general Hollywood events, not just the private lives of celebrities. Second, it makes specific predictions about the facts, names, and months, rather than just making vague statements like those who hang up a sheep's head but sell dog meat. Moreover, after six months, several of the predictions did come true, which is somewhat reasonable. Now, please see the main text below. January:

The names of the Canadian quintuplet child stars will continuously appear in various newspaper news columns, but it will have nothing to do with movies.

(Note): This prediction has already been fulfilled. The New York World's Fair invited the Dionne quintuplets to perform at the opening ceremony on May 1st. At the same time, the British King and Queen also prepared to "meet the saints," the Dionne quintuplets. Both news items were published in various newspapers.

Luise Rainer, the female lead of "The Good Earth," will receive some kind of award.

(Note: This prediction has also been fulfilled. Luise Rainer toured the United States last year and received the 1938 Travel Award, which was presented in January.)

February:

Charlie Chaplin will officially announce the content of his new work.

(Note: This prediction has been confirmed. Charlie Chaplin announced his new film "The Great Dictator" in February.)

The golden award for the best acting performance of 1938 will not go to Bette Davis, but to another more famous actress.

(Note: This prediction also came true. On February 23rd, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that the winner was Norma Shearer, the female lead of "Marie Antoinette." Bette Davis's ranking was after Norma Shearer.)

March:

Famous director Frank Borzage will fall ill.

Carole Lombard will be involved in a lawsuit due to income tax issues.

(Note: Neither of the above predictions has been confirmed.)

April:

The wedding of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, scheduled for this month, will be postponed due to some reason.

(Note: Clark Gable married Carole Lombard in late April and was not postponed for any reason.)

May:

Samuel Goldwyn will gather many famous writers to co-write a movie script, but it will ultimately not be filmed.

(Note: There seems to be no news of this?)

June:

Li Sislian Howard will self-fund the production of a color film.

Major film companies will compete to buy a famous script, and MGM will win, but it will be banned from filming by the film censorship board.

July:

Three Soviet national defense films will be screened in New York, one of which will cause a protest from Japan.

Greta Garbo will return to her homeland again

August:

Child star Shirley Temple will suffer from a surgical illness and require surgery.

Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation will change its internal organization, and a certain well-known star will engage in litigation with the company authorities.

September:

Gary Cooper will receive some kind of honorary award.

Charlie Chaplin's new work will be completed, and he will announce his official divorce from Paulette Goddard.

October:

Maybelline's cosmetics company will be very profitable. Horror star Boris Karloff will travel to Europe.

November:

Charlie Chaplin's completed new film will be praised by some audiences but opposed by others.

Robert Taylor will be in a car accident but will only suffer minor injuries.

December:

Star Mickey Rooney will receive a strange gift on Christmas.

Among all the film companies, the most profitable will be RKO Pictures.

### One Person, One Day

Once, the New York Women's Federation held a carnival, and one of the events was a Charlie Chaplin costume contest. In advance, they specifically telegraphed Hollywood, asking the comedian himself to serve as a judge. Chaplin, because he happened to be busy, telegraphed back that he could not attend, much to his regret.

However, the carnival still opened, and the costume contest was held as planned. It is said that on that day, traffic was heavy, and the scene was grand. Even more enthusiastic were the participants in the Charlie Chaplin costume contest. The small mustaches and torn shoes were the same color, and the canes and old felt hats flew everywhere. The real and fake Charlie Chaplins were simply indistinguishable.

With great difficulty, the three judges looked left and right, deliberating and deciding on the top three. Amidst applause, the three winners went on stage to receive their awards. A large silver trophy, a silver shield, and a silver medal for third place. Everyone was praising the first-place mustache, the second-place torn shoes, and the third-place figure, which was also not bad... Suddenly, the third-place guy started to speak on stage.

"Thank you all for your kindness in selecting me as third place." After saying this, he took off his hat and cane, and pulled off his mustache. Who was he? It was none other than Charlie Chaplin himself.

"Mr. Manager, can I open this box and sell a bullet to this gentleman? He wants to commit suicide!"

### Weather Forecast

"Transport trucks as prison vans, detectives make a big arrest of hawkers." The Hong Kong police authorities, after all, have extraordinary methods. Such a wonderful plan, how did they think of it? It's a pity that it's a "big arrest of hawkers," not exciting or stimulating enough, still lacking a bit of excitement.

A man named Huang, twenty-three years old, committed fifty-seven cases single-handedly, truly worthy of being the king of model thieves. I think this person probably has a penchant for stealing, with nothing to do after a full meal, stealing for fun. What other explanation could there be?

"A man named Lin, addicted to heroin, fell one day, breaking his right foot, and was hospitalized for bone grafting surgery. The doctor discovered that the heroin poison had penetrated deeply, causing the bone marrow to decay, making grafting impossible, so the right foot was amputated." Heroin addicts, be careful of falling.

The Mong Kok Island brawl and assault case last month was tried yesterday. The deceased was murdered by "a person of unknown name." The witness was angry and did not provide a complete and truthful testimony. Three people were fined fifty dollars or imprisoned for one month, and one person was fined one hundred dollars or imprisoned for two months. Serves them right, why did the witness lie?

Answer: Yesterday, there was a small problem with the candy distribution that was originally scheduled to be announced in three days. Unexpectedly, yesterday alone, we received as many as one hundred and eighty-six letters with answers, and two-thirds of them were correct. This really overwhelmed me a bit. Thinking about it, I have to announce it earlier today.

When this question was posed, there was a bit of carelessness, so there could be several answers: Any answer that is: 79, 160, 241, 322, 403, is considered correct. Afterwards, you can add 81 to get this number.

To thank the respondents for their enthusiasm, I specially discussed it with Manager Cai of Caizhi Zhai and made an exception to increase the prizes. The first three names will receive six zongzi, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth names will each receive three zongzi. The rest who answered correctly will receive one zongzi each, to express my gratitude and help with their elegant interests. Today, Cai Zhai specially made a batch of zongzi, please gentlemen and ladies come and pick them up before 2 pm.

The first six names are published below, and the rest are welcome to go directly to Caizhi Zhai, where there is a detailed statistical table.

(1) A certain gentleman from the Bank of Communications

(This gentleman had someone knock on the door of Caizhi Zhai at eight o'clock in the morning to deliver the answer.)

(2) Mr. Feng Baosen from the Bank of Shanghai

(3) Ms. Tang Ruoying from the China Travel Theater Troupe

(4) Mr. Wu Zhongqi on the third floor of Standard Chartered Bank (5) Mr. Zheng Xianchao from the Commercial Press

(6) Mr. Tan Kunyuan from the Peninsula Hotel

Finally, I would like to announce that in a couple of days, I will ask another difficult question, please answer it.

### Maritime Storm Nine

— By Captain Lauton, Translated by Yang Bi

Previous excerpt: In the autumn of 1914, the "Sui Mei" steamship (Kailong Boqi) was carrying eight million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the radio operator of the Qiukes Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took advantage of the ship to travel around Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator Lu Jialuo and the ship's German radio operator Baufu. When Jack was working for Bau, he received a strange message saying that Britain and Germany had declared war, and British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then began to run aimlessly. Soon, the radio again reported that there was an iceberg nearby...

"I hope he heard it and stops the ship," Bill said. "I'm not afraid, but running at full speed in such dense fog, with an iceberg ahead, is not very appropriate."

"I only think the only good thing is that these passengers don't know. They are anxious enough, and if they knew there was an iceberg, I believe someone would put on a straitjacket."

"Really, only the Americans and British on this ship have the leisure to be indifferent. Today, in the smoking room, I saw several American millionaires planning to buy the ship so they could pass safely."

"That's indeed the American way," Jack laughed. "What was the result?"

"The captain told them that the ship was not for sale, even if they paid the price of the gold in the vault."

Jack found the captain in the front cabin, where he was seriously discussing with some of the crew.

"Well, what's the news?" The captain saw Jack come in.

"Yes, it's not good news. Ka Li Donavan just told the Lisa that there's an iceberg ahead."

Some of the crew exchanged glances, all looking at the captain, hoping for orders in the face of such a great danger on the water during navigation.

Their second mate, Mi Qin, was the first to ask: "Captain, are you going to change course or reduce speed?"

The big-bearded captain glared at him and raised his big fist, hitting the table hard.

"We're going forward as usual!" He said loudly; "Rather than let the transport ship fall into British hands, I'd rather it be smashed to pieces."

"But there are so many passengers!" Jack exclaimed. "Really—"

"Mr. Red, I'm the one in charge of giving orders on this ship, and I order you to go forward at full speed."

Five became enemies

Hearing the news that Jack brought back, Bill Nanuo shrugged and said:

"I'm not surprised, in my previous marine life, I've met many Germans who hold this belief, that they'd rather sink the ship than let others take advantage of it."

"But this is terrible, Bill," Jack protested, "at any time, there may be a smash, and—"

### Increased Export of Local Goods is Expected After Foreign Exchange Rate Adjustment. The Success of the Southwest Customs Management Has Transformed into Trade Surplus. Trade Deficits in Shanghai and Tianjin Customs May Be Reduced Hereafter.

(Shanghai Special Dispatch) After the government adjusted foreign exchange rates, although the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai has tightened, it is beneficial to China's balance of international payments, reduces the import of useless foreign loans, eliminates trade deficits, and encourages exports. The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee is determined to maintain the stability of foreign exchange with all its strength. The details are as follows:

Southwest Trade Surplus, Customs Trade Deficit

After making every effort to eliminate trade deficits at various customs, the southwest Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, Longzhou, Beihai Qiongzhou, Leizhou, Jiangmen, and Wenzhou, Shantou, have all become trade surplus customs. However, the customs in the occupied areas are still in trade deficit, and the numbers are increasing, especially Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, Xiamen, etc. For example, from January to April this year, Tianjin's trade deficit was 74.307 million yuan, Shanghai's trade deficit was 72.316 million yuan, Jiaozhou's trade deficit was 14.951 million yuan, and Yantai's trade deficit was 5.009 million yuan.

April's Trade Deficit Sets a New Record

Regarding the nation's foreign trade, when the war first started, from September to December of the 26th year of the Republic of China, each month changed from trade deficit to trade surplus, with a total trade surplus of 53.627 million yuan in four months. From June to September of the 27th year, each month was also in trade surplus, with a total trade surplus of 20.638 million yuan in four months. However, from October of last year to April of this year, all were in trade deficit, with a total trade deficit of 156.242 million yuan. Especially the trade deficit in April of this year set a new record high since the war, totaling 56.541 million yuan. (To be continued)

### New Measures for the Exchange of Legal Tender

— Gong Jialin

4. Make the planned control of exports in Central China by the Japanese puppets meaningless. The export from the occupied areas is one of the sources of supply in the black market for foreign exchange. If the organization is determined to control the export of foreign exchange (regardless of whether it can be done), then the supply in the black market for foreign exchange will be further reduced, and the Japanese plan to seize foreign exchange will be even more difficult to implement, and they will only eat their own bitter fruit.

(4) The Legal Tender is Strong, and Japan is Weak.

After the sharp contraction of the legal tender exchange rate, the price of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market has also become slightly stronger, but it is far from the standard it should be. On June 7, the day before the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange in the black market, the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai was 9 jiao 2 fen, and the price of the legal tender was 8 benzi 25. Recently, when the legal tender fell to 6 benzi half, the Japanese yen should have risen to 1 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen, but in reality, it is still hovering within 1 yuan and has not been able to reach parity. It seems quite thought-provoking. In fact, this is not very difficult to explain. Although the Japanese yen is still maintained on the surface at an official rate of 1 shilling 2 benzi in Japan due to the government's strong control, due to the country's financial difficulties, currency inflation, depletion of reserves, deterioration of trade, restrictions on the domestic and foreign use of the Japanese yen, and the failure of the war against China, even the Japanese people themselves, who have a strong sense of patriotism, have expressed pessimism about the future of the Japanese yen. The depreciation of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai open market is the best evidence. On the other hand, the legal tender reserves are still abundant, it can freely purchase goods domestically, and it can freely exchange foreign exchange abroad. The Japanese also firmly believe in the foundation of the legal tender, so as soon as the exchange rate is slightly favorable, they desperately use the Japanese yen to exchange for the legal tender. As a result, the supply of Japanese yuan in the market exceeds the demand, and the exchange rate will naturally fall back. This simple fact has been explained to us by the Japanese themselves about the solid foundation of the legal tender. Do we still need to doubt it? (The End)

### Sweeping Away the "Kiss Donation" Movement

— Rage Tide

Recently, the air of "kiss donation" has been rampant in Hong Kong. Although this movement has not been put into practice, it has indeed attracted the attention of some members of society.

It is said that the purpose of launching the kiss donation movement is to raise money to contribute to the motherland? Moreover, a woman even published an article in a certain newspaper voluntarily sacrificing her beauty. To be the first practitioner to unveil this movement.

Because the method of this movement is a bit novel, from an objective standpoint, through the method of analysis, how should we evaluate the significance of this novel movement? This is really worth our discussion.

Because this kiss donation movement is a supplement to raising financial resources for the motherland in the War of Resistance, therefore, for this question and the methods it adopts, what kind of excellent or bad effects will it have objectively in the process of practice, and what inevitable impact will it have on society, these are all things that we should give strict consideration to.

In the motherland's sacred war, every Chinese people should concentrate all manpower, material resources, and financial resources into the torrent of the War of Resistance. This is not only an irrefutable responsibility, but also an obligation that must be borne. Therefore, we do not oppose the people's donations to the country; however, we believe that this "kiss donation" method greatly tarnishes the spirit of resisting Japan and saving the country. Because although the kiss donors are for the motherland, those who enjoy the "kiss" themselves, the purpose for which they take out their money, is first and foremost to treat women as objects. According to this motive for setting out, it is very wrong.

To put these shameless carnal and spiritual sensations into the great content of the War of Resistance would be an insult to the War of Resistance.

If we understand the social organization of China, we all clearly know: China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country; although it has undergone the impact of the May Fourth Youth Movement and countless new ideas, due to the deep-rooted existence of the old social system for nine thousand years, even up to now, we can easily smell the legacy of feudalism everywhere. As for the removal of these feudal dregs, it will take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, this "kiss donation" action is bound to arouse criticism from the general public in society, and will produce the opposite effect.

During the War of Resistance, as long as they are not traitors, every Chinese person is a member of the nation. In the sense of a united front, only when people from all walks of life are linked together and form an iron front can we eliminate the enemy and win the final victory. Therefore, for this layer representing a semi-feudal society, in the technology of national salvation, we must try our best to win their sympathy. Avoid overly blind actions. And avoid causing unnecessary friction between them. Now, without passing through the analysis of social conditions and the grasp of the social foundation, making their children and strangers kiss, this trick will of course immediately make them disgusted, and even further distort the basic task of national salvation work, and should be subjected to all kinds of blows.

Therefore, the effect of this action is greatly contrary to the spirit of the War of Resistance. And if this movement unfortunately gets a local abnormal development, some improper prostitutes will also put forward the "××××" movement at the same time. We further think: what a terrible impact this will form.

For the sake of the revolutionary character of thousands of national salvation workers, and for the sake of the great spirit of the national War of Resistance, we must sweep away the atmosphere of the kiss donation movement.

We raise the giant hand of protest against this incorrect movement.

### The Pit (Part 1)

— Telegram

I swayed and paced off the bridge, my eyes fixed straight ahead, ignoring the fellow to my right.

My legs moved back and forth, quite freely, yet I glanced at him sideways: like half a burnt-down yellow candle, stiff and angry, stuck there. I couldn't help but chuckle...

Suddenly, I heard the sound of leather shoes and a gun handle striking. I quickly turned sideways: the seven-member gang was aiming the gun right at my belly. Slowly, I raised my hands, losing the smile on my face. However, he lowered the gun back to his shoulder, took a short rod from his waist, and strode over.

He took three legal tender notes and eight Qin Hui notes from my pocket. He hurriedly stuffed the three notes into his trouser pocket, but tore up all the Qin Hui notes. He smiled slyly, pointed with his finger to the foot of the bridge, and I saw that a pit was being dug there. He, like a mute, raised his right palm above his head and made a gesture with his left palm at knee level. So I swallowed some saliva and walked over: the pit was only three or four feet deep, a little wider than one person, with a small shovel stuck in the pile of dirt beside it.

"What?"

He repeated the gesture, and smiled slyly again. Did he want me to dig? Were there munitions below? Or his father's grave? He then waved his pistol at me. I stubbornly craned my neck at him, smiled just as wickedly, grabbed the little devilish shovel, and tested it, gently—if it were longer, I could swing it over and send his mother's half-candle to the Western Paradise. So I brandished it, and now he was furious, his eyebrows furrowed, gnashing his teeth, shrinking his legs back a bit, stomping his feet. The expression was like an old monkey with its tail burnt, screeching uselessly.

I pretended to look ahead, but it was completely empty, not even a ghost to be seen. Damn it, I had to obediently "respect the order" and dig. Digging and digging, I stole a glance at the gang member, who was fondling his pistol. I coughed loudly to startle him. He suddenly jumped, his legs shrinking back again, aiming the gun at me. So I dug again, digging... it was very dry, so I spat some saliva into my palm, rubbed it, and dug, shoveling, waiting a while, then glanced at him again: he smiled wickedly and evilly again, then leisurely took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and started puffing.

Digging, digging, picking up mud, the pit was now two feet deeper, and I stopped, coughing loudly again. He strode over, patted my shoulder, and made another gesture; did it need to be this deep? You're out of luck today, old man!

I lazily brandished the shovel thinking: how many munitions are below, who left them here? It was puzzling—digging, digging, digging, observing, observing, it was as if I was digging up his ancestral grave. Digging and digging, the pile of dirt beside the pit was getting higher and higher: strange! My shoulder suddenly felt a sharp pain. Turning my head, I saw that he had hit me with the pistol butt; I shouted, "What? Your father..." The gun was aimed at my throat, black and shiny, and I sullenly bent down again, digging, digging, damn it! I spat hatefully, rubbed my hands: something really did come up below. I would use it to get rid of him decisively! One-on-one, could I still fail? How truly shameful; alright, dig, dig, dig.

I looked over again, he was squatting to pick up the shredded notes, his half-burnt candle-like body even more foolish. Suddenly, my heart almost jumped out of my chest, I couldn't help but raise it up, jump out of the pit in one stride, and give him a faceless beating... I was preparing to deal with him, but he stood up, adjusting the long gun on his back, which clanged.

### Expectations for the Supplement Editor

— Shangqing

Every newspaper has a supplement. The indispensability of supplements is already a general understanding. Some people even say that they often encounter people who don't read the editorials or certain news items when reading a newspaper, but there are absolutely none who don't read the supplement; the importance of supplements to people is especially evident in this fact. Some people think that real public opinion should be sought in the supplement. Perhaps there is some truth to this statement.

The importance of supplements is such that the responsibilities of the supplement editor are also self-evident. Of course, supplement editors are respectable in terms of their scholarship and morality. They naturally know the heavy responsibilities they bear and will deal with them appropriately. There is no need for someone like me, who has no editorial experience, to lecture them. However, I think my offering some opinions, especially during this time of war, may provide them with some reference.

First, I hope that the consciousness of the supplement editor is always forward-thinking and never regressive. Therefore, the manuscripts they select will never promote feudal thoughts, superstitions, low-level tastes, or any national dregs. Unless there are special reasons, they will not publish manuscripts written in classical Chinese. They will also improve the use of old-fashioned punctuation with circles added to each sentence in vernacular manuscripts, changing it to modern punctuation. Any text that mentions taking concubines, visiting prostitutes, or other vulgar matters, and seems to describe them with relish, implicitly praising them, will be immediately thrown into the wastepaper basket, no matter what the reason. Whenever selecting a manuscript, they will think about whether publishing it will have a bad influence on readers, hindering social progress and national civilization.

Second, I hope that they are serious, not perfunctory, and not accommodating. Only good manuscripts, or at least manuscripts that are harmless to readers, can be published; otherwise, even if they are introduced by influential people, they should be rejected without hesitation. They should read every submitted manuscript from beginning to end and not discard it just because the submitter is an unknown person, or because the beginning of the manuscript is not good, thereby burying the author's painstaking effort. Of course, it is especially inappropriate to monopolize the "territory" and only use it to cater to their two or three close friends, without any openness, and to not publish manuscripts from strangers, regardless of their quality. For publishable manuscripts, I also hope that they are willing to revise them and proofread them after typesetting, because most submitters are not technically specialized and will inevitably have errors or minor imperfections, so it is necessary to help in this way.

Third, I hope that they will not be used by others, nor will they use it improperly themselves. Publishing texts that tout and flatter is a minor form of exploitation. Attacking others' privacy and slandering others without cause, if they say that they do not intentionally publish such texts, at least they should be blamed for oversight. If they are instructed or bribed by others to propagate some kind of bad idea or doctrine, I think wise editors will certainly be able to distinguish this and that it is absolutely unacceptable.

These three points mostly refer to normal times. As for now, in this time of war and nation-building, in addition to the above three points, I hope that supplement editors will respect the following point:

Only publish works that can uplift the spirit of our compatriots, and absolutely do not publish works that can dissipate morale! Therefore, I hope that editors will not publish literary works that describe romantic scenery. That is to say, I hope that it is best to publish fewer works that express sorrow and resentment, or that expose some kind of dark side of society. Even if it is known to be "eight-legged essays for resisting Japan," one must strive for excellence within this "eight-legged" framework and cannot jump out of this range and publish "nine-legged" or "seven-legged" or any other great articles that are unrelated to reality and cannot promote our fighting spirit with self-satisfaction. Of course, on isolated islands, "the environment" should also be considered, and it is not appropriate to speak out loudly, lest small impatience ruin great plans. But I think a smart editor, and also a patriotic editor, will always find a way to overcome this "environment" to achieve their goals. If everything is attributed to "the environment," and things that are incomprehensible or even poisonous are published, then I must honestly and impolitely say that this person has ulterior motives, and we must impose severe sanctions on them!

These are just a few of the things I hope for. I am ashamed to say that they are just commonplaces, with no new ideas. However, I must honestly say, have the current supplement editors fully achieved all the points we hope for? Of course not completely. Therefore, I still cannot help but mention my expectations to all the editors.

In short, the position of the newspaper supplement is important, and the responsibility of the editor is great. I hope that editors will be responsible to readers, responsible to society, and now even more responsible to the nation and the country, contributing to the joint effort of resisting Japan and building the nation, and promoting world civilization!

### Spark

— Dawn

In the hazy distance,

A spark flashes,

Bright!

My eyes, buried in the gloomy seven tombs,

Have spent nineteen years of suffering,

And only now have touched the torch of freedom.

My left hand is braced in the mud,

My right hand grips the mountain rocks,

Stomping in one foot,

Then closely following the next step.

Who scattered this slippery layer,

Making me hesitate, unable to open my stride?

Looking back is a blackness full of ghostly shadows,

Only ahead is the spark rising.

Go!

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

6. National Hero

Here, the vegetable garden where the Mian County government is located is also a thatched hut, but it is already on the edge of the plain and transportation is convenient, so there is now ×× unit, number ×××××××, there are faculty and staff dormitories of Northwestern United University, and there is a middle school. The surrounding area is full of slogans for resisting Japan; although the place belongs to Shaanxi, the name of the group is Shanxi Service Nation, there is a branch station here, and the bus must stop briefly to check tickets. A female comrade traveling with me is learning Cantonese from me. There are seven women traveling together, one is a widow. She is bringing four girls and one boy. The female comrade learning to speak is her eldest daughter, about twenty years old. She is the opposite of a female comrade who likes to show off and deliberately pretends to be mysterious, and she has a thoughtful and contemplative personality. After two days of walking on mountain roads, the bus bumped so badly that she vomited several times. I gave her Eight Trigrams Pills and Qi Zhong Shui to take several times. But coming out of the plains and about to arrive, her mood also became cheerful, and she began to learn to speak with me. She said:

"I'll say a sentence in Cantonese and you listen to see if it's right?"

She is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, grew up in Tianjin, and fled through Jinan, Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, to Chengdu, and now enters Shaanxi. I said:

"Okay, say it and let me hear."

She spoke, but I didn't understand. She translated it into Mandarin:

"Shall we go see a movie?"

I translated it into Cantonese for her:

"Tung ngoh tai dianying hui ho um ho?"

She followed and learned, and I answered her:

"Ho!"

Everyone laughed.

"Okay!"

Everyone laughed.

At half past two, we passed Baocheng. From here, going north is Shiji, and going east is Hanzhong (Nanzheng), only thirteen kilometers away. At three o'clock, the bus had arrived at the station north of Nanzheng City. Everyone jumped down from the open-air truck, unloading the suffering of the four-day journey, and their faces showed happy smiles. (To be continued)

### High-ranking Official of the Ministry of Communications Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss Domestic Transportation Construction after the War; Building Highways, Dredging Rivers, and Smooth Water and Land Transportation; Developed Aviation, Postal, and Telecommunications to Open up International Routes

Since the start of our country's war of resistance, nation-building plans have also been actively promoted at the same time. As far as transportation construction is concerned, such as strengthening public transportation, engaging in road construction, expanding postal, telecommunications, and aviation, and dredging canals and waterways, there have been good results. Internal communication is unimpeded, and the transportation of goods is convenient both internally and externally. According to a high-ranking official of the Ministry of Communications who has just arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing on official business, the current domestic transportation situation is as follows.

Highways

Regarding highways, according to reliable statistics, the current highways and motor roads total 72,140 miles, and the total number of motor vehicles in China is about 72,000, which is about one vehicle per mile. The government has developed highways and has also set up a truck manufacturing plant. As for the management methods, the main roads in the southwestern provinces are all under the jurisdiction of the Southwest Highway Transportation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the northwest is under the jurisdiction of the West Highway Transportation Management of the Ministry of Communications. The Sichuan Highway, which connects the southwest and northwest, is managed by the Sichuan Highway Bureau. The highway from Yunnan to the border of a certain country has also been opened to traffic long ago.

Waterways

In order to avoid the threat of military bombing, the transportation of goods in the interior is mostly changed to waterways. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications is doing its utmost to supervise the dredging of canals and waterways with transportation value in various provinces to assist wartime transportation. Regarding waterway transportation management, there is the Yangtze River Shipping Joint Office jointly established by the China Merchants Bureau and various shipping companies, and the Inland River Shipping Joint Office established by the municipal government bureaus of various commercial ports, which controls the navigation of various ships and small inland river ships in the Yangtze River. In addition, due to the dangerous shoals of the Sichuan River, the method of improving the shoals has been improved, and rescue stations have been set up at dangerous places, using machines to pull the shoals to ensure safety.

Aviation

Aircraft transportation is still being carried out by China and Eurasia Airlines, which are increasing the purchase of aircraft and changing flight routes at any time according to the war situation. Under the circumstances of avoiding destruction by enemy aircraft, efforts are made to maintain air transport. Not only can various important cities in the country be reached from morning to evening, but even the capital of the Soviet Union can be reached in only five days (which used to take seven days). In addition, the direct route from Chongqing to Vietnam can be reached in only a few hours. The direct route from Chongqing to Yangon and then to London has also been tested and will soon be officially opened. As for aviation fuel and repairs, there are also sufficient preparations for supply.

Postal and Telecommunications

Telegraph networks have been added in various provinces in the rear, and many connecting lines have been added between provinces. Many long-distance telephones have also been opened, such as the recent Kunming-Ce, Kunming-Chongqing, Kunming-Rong, Chongqing-Guilin, and Longxi-Chongqing long-distance telephone lines, which have been opened one after another. It is also heard that the amount of copper wire used by the Ministry of Communications in the past year is enough to offset the amount used in the previous ten years. International radio can directly communicate with major European cities. In addition to the establishment of many post offices and agency offices, village and town mail carriers, village and town post offices, and mailboxes in the rear provinces, as well as more than 10,000 miles of new postal routes, military mail is also set up in the war zone and transferred with the position to facilitate postal transportation.

### The Philippine Authorities Improve the Way to Accommodate Chinese Refugees; Can Obtain a Residence Permit from the Philippine Immigration Bureau

Yesterday, this newspaper received news from the shipping industry in Hong Kong that the Philippine Immigration Office recently decided to improve the way to accommodate Chinese refugees. In the future, Chinese refugees going to the Philippines and those already in the Philippines, in addition to holding refugee certificates issued by our consulate general, must also obtain a refugee residence permit from the Philippine Immigration Office and pay a handling fee of 2.2 Philippine pesos. It is found that this method is quite convenient for our refugees going to the Philippines. After the immigration office issues a certificate, they can reside in the Philippines until the end of the war in our country. Several batches of refugees are already in the Philippines. After the list is announced by our consulate general, those approved by the refugee review committee number more than 250 copies. The consulate has issued refugee certificates to 208 people. However, if they do not obtain refugee status, they will still be handled as usual. When the Anqing ship arrived in the Philippines a few days ago, 11 people were sent back to Quanzhou due to non-compliance with the procedures. However, the practice of paying an export certificate stamp tax of 5.2 pesos has been abolished. This method is based on the instructions of the Philippine Presidential Palace. From now on, overseas Chinese returning to China can be exempted from obtaining an export certificate. Those who have not obtained an export certificate when returning to their country do not need to pay a supplementary payment after returning to the Philippines.

### The Iron Current Theater Troupe Is About to Perform

They have rehearsed many well-rehearsed plays and are preparing to perform recently. Before the performance, the troupe will regularly invite people from all walks of life in Hong Kong to perform the play "Flower Tears", etc.

### The New Sports Ground of Jiefang Girls' Middle School Is Completed; Students Are Injected with Immunization Shots

For the purpose of improving students' physical education, Jiefang Girls' Middle School, with a sea view, started construction after obtaining permission from the Hong Kong government to lease 5,000 feet of open space near the school. Most of the project is now nearing completion. The main entrance faces Zhengmi Road, opposite the school. The area inside the stadium is spacious, and the sports equipment is very complete. In addition, in order to ensure the safety of students due to the recent epidemic of cholera in Hong Kong, the school injected them with anti-cholera shots last Saturday.

### This Month's Criminal Cases Open for Trial; The High Court Sentences Nine Cases; Defendant in Fifty-Seven Cases, Can Be Called the "King of Pickpockets"

There are eight criminal cases this month. Yesterday morning at 10:00, Judge McKeag and Associate Judge Lian Su of the High Court presided over the trial. Nine cases were sentenced, and the remaining cases were remanded because the defendants all pleaded not guilty. Then, jurors were summoned to jointly interrogate. The prosecutors were government lawyers Yiyi and Bao Liandi.

Pickpocketing and Drug Possession

There were five sentences passed yesterday morning, including (1) Huang Zhong, accused of pickpocketing Yu Yaokun on the road last month and stealing a wallet containing 70 Hong Kong dollars and 10 Vietnamese dollars.

When the court deliberated on the matter, it said that this kind of drug is more harmful to the Chinese people than Japanese planes. You knowingly committed the crime and cannot be forgiven, so you will be sentenced to three years of hard labor. (5) Zhong Zhenkun, accused of possessing two cut-off shotguns and sixteen bullets in Shau Kei Wan last month, was sentenced to three years of hard labor.

Learn in the Collective, Grow in the Collective; The Opening Ceremony of the Youth Tong Le Society Held Warmly at the North River Theater; Latte

### Learning and Growing in Collectivity - Youth Fellowship Inauguration Ceremony Held Vigorously at North River Theatre

— Latter

Over a thousand young men and women, filled with spirited fervor, gathered cheerfully at the North River Theatre in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, on a clear and sunny morning yesterday to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Youth Fellowship.

The venue was filled with guests, and the stage was also filled with representatives from various societies. From the plaques displayed on the stage, sent by Morning Bell Society, Self-Strengthening Society, Foreign Affairs Workers; Chung Hwa Book Company, Military Society, Lianxing Typing Company, Huiyang Youth Association, Women's Federation Yixun Class, Sham Shui Po Hawker Ping An Hall, Du Qizhang, Yang Yueji and others, adorned with simple and beautiful anti-Japanese war slogans, one couldn't help but be reminded of how the Youth Fellowship itself had gained the love and sympathy of people from all walks of life, and earned the position it deserved in society.

Indeed, the Youth Fellowship had gone through a considerably long preparatory period. However, through the efforts of this group, full of fighting spirit, truth and justice, and the courage to roar at the motherland, they had already done many extraordinary things. In the past, they had sent thirty to forty members back to the motherland to serve in the war, distributed across the East River, West River, and North River regions. This was the glorious achievement of their mobilization work. They had also done their utmost in fundraising, whether in terms of spiritual reports, food, or material supplies; and had sent warm condolences to soldiers, wounded soldiers, and people. They had also taken their educational work very seriously, including current affairs seminars, women's discussion groups, choir, Mandarin classes, publishing wall newspapers, and children's groups. This was a part of their internal strengthening of education. Their external service work was also no less than ninety-six times, covering areas such as drama and singing. These were the many glorious achievements of the Youth Fellowship, and the fundamental reason why it had won the sympathy and applause of people from all walks of life.

The Youth Fellowship is gradually growing stronger and healthier, and it will not betray the eager expectations people have for it. Perhaps it still has many shortcomings and weaknesses that need to be overcome as soon as possible.

At nine o'clock, the joyful and enthusiastic crowd eagerly watched the curtain being unveiled:

The chairman, with a lively and energetic face, explained the reasons for holding the meeting. Following this, a leader led the oath of national spiritual mobilization. At this moment, the people's voices announcing the oath rose loudly. The oath also tightened everyone's tense blood, making everyone from now on hold the torch of "national conscience" tightly to burn the souls of national traitors. After the oath, Mr. Zheng Shouren, the KMT representative stationed in Hong Kong, gave a speech. He encouraged the youth to strengthen unity and shatter the enemy's conspiracy of a quick victory through war or peace. These were very important topics. The speech by Mr. Du Qizhang, the honorary president of the Fellowship, also encouraged the youth to raise their national self-esteem and resolutely eliminate the dregs of traitors in the rear. Hitting out at the words and deeds of traitors, so as to coordinate with the progress of the current military and political situation. These were very valuable words. The representatives of other societies also delivered concise and powerful messages to strengthen the national united front, expressing the heartfelt voices that each should have. All of these speeches drew enthusiastic applause from the audience. From everyone's words and applause, it was clear that people's thoughts were concentrated, their will was concentrated, and their strength was concentrated. This would not be an exaggeration.

After the speeches, the Youth Fellowship's youth choir, both male and female, dressed in pure white clothes, sang patriotic songs under the direction of Mr. Liu Jia, lively like a flock of seagulls in the wind and waves. The clear, tragic, crisp, and melodious voices made people feel that this group of young men and women was even more lovable, and everyone showed joyful smiles.

After the singing, people hadn't yet gotten over the joyous emotions they had just enjoyed, and even more enjoyable recreational programs began to be presented:

The first act was a one-act play "Daughters of China". The plot was about a girl full of love and passion who would rather sacrifice her sweet love and end the life of her lover who was a traitor. The performance was quite intense, and the technical level of the actors was not bad. This could be clearly seen from the shouts and applause of the audience.

The second act was "Struggling on the Line of Life and Death", also a one-act play. The plot was about anti-pessimism. The technique of the performers was not bad either, but because there were some not-so-intense factors, it was inevitable that the audience was not very interested.

The third act was "Let Go of Our Grievances", also a one-act play. The plot was about a family who, because of the devastation caused by the enemy, abandoned their ten-year-old hatred for a soldier who killed their husband and father, and jointly raised the call for military-civilian cooperation, abandoning old grudges, and resisting violence. This was the most intense and outstanding performance, and the most exciting and inspiring act.

These three one-act plays could be considered some sincere gifts that the Youth Fellowship gave to the people. However, it was precisely from these gifts that people had a deeper understanding and a more genuine trust in the Fellowship's lively energy, its serious, and intense atmosphere.

After the plays, a group of clever and lively boys and girls from the Fellowship, also with voices like swallows, sang "China, China..." "Wandering Children... Arm Yourselves..." This aroused even more laughter and enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

In this harmonious exchange, at around 2:15, everyone wiped the sweat from their foreheads with smiles and the meeting ended. Each person embarked on their way home, carrying unforgettable and wonderful impressions.

### Cargo Transport Congestion and Insufficient Supply – Hong Kong-Vietnam Shipping Rates Increase – Both Taikoo and Jardine Increase by Twenty Percent

Since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the economic center of our country has shifted to the southwest. The southwest has the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam transportation lines, which are currently the only transportation routes in our country. Among them, Haiphong, Vietnam, is particularly convenient. Therefore, since the function of Hong Kong as an entrepot has disappeared, the volume of goods transported from Hong Kong to Vietnam has increased significantly. Seeing the potential for profit, various shipping companies have successively increased the number of ships sailing between Hong Kong and Vietnam. It is estimated that more than ten ships have been added compared to before the fall of important cities, with an average of one ship traveling back and forth every day. However, there is still a situation where demand exceeds supply. Therefore, cargo transportation costs are rising daily. According to sources in Hong Kong's Vietnamese community, the shipping rates of Taikoo and Jardine's ships have uniformly increased by 20% since the first of this month. The original rate of six yuan and two and a half dimes per ton of general merchandise has now increased to seven yuan and five dimes. However, cargo transport has not decreased as a result, and is still extremely congested.

### Huiyang Youth Association Launches Comfort Campaign – Determines "July 7th" Commemoration Work

The Hong Kong Huiyang Youth Association recently established a Comfort Work Committee to carry out all comfort work. It is reported that it has been decided to start district-based competitions for soliciting donations of medicines, etc., on the 20th of this month. Regarding the Association's preparations for this year's "July 7th" anniversary, it plans to hold activities such as fasting and selling flowers to enrich the strength of the comfort work. At the same time, it will also prepare an exhibition, using Huiyang in the War of Resistance as the main material, scheduled to be held around "July 7th".

### Pang Jingzhou Talks About the Recent Situation of the Red Cross Society of China's Work

Zhu Hengbi, Managing Director, and Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General, of the Red Cross Society of China, had left Hong Kong for two months to inspect the Society's relief work, traveling through the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan. They recently returned to Hong Kong and resumed their duties. Yesterday, the reporter made a special visit, and Mr. Pang revealed that the Society's current work can be roughly divided into two major parts: one is the care of wounded soldiers, which is entirely handled by Lin Kesheng. The headquarters is located at Geyunguan, six miles outside Guiyang City. There are a total of four brigade headquarters, located in the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. The locations where the teams are distributed extend east to Jinhua, south to Shaoguan, northwest to a certain county in southern Shanxi, and Fushi in Shaanxi. Their duties include assisting military hospitals with treatment, rescue, transportation, epidemic prevention, injections, and disinfection. Most of the teaching staff of the health personnel training classes established by the Military Affairs, Political Affairs, and Internal Affairs departments are also personnel of the Red Cross Society. The second is civil relief, which focuses on emergency care during air raids in major cities. Offices have been established in Chongqing and Kunming, either participating in joint offices in those locations or taking on the responsibility independently. Chongqing has been subjected to repeated air raids in recent days, and the Society's participation in rescue efforts has been very effective. The Society is responsible for the cleanliness and inspection of air raid shelters in Chongqing and Kunming. In places such as Guizhou and Guangxi, the Society has medical teams stationed there, which can be mobilized at any time. Mr. Pang also said that within the next few days, a comprehensive report on the entire work of the Red Cross Society since the War of Resistance, including all accounting, will be drafted into a special document and published in Hong Kong newspapers.

### Clever Strategy of Police Detectives – Transport Vehicles Used as Prison Vans – Large-Scale Arrest of Unlicensed Hawkers – Police Detectives Change Clothes, Disguise Themselves and Move Out – Hawkers Arrested Before They Could React

Unlicensed hawkers originally violate police laws. However, due to the difficulty of making a living, some hawkers risk their lives to earn a living, gathering in Cochrane Street and Gage Street in Central, Tung Street and Sai Street in Sheung Wan, and Chung Ching Street and Second and Third Streets in Sai Ying Pun, Hennessy Road and Tai Dao East Shek Wing Chek Street in Wan Chai, etc., morning and evening markets, arranged like long snakes, are very lively, almost more prosperous than formal merchants in the market. The reason is that they sell on the streets without the need for rent or license fees, and the selling price is cheaper than in the market. Therefore, more and more people are flocking to them, and more and more people are doing this business. The police authorities have previously dispatched prison vans to carry out large-scale arrests of these unlicensed hawkers. However, the hawkers are extremely cunning. As soon as they see the police or prison vans arriving, they flee in droves. After the police leave, they return to their stalls. Driven by life, they cannot but struggle with the environment in panic and movement. The inspectors are responsible for maintaining traffic and tidying up the city, and constantly try to clean up these hawkers. However, the arresters arrest, and the hawkers remain undiminished. The authorities have not yet found a fundamental solution to the problem of unlicensed hawkers. The Hong Kong and Kowloon magistrates' courts interrogate unknown numbers of unlicensed hawkers every day. The result is nothing more than fines. Because there are too many offenders, the judges can only impose penalties according to regulations. After these people are released after being fined, they resume selling on the streets. Therefore, the hawker problem cannot be eliminated unless the government finds a way to solve it thoroughly. Recently, the police, in view of the difficulty of arresting hawkers who evade arrest, implemented disguised action. Yesterday, on Sunday afternoon at around 3:00 p.m., a large number of police detectives were dispatched, who first changed their clothes and patrolled around the Central Market. Then, a transport vehicle was dispatched, covered with a Red Cross flag to conceal the hawkers' eyes and ears, so as to prevent them from fleeing in advance. The hawkers in the Gage Street and Cochrane Street area were in the midst of vigorous business at this time. At first, they did not know that the transport vehicle covered with the Red Cross flag was a prison van, and they were arrested one by one. The male and female hawkers selling vegetables who were arrested on the spot numbered seventy or eighty. Those who took the opportunity to flee were eventually intercepted by the plainclothes police detectives and escorted to the prison van.

Appearing with a New Look, Pioneering a New Path for Illustrated Magazines - Promoting the "Shen Bao Pictorial", Inaugural Issue Published Today

Special report from this newspaper.

### Appearing with a New Look, Pioneering a New Path for Illustrated Magazines - Recommending the "Shen Bao Pictorial", Inaugural Issue Published Today

— Qi Zhuo

Two or three months ago, precious photographs from all directions were delivered to the office of Mr. Zhang Zhengyu, the reprint editor of this newspaper, one by one by the postman. Many times, even when it was late at night, Mr. Zhang was still diligently buried in editing.

Publishing a book or magazine? Mr. Zhang told the reporter:

"Photographs are more agile and profound than words. Especially for the vast overseas Chinese and international friends, it is easy to see from the photos the suffering and new life of China in the War of Resistance. These vivid and concrete facts are not exaggerated, nor are they emphasized. They are a powerful weapon for comforting overseas Chinese, inspiring overseas Chinese, and expanding international publicity."

"At present, domestic transportation is inconvenient, and there is a lack of material conditions. Publishing a healthy and great pictorial is not an easy task. We promote cultural undertakings in Hong Kong's news work, so we must shoulder this great and inescapable task."

"What are the characteristics of our pictorial?" Mr. Zhang told the reporter very proudly:

"Abandon the traditional concept of beautiful women on the cover, and promote a bold and broad editorial format. There is no..."

This book has finally met the readers today after arduous editing and printing.

The paper is eight-open size number two printing paper, and the texture is very fine. Printed in photogravure, it is very clear and exquisitely bound. Twenty pages or forty pages, it is a brand new and substantial new pictorial. The cost of the content determines that the selling price of each copy cannot be less than forty cents.

The cover is exquisitely printed with a five-color rubber plate featuring a portrait of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. Although his eyebrows are white and his spirit is vigorous, he symbolizes the good omen of the country. Just as the inaugural statement says: "Shen Bao is an old newspaper, but the staff always wants to seek innovation... Mr. Ma Xiangbo has been enthusiastic about the revolution since he was young, and he has not changed to this day... Therefore, this newspaper uses the recent photograph of Mr. Ma as the cover of our pictorial, which is to take Mr. Ma's usual style as the motto of this magazine, to encourage each other, and to warn each other."

Open the cover, and the first picture is a flame; a burning flame, a great flame. The flame symbolizes the light of the nation, and the flame symbolizes the vitality of the nation. Going further, each page has a center. "Turning the Day of National Humiliation in May into a Day of Never Forgetting National Humiliation" contains the grand scene of the torch parade in Chongqing. The solemn posture of Chairman Jiang during his speech. The following page, "National Covenant Oath of the United People," makes people feel infinitely gratified and infinitely inspired.

The "Blood Account" page includes the ruins of the Nine-One-Eight Incident, which are the tragic scenes after Chongqing was bombed. This hatred, this resentment.

"The Sound of Horns Moves the North Wind, the Sword Energy Charges the Southern Dipper" shows Hunan, Guizhou, Central Hubei, Northern Shaanxi, Northern Jiangsu, Eastern Anhui... in the great ranks of coordinating the War of Resistance. As the saying goes, "Dare to say that today's East Asia is still the mountains and rivers of China!" The soldiers on the "Jin-Yu Line" are ready to face the enemy, which makes people stand in awe. The "New Army Waiting for Orders" and "Lofty Ambitions Reach the Galaxy, Heroic Spirit Pervades the Heavens" have achievements in battlefields, and there are valiant air force soldiers. It tells us: China is advancing on the road to modern countries, and our heroic air force soldiers are the clouds of the nation.

"The Central Figures in the European Situation in Confrontation" and "Illustrated Explanation of European Affairs" are a clear and concise analysis of the current situation. "A New Theory of War" is a rare thesis, with precise statistical figures and rare illustrations.

The modern Chinese cartoon exhibition held in Hong Kong a few days ago also selected twelve representative works to form an essential page, showing the contribution of advanced painters in the War of Resistance.

"The Base of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance - Gansu" makes people admire the greatness of the motherland. The "Pilgrimage to Yan'an" page, including eight illustrations, makes people look up to it and feel excited and optimistic about the future of New China. Ding Ling's healthy and determined portrait fully demonstrates the outstanding sons and daughters of the nation forged from the great era, and their spirit is a good example for young friends.

There are also: the panorama of the "Golden Soup of Bashu", Sichuan; the powerful and hot fourteen scenes of "Human Power"; the essence pictures of the Chinese Travel Service's, Phoenix City's "sensational" "Huang Hua Gang Seventy-Two Martyrs" play, the celebration of "Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Anniversary," and the innocent and lively little masters of "Nurturing to Support the Foundation of the Nation," all of which are the true portrayal of China in hard struggle, and a new China.

The editor, Mr. Zhang, said that he will strive to enrich the book and hopes that readers will give more criticism and suggestions and contributions, so that the book will become an advanced publication that bears the great task of the era.

### Hong Kong Fishing Boats肆 Slaughtered by Japanese Warships – Estimated Losses Reach 20 Million – Over a Thousand Fishing Boats Burned, More Than Ten Thousand Victims – Ignorant Fishermen in Sanmen Bay Actually Attached to Japanese

Since the Japanese warships illegally blockaded our coast in September of the previous year, incidents of Hong Kong fishing boats being attacked by Japanese warships in Hong Kong and overseas have been happening almost every day. Initially, a number of fishing boats accepted the government's advice and temporarily stopped going out to sea. However, as time passed, making a living became a real problem, so they ventured out to sea again at the risk of their lives, putting life and death out of their minds. If they encountered Japanese warships, they tried to escape. If they were captured, they resisted stubbornly, and most of them made heroic sacrifices, creating an unprecedented record of shipowners suffering.

Recent Statistics on Fishing Boat Casualties

Every time fishermen encounter difficulties at sea, the survivors report to the Overseas Chinese Fishermen's Association in Hong Kong. Over the past year, the Fishermen's Association has gathered reports from all parties and reported the true situation of fishermen's suffering to the ancestral country's government authorities. According to the recent statistical report released by the Association, from September of the previous year to the end of November of last year, a total of 628 Hong Kong fishing boats were burned by Japanese warships in Hong Kong and overseas, with 10,092 fishermen killed. From January to the end of May of this year, 16 fishing boats were burned and 34 went missing in five months. On average, 1,205 fishermen were killed. From September of the previous year to the end of May of this year, a total of 644 fishing boats were burned and 34 went missing in 21 months, with a total of 11,342 fishermen killed. The above figures are only based on statistics from fishermen's reports. Others who have not reported to the Association are not included. It is estimated that the total number of Hong Kong fishing boats burned and missing in the past 21 months is over 1,000, with an estimated financial loss of as much as 20 million yuan.

肆 Japanese Warships Acted Rampantly in Three Periods

According to reports, Japanese warships' oppression of fishermen can be roughly divided into three periods: initially, intimidation, burning fishing boats whenever they encountered them operating overseas; the second period was to implement a policy of appeasement, luring fishermen with benefits; and the most recent was to implement a policy of robbery. Therefore, in the past five months, there have been many more Hong Kong fishing boats missing. Both the missing people and boats have been captured. Only those who were at sea with them returned to Hong Kong to report. In addition to robbing property, fishermen's children are also the target of these people. It has been found that there are an average of six or seven children on each fishing boat. After the Japanese soldiers capture them, they rush them back to Japan to instill in them slave education, in order to replenish the number of young men in their country. This method is extremely vicious.

Ignorant Fishermen Lured to Attach Themselves to the Japanese

What is even more heartbreaking is that some ignorant fishermen have been lured to attach themselves to the Japanese. Near Sanmen Bay, a portion of the fishermen have been bought over by the Japanese. According to fishermen who returned to Hong Kong from Sanmen Bay, some fishermen there have been lured by Japanese benefits and have become traitors, forming a group to transport grain for the Japanese and are protected by Japanese warships to fish along the coast. When Hong Kong fishing boats sail to that area, they are attacked by Japanese warships. Many of the fishing boats that Japanese warships have robbed in Hong Kong and overseas in the past are also parked there. After the Fishermen's Association was informed, in order to prevent ignorant fishermen from being attracted and attached to the Japanese, it actively advised fishermen to be careful when going out to sea to fish, and not to sail near Sanmen Bay to avoid misfortune. Most fishermen also believe that fishing there is too dangerous and do not dare to sail there, instead fishing in places such as Lufeng, Jiazih, Jieshi, Pinghai, and Aotou to avoid looting by Japanese warships.

Authorities Improve Fishermen's Lives

The reason why fishermen attach themselves to the Japanese is due to the difficulties of making a living, which makes them susceptible to Japanese enticements. Recognizing this, the domestic military and political authorities have taken steps to improve the lives of fishermen. Recently, the Commander of the ×th War Zone, in order to investigate the living conditions of residents along the coast of Guangdong and improve them, organized a Guangdong East Sea Area Fishery Investigation Team and sent them to various coastal areas for inspection. The team recently arrived in Hong Kong and transferred to Bao'an. During its stay in Hong Kong, it investigated everything with the Overseas Chinese Fishermen's Association, which provided a great deal of reference information on the living conditions of fishermen. It also reported in detail the various forms of extortion by fishery and salt officials towards fishermen, requesting the authorities to thoroughly improve the situation in order to solve the fishermen's livelihood. The Fishermen's Association has also prepared a petition and submitted it to the authorities in writing, hoping that ways can be found to improve the situation.

### Diocesan Boys' School Student Strike - Resolution Expected Today

The authorities of Diocesan Boys' School in Ho Man Tin, Kowloon, recently appointed a Japanese student named Peng as the student body president. The Chinese students of the school, believing that his reputation did not meet public expectations and fearing that it would affect the patriotic movement, requested the school authorities to appoint someone else, but their request was not met. More than a hundred Chinese students have successively left the school. The school principal, Mr. Corbin, has tried to explain the misunderstanding to the community and the students of the school, expressing absolute sympathy for China's resistance to Japan. At the same time, he extended the deadline for the striking students to return to school to the 19th. Now that the deadline has passed, many of the striking students have not returned to school to attend classes. Both sides are taking extreme measures, which is not a good idea. Seeing this, the Hong Kong Student Relief Association specially appointed its director, Li Zhengyao, to mediate the matter. Mr. Li immediately met with the student representatives, listened to everything, and then visited Mr. Ho Minghua and Mr. Luo Xuhui, the chairman and vice-chairman of the school's board of directors, respectively, conveying the students' opinions and requesting Mr. Ho and Mr. Luo to discuss with the school principal and other school directors to first allow the more than 20 students of the second grade who left the school to return to school on Saturday (24th) to participate in the Junior Meeting of the Director of Education, and secondly, that the student body president, Peng, was originally only a temporary acting appointment until the expiration of his acting term on the 24th, and then request the school authorities to appoint someone else according to regulations. It is heard that the result of the negotiation was very satisfactory, and the opinions of both sides are very close. Bishop Ho Minghua has expressed to the representatives of the Student Relief Association that he hopes that the students who left the school can resume classes on Tuesday and that everything else will have a satisfactory solution. According to reliable sources, the students who left the school will all resume classes today, and a solution will be negotiated today.

### Lion Rock [Japanese] Warehouse - Collapses and Explodes - Gasoline Burns, Causing Great Loss

Since the [Japanese] army occupied Humen, they have set up ordnance warehouses in Lianhua Rock and Lion Rock on the mountain, storing a large amount of ordnance, ammunition, and supplies. However, in recent days, there has been continuous heavy rain and mountain torrents, which on the 14th washed away the large stone on Lion Rock, which was more than five zhang square. The gasoline stored in the rock was spilled at once, causing a fire, and the bombs in the rock also exploded at the same time. The sound of the explosion shook the mountains and valleys.

### A Discussion from Ancient Greece - The Various Aspects of the Olympic Games

- Ding Lao

- A More Valuable History of Sports -

The Decline of the Olympic Games - Greek sports had a tendency to decline. Some philosophers, such as Xenohhanosplaton, had criticisms, but they were useless. Later, sports became professionalized and specialized, so although the athletes' bodies were far developed, they had no moral cultivation. They forgot the meaning of representing their countries and their religious beliefs in order to win prizes for themselves. At the 96th athletic competition, the Elio judges were suspected of colluding because the athletes from their city won. At the 97th competition, the judges were bribed, and there was an event of unfair judgment.

Later, Rome conquered Greece. Although they still retained the custom of athletic competitions, Roman youth were mostly preparing to become politicians and political commentators. They were always in the position of observing and criticizing the success or failure of athletic competitions and were unwilling to fail and be criticized. Since the upper class was unwilling to participate, it was bound to fall into the hands of wandering performers. These people used sports as a profession, and the victory or defeat in sports had a direct impact on their lives, so they often used improper means to achieve victory. Because they only sought victory, they disregarded their physical health and even became disabled invalids as a result. However, the war-loving Romans needed sports to be as bloody as the battlefield in order to stimulate their senses and satisfy their pleasure. Therefore, in the large theater that could accommodate 80,000 people, they watched wild beasts fight. Local officials considered it a credit to their duty to raise wild beasts. The stench of blood was dissipated by sprinkling grape wine. The Romans were not satisfied with the sensory stimulation of animals fighting each other. They forced criminals sentenced to death to fight beasts. Their psychology was that they did not want people to kill beasts, but they wanted beasts to eat people. Later, they changed to criminals fighting each other with real knives. If one of the two was injured, the victor would ask the crowd for punishment. If the crowd pointed upwards, they would be spared; if they pointed downwards, they would be killed. They took pleasure in watching their dying misery. After they died, they were immediately carried out of the arena for fear of hindering the next fight. Even the children of Rome found this dark and miserable thing pleasurable. No wonder historians wrote in the history of the decline of Rome that the decline of sports was the only reason for the fall of Rome. The Romans regarded war as a business, so the celebrations of each victory were always cyclical. Some ambitious people, in order to cater to the public's opinion, made the youth perform practical combat-like sports. This kind of sport was later added to the practice of land warfare with 500 soldiers and 20 elephants, and the practice of naval warfare with the creation of lakes. They did not care even if there were deaths or injuries. When the Romans conquered Greece, they did not dare to desecrate the treasures of the Greek temples for fear of offending the gods. Later, some people gradually took them to decorate their homes. When Emperor Nero came to power, he transported more than a thousand treasures and was jealous of the marble statues of the winners, ordering people to destroy them. That is why the remnants and fragments of sculptures and stone statues, which are now considered to be rare treasures in art museums around the world, exist. He was opposed to the worship of Greek culture by his ancestors, but he himself wanted to be the winner of the athletic games. He specially opened the Olympic Games again and participated in the chariot race. He fell out of the chariot as soon as he entered the arena and used a lot of bribes to finally win. He also returned in triumph according to the Greek ceremony, wearing purple clothes, riding a white horse, and holding a laurel wreath in his right hand, proudly ordering the citizens to cheer and congratulate him on his victory. To sum up, the reasons for the decline of ancient sports are: first, the Roman's practical character; second, the Roman's need for strong sensory stimulation; third, Emperor Nero's nonsense; and fourth, the rise of Christianity. Among them, the fourth reason was the most fatal blow to the decline of ancient sports. At that time, the Roman class system was very strict. The upper class was chaotic and licentious, and the majority of the lower class could not bear the suffering of the world and hoped to go to heaven early and be willing to be martyred. Later, the doctrines gradually became popular, and people from the upper class began to believe in them. In 394 AD, Emperor Thedofsus made it the state religion and ordered that those who did not believe in the police religion would be punished. He also considered the Olympic Games to be a relic of pagans and resolutely banned them. The sacred games, which lasted for 1,170 years from 776 BC to 394 AD, came to an end. Later, the temples were destroyed by a major earthquake, and the arena was buried by floods. It was not until 1875 that it was excavated by the Germans and French. (8)
