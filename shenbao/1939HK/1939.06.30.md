### Concerning the Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo

The Tianjin Concession issue will be negotiated by the British and Japanese sides in Tokyo to seek a resolution. We already pointed out in yesterday's "Small Commentary": Recently, Japan × has been provoking Outer Mongolia on the one hand, and forcibly occupying Shantou and Dinghai on the other, announcing the blockade of Fuzhou and Wenzhou. At the same time, it is enticing and intimidating Britain. Yesterday, a sudden message of "complete withdrawal of Guangzhou × troops" was spread in this port. Although in fact Japan × may have withdrawn and transferred some of the troops stationed in Guangdong for military reasons, it can also be seen as Japan × cooperating with the ongoing great conspiracy of Wang's regime and others, rehearsing a certain posture before the negotiations with Britain!

According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 27th, the Japanese side put forward two requests in the negotiations with Britain. First, the Tianjin Concession should not be used by the Chinese for anti-Japanese activities. Second, the Tianjin Concession should not be used as a base to support Chinese national currency to counter the Japanese new currency. The agency reported: "The British government cannot agree to the second proposal." Judging from Chamberlain's recent speech, the British government's attitude seems to be to accept the Japanese demands. Despite the surging waves of opposition to appeasement diplomacy from the British people, Chamberlain's government still adheres to the principle of "never giving up peace until the hope of peace is exhausted." Therefore, judging from the current situation, it can be asserted that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo will not obtain a fundamental solution to the problem.

However, in fact, no matter how Japan × entices and intimidates Britain, and no matter whether Britain will continue to compromise and yield to Japan, one thing will not change: the development of Japan ×'s power will inevitably increase day by day. Its contradictions and conflicts with Britain, unless Britain voluntarily withdraws from the Far East, even if Britain and Japan compromise, will not last long. What's more, despite Japan × adopting all kinds of deceptive methods, in fact Japan × has already carried out an "undeclared war" against Britain!

At the same time, observing all the events that have occurred in the Far East in recent years, Britain's interests are completely consistent with our country's interests. Under the crazy attacks, plunder, and killings of Japan ××, we lost the four northeastern provinces, and Britain also lost all the rights and interests it originally enjoyed in the four northeastern provinces. Our troops and political power withdrew from North China, Central China, East China, and even South China, and Britain also lost all its original rights in North China, Central China, East China, and even South China, and its overseas Chinese encountered destruction, robbery, insults, and killings by Japan ×. On the contrary, our nation's war of resistance, in order to defend our country's territorial sovereignty, is also a powerful guarantee for Britain's interests in China. Therefore, if our war of resistance compromises or fails midway, it is actually Britain's failure and loss. If our war of resistance can persist, we will surely achieve final victory, and our victory is also Britain's victory.

Every Chinese should know this reason, and every far-sighted British person, even the British government, has already seen it clearly. Therefore, regardless of whether the British government will compromise with Japan at present, we can assert: China is not Czechoslovakia! Britain will not and cannot treat China as Czechoslovakia!

No matter how the Tokyo negotiations proceed, we not only absolutely do not allow the British government to disregard our country's interests, and not only absolutely do not allow this negotiation to inflict any damage to the interests of our war of resistance, but also at the same time, we must remind our compatriots: the result of our heroic persistence in the war of resistance for two years is that we have already obtained the right to speak on the Far East issue and any international issue related to our country, and we have the right to urge all countries to respect this right. However, we must also show the international community and friendly countries an even greater power, and show that our own power is enough to defeat Japan × and the traitors, and show that the Chinese nation will never be ruled by Japan × and the traitors. Then, every Chinese who is unwilling to be a slave must be serious and tense! Especially those compatriots who are close to friendly people every day, we must enhance our self-esteem and self-confidence!

### On Guerrilla Warfare in Flat Terrain

— Zhou Shiti

(1) The Importance of Guerrilla Warfare in Flat Terrain

1. The experience of twenty-four months of the war of resistance has proved that developing guerrilla warfare and establishing guerrilla bases in the vast areas behind and on the flanks of the × people has achieved its task.

A. It has mobilized and organized millions of people to fight against ×, destroyed the puppet regime, and kept most of the territory within the occupied areas of × in the hands of the Chinese.

B. It has consumed a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the × people, and restricted and dispersed a lot of the × people's forces.

C. It has shaken the morale of the × people's army and organized constant defections of the puppet army.

D. It has played a great role in coordinating with the regular army in strategy, campaigns, and battles.

2. The current war situation is in a period of transition from the first stage (× people attacking, our army strategically defending) to the second stage (× our strategic stalemate). Insisting on and developing guerrilla warfare in various areas on the flanks and rear of the × people, consolidating the original strategic support points and establishing new ones, and coordinating with operations in all aspects to achieve greater and more consumption, restriction, and dispersion of the × people, rapidly ending the first stage and transitioning to the second stage, so that the strategic counter-offensive can be carried out more guaranteed and smoothly in the third stage, is of great significance, especially in North China today, which is a more important and urgent task.

And in North China, there is more flat terrain than in Central and South China. Therefore, in North China, we should have the determination to develop guerrilla warfare in flat terrain.

If it is said that guerrilla warfare cannot be carried out in flat terrain and guerrilla bases cannot be established, it is equivalent to automatically giving up more than one-third of the territory in North China (the number I roughly calculated from the map), allowing the Japanese × to rule, letting millions of compatriots be destroyed and massacred by the Japanese ×, and letting unlimited resources be plundered by the × people. This is not only a lack of understanding of the essence and importance of guerrilla warfare, but also a lack of confidence in the development of the war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, the importance of guerrilla warfare in flat terrain should be understood from the entire anti-Japanese war, from the political, military, and economic aspects.

(2) Can Guerrilla Warfare Be Developed and Guerrilla Bases Established in Flat Terrain?

1. It is a fact that the terrain conditions in mountainous areas are better than those in flat terrain, guerrilla warfare is easier to develop, and guerrilla bases are easier to establish and consolidate. However, the main condition for establishing guerrilla bases and developing guerrilla warfare is the condition of the masses. The masses and the guerrillas are like fish and water. With water, fish can gallop freely. With the masses, the guerrillas can resist the × people and defend themselves. Whether in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, etc., the population and villages in flat terrain are always much denser than in mountainous areas. With the conditions of the masses (of course, to develop, organize, and lead), there are basic conditions that can develop guerrilla warfare and establish guerrilla bases.

2. Flat terrain can increase the effectiveness of air force, armored units (including tanks, armored vehicles, and armored trains), cavalry, and artillery. The × people's technology is superior to ours. These are unfavorable conditions in flat terrain. However, flat terrain also has many villages, large ditches, small ditches, mounds, gaps, rivers, forests, plants, and other terrain features, as well as the weather such as night, rain, dew, wind, and snow, which can easily conceal the troops and partially restrict the activities of the × people's technical arms. At the same time, the more the × people go deep, the longer the battle line becomes, and the less the × people's forces are allocated. Especially the × people's technical arms are limited, and most of them are used for a long time on the main battlefield, and the proportion allocated to the rear and flank guerrilla areas is very small.) It is not to say that the × people will not concentrate their forces and technology to attack guerrilla bases, but that in general, it is a minority. At the same time, automobiles and armored vehicles must have roads or better railways to travel. Tanks must rely on railway transport to hundreds of miles away from the combat area before they can be used. In order to prevent anti-tank guns, the use of tanks in densely populated areas around villages is of great concern, and the heat in the vehicle is very heavy, and the driver is mentally uncomfortable when driving from left to right. A driver must rest after working for a day. If armored trains can only run on railways, armored units are not used unconditionally, and they also have many difficulties. At the same time, we also have methods and experience to defend and resist. Therefore, in flat terrain, do not be overly afraid of the × people's technical arms. As long as there are mass conditions, a high degree of anti-Japanese sentiment and psychology, and a spirit of enduring hardship, guerrilla warfare can be generated in flat terrain.

3. In North China, twenty-four months of war of resistance have proved that guerrilla warfare can be developed and guerrilla bases can be established in flat terrain. In the northwest of Shandong, the northeast of Henan, the entire province of Hebei, the east, south, and north of Suiyuan, the Yanbei dam and Fenhe dam in Shanxi, not only small guerrilla teams, but also large guerrilla corps and regular corps can move freely, and large guerrilla areas have been established in Jizhong, Jidong, Jinan, and the plains in northwestern Shandong (although whether they are still consolidated or not). For example, our □ Detachment and □ Detachment operate in the flat dams of Yangqu, Qingyuan, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Qixian, Taigu, and Fenyang, fighting countless times with × and achieving constant victories, destroying the × people's puppet regime, and mobilizing and organizing a wide range of people. In particular, our □□ Detachment, in cooperation with the Security Detachment and a part of the Workers' Self-Defense Force, attacked the North Pass of Qixian in the middle of the Fenhe Dam in October and achieved complete success. When they attacked, they brought fifty oxcarts from a very far place. After the attack was successful, they transported back more than 2,000 pieces of cloth from the Japanese × cloth factory (more than 1,000 pieces were distributed to the masses on the spot, and some are still outside). This is a pioneering work and a miracle of guerrilla teams operating in flat terrain.

4. We are sure that guerrilla warfare can also be developed and guerrilla bases can be established in flat terrain, although it is more difficult than in mountainous areas.

(3) Several Tactical Issues

In flat terrain, we still have to apply the principle of "mainly guerrilla warfare, but do not relax mobile warfare under favorable conditions." However, the terrain conditions in flat terrain and mountainous areas are different. There are fewer opportunities to carry out large-scale mobile warfare in flat terrain, but it is not to say that mobile warfare cannot be carried out at all in flat terrain, but that guerrilla warfare is more important in flat terrain. Now, several tactical issues in flat terrain are described as follows:

(A) Matters to be Noted During Marching

1. In order to easily conceal and prevent air raids, it is advantageous for large units to march at night (the roads in flat terrain are flat and wide, which is convenient for night marching), but there are many roads and the terrain features are not easy to identify, so special attention must be paid to communication and liaison.

2. The roads in flat terrain are wide and large, so two to four columns should be adopted to shorten the marching distance, but in the daytime, in order to facilitate air defense, a considerable distance must be left between each detachment. There are many parallel roads in flat terrain. If a large group is mobilized, it can be divided into two or three columns.

3. During daytime marching, special attention should be paid to air defense. Every person, horse, and stretcher must be effectively disguised. When × planes are discovered, quickly leave the road and use the nearby terrain features. Even small ditches, mounds, field ridges, grass, and trees are very valuable. Regardless of whether there are terrain features to use or not, take a lying down posture. Do not densely conceal in villages. When concealing, disperse in units of squads. Commanders and dispersed troops should pay attention to liaison. At this time, special attention should be paid to the vigilance against the × people on the ground (especially the cavalry). If the air defense shooting troops, such as the × planes, have not discovered us and are not within the effective shooting range, they should not shoot.

4. Flat terrain has convenient transportation and many roads. The mobility of × people's cavalry, armored units, and automobiles is great. Even if the distance from × is very far, there should be concerns about encountering ×. Therefore, reconnaissance, vigilance, and combat readiness must be paid attention to at all times. There are many parallel roads in flat terrain. The vigilance troops of the vanguard, rearguard, and flank guard must be dispatched according to principles and circumstances. When resting on the way, vigilance must be dispatched immediately. Negligence and perfunctoriness are not allowed. This time, the □ Company of the □ Detachment attacked the puppet army in the flat dam southeast of Guisui and seized fifty or sixty horses. Because they did not pay attention to reconnaissance and vigilance, they were ambushed by × near Sitongzi, resulting in the loss of all the seized horses and spoils, and the loss of contact with several people. This is a serious lesson.

(B) Matters to be Noted During Bivouacking

1. The division of bivouac sites should meet the tactical requirements. Although all troops should be bivouacked together in winter and spring, if there is a lack of houses, they can be squeezed together as much as possible. The entire bivouac plan should not be affected by the relationship of the houses.

2. Send out vigilance first, and then enter the bivouac site. After entering the bivouac site, cadres at all levels and communicators should check the terrain, paths, and emergency assembly areas in and around the bivouac in advance. Cadres at all levels must consider the handling of the discovery of × people. There must always be duty troops to deal with temporary incidents, and the routes within a hundred miles around must be investigated and drawn into a route map.

3. Reconnaissance and vigilance must be strict and comprehensive. In addition to the main force sending out reconnaissance, the vigilance troops must send out reconnaissance squads or groups to continuously reconnoiter at a distance of tens of miles outside the vigilance line. The vigilance troops must prepare for force and weapons in accordance with the vigilance principles and local conditions. In general, they should be strengthened more than in mountainous areas, and the distance can be slightly faster. They must also do work and disguise. Observers can be placed on trees or roofs to disguise or in sorghum fields (using ladders, observers sitting on the ladders).

4. Air defense. Every bivouac site must have a dedicated air observation post, air defense alarm, and air defense shooting troops. Distinguish the shaded areas. The shaded locations should not be in the village. Small ditches, mounds, botanical gardens, forests, and all possible terrain features can be used, and single-person air defense shelter holes or four or five-person air defense shelter ditches can be made and disguised. If time permits, pay attention to the attacks of the × people on the ground, especially the cavalry. Therefore, in addition to the vigilance troops, each unit should have special ground observers.

In air defense in flat terrain, the most important thing to pay attention to is smoke. The air force can detect smoke in flat terrain from a long distance. It is the best marker for indicating targets to the air force. Therefore, the time for burning fire in the bivouac site should be planned and regulated. It is best not to burn fire from 8:00 to 16:00. Breakfast should be cooked before 8:00, and dinner should be cooked in turn in the afternoon to avoid finding a lot of smoke at the same time. If × air force is found, all fire and smoke should be extinguished, and it is stipulated that pits are not allowed to be burned during the day.

5. If you are defending against air raids, it is advantageous to station in small villages because large villages and cities have larger targets.

(C) Matters to be Noted During Combat

1. Flat terrain has convenient transportation, and × people can quickly reinforce, and the effectiveness of firepower is increased. The × people's firepower has an advantage. If the combat time is prolonged, it is unfavorable to us. Therefore, during combat, we must be more decisive, brave, and quick, and it is advantageous to resolve the battle in a short time.

2. Estimate the strength of the × people's firepower, so we must be good at concentrating and using our weapons, and organize firepower in a planned way. Use sudden and fierce firepower to gain the advantage of firepower in a short time. At this time, the assault team should resolutely and quickly carry out the assault. Before the × firepower is deployed, I have already approached the × people and carried out a melee, so that even if the × people's weapons are superior, they cannot be used. In combat in flat terrain, on the one hand, we must avoid and reduce the harm of the × people's weapons. This is the key to combat. At the same time, there are few opportunities for overshooting, and the number of gap shootings increases. These should be paid attention to in peacetime education.

3. Flat terrain is convenient for the activities of technical arms such as tanks, armored vehicles, armored trains, and cavalry, as well as the air force. Whether marching or bivouacking, we must pay attention to the defense and resistance of × technology, and strengthen the education of × technical arms in peacetime.

4. In combat, our commanders at all levels are often in front of the troops or in the first echelon. This is caused by the revolutionary sense of responsibility, but in this way, they are often prone to unnecessary damage, especially in flat terrain, where the firepower is fierce and it is not easy to conceal. Therefore, the position and command post of commanders at all levels should be based on the standards of being able to command the subordinate detachments and observe the situation in all aspects. They should not be too close to the front, and should be disguised.

5. Villages and towns are better in flat terrain, and they are often strongholds for attackers and defenders, becoming terrain features of great tactical value. According to the experience since the war of resistance, the × people often use villages and towns as strongholds when fighting with us, and we lack weapons and have some weaknesses in tactics, so it is not easy to overcome when × uses villages and towns. There are more opportunities for village combat in flat terrain. We must practically apply the past experience and lessons of village combat and the tactical principles of village combat in the troops and increase the exercises of village combat.

### Our Forces Fight Valiantly Near Jieyang; Shandong Changes from Defense to Offense, Advancing on Multiple Routes; Japanese Army Busily Deploying, Planning Further Offensives

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Because the Japanese army has difficulty advancing on various battlefields, they are using their navy to harass coastal areas. Our Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong forces have new deployments, and the invading Japanese will suffer heavy losses.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The Japanese army in Southern Shandong is now on the defensive. We are advancing on multiple routes, and the overall situation is turning in our favor. In Shanxi Province, in the area between Xia County, Wenxi, and Jiang County, there have been local engagements for the past two days. In the southern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway, the Japanese army is still busily deploying, with plans for further offensives. The number of Japanese troops at Fenglingdu has decreased compared to before, but they still sporadically shell across the river. In northern Henan and eastern Henan, there are constant small engagements. Central Hubei is calm. The remaining Japanese forces in Qianjiang are still trapped.

Large Army Arrives in Eastern Guangdong; Japanese Troops in Chaoshan Have No Strength to Penetrate Deeper

[Our Newspaper, Shaoguan, 30th Dispatch] The Japanese army in Shantou, fearing an attack from our forces from the rear, have again occupied Chao'an. Our XXX Army rushed to Chao'an to reinforce, but unfortunately, it was too late. Our XXX Division and XXX Division are currently deploying from Hailufeng to Jieyang. The self-defense corps led by Hua Zhenzhong is fighting the Japanese army along the Chaoshan Road with the XXX Division, with minor losses. Their retreat was carried out according to a pre-determined plan and did not have the chaotic situation that happened during the fall of Guangzhou last October. According to a senior staff member here, the Japanese in Chaoshan will not invade northwards. Shaoguan is difficult to sneak through because of the Luofu Mountains that obstruct the area between Chaozhou and Shaoguan. Furthermore, the Japanese who landed were naval marines, who lack the strength to penetrate into the interior. A portion of our Guangxi Province's mechanized troops has arrived north of Conghua and Xinjiekou to block the Japanese army from invading northwards.

[Our Newspaper, Shaoguan, 30th Dispatch] It is said that the Japanese army's invasion of Shantou is related to the ambitions of the Mitsui Zaibatsu. This is because the Chaoshan area is rich in mineral deposits, which are coveted by the Zaibatsu.

[Central News Agency, Liuhuang, 28th Dispatch] According to a Jieyang phone call, the Japanese army invading Shantou dispatched two shallow-water warships carrying approximately one thousand soldiers late at night on the 26th, sailing west along the river to Guanbu, which belongs to Chaoyang. There, they switched to speedboats and went straight for Jieyang. On the morning of the 27th, they landed about thirty li southeast of the county seat, between Beizhai and Paotai City, and fled north. A small portion, about one hundred soldiers, raided Paotai City, while the majority turned northeast, passing through Pingjiao, where Chao'an and Jieyang meet, on the western side of our Fuyang-Fengxi line, intending to coordinate with the Japanese army on the front of the railway. They were ambushed and attacked by self-defense corps from various villages along the way, suffering more than half casualties. The remaining Japanese forces were met with strong resistance about ten li west of Fuyang-Fengxi, and are currently engaged in mixed combat. The Japanese forces raiding Paotai City were repelled by our counterattack and retreated towards Beizhai.

[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan] The Japanese forces invading Chaoshan this time number around ten thousand. Due to rising river waters, Japanese ships are extremely active. Our army, according to the original plan, fought hard on the two lines of the outskirts of Shantou City and national defense works for six days and nights, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. It is estimated that more than a thousand Japanese have been annihilated. Our army transferred to a new position at You (5-7 PM) on the 26th. Now, our reinforcements have arrived on the front lines of Chaozhou and Jieyang, and are counter-attacking the Japanese army.

[Express News from Daxu News Agency, Xingning] After our army in Fuyang changed positions, it made close contact with the reinforcements. Near Tiechang, the terrain is narrow, and the Japanese army did not dare to advance easily. On the morning of the 29th, multiple teams of planes attacked Tiechang, Xinxu, Xichang, and Jieyang County, bombing and strafing everywhere. Many bombs were dropped, and the extent of the damage is unknown.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 28th Dispatch] Early this morning, our army took advantage of the moonlight to launch a surprise attack on the Japanese army near Shengang in Conghua. The Japanese initially resisted stubbornly, but our artillery exerted its power, concentrating bombardment, killing more than two hundred Japanese soldiers. More than a thousand remaining Japanese soldiers were routed from Shengang in a panic, and retreated to the mountains to the east, relying on solid fortifications to hold their ground. At dawn, more than ten Japanese planes bombed and strafed our army in batches to assist in the battle. A portion of our army detoured and attacked Dagang Ridge (north of Shengang), the outer defense of the Japanese army from the south, cutting off communication between the Japanese army and Taipingchang. As of 3 PM, the fighting between us and the Japanese army was still ongoing. Also this morning, a portion of our army advanced to Wenmenlu in the southeast of Shengang, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army. Because of excessive casualties, the Japanese army was routed to Zhushiling behind them, and our army is currently in pursuit.

Martial Law Implemented in Fuzhou; Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing in Yuhuan Area

[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 29th Dispatch] A well-known foreign military observer here stated that the Japanese army's attempt to occupy Fuzhou and Wenzhou has no military value, and occupying Shantou and Chao'an is not enough to cause major damage to the Chinese. The supply of Chinese military arms in Guangdong is transported from Chongqing, and although coastal areas have been occupied, it will have absolutely no impact on China's overall strength in resisting Japan.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Chinese authorities have declared martial law in Fuzhou and are actively preparing to resist the Japanese army's invasion. Starting today, all Chinese and foreign ships are prohibited from entering or leaving the port. Chinese coastal artillery units engaged in fierce artillery battles with eight Japanese warships outside the mouth of the Min River on Tuesday (the 29th).

[Guomin News Agency, This Port Dispatch] Since Xiamen and Jinmen successively fell, the Fujian authorities have long been making military preparations for Fuzhou. Residents have been ordered to evacuate the old, the weak, women, and children early, to prepare for when necessary. The front lines of Fuzhou have also been deployed and stationed with heavy troops. The people of Fujian have always been rich in the spirit of resistance. This is clear and verifiable in national history. Moreover, the people of Fujian have an irreconcilable hatred with the Japanese. Tracing back to the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, pirates harassed Fujian, carrying out cruel massacres. The people of Fujian are eager to kill the Japanese, and heroes against the Japanese have emerged in every generation. Qi Jiguang and Zheng Chenggong are the most famous of them. Moreover, the mountains of Fujian Province are connected, and the terrain is naturally formed. The dangerous places at sea have been set up with artillery batteries everywhere since Li Shijia took over as commander of Mawei, and are equipped with new-style cannons. The military and civilians can cooperate effectively. They are only afraid that the Japanese will not come. Now that the Japanese are invading, they should start a bloody battle and shatter the Japanese people's dream of aggression.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] It is reported that Chinese troops on Yuhuan Island, near Wenzhou, are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops that landed.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 28th Dispatch] This morning at 9 AM, more than two hundred Japanese troops were added to the Kanmen Zhiyan Artillery Battery Mountain area of Yuhuan. Zhan Yinzi, the Magistrate of Yuhuan County, still led his troops to constantly strafe and attack them. At 12 PM, Kanmen was finally abandoned due to the complete destruction of the fortifications. After the Japanese entered Kanmen, they immediately set it on fire. The fire has not been extinguished by the evening. The battle is still ongoing.

Artillery Battle North of Xinqiang River; Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing in Southwestern Shanxi Province

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 29th Dispatch] On the morning of the 29th, sporadic artillery fire was again heard north of the Xinqiang River. It is assumed that the Japanese army was carrying out probing firing towards Weiwulingxia Yan'an on our north bank, lasting more than ten rounds, then stopped.

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 28th Dispatch] An artillery battle occurred north of the Xinqiang River on the 28th, which ceased after five hours. Our guard troops at Weiwuling and Majiawan on the north bank deliberately exposed targets in the morning to attract the attention of the Japanese observation teams. Before long, Japanese guns north of Changshan and Manjia Mountain concentrated their fire on the area, firing over a hundred rounds each, including poison gas shells. At that time, officers and soldiers had entered the shelters, so losses were minimal.

[Zhongzhong News Agency, Xingji, 29th Dispatch] The Japanese troops invading south along the Baijin Highway have recently been entering and exiting the areas of Zouma Ling, Xiyang, Niu Temple, and Gucheng (all south of Qiaodian). Their main force is still concentrated in Quindian. On the night of the 21st, our XX Division engaged in fierce fighting with them at Shanggu until the morning of the 22nd, then it became calm again. On the 24th, a portion of the Japanese army harassed southward along the highway, but retreated north after seeing our counterattack. Currently, the Japanese forces in that area are looting the people's property, forcibly conscripting laborers, searching and arresting XXX every day, and constructing fortifications and rushing to repair highways in the areas of Zouma Ling, Xiyang Niu Temple, with the appearance of a long-term occupation. We are taking the opportunity to encircle and attack.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 28th Dispatch] Military news: at 2 PM on the 27th, about two hundred Japanese troops engaged in fierce fighting with our army for three hours at Mulizhuang (more than ten li west of Longhua Town in Gucheng). The Japanese army could not hold out and retreated to the southeast. After dusk, the Japanese force sneaked back and was again repulsed by our army.

[Central News Agency, Wu XXX, 28th Dispatch] More than three hundred Japanese troops from Fengzhen invaded the Longshengzhuang area on the evening of the 14th, but were lured to the mountains. In the fierce battle until noon on the 15th, more than fifty Japanese troops were killed, and two vehicles were destroyed. The remaining Japanese troops fled west, and our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them to Shudong Shuhe and other places in Suiyuan.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 28th Dispatch] When our army attacked Wang Mao Town (north of Yuanqu) on the 16th, it surrounded the Japanese army's baggage train and annihilated them all, with no survivors. All of the Japanese supplies were captured.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 28th Dispatch] A unit of our army in eastern Henan attacked the Yejigang Station east of Landaidong on the night of the 22nd, killing twenty to thirty Japanese troops and destroying a section of the railway track.

### National Government Establishment Anniversary; No Celebrations to be Held

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Regarding the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government on July 1st, the Central Government had previously resolved to hold a joint celebration. However, there is no need for people from all walks of life to hold celebrations on that day. Furthermore, since the start of the War of Resistance, the Central Government has decided to strive for simplicity in all celebrations. If there is a need to hold an event, the Central Government will first issue an order to all localities to comply.

### Disregarding British and American Objections, the Japanese Army Implements a Blockade of Wenzhou; Orders the British Hospital in Datong to Withdraw; Britain Demands a Reply to the Tinker Case

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] A Shanghai-based foreign source reports that the British naval authorities informed the Japanese side that the British Navy would send a warship to Fuzhou to protect British nationals. However, the Japanese side stated that if the British warship did not withdraw from Fuzhou before 11 AM today, the Japanese side could not be held responsible. It is reported that the Japanese side has decided to ignore the British protest and implement a blockade of the Wenzhou estuary.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] According to foreign news, the situation in various parts of South China has not changed significantly in the past two days. The British ships "Sharnet" and "Scott" are still docked in Shantou. The most recent British ship to call at the port of Shantou was the "Jiangsu" of the Taikoo Company. Other British ships are still sailing to Shantou as usual, but they are all anchored outside the harbor. There are two British destroyers in Fuzhou, and no British nationals in Fuzhou have been evacuated.

[Reuters, London, 28th Dispatch] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons on the 28th regarding the situation in South China, that the Japanese authorities have announced their intention to take military action on the 27th of this month against the treaty ports of Wenzhou in China. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, made a request to the British Consul-General, Mr. Fu, that all foreign merchant ships and warships should leave these ports before noon on the 29th of this month. The British Consul-General immediately rejected it, stating that the right of British ships to navigate to Chinese ports must not be infringed. The British government believes that the Japanese authorities have no right to interfere with the actions of British ships and the lives and property of British nationals.

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Regarding the news that the US ambassador to Japan, representing the US government, sent a note to the Japanese government, stating that if the Japanese army occupies Fuzhou and Wenzhou, the Japanese side must be fully responsible for all losses of American nationals in the two locations, US Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday and expressed tacit agreement on the matter, explaining that the US government has granted Admiral Yan Luer, commander of the US Navy in China, greater authority to deal with unexpected matters, but the power of decision-making remains in the hands of the US envoys in the Far East.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Northern Ping foreign dispatch: The Japanese military authorities here have ordered the hospital run by the British Church outside Datong to withdraw from the area within one week. The hospital's superintendent, Bishop Norris, has gone to Datong to investigate everything. It is said that the Japanese side has long intended to buy the hospital. The total value of the hospital is as high as 400,000 yuan, but the Japanese side is only offering 75,000 yuan. Now they want to force the hospital to hand it over by force.

[Central News Agency, London, 29th Dispatch] The British government has issued an urgent order to British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, instructing him to demand that the Japanese government promptly issue a reply to Britain's previous protest regarding the murder of Tinker in Shanghai by the Japanese army.

### Anti-British Movement in Qingdao; Britain Protests to Japan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Shanghai foreign dispatch: An anti-British movement has recently erupted in Qingdao. Anti-British slogans have been posted on streets, lanes, and in front of the British Consulate. The British Consul has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side.

### Wang Jingwei Returns to Shanghai; Met with Wang Kemin and Sugiyama in Beiping

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Ping foreign dispatch: After meeting with Wang Kemin and Sugiyama, Wang Jingwei returned to Shanghai. Wu Peifu insisted that he must have absolute autonomy in finance, diplomacy, and military affairs before agreeing to come out of retirement, so Wang did not meet with him.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 29th Dispatch] Regarding the news that Wang Jingwei and the Japanese government have formed an agreement to organize a "united government" with Wang as the head of state, well-informed political circles here state that this is premature. Since the two puppet governments of Beiping and Nanjing must cede some of their rights to Wang, they will definitely object. Unless the Japanese side acts as a mediator, Wang's plan will not be supported by the two puppet governments of Ningping at the meeting next month. It is also heard that Wang's relatives and friends, who recently returned from Tokyo, said that the first step of Wang's plan is to reorganize the "Kuomintang" in the Japanese-occupied areas and arbitrarily change the Kuomintang's party platform to suit the Japanese government's slogan of "Asia is for Asians." Wang is currently conducting a large-scale propaganda campaign. In the past few weeks, Wang has bought several Shanghai newspapers.

### Chongqing Groups Express Sympathy to Compatriots in Tianjin; Soldiers and Civilians on Eastern Battlefield Call on All Countries to Restrain Japan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th Dispatch] The Japanese army has blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin for more than half a month. Various trade associations and women's cultural circles in Chongqing are very concerned about the compatriots in the concessions who are in dire straits. They have sent telegrams to express their condolences and encourage them to fight to the end.

[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Eastern Jiangxi, 27th Dispatch] Since the Japanese army illegally blockaded the Tianjin concessions, the soldiers and civilians on the eastern battlefield have been extremely indignant. They all advocate using national diplomacy to telegraph the British, French, and American governments, strongly restrain Japan, and express sympathy and support to our compatriots and foreigners trapped in the Tianjin concessions. The party, government, military authorities and people's organizations, cultural organizations of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and the political department of the XXX War Zone have jointly telegraphed to the Central Propaganda Department to translate and transfer to the envoys of Britain, France, and the United States and the heads of state, foreign ministers, and parliaments of various countries, expressing support and asking for joint and strong restraint against Japan. At the same time, they also telegraphed to the national press and compatriots across the country, unanimously advocating.

### Li Hanhun Returns to Guangdong from Chongqing

[Daxu News Agency, Shaoguan Express] Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun went to Chongqing on the 15th of this month to meet with the central authorities, report on the administration of Guangdong Province, and request instructions on future policies. He originally intended to stay in Chongqing for a longer period of time, but the provincial government has telegraphed urging him to return to Guangdong and preside over affairs due to the outbreak of the Chaoshan battle. It is reported that Li has already set out from Chongqing and is rushing back as soon as possible.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The Japanese army has repeatedly broadcasted absurd rumors in Tokyo, attempting to confuse and mislead listeners. A few days ago, they again employed their habitual tricks in Tokyo, promoting the rumor that Li Hanhun, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, has been dismissed. The reporter took the opportunity to speak with the spokesperson of the Military Commission yesterday, who said that since Li Hanhun took charge of Guangdong, he has been loyal and hardworking, and has made many achievements. The government has high expectations for him. It is the nature of the Japanese to fabricate things out of nothing, but this clumsy propaganda is truly laughable for those who are knowledgeable.

### The Japanese Attempt to Poison the Jiangzhe Area; Our Guerrillas are Ordered to Monitor

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th Dispatch] The Japanese army is implementing a poisoning policy in the occupied areas of Jiangzhe. A large quantity of drugs is being continuously shipped from North China to Shanghai under the control of the Japanese side by traitorous merchants, and then transferred to the interior. Our guerrillas have been ordered to severely punish these traitorous merchants once they are discovered.

### The Period for Stopping Traffic on the Qi'ao Highway is Pending

[Daxu News Agency, Zhongshan Express] Yesterday, it was rumored that the Qiguan Car Company plans to stop traffic on the Qi'ao Highway on July 1 due to thorough destruction. According to a senior official of the 6th Guerrilla Area Command, the highways in Zhongshan County have been destroyed in segments to meet wartime needs. The Qi'ao Highway is destroyed in three segments, but it is still temporarily possible to drive in segments. As for when the destruction will be such that traffic is impossible, this will be determined by the military authorities based on observations of the situation. The Qiguan Car Company has no such power.

### Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong Water-Land Transportation; Jointly Managed Automotive Teams Are in Operation

[Our Newspaper, Jinhua, 29th Dispatch] The authorities of the five provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong believe that since the War of Resistance, inter-provincial trade has become increasingly developed, and the adjustment of products between the provinces is particularly urgent. They have specially prepared for joint water-land transportation in the five provinces. Now, the joint water-land transportation office for the five provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong has been formally established in Jinhua. Each province has a branch office to manage transportation affairs. The office has specially authorized commercially operated vehicles. Automotive teams with five vehicles are also operated, starting on June 11. Its journey starts from Zhejiang, passes through Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, and ends in Guangdong Province. Therefore, in the future, joint passenger and freight transportation among the five provinces will become more convenient.

### Chongqing China-America Cultural Association Hosts Johnson; Tea Party Scheduled for July 1

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Kong Yongzhi, president of the China-America Cultural Association, Chen Lifu, vice president, and others are scheduled to hold a tea party on July 1 to welcome US Ambassador Johnson. They have invited representatives from China, America, and other friendly countries stationed in Chongqing to attend.

### Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing Five Times; It's Not Worth the Loss; The Japanese Spent 40 Million, We Lost 5 Million; Estimated by Foreign Aviation Experts

[Shanghai Communication] Shanghai's Millard's Review commented that the recent five air raids on Chongqing by the Japanese army cost at least one million US dollars each time, five times costing five million US dollars. This is the opinion of foreign aviation experts, several of whom were in Chongqing when it was bombed. The Japanese figures are as follows: The average number of bombers participating in the air raid was 27. Each time the Japanese lost four of their planes. Each bomber of the type used by the Japanese costs approximately US$125,000. Losing four planes each time is US$500,000. Each bomber carries seven airmen, four of whom operate machine guns. Training an airman in the United States costs approximately US$100,000. If it only costs half that much to train a Japanese airman, the loss is not difficult to calculate. In addition, items such as bombs and gasoline are also considerable. Each plane carries approximately one thousand pounds of bombs, which costs an average of approximately US$1.50 per pound, so each plane's bombs cost approximately US$1,500. Since the nearest air force base is in Hankou, each plane flies for eight hours, requiring approximately 800 gallons of aviation gasoline. Shanghai's major companies sell aviation gasoline wholesale at approximately US$0.25 per gallon, so each plane's gasoline costs approximately US$200. The total cost for the entire team is approximately US$5,400. The property destroyed in Chongqing may not exceed 5 million legal tender. Therefore, the cost of the five air raids by the Japanese army has reached 40 million legal tender at the current exchange rate.

### A Flourishing Baoji

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

The story of Emperor Gaozu of Han "openly repairing the plank roads while secretly crossing Chencang" is something everyone finds familiar and interesting! The Baoji discussed here is the location of Chencang (facing Baoji city across the river). However, since the completion of the Longhai Railway to this point after the War of Resistance, it has emerged with a brand new, epoch-making appearance.

In the past, Baoji suffered from inconvenient transportation and backward education. Generally speaking, political establishments showed little progress. According to the current County Magistrate Wang Fengrui: In over twenty years since the Chinese Revolution, its power had not yet reached the county government. The so-called department clerks and officials were mostly people from the former Qing yamen, numbering from over ten to twenty. They handled the work of the departments, but received only sixty-four yuan per month, including food, lodging, and office expenses. Corruption was rampant, which was self-evident. Not to mention any administrative construction, even the county government was worse than a "beggar's shelter" in terms of living conditions. However, successive county magistrates and hereditary department clerks and officials had always accepted this with equanimity.

But the Baoji of today is vastly different from before. This Magistrate Wang studied engineering and originally worked in the Ministry of Industry. Chiang Kai-shek, recognizing the importance of Baoji's municipal construction, specially transferred him to this position. To implement a new administration, new people were needed, so he appointed sixteen young university graduates as assistants. However, the county government had limited funds, with each person receiving a monthly salary of sixteen yuan, while meals cost seventeen and a half yuan. To cover the shortfall, Magistrate Wang had to allocate funds from his own tax revenue commission to subsidize them. These sixteen young people were focused on getting things done and didn't care about anything else. All income and expenditures of the county government were recorded using bank bookkeeping methods, with daily clearings of each entry. If superiors wanted to audit the accounts or if there were visitors, the books could be taken out at any time to make everything clear at a glance. Such financial transparency in the county government was truly commendable. In general county administrations, foot binding and men's queues were being abandoned, but this area still needed efforts to promote it. Last month, a queue-cutting campaign was started, and in the county seat and the market town alone, over seventeen thousand queues were cut off. This shows one...

During wartime, the county government, together with Yue Zhi, Director of the Political Department of the ×th Reserve Division, and all personnel, vigorously promoted...

In terms of industry, since the War of Resistance, factories from major cities, affected by the war, have successively moved west to Baoji. These include textiles, printing, machinery, batteries, matches, soap, dyeing, etc., totaling about two hundred large and small enterprises. Each industry also has cooperative organizations, numbering up to forty-three units. Six or seven thousand unemployed workers displaced from the war zone have been resettled there. The important machinery of each factory is protected using wartime scientific methods, dispersed in the countryside, and hidden deep in cave dwellings. If we change the ancient poem "The wild goose flies in the vast sky, what does the hunter seek?" to "The factories are hidden in the depths, where will the iron crow safely lay its eggs?" to praise the safety of Baoji's underground factories, it would probably not be an exaggeration!

The number of ordinary air-raid shelters is almost comparable to a beehive. Enemy planes have ravaged this place twice, dropping fifty to sixty bombs. The number of deaths and injuries in the first attack was only about twenty, and the second time it was reduced to only seven or eight.

There was an old bad habit here: residents, whether in cities or villages, did not pay attention to public hygiene and could defecate anywhere. Later, after the ×th Division was stationed here, strict measures were taken to ban this. Sentries were posted every morning to arrest people, catching hundreds of people every day. One morning, a certain division commander even personally took action, single-handedly capturing over thirty of these "illegal manufacturers and traffickers of poison," and sentenced them all to digging air-raid shelters: "Planning it, building it, completing it in no time." From then on, illegal trafficking disappeared, and air defense was also successfully completed.

Baoji previously had no newspaper. Later, through the planning of the division headquarters, the Zhengzhou Popular Daily agreed to move its publication here in April, publishing a small newspaper daily, priced at two yuan every three months. The division headquarters printed and distributed methods to encourage citizens to read the newspaper, urging citizens to subscribe, with the aim of achieving one copy per household, so that people's intellect and cultural endeavors could achieve practical results together.

Baoji has become a communication center connecting the Northwest and Southwest. In terms of products, in addition to the cotton and wheat mentioned above, there are also the dense forests of the Southern Mountains, abundant coal mines in several places, and large waterfalls that can be used for power generation, all of which are sufficient to meet the needs of the currently numerous factories. Therefore, land prices have soared. For example, farmland near transportation routes, which used to be worth tens of yuan per mu, has now risen to over a thousand yuan. If this place does not encounter any special setbacks in the future, the prosperity of its industry and commerce, and the development of its cultural undertakings, have truly unlimited potential.

Civil training work is in line with the needs of wartime. Among them, able-bodied men, village chiefs, neighborhood heads, tea servers, prostitutes, merchants, refugee children, theater performers, skilled workers (storytellers, fortune tellers, and various other performers), etc., have all undergone training for more than two months, and most have achieved relatively satisfactory results.

The trained people have actually participated in and done quite well in tasks such as fundraising, propaganda, comfort, air defense, rescue, and reconnaissance. For example, the number of wounded soldiers transferred here from the front lines often reaches ×× percent. Whether they are old or new arrivals, the people warmly comfort them. Each theater hosts them for a show once a week, bathhouses welcome them to bathe once a week, barbershops take turns going to the hospital to cut hair once a week, and students from various schools also constantly go to the hospital to sing and perform dramas, and write letters for them. The women's comfort team (mostly composed of prostitutes, totaling one hundred and sixty-one), also goes to the hospital every week to sing and perform, or have separate conversations. The feelings of mutual friendship between the military and the people are built up day by day, which can directly encourage morale and indirectly improve social order. Prostitutes were trained in nursing and special service subjects. During the two bombings of Baoji, they were able to bravely step forward to rescue the dead and injured. In addition, they have also solved several theft cases, so they have won high praise from the general public.

The new construction in the county seat is primarily the installation of water filters and water pipes, using spring water from the Northern Mountains to supply drinking water for the entire city. It is said that this is the first county in the Northwest to have running water. Second is the county government's underground office, which is currently being excavated on a mountainside near the city. The design is so perfect that it seems to be more than just for the county government's temporary air defense. There is also a municipal engineering plan, which will probably be implemented soon.

Bao County produces very little rice. The annual output is about four hundred shi. The output of cotton and wheat is relatively high. The annual cotton production is about six to seven hundred thousand jin, and wheat is about forty-eight thousand five hundred shi. Commerce is not very developed. Among the goods on the market, the largest sales volume is for rice, wheat, medicinal materials, and printed cloth.

### Tianjin Situation Unresolved - Japan to Intensify Blockade - Consuls from Both Countries Have Gone to Tokyo - Rumor is Japan Will Present Four Demands

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Shanghai dispatch: According to Japanese sources, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin will intensify their blockade of the British Concession starting in July. From July 1st or 2nd, all entrances and exits of the British Concession will be limited to one-way traffic. The evening curfew will also be extended. The Japanese authorities in Tianjin also stated that they cannot accept the British protest this Thursday regarding anti-British movements in various locations.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Tianjin dispatch: The British Consulate-General announced yesterday that the British Consul in Tianjin, Herbert, left at 5:00 AM this morning via Tanggu on the British warship "Decoy" to participate in British-Japanese negotiations regarding the Tianjin issue. It is reported that the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Tanaka, is scheduled to leave today to participate in the negotiations in Tokyo. Yesterday, the general situation in Tianjin had eased. No incidents occurred at the Japanese military obstacles in the concessions. The local situation is now easing. General attention has shifted from Tianjin to Tokyo. At the same time, there is much discussion about the outcome of the negotiations and the impact of this meeting on British rights in North China. On Tuesday afternoon, a British tugboat carrying several Chinese and foreign passengers was forced by the Japanese military to dock at the Dalian Steamship Company pier for inspection. It was detained for several hours before being released.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tianjin dispatch: Well-informed Japanese observers recently stated that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have no objection to the British and Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. However, based on the observations of the Japanese diplomatic and military authorities in Tianjin, the following four points should be the minimum conditions for Japan to resolve the Tianjin incident: (1) The British and Japanese should jointly conduct strict inspections and suppress "terrorists." (2) Anti-Japanese elements within the British Concession should be suppressed with strict measures. (3) The economic chaos in North China should be resolved. The British should cooperate in implementing the economic policies of the newly organized North China government. (4) The 48 million yuan in reserves stored in Chinese banks within the British Concession should be handed over to the "Provisional Government of Peiping."

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 29th] On Tuesday, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, held a meeting with the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, for two and a half hours. It is reported that the main issue discussed was the Tianjin incident. As for the results, nothing has been announced.

[Central News Agency, London, 28th] Regarding the Tianjin incident, sources close to the Foreign Office here stated that Britain does not intend to change its current general policy in the Far East, especially regarding Chinese currency. The 48 million Chinese currency stored in British Concession by Chinese banks should not be handed over to the Japanese. The Chinese financial issue is not only related to Britain, but Britain's policy towards China is also part of Britain's overall foreign policy. When the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, holds talks with the Japanese authorities, he should treat the Tianjin case as a local incident and try to resolve it, lest the Japanese use this case to change Britain's policy towards China. In summary, the principle of maintaining neutrality in the British Concession of Tianjin is acceptable to the government, but Britain's authority within the Concession must be maintained intact.

British Houses of Parliament - Day-Long Verbal Debate

[Reuters, London, 28th] During today's discussion in the House of Commons on the recent situation in Tianjin, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the supply of perishable foods remains intermittent and only a small fraction of the usual amount is being delivered to the British Concession. The British authorities in Tianjin have taken effective measures to compensate for the current shortage. A total of fifteen British residents, including one woman, were forced to undergo strip searches when crossing the blockade line, but such incidents seem to have ceased in the past day or two. Representatives of the local British and Japanese authorities will be invited to Tokyo to attend a meeting to jointly resolve all issues related to the current situation in Tianjin. Chamberlain continued, "The scope of the negotiations will be all local incidents, and will seek to determine the nature of the British Concession, maintaining neutrality while ensuring British sovereignty. In view of the convening of these negotiations, the British government anticipates that the strip searches in Tianjin and all similar incidents will cease from now on, and there is ample reason to hope that this anticipation will become a reality. In this environment, the government does not intend to consider submitting this dispute to the Council of the League of Nations based on Deng's suggestion. Regarding South China, the Japanese authorities have announced that they will implement military operations against Wenzhou and Fuzhou. The British authorities have received a request from the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, ordering all ships of third countries (including warships) to leave the aforementioned two commercial ports by noon on Thursday (the 29th). The British Consul-General in Shanghai replied, stating that the British Navy's freedom to sail to any Chinese commercial port remains unchanged, and that the British also feel that the Japanese authorities are unreasonably interfering with the movements of British ships or deliberately endangering the lives and property of British residents. The situation regarding merchant ships going to Shantou is still unclear, and negotiations between the local British and Japanese authorities are continuing."

[Reuters, London, 28th] Lord Elibank expressed his opinion in the House of Lords today, saying that the Japanese insult to Britain in China this time will be difficult to forget even after a long time. He found the Japanese government's suggestion to ask Britain to cooperate in suppressing anti-Japanese elements particularly unbearable. The word "cooperation" in the Japanese dictionary actually means "giving whatever is demanded," so he hoped that Sir Robert Craigie would not forget this point when conducting negotiations with the Japanese in the future. Japan may also request British assistance in its currency in North China. Fortunately, the British government has refused and hopes to persevere to the end, so that international trade and British trade in China will not be trampled on. The fifty million yuan in silver deposited in the Chinese Bank in the Tianjin Concession is especially coveted by the Japanese. He hopes that the British government will not hand it over. At the same time, he hopes that Japan will not press too hard, as British tolerance also has its limits. Foreign Secretary Halifax then assured Lord Elibank that the government would consider Lord Elibank's observations and hoped that Lord Elibank would absolutely trust the government.

[Reuters, London, 28th] National Labour Congress representatives Sir Walter Citrine, Dr. Hugh Dalton, and Herbert Morrison met with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in the Prime Minister's Office in the House of Commons today to discuss various diplomatic issues, lasting two hours.

[Reuters, London, 28th] Winston Churchill warned listeners in a radio address today that the situation in Europe would reach its most tense state in the next three months. At the end of his speech, he also mentioned the situation in Tianjin. He said, "I see Goebbels' Italian partner Dagay will laugh at us because of the British residents in Tianjin. However, once the security of the Mediterranean is ensured, there will be no need to send warships to the Far East, and the Japanese will also restore their inherent courtesy. Japan is mired in the war against China. Japanese blood has been spilled everywhere in China, and national strength is being greatly depleted. In North China, it is being suppressed by the Soviet Union. I don't believe that Japan will be willing to fight the British Empire before recognizing what changes are taking place in the European situation. Therefore, we should commend the government's patience and firmness in dealing with the distant problems." Finally, Churchill again called on the government to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, London, 29th] The Times stated, "Regarding the Tianjin incident, it would be premature to say that it will be easily resolved, but Tokyo's agreement to negotiate shows that the ambassador's policy of patient diplomacy has been successful. The differences between Britain and Japan can now be discussed in Tokyo, where the arrogance of the warlords is not as high as in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. No matter what demands Japan puts forward, the fact that this matter has been moved from Tianjin to Tokyo proves that the Japanese government is willing to seek a peaceful and reasonable solution."

### German-Italian Air Force Cooperation Agreement Announced

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th] The German-Italian Air Force Cooperation Agreement was officially announced today. The agreement was signed by German Air Minister Goering and Italian Air Force Commander General Valle.

### Britain Begins Appeasement Again - Submits Memorandum to Germany - Asks When Negotiations Can Begin - How to Obtain Treaty Guarantees

[Reuters, London, 28th] The British Embassy in Berlin has submitted the British reply to the German memorandum on the cancellation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The British Foreign Office also published the contents of the memorandum tonight, stating briefly that regardless of where Germany becomes involved in a war in Europe, Britain will not necessarily take a hostile attitude towards Germany. Britain will only become hostile if Germany undertakes aggressive actions against other countries. The German government's claim that Britain is pursuing a policy of encircling Germany is completely unfounded. Britain has no intention of limiting Germany's commercial development and has already provided Germany with a large amount of raw materials. If Britain and Germany can establish mutual trust and friendship, the British government is very willing to hold negotiations with Germany to improve Germany's economic position. The British government's wish is not only not to wage war against Germany, but also to establish British-German relations based on mutual understanding of each other's needs, and to seek to avoid conflicts with the interests of other countries. The main purpose of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is to achieve a stable state and avoid unnecessary arms races. Therefore, the agreement does not have a unilateral cancellation clause. Today, it is stated that cancellation or modification must be discussed by both parties. When the agreement was signed in 1935, it was declared to be permanent in nature and stipulated that, except for submarines, the condition for modifying the agreement was a major shift in the naval balance. Even if this situation has occurred, Germany must consult with the British government before modifying the agreement. The German government has violated these regulations and did not consult with the British government on the situation before taking the action of canceling the agreement. The British government previously notified Germany of the British Navy's planned strength. Its sole purpose was to fulfill the terms of the 1935 agreement and to allow Germany to fully utilize its 1935 quota. However, if Germany is no longer bound by the 35% quota stipulated in the agreement, the British government can no longer be bound by its past planned strength. Therefore, the planned strength has already been considered canceled. If Germany wants to seek to reopen negotiations and establish another agreement, the British government is very willing to know Germany's views on the scope and purpose of the new agreement. What it especially wants to understand is (1) When does Germany think the discussion to establish a new agreement should be held? (2) How will Germany guarantee that, during the implementation of the new agreement, agreement should be obtained from both parties on the issue of cancellation or amendment?

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th] The British Embassy in Germany delivered the British government's note on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to the German Foreign Office last night. Hitler, Ribbentrop, and other government officials immediately convened a meeting to study the contents of the British note. The original text of the note was also published in newspapers. The People's Observer's commentary was completely negative in nature, believing that the British note did not contribute to peace and was sufficient to prove that the agreement should be cancelled. The newspaper also said that the wording of the British note was provocative, only stating that Britain had no intention of pursuing a policy of encircling Germany, while the words expressing willingness to engage in discussions were expressed in unfriendly language.

### Soviet Army Autumn Grand Exercise - Extremely Important Significance

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 29th] It was announced here today that the Soviet Army's grand autumn exercise this year will be held in the Leningrad Military District. In political circles, in view of Leningrad's proximity to Finland in the north and Estonia in the west, the current international political situation, and the Soviet Union's insistence on guaranteeing the Baltic states, this exercise is considered extremely important.

### Soviet-Japanese Air Combat Again - Two More Japanese Planes Shot Down - Central News Agency Reporter Goes to Inspect

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] According to the official news agency, fifteen Japanese bombers, protected by fighter planes, flew over the area of Lake Buir today on the "Manchurian" border. Soviet anti-aircraft guns shot down two Japanese bombers, and dispatched fighter planes to intercept them. The Japanese planes eventually retreated to "Manchukuo."

[Central News Agency, Somewhere on the Outer Mongolian-"Manchukuo" Border, 29th, 2 Telegrams] This reporter went to inspect a location on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" yesterday, and toured a week at the location which had been bombed by Mongolian planes previously. Strangely, no one there knew anything about the air combat, nor were there any signs of the Mongolian planes. It was only said that news had been received from the Buir Lake area that there had been a small-scale air battle there on the 27th of this month. A fighter plane caught fire and went down. The pilot then jumped out with a parachute. The soldier was immediately captured by the Japanese army. This reporter got to see the soldier. He was unable to say more because he was extremely shaken and also had burn wounds. The only thing known was that his name was Teraminsky, and he was 23 years old. The atmosphere is extremely tense here, and it is believed that a major war will break out before long.

### US Again Finances ×

[Reuters, New York, 28th] Two Japanese manufacturers recently ordered steelmaking plant machinery from the United States, valued at several million yen.

### British Royal Society Meeting - Ambassador Koo Speaks - Denounces Japanese Aggression - Destroys Open Door Policy

[Reuters, London, 28th] Ambassador Wellington Koo spoke today at the Cobden Memorial Meeting of the Royal Society, saying that Japan's acts of aggression have not only destroyed Chinese sovereignty, but "the principle of the Open Door has also been destroyed by these notorious acts." One of the main goals of Japan's policy of aggression against China is clearly to weaken and destroy the principle of equal opportunity, which in the past fifty years has proven to be a major force in stabilizing relations between China and other countries. Ambassador Koo continued, "The ultimate goal of the Japanese government is becoming increasingly clear. Its goal is to exclude all foreign interests in China obtained through commercial treaties. The instability of the commercial interests of Europe and the United States in the Japanese-occupied areas is increasing. No matter what assurances Japan provides, in fact the open door is only open to Japan's exports, not for the benefit of other foreign countries." Ambassador Koo continued to warn his listeners that if Japan once swept across China and then used this large workforce, using China as a market for its products and as a huge warehouse for its mineral and agricultural resources, then Japan would certainly "use these unlimited and immeasurable human and material resources as a tool for aggressive annexation." Ambassador Koo's speech was entitled "Open Door and World Peace." Attendance at the meeting was very enthusiastic, and all were well-known figures. It was chaired by Lord Lytton. Ambassador Koo said that in the Far East, the principle of the Open Door is not only considered the basic principle for maintaining relations between China and foreign countries, but also the basic principle for maintaining relations between countries.

### Chamberlain to Deliver Broadcast

[Reuters, London, 28th] Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a radio address at five minutes past nine o'clock on Sunday evening (standard time), entitled National Service. The broadcast will last about ten minutes.

### British and French Representatives Meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Yesterday - Soviet Union Recalls Chargé d'Affaires to Japan

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] According to authoritative sources here, after French Foreign Minister Bonnet and British Ambassador to France Phipps held a meeting, the British and French governments have reached an agreement on the new instructions to be submitted to the British and French representatives in Moscow. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Special Envoy Strang will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Thursday.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet received US Ambassador Bullitt and British Ambassador Phipps on Wednesday afternoon. It is reported that the purpose of the US Ambassador's trip was to pay a courtesy call after suddenly returning from the United States, and to take the opportunity to provide a face-to-face account of the United States' diplomatic policy towards Europe. It is also reported from communication circles that the meeting between the French Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador was to discuss the British side's new proposal to Moscow. The contents of the proposal were communicated to the British Ambassador in Paris to inquire about the views held by the French Foreign Office and report them to the British government.

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union's Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Smetanin, has been recalled to Moscow. The reason for this has not been announced, but foreign observers believe that his return to the country is to report on the situation in the Far East to the government and to receive the government's views on this.

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] Soviet parliamentarian Zhdanov published an article in "Pravda" today, stating that the negotiations for the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance pact are progressing slowly, and that Britain and France are really to blame, with Britain bearing even more responsibility. The Soviet Union has made various efforts to ensure the speedy realization of the mutual assistance pact, but so far there has been no significant progress. This is enough to show that Britain and France do not want to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union on the basis of equality. What they hope for is that after the Soviet Union concludes the treaty, it will shoulder all the obligations. They do not know that any self-respecting country will never be willing to be played with at will, or to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for others. The Soviet Union's power and solemnity have been universally known, and it is even less willing to agree to this kind of treaty.

### Complete Success of the Anglo-French Conference

[Reuters, Singapore, 29th] Vice-Admiral D'Argenlieu, Commander-in-Chief of the French Naval Forces in the Far East, told a Reuters reporter today that the Anglo-French joint defense conference was a complete success. The Anglo-French Commanders-in-Chief in the Far East will meet regularly to discuss the situation.

Brief Commentary

### The Call from the Eastern Front

Today's news reports that the Party and government authorities, people's organizations, cultural organizations, and war zone political departments of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have jointly sent a telegram to both domestic and international audiences regarding the illegal blockade of the Tianjin Concession by Japanese forces. The telegram calls for international sanctions against Japan and expresses sympathy and support for compatriots trapped in the Concession. This is a movement that deserves enthusiastic response from all regions and sectors of the country. We, being overseas, should even more so feel obligated to use all our strength to urge friendly nations to jointly promote the aid-China and anti-Japanese movement. We should also call on overseas Chinese to unanimously launch a campaign to express sympathy for our compatriots trapped in Tianjin.

However, we must also clearly recognize that the current dire situation of our compatriots in the eastern provinces is particularly unbearable to imagine. This is partly due to Japan's intimidation of Britain, and partly due to Japan's eagerness to exploit the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of our occupied areas to "support the war." Therefore, from Shanghai, Dinghai, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou in the north, to Shantou and Chaozhou, there is again a state of extreme fear.

Therefore, we must not only respond to the call from the eastern front, but also do our best to assist our soldiers and civilians on the eastern front—supporting their resistance against Japanese forces and the traitor Wang Jingwei, and opposing Wang Jingwei and his group's traitorous rhetoric of peace and anti-communism. We must be vigilant and aware that Japanese forces and Wang Jingwei are attempting to use this kind of activity, even coordinating with deceptive maneuvers such as the "withdrawal of Japanese troops from Guangzhou," to orchestrate political conspiracies and deceptions during the second anniversary of the "July 7th Incident." They aim to divide and split the unity of our nation, completely undermine our national policy of resistance and reconstruction, and shamelessly betray the Chinese nation, condemning our entire people to eternal slavery under Japanese forces!

### Situation in Danzig Suddenly Tense; Nazi Troops to Make Unusual Moves; Polish President Delivers Strong Speech

[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] It is reported that the Nazis in Danzig are rumored to be making military preparations. However, upon hearing this news, there are no signs of unrest here. Polish newspapers are all questioning whether the Nazis are about to launch an attack. There are many rumors circulating, but the general public's attitude can be summed up in the words "monitoring" and "vigilance."

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] After learning of the news that German troops and armaments have arrived in Danzig, newspapers here fear that the Nazis will take action and warn Germany. They also believe that Britain and France will fulfill their obligations to Poland. "Le Figaro" reports that German troops will be instructors for the Danzig Free Corps, attempting to prevent any forward action by Poland and enabling German troops to invade the Vistula River. "L'Ordre" states, "If Hitler seizes Danzig and succeeds, he will become the overlord of Eastern Europe. Prime Minister Daladier's speech on Tuesday showed that he has no illusions, but Chamberlain continues to give speeches filled with doubt, encouraging Nazi actions, or even imagining a new Munich, which will be the death knell of Britain and France."

[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] Polish President Mościcki delivered a broadcast speech today, strongly asserting that the ports of Gdynia and Danzig are extremely important to Poland's national economy. "The connection between Danzig and Poland has lasted for thousands of years, and the reason lies in this." Gdynia and Danzig are both free ports, where merchants from all countries can freely conduct business.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 29th] A certain foreign expert on international affairs here stated that German leader Hitler has ordered the acceleration of agricultural harvesting in East Prussia, Czechia, and Moravia, in order to store more grain to cope with a possible crisis in mid-August. German troops continue to concentrate in eastern Moravia, and troop movements are carried out at night to avoid attention. The Polish border area is also preparing to build barracks sufficient to accommodate 100,000 soldiers.

### The Guarantee of World Peace

— Shichang

It has been over four months since Britain, France, and the Soviet Union began negotiations, but the final agreement has been delayed. The crux of the problem is clearly the guarantee for the Baltic states. Other difficulties are not a problem. According to recent news, Britain has decided to make concessions again and is prepared to accept all of the Soviet Union's demands. Therefore, the establishment of an Anglo-Soviet agreement will surely be realized in the near future.

We should recognize that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality, and are for the benefit of everyone. If the Baltic states were to be invaded, the security of the Soviet Union would be seriously threatened, and Britain would also feel uneasy. Moreover, if Britain and France do not approach the Soviet Union, hold negotiations, and establish an agreement, then the Nazi fleet could boldly sail into the Baltic Sea, invade the Soviet Union, and threaten Britain and France. However, after the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement, their combined strength will be strong enough to deal with any aggression, preventing aggressors from acting recklessly without any consideration. This is truly the guarantee of world peace.

We recognize that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are all peace-loving countries. The purpose of their mutual negotiations is not only to ensure their own security, but also for world peace, or more precisely, European peace. Therefore, it is clear that the main purpose of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement is to avoid war. Britain and France will not provoke war, which everyone acknowledges. The danger of war lies in Germany. If Hitler says again that he opposes war, it is somewhat true, because the Nazi Party hopes to promote a bloodless system of conquest. Wasn't the annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia very good?

Hitler loudly clamors that Germany must recover its old colonies, and he is even more ambitious for the area from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. However, to achieve this goal, there is no other good way except through war. Therefore, all of Germany's actions are based on war; the entire economy is based on a state of war readiness. Eighty percent of production is war materials and military supplies. Wages are low, the purchasing power of the people is reduced, and food imports are replaced by war materials. Everything is centered on war, sacrificing bread for cannons. Germany's situation has reached an extremely dangerous point.

All countries are familiar with Germany's situation. Hitler and the like are not unaware of the crisis in their own country. However, they still have a glimmer of hope, which is to wait for a good opportunity to fight a battle. Other than this, there is no good way to save the country from its misfortune.

This is the current state of crisis in Europe. Germany urgently needs to seek external development, while the democratic bloc must prevent the imminent acts of aggression. Of course, the future trend is mysterious and unpredictable, and no one can accurately predict it. However, finding the direction to achieve peace is not very difficult. The importance of the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance lies in this. Before launching an aggression, Germany must consider that Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, Poland, and Turkey will be in a hostile position with Germany. Moreover, Italy's cool attitude and the neutrality of the Balkan countries are all unfavorable to Germany. However, if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union fail to reach an agreement, everything will be very different. At that time, the Nazi leaders will surely mobilize quickly and launch a surprise attack on neighboring small countries, the consequences of which would be disastrous.

The current international situation is maintained under tense circumstances. Those who care about peace are all showing worry on their faces. However, the manipulators of the overall situation and the decision-makers of war and peace are still in London and Moscow. Undoubtedly, the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement will be the guarantee of world peace.

### University Education

Is University Worth Attending?

To study the value of modern university education, the Harvard University class of 1911 is a good source of information. Our class was made up of very ordinary students, with no particularly good academic records, no nationally renowned athletes, and no outstanding thinkers. College students in the United States represent only 5 percent of the total population, and we are among the fortunate few to receive so-called higher education in the world. Now, let us study how we have used this opportunity for higher education.

In our class, there are truly many talents: a former commander of the American Legion, a vagrant who hasn't slept in a bed for five years, the owner of a gas station, a former director of the New York Stock Exchange, a machinist, a radio broadcaster, a senior official of the League of Nations, a university president, a railway postal worker, a lunch wagon renter, and a member of the Harvard Club in Sing Sing Prison. In addition, there are many more.

In our class, 50 percent of us admit that our current occupation is not what we originally hoped to do when we graduated from university. Some of us have changed jobs five or six times and are still looking for new ones. Only 5 percent have stuck to one occupation from graduation to the present.

In our class, I also discovered several surprising facts. Twenty-five years after graduating from university, one-eighth of our classmates are receiving government relief or are relying on their families for support. Some classmates can't even spell the president's name. Twenty-five years after leaving university life, the average income of our entire class is $4,500 per person per year. In the eyes of those of us who have received a university education and have been in society for a quarter of a century, this number is certainly not a lot.

After investigating these 541 people in detail, I feel that a university education does not guarantee a stable life. Some classmates who married wealthy women have invested their money wildly and spent it all. Some classmates let their fathers-in-law invest, and they also failed. Many classmates stuck to one occupation and suffered the effects of the economic downturn. On the other hand, there was a poor kid who worked his way through college and only knew a dozen or so classmates. Now, he is the big boss of a chain of cigar companies. The kid who made money answering phones at the stock exchange at night and came to school during the day, not knowing when he slept, is now one of America's great scientists. The classmate who joined every club in school and shook hands with people all day long recently paid $2,645 in income tax.

So, what special benefits did the four years of so-called university education bring us? There are many people in the world who have never attended university, but they have also accomplished great things and done things that have benefited mankind. From the perspective of some people in our class, a university education is undoubtedly valuable. But to sell stocks, sell securities, do insurance business, sell real estate, be an investment consultant, or be an interior decorator, there is no need to receive a university education.

Universities have always been regarded as a beacon of wisdom. But now, this beacon of wisdom has produced such a group of citizens. If you send your son to university because you want him to socialize with the children of the wealthy or hope that he will earn a lot of money in the future, then you should think again about whether you are wasting his time and your money.

Finally, I must state that this is talking about the United States. Whether it is the same in China is unknown.

### One Person Per Day

Han Yu, a great master of Chinese studies, was most afraid of monks and Taoists talking nonsense, believing them to be "demons that would destroy the country." His door was always posted with "No monks or Taoists allowed," and he never gave them a single hair.

The high-ranking monks in the capital often suffered his anger and hated him to the core.

Once, they found a handle and went to see Master Han, asking:

"Since you despise Buddhism and Taoism so much, why is your young son's nickname 'Monk Brother'?"

"That's too simple," Old Han said solemnly. "Haven't you heard that Wang Laoer, the night watchman, calls his son 'Doggy,' and Li San, the vegetable seller, calls his son 'Kitty'? My son is called 'Lunge,' which is the same meaning."

### Plan

Not long ago, an American women's magazine solicited the opinions of domestic women on the topic of "The Ten Most Important Things That Modern Women Think Are Important." The following are the results obtained by the magazine, ranked in order of importance, with the most important ranked at the top:

(1) Beauty
(2) Emotion and Love
(3) Economic Stability
(4) Youth
(5) Health
(6) Children
(7) Fashion
(8) Family
(9) The Surrounding World
(10) Entertainment

### Rain Flower

Officer: How is your health?

Recruit: I don't understand.

Officer: Nonsense, don't you understand your own health?

Recruit: Because my body has been dedicated to the country, it is not my own body.

Lawyer: It would be good if you could prove that you were not at the scene when the theft occurred. At that time, did anyone see you anywhere?

Defendant: No. Fortunately, no one saw me, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do it.

Metropolitan woman visiting a pasture: Oh, that cow keeps looking at me.

Guide: That's because you're wearing red.

Woman: The hateful thing, does it know in the countryside that this dress is not fashionable this year?

A: I can't fall asleep if I drink coffee.

B: I'm the opposite. Once I fall asleep, I won't drink coffee.

### Weather Station

What is it called? In Hanoi, one is attacked and expelled; in Shanghai, one cannot live; in Nanjing, no one cares; in Beijing, there is unanimous opposition: What is this called? A burial ground.

We are very fortunate that the British Empire is indeed a country with democratic politics. This time, we have seen it even more clearly. Every day, the House of Lords speaks, the House of Commons discusses, you question, I criticize, strong, strong! Public opinion is expressed with great enthusiasm. !

, Stripped naked, is not insulting; the Japanese say. John Bull says: Let's discuss it, it doesn't matter.

A Hong Kong news item. A faithful report: "The Hong Kong and Kowloon Tour Guide Industry held a charity fundraising meeting for the 'July 7th' memorial at the Ko Shing Tea House yesterday. Seventy-two tour guide agencies from Hong Kong and Kowloon attended, with representatives reaching one hundred people. After the meeting, the chairman gave an opening speech, saying that all Hong Kong organizations are preparing to commemorate 'July 7th', each fulfilling the responsibility of a citizen. Therefore, the Hong Kong and Kowloon tour guide industry will also conduct a charity tour on 'July 7th' for one day and one night, and all proceeds will be allocated, with one-tenth to be used to console the family of the martyred Chinese detective Yin Wen, and the remaining nine-tenths to be sent to the central government to strengthen the forces." Long live patriotism!

### Tidbits

There was a fellow who liked to write articles, but his writing style was poor. Every time he wrote an article, he would use "Alas" a lot. Often, the text was less than two hundred words, but there were already seven or eight "Alas." Once, his friend added a long comment behind one of his favorite masterpieces, which was full of "Alas":

Beginning with "Alas," ending with "Alas," in the middle, everything is "Alas." Long "Alas," short "Alas," saying it over and over again, it's always "Alas." "Alas" and "Alas," "Alas" and again "Alas," I'm afraid you'll soon be "Alas"!

### A Small Question

There is a piano in the living room, and a parrot on the piano. John is playing the piano, and Tom is singing and walking around the piano. When the parrot sees Tom turning, it also turns. Tom turned five times and stopped, and the parrot also stopped.

Now, please answer: How many times did Tom turn around the piano? How many times did Tom turn around John? How many times did Tom turn around the parrot? How many times did the parrot turn around the piano? How many times did the parrot turn around John? How many times did the parrot turn around Tom?

### Sea Storm

— By Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi

The previous text excerpted from 1914

In the autumn of that year, Jack, the radio operator of the Cox shipping company, and Bill, the mechanic, took the German ship "Kaiser Wilhelm II" to travel to Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then fled madly. Soon, they encountered icebergs and British warships' shelling. With great difficulty, they escaped the tiger's mouth and returned to White Sea, America. Jack and Bill then returned to New York to see Mr. Cox. Cox then asked them to go to Europe to find his son...

"Exchange them for cash and take them with you," he handed over the checks, "If these are used up, Lee House and Harding in London are my agents, you can find them for anything you need. Also, this time, do you want to bring anyone with you?"

"Sir, I was also preparing to say that this kind of hard work, Bill Nanuo—"

"Him, I know, that lanky kid. Not bad, but is he willing to go with you?"

"I think he will be willing."

9 Remembers the Account Again

This kind of errand, as Jack himself said, was almost impossible to succeed. However, Jack was still childish enough, and he was quite happy to take this opportunity to tour wartime Europe. As for Bill Nanuo, he was somewhat addicted to being stimulated.

The 'Saint Mark' was a very famous ship, and in the past, she was often fully booked when she sailed out. However, this time, there were very few first-class passengers, and second-class passengers were as sparse as the morning stars. As for the lower class, there were fewer than one hundred people, most of whom were going back to Europe to enlist in their home countries.

When they sailed out of the harbor, the two sides were lined with ships of all sizes, from small freighters to large liners with four smokestacks, all docked there. Before the war, they traveled between Torkinsville, Statesville, Florida, and other places for business, but now, everything seems paralyzed and stagnant. The United States is a neutral country, and it is her responsibility to inspect outgoing ships and prevent them from carrying wartime contraband, especially those flying the flags of belligerent countries.

After being questioned by a young junior officer, the "Saint Mark" lowered its flag and sailed out of the harbor.

"Okay, Jack," Bill Nanuo said, at this time, Jack had just finished sending a few farewell and business letters for the ship, "We're on the road again."

"That's true, and this time, thank goodness, we're under the American flag, which is really good luck these days."

"That's true, but do you have any idea which port the ship will dock at?"

"It's still unknown, we have to wait for telegrams from the New York or London companies to decide."

"The position we're holding now is really a novel one, Jack,"

"Isn't it? I hope it goes smoothly. In any case, it's an opportunity for us to see the situation during the war."

"That's a great opportunity, but as for finding Tom Cox, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack, it's really not easy."

A large man, with a black beard, walked into the radio room, holding a letter he had already written.

### The Passing and Throwing of Water Polo – Lecture

— Pan Congshao

In order to throw the ball far, with great force, or to throw it high, strong arm strength must be used. The higher the upper body rises out of the water, the greater the force of the arm swing and the waist. When throwing the ball with one hand, the other hand should extend sideways in the water to assist the arm's power, and at the same time, apply a slight downward pressure to help the body float. It is important to note that this hand in the water should be able to produce a floating-body assisting action.

Floating the body is a skill that throwers must practice diligently for flexible use. In water polo passing, receivers must also have high swimming skills for floating in the water. As for its importance in ball-grabbing, it goes without saying.

Possessing the ability of freestyle swimming, knowing how to hold and throw the ball, and passing water polo, it is possible to practice the entire water polo sport. Here are a few key points for shooting at the goal for the reference of those who are learning.

From a water polo strategic perspective, how to arrange formations for advancing and the art of scoring require quick and unexpected techniques. Daily shooting practice should focus on the basic techniques of throwing. The water polo goal is not very wide, and if the goalkeeper has the talent to jump high out of the water, it is not easy to throw the ball into the net. Therefore, scorers must:

First, the throwing power must be fierce and the action quick. Because the competition area is not wide, shooters often approach the goal before throwing, making the goalkeeper intimidated. And because the action is quick, even if the goalkeeper is calm, they may not be able to react in time due to the suddenness of the attack.

Second, the direction of the throw must not be obvious. Because throwing occurs close to the goal, the direction of the throw can be easily observed. Therefore, the gesture of releasing the ball should appear as if still in the preparatory throwing motion, so that the goalkeeper does not have the chance to observe and react.

Both of these points are feared by goalkeepers. Apply one's strengths to exploit the opponent's weaknesses that cannot be overcome. Acquiring these basic movements is of great value. (End)

### "Two-Ton Giant" Loses to "Black Boxing King": Galento Fails in the Fourth Round

[Reuters, New York, 29th] The world heavyweight boxing champion, "Black Boxing King" Joe Louis, fought "Two-Ton Giant" Galento last night at Yankee Stadium.

### Tai Chi Style Diplomacy

— Qianli

Peace, peace, turning big matters into small matters, and small matters into nothing. This is the policy adopted by "Peace Angel" Mr. Zhang Bolun since he took office. However, sometimes, when forced by those unreasonable and reckless barbarians, "Peace Angel" Zhang has no choice but to temporarily put down the slogan of peace and talk about his strength. He said, "Look, our British navy is the strongest, our British air force is the best in the world, and the power of our tanks and cannons is unmatched by anyone. We are not afraid of anyone, and we are 'not afraid of war'. If you continue to be reckless and overconfident, then you will regret it..."

Sometimes, these words have some effect, so Mr. Zhang takes advantage of the situation to bring those disputes to a compromise ending. But sometimes, when encountering even stronger barbarians, they see that Mr. Zhang, holding a peace umbrella, is not really a god of war, and the umbrella cannot replace guns and swords, so they ignore him and continue to be reckless. At this time, Mr. Chamberlain's situation is indeed a bit difficult, but he also has a way, which is to contact all parties, asking everyone to endure, concede, sacrifice, and prevent the event from escalating, holding on to "peace."

Using this method, he produced the "non-interference policy" towards Spain and the "Munich Conference" towards Czechoslovakia, preserving the "peace" of the world!

Our Mr. Wu saw that Mr. Chamberlain's diplomatic policy was very skillful and infinitely varied, so he called Mr. Zhang's policy "playing Tai Chi," saying that it was "hard in the soft, soft in the hard, using gentleness to overcome strength, a clever strategy that makes the opponent unable to deploy." He told people not to underestimate this old man.

As far as I know, probably no one would dare to underestimate this skillful and sophisticated diplomatic strategy. Unfortunately, those reckless barbarians do not understand the advantages and disadvantages of Mr. Zhang's "Tai Chi policy" and continue to be reckless. So as a result, Spain was sacrificed, Czechoslovakia was also sacrificed, and Austria and Albania were sacrificed one after another. In addition, Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania... are also in imminent danger of being sacrificed.

In the Far East, China itself has been sacrificed in large part, and the interests of the great powers in China have perhaps been sacrificed even more. The market in Manchuria has been completely occupied by the Japanese barbarians, and the foreign markets in North China and Central China have been almost completely excluded. The few remaining concessions are also in turmoil. The police power in Gulangyu is being wantonly trampled upon and blockaded, the Shanghai Municipal Council is repeatedly threatened, British ships are repeatedly bombed, and British diplomats are constantly being insulted and kidnapped. All of this is the fine fruit of Mr. Chamberlain's "peace diplomacy" in dealing with the powerful.

Now, in the Tianjin incident, the opponent's reckless methods seem to be even more thorough. The Japanese devils not only confine the citizens of the great British Empire within the electrified concession, cutting off the supply of vegetables and meat, but also play all sorts of tricks, such as forcing British expatriates to strip naked in broad daylight for intrusive searches, even the genitals and hair cannot be spared, and even further demanding that Ms. Duan Tesheng, a British expatriate, take off her pants in public. Such extreme treatment is probably rare even in conquered countries. However, Mr. Chamberlain seems not to care. In addition to firmly stating that "the serious stage of retaliation has not yet been reached," he has also sent Ambassador Craigie to Japan to visit Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, asking him to have mercy and stop the Japanese actions. This is probably the method of using gentleness to overcome strength in the Tai Chi diplomatic policy.

However, can this Tai Chi style diplomacy achieve results, causing the Japanese to finally see the light and be merciful, and ultimately be overcome by gentleness? Or will it only "encourage the Japanese to continue their atrocities"? From the evidence of the facts, it seems to belong to the latter. Did we not see the Japanese troops landing in Gulangyu withdraw because of the same actions of the British, American, and French? Isn't the supply of meat and vegetables in the Tianjin concession only able to pass through because of the protection of British troops?

Why doesn't Japan immediately occupy the British concession in Tianjin? It is not because Mr. Zhang's Tai Chi style diplomacy makes them fear, but because there are many British cannons inside the concession and at the harbor. If they eat this piece of meat and inevitably have to sacrifice, that is not what they want to do. Now that the situation is so serious and urgent, if Mr. Zhang is still only talking about "peace" and only evacuating expatriates and waiting for the Japanese to repent, then the long night will be dark, and there will be many nightmares. I am afraid that not only will the British concession in Tianjin soon become a completely dead market, but also Hong Kong and Singapore may not be able to sleep peacefully.

### To the Nameless Heroes

— Shiguang

Friends: I am the most afraid of loneliness and calmness. To me, loneliness and calmness are like a pitch-black night without lights, stars, or moon, being in an abyss of ten thousand feet, having to crawl through tunnels of tens of thousands, which makes me shudder.

Before the war, I had many friends who understood and sympathized with each other. We often gathered together, mostly talking about the world situation and the international situation. The friends were also generous, forthright, enthusiastic, hardworking, and responsible, even surpassing ordinary men. However, not long after the war, two disappeared, having been missing for nearly two years; one sacrificed, and she sacrificed on this day last year!

Only I remain alone on this devilish island, living the life of a weak writer. Everything has become my memory. But I am not depressed: You, martyrs, died gloriously, but you have achieved your own aspirations, and your great spirit will always exist.

Ah, friend, regret; another message came, and I almost couldn't believe my ears, you sacrificed yourself for the country again. Really, you died. I laugh, I laugh at your seeking benevolence and gaining benevolence. A overseas Chinese who grew up overseas sacrificed himself in the embrace of the war-torn motherland, wandered from the United States to China, and stained the battlefield with blood. How great that is!

You were a young man full of vigor. In the team, you took on responsibilities even more diligently. In less than a month of joining the army, you held four positions at once. You took the lead in charging on the front line, you trained the brothers, you composed popular songs for the people to sing, and you also managed the wall newspaper.

I still remember: "The environment is like this, but I have to transform the environment and fight against it!" You said.

"Friend, I hope you move forward bravely. That's right, we have to create the environment!" When I heard you talk about a certain special situation in that place, I always advised you like this. When we first met, you gave us a deep impression. We got to know each other like this, but there was no more opportunity to have a long conversation all day long, because everyone was busy: You were firm and mature, extremely alert. When encountering a difficult matter, two are often deeply black. You sympathized with all the oppressed people in the world, and even went to work as a dock worker and as a worker in a factory. Children like you are still a minority among those born in bourgeois families!

From now on, may you rest peacefully in the warm soil of your motherland. Your white bones and bright red flesh and blood are all fertilizer for the new China that is growing up. In the near future, even more beautiful buds will grow on this land.

Ah! Great and glorious dead, nameless heroes who will always live in our hearts, when will I bring a bouquet of flowers to the solemn he dedication before the opening ceremony in front of you

### Hurled Themselves Towards the Motherland

— Jin Yi

— The Story of a Girl —

Jingwen tilted her head and said angrily.

"That's not necessarily true, but there are more procedures."

"But—" Jingwen's face turned to Qingzhi, "Why can those first-class passengers go up?"

"Who knows? Anyway, small societies and large societies are all the same. There's no way to jump out!"

They helplessly walked back to the cabin, closed the door, and went to sleep on the bed. They couldn't hear the sound of the ship moving. On the contrary, they felt a bit lonely. When they opened the cabin door, the noisy voices made people feel upset.

"No matter what, we should cheer up a bit, because we are back in the arms of the motherland."

Jing opened her mouth as if explaining to herself.

"The road is always walked step by step. First, we will come out of the clutches of the × people, and gradually we will be able to go to the place we want to go. Good, those houses are really interesting, they are simply stacked there like small toys. Look, that electric army is so small, the people are so small..."

(To be continued)

### A Call from the Mainland

— Lunzi

Come on, friends! If you don't plan to come, you must come; if you plan to come but want to come later, come sooner

I know you are dissatisfied on the isolated island. Some of you are studying, but you are not settled, because Shanghai is not a place to study at all, and it is even worse now. Some of you are doing some small things, reluctantly working in a job that can make a living, but you feel bored, thinking that working like this is too meaningless. Some of you are wandering around, or you are overwhelmed by life and feel unbearably boring. You all want to live more satisfactorily and happily.

Then, strangely, why don't you come to the mainland? The mainland has freedom, you can do whatever you want. The mainland has vigor, which can make a decadent person strive. The mainland is full of meaningful work. The strong can shoulder guns, those with eloquence can propagandize, and those with specialized skills can be used appropriately. The mainland not only has no worries about life, but is also richer in the feeling of real life. Why don't you come?

You must come, and come sooner! You know, our pain is gradually passing; our light is right in front of us; all our great goals will be achieved. Are you unwilling to come and greet such an era? Are you unwilling to participate in the realization of this era? If you are lingering on the isolated island, if you are not intending to wait to be a subjugated slave, are you intending to stand by now and then sit back and enjoy the success in the future? Do you have no ambition? No ambition?

Of course, you also have various difficulties that prevent you from escaping. But have you forgotten the immortal maxim, "Those who have ambition will succeed"? As long as you have the will, I believe that your family burdens can be resolved; as long as you are willing to ask others, you can definitely find a suitable path.

Please temporarily close your physical ears and eyes, and listen with your spiritual ears. We are calling you. Please come and join the wedding feast that will be held soon; look with your spiritual eyes. We are waving to you. Please come and join us in repelling the invaders, and then build our new China together!

Come on, friends on the isolated island!

Nameless Soldier

### Ancient City

— Li Qu

— Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou —

They said it was only twenty li to the ancient city, but I didn't expect that we didn't arrive at this distant campsite until dusk.

Dragging my aching feet, I stepped into the ancient city shrouded in twilight, surrounded by green trees, which seemed so quiet and secluded. A touch of leisurely thought suddenly floated in my heart: Is this the ancient city that Zhang Yide guarded? I remember when I was a child, I saw the picture in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. When Guan Yunchang beheaded Cai Yang, Zhang Yide was still squatting on the city tower of the ancient city, beating the drum to cheer. Could General Zhang, with his tall stature, squat down on the low fence gate tower that I just stepped over? — Maybe this city gate is not the same city gate as before, but is this city really the ancient city that Zhang Yide guarded? Please let the archaeologists examine it!

This city is just a market town with about two to three hundred households, under the jurisdiction of Bozhou. It seems to be quite lively on weekdays, but it has now been visited by brutal planes several times, and the people have been bombed and run away. The city is full of frightening desolation. The houses on both sides of the street are completely closed. Even the dogs don't know where they have escaped with their owners. There is not even a welcoming bark. In the thin night, only a few bats are flapping their black wings, flying back and forth quickly, as if they are playing games for the children.

We found a large empty house without any covering, and lay down.

"Order!" someone knocked on the door outside.

I opened the door, and a messenger walked in:

"The commander's order: Comrade Yang is asked to go to Bozhou to scout as soon as possible. Have the teams we were separated from on the road arrived in Bozhou? We must quickly get in touch with them..."

The messenger walked out, and Comrade Yang, who was lying on the bed, jumped off the bed and scratched his head:

"How can I go in this dark night? I haven't been to Bozhou before..."

At that time, Bozhou was at war; but can I not go?

After hesitating for a while, Comrade Yang changed into an old peasant's clothes and went out with an unguided man.

Not long after the people in the house fell asleep, another order came:

— Depart at four o'clock tonight, destination Qiuchu Village...

Before dawn, a mixed crowd of people and horses came out of each room. The sound of horses' hooves, the collision of canteens and bayonets, and the turbid footsteps... mixed together, echoing in the ancient city that was still sleeping. The dead ancient city seemed to come alive again!

### Special Gazette Issued: Ferry Engine to be Quarantined; Passengers Must Submit Certificates and Undergo Inspection Before Departure; Governor Has the Power to Promulgate Special Cases to Suppress Epidemics

Cholera is prevalent in Hong Kong. The government authorities have already taken active measures to prevent it. In order to prevent external infections, strict precautions have been taken for passengers on Hong Kong-Macau ships. Yesterday, the government's special gazette again promulgated regulations on ship quarantine. These regulations stipulate that aircraft and ships traveling from Hong Kong to Macau must first undergo inspection before being allowed to depart. These regulations are listed in the 1936 Sea Ban and Disease Prevention Ordinance. The Governor-in-Council and the Legislative Council have the power to issue various special cases to suppress it in the event of smallpox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, and intestinal epidemic. The notice stated that all ships traveling to Hong Kong and Macau require passengers and sailors to be injected by health officials, and must submit certificates proving that they have recently been vaccinated and injected to prevent cholera and other infectious diseases. Anyone found to be suffering from an infectious disease or who has been in close contact with someone who has been infected must leave the ship immediately. The injection certificate must prove the date of the injector, which must be six days before and not more than half a year old, and must have a photo of the certificate holder, and be valid only after being printed by the government and signed by the Health Bureau. The ban to be implemented is recorded below.

(All aircraft or ships sailing from Hong Kong to Macau must be subject to the following regulations, unless specially exempted by the Director of Medical Services). (1) The parts of the ship or aircraft that are particularly susceptible to contamination must be hygienically cleaned. (2) Passengers and crew must first be inspected by a health official and must submit recent vaccination and immunization certificates. (3) Anyone found to be suffering from an infectious disease listed in Article 2 of the regulations, or who is in close contact with a patient and may be infected, the health official has the right to order him to leave the ship or aircraft. (4) The ship and aircraft are where there is dirt. The health official has the right to remove it. (5) When the plague is prevalent, the government implements the ban. The health official suspects that rats have been found on the ship or aircraft and can order rat extermination. (6) If enteritis is prevalent and the government has to implement the ban, no matter who or other items, the health officer has the right to order its disinfection after inspection.

### Air Force Technicians Arrive from England One After Another: Two Batches of Seventy Men are Transferred to Hong Kong; Local Chinese Air Force Personnel to be Recruited in Hong Kong

In light of the increasingly precarious situation in the Far East, the Hong Kong military authorities are taking proactive measures to strengthen defenses in all three areas – sea, land, and air. Particular attention is being paid to air defense, as warfare today is three-dimensional. Should an emergency arise, there will be no distinction between front lines and rear areas, and there is a risk of being threatened at any time. Therefore, preparations for air defense are being pursued more actively than other areas. In addition to intensifying the training and organization of the public in air defense knowledge and skills, increasing the strength of the air force is also urgently needed.

Two Batches of Air Force Personnel Arrive in Hong Kong

According to air force sources yesterday, the Royal Air Force station in Hong Kong has completed the magnificent Kam Tin Airport. Together with the existing Kai Tak Royal Air Force station, there is sufficient capacity to house a large air force. The British Air Force High Command has decided to dispatch air force technical personnel to be stationed here. They are arriving in batches. The first batch of 25 men arrived last month, and the second batch of 45 men arrived in Hong Kong yesterday by transport. This second batch of more than 40 men includes pilots, mechanics, bombardiers, and other specialized technical personnel, all of whom are outstanding members of the air force. The air force technical personnel that England has decided to transfer to Hong Kong will continue to arrive in Hong Kong in the near future.

Planning to Recruit Local Chinese Personnel

Furthermore, in order to replenish the number of air force personnel to meet urgent needs, the air force authorities are considering a plan to recruit a certain number of local Chinese air force personnel, similar to the methods used in the army and navy. These personnel will be responsible for all heavy work related to the air force, facilitating swift action in emergencies, just like the current local Chinese artillerymen and engineers in the army. The air force authorities have already completed the planning for this matter and submitted it to the British Air Force Ministry for approval. Once approved, recruitment of these local Chinese volunteer air force personnel will commence to meet the needs. As for the organization of the Air Force Volunteer Corps, the air force authorities believe that since it has already been implemented in other overseas territories of the British Empire, it is also necessary to establish it in Hong Kong as soon as possible. Therefore, based on the organizational methods of the Army Volunteer Corps, a complete organizational outline has been drafted and submitted to the British military department for review. Approval is expected soon, and all preparations will then begin, it is said.

### New Record: 120 Vehicle Accidents Last Week

According to a report from the Police Traffic Department, in the week ending at 8:00 PM last Saturday, a total of 120 traffic accidents occurred in Hong Kong, an average of 17 accidents per day, setting a new historical record for Hong Kong.

### Survey of Air Defense Personnel in Various Districts: No One in Section A of Central District Passed the Exam; Few Applicants Since the Start of the Second Class

To ensure that the general public has a widespread understanding of air defense knowledge, the Hong Kong air defense authorities have established air defense training classes in various districts of Hong Kong. These classes teach residents of each district various types of knowledge about avoiding air raids, so that they can protect themselves and others, and serve the local area in times of emergency. Air defense classes have been established in various districts for some time. Recently, to understand the number of people who have passed the air defense exam in each district, so that they can be easily assigned to service work in times of emergency, the authorities have sent letters to the heads of each district, instructing them to report the detailed numbers. Liu Jingqing, the head of the Central District Section A Air Defense Training Class, received the letter and, after investigation, replied to the air defense authorities yesterday, stating: "This district has been thoroughly investigated, but as of now, no one has passed the exam. It is found that there are about 1,200 shops and more than 4,000 floors of buildings under the jurisdiction of this district. Moreover, this district is a commercial hub with a relatively large number of intellectuals. Yet, among the residents of the entire district, no one holds a certificate as a trainer or paramedic. The reasons for this can be divided into the following three points: (1) Businesses in this district may be too busy with their commercial affairs and therefore do not pay attention to sending people to learn. (2) They believe that practicing air defense knowledge is just working for others and hold a negative view, thinking that even if an air raid occurs, government personnel will provide guidance, so they do not send people to learn. (3) At the same time, they believe that sending shop assistants to learn air defense means one less person in the shop, indirectly affecting business. It is hoped that the businesses and residents in this district will promptly abandon the above three negative views, as practicing air defense is not primarily for protecting others, but for protecting oneself first," etc. According to reports, the air defense class opened in the Central District section of Central District last month had a total of 191 trainees, but only about 30 of them were from that district, with the rest coming from other districts. Moreover, since the start of the second class, almost a month has passed, and only a few people have applied for training. The head of the district hopes that the businesses in the district will promptly send personnel to participate. If the number of applicants still does not reach 50 within this ten-day period, it may be necessary to cancel the class and reorganize it. As for the business people in other districts who are inconvenienced in learning air defense, there are many inconveniences, it is said.

### Ling Ying Middle School Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday: British Guest's Speech Was Very Insightful; Expressed Great Confidence in China's Future in the War of Resistance

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Ling Ying Middle School in Hong Kong held its middle school graduation ceremony, as well as graduation ceremonies for the attached elementary school and kindergarten, at the school at 9:00 AM yesterday. Several hundred people attended, including parents and all the school's teachers and students. After the ceremony proceeded as usual, the school's principal, Hong Gaohuang, gave an opening speech. Then, a British guest, Mr. Luo Dale, delivered a speech. The speech was delivered in fluent Mandarin and was very moving. Principal Hong translated the gist into Cantonese, saying that today's crisis in China is a crisis for the world, a crisis for the youth, and also a crisis for the individual. The rapid progress of construction in southwestern and northwestern China, and especially the spirit of unity and hard work, are enough to guarantee that victory will belong to China. China is now opening the back door of the northwest as an international gate, making transportation extremely convenient. The spirit of the youth at the Anti-Japanese University is especially admirable. Young people working hard to serve society will surely become great figures, etc. Then, Provincial Assemblyman Jin Zengcheng gave a speech. After the principal awarded graduation certificates and prizes, elementary school student Bei Jianming gave a speech in Mandarin, which was quite innocent and lively. Entertainment was provided and the school's silver band, led by Lin Shengweng, played music, ending the event with joy. It is reported that the school had 30 graduates from middle school, 26 from elementary school, and 11 from kindergarten this year.

### Student Relief Association to Hold Regular Meeting to Discuss Organizing a慰勞团(Comforting Delegation) and Presenting a Sword

### Legislative Council Meeting Yesterday: Announcement of Air Defense Expenditure; Extension of Banks' Right to Issue Banknotes Passed; Postmaster Authorized to Search Residences at Any Time

The Legislative Council held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Those present included: Sir Geoffry Alexander Stafford Northcote (Chairman), Commander of the Army Major-General A.E. Grasett (representing A.S. McKerron), Colonial Secretary N.L. Smith, Financial Secretary G.G. Gimson, Secretary for Chinese Affairs R.A.C. North, Commissioner of Police E.I. Barreto, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services S.Y. King, Director of Marine J.O. Thomson, Director of Public Works A. Inglis, and Unofficial Members Sir Shouson Chow, T.N. Chau, R.H. Kotewall, James Paterson, L. D'Almada Remedios, and Lo Man Kam. After opening the meeting, the Colonial Secretary first announced the situation regarding air defense actions and expenditures, stating that when the budget was discussed last year, the air defense item was only a rough estimate, as the air defense plan was still under consideration. After research, the outline of the air defense plan was decided, and the implementation steps included the installation of air defense chambers and sandbags in various agencies, the addition of firefighting tools, gas masks, clothing, and medicines, as well as the preparation of subsidies for the construction costs of air defense chambers for private factories and companies, and the formulation of a air raid shelter excavation plan. The decision was made not to proceed with the construction of large tunnels and basements, as it would be difficult for citizens to rush to the tunnels from crowded areas within a few minutes after the alarm was issued, and there was fear that the existence of tunnels would cause citizens to neglect indoor air defense construction. Regarding the issue of defense against poisonous gas, a plan has been drafted to establish an organization to operate the sale of gas masks at cost, and the government will provide free custody. As for the detailed methods, they will be announced in the future. The implementation of the air defense plan requires expenditure exceeding the 1939 budget. In addition to the expenditure of the Air Defense Department, the various air defense units need $250,000, and public construction will require $200,000. The air defense expenditure for this year exceeds $1.5 million, and that number will be submitted to the Finance Committee for discussion and approval, it was said.

After the Colonial Secretary finished the announcement, Unofficial Member Sir Shouson Chow raised the following questions: "Have the rates for 1939 to 1940 been assessed? If the assessment is complete, please announce the new figures." The Colonial Secretary, representing the government, replied that the new assessed rates for each district in Hong Kong and the comparative figures for the rates for 1938 to 1939 are as follows:

Region Assessed Value for 1938-1939 Assessed Value for 1939-1940

Victoria City 21,346,621 24,657,053

Hong Kong Rural Area 3,828,927 4,279,463

Kowloon 81,181,336 100,857,840

New Kowloon 2,208,738 2,282,9772

Statistics 35,502,622 41,915,072

Financial Secretary G.G. Gimson proposed the following resolution regarding pensions for widows and orphans: "The resolution regarding the provisions for widows and orphans' pensions passed by this council on June 1, 1938, is hereby repealed in its entirety and replaced by the following provision: 'The resolution passed by this council on August 2, 1902, regarding the exchange rate for widows and orphans' pensions paid in London at three shillings per dollar shall not apply to those receiving pensions after June 1, 1938, but those approved by the Governor may receive pensions at that exchange rate.'" The motion was passed unanimously. Then, the lawyers submitted for first, second, and third readings and passed "The Draft Law Extending the Term of Legal Authority of Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India and China to Issue Banknotes." It was passed unanimously. Finally, the following draft laws were passed at the second and third readings: (A) Draft Amendment to the 1899 Merchant Shipping Ordinance, (B) Draft Amendment to the 1936 Telegraph Ordinance, (C) Draft Amendment to the 1937 Gold Standard Salary Remittance Ordinance, (D) Draft Amendment to the 1933 Naval Volunteer Ordinance, (E) Draft Amendment to the 1901 Rating Ordinance, (F) Draft Amendment to the 1873 Dangerous Goods Ordinance, (G) Draft Amendment to the 1932 Pension Ordinance. Regarding the Telegraph Ordinance draft, which authorized the Postmaster and his staff to search residences at any time, Councillor Lo Man Kam expressed the opinion that there was a risk of abuse or disturbance to residents and should be considered. The Attorney General immediately explained that this was a necessary measure in times of emergency and then sought the opinions of everyone. With the exception of Councillor Lo, everyone else expressed their approval, and the draft was passed by a majority vote.

### Telegrams Still Reachable Between Hong Kong and China; However, No Telegrams Received in Three Days; Fujian Provincial Bank Also Sends Telegraphic Transfers

Although telegrams between Hong Kong and Fuzhou are still communicable, most Fuzhou merchants in Hong Kong have not received telegrams from Fuzhou for three days since the 27th. It is rumored that although telegrams are communicable, they must be relayed through other places, resulting in delays in transmission, or that telegrams are being blocked because Chuanshi Island has been occupied, as the Great Northern Telegraph Company's submarine cable station is also located on that island. Although the Bank of China and other banks in Hong Kong have announced a suspension of remittances to Fuzhou, the Hong Kong branch of the Fujian Provincial Bank can still send telegraphic transfers. As of yesterday, it had not yet received a notice from the provincial headquarters to suspend, so the rumors of war in Fuzhou are likely false, it is said.

### ×××. Cannot be Reborn! The Suffering and Prospects of Chaoshan

— Qi Zhuo

After Attending the Cadre Meeting of the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Association

Special Report from This Newspaper

For national hatred and hometown friendship, the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Association held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday evening at the Nanhua College building to provide relief to our homeland. Zhang Jiayan, Wang Yongzhan, Wang Youjian, Lin Tianduo, Chen Changwei, Cai Chusheng, Luo Yinpu and other directors spared time to attend. Those present included Lu Fu, Cai Hansun, Cai Xuetian, Huang Xinjing, Lin Gao, Zhu Qizhuo, etc. Usually, this should have been a joyful gathering with the right timing, location, and people. However, the flames of war raging in our hometown, the sins and disgrace of humanity, weighed heavily on the hearts of travelers abroad. With old and new sorrows, who would have the interest to pay attention to the beautiful and tranquil night scene where Lion Rock Road connects to the suburbs!

There are already transport ships traveling between Shantou and Hong Kong, but the postal service is not yet open. Foreign firms specialize in sending letters that have already arrived in Hong Kong. The number of wounded soldiers transported from Shantou is in the hundreds and seventies. It is absolutely true that we have fierce resistance along the Chaoshan Railway. Although news reports still have weaknesses, it is also inappropriate to emphasize the theory of failure and to be excessively pessimistic and depressed. After exchanging words, the official meeting started at around 8 o'clock.

Chairman Lin Tianduo first gave a speech: "Our hometown, Shantou, and Chao'an have fallen one after another! We have long anticipated the conspiracy of the × people. Looking at the overall war situation, there is no need to be pessimistic. However, the refugees are displaced, and other tasks are waiting for us to complete. How should we do it? Please express your opinions."

"You come from your hometown, you should know the affairs of your hometown." Mr. Yongzai suggested this, and everyone agreed. Mr. Lin Gao stood up and reported the process of the fall of Shantou in great detail with great sorrow. Readers who want to know the details, please read Mr. Lin's eyewitness account of the fall of Shantou – serialized in the domestic section of this newspaper.

Next, Mr. C reported on the emergency meeting of the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Disaster Relief Association. He also said that the elders in the hometown have unspeakable pain for the fall of their hometown. Explaining the development of the overall situation and assisting in the disaster relief work, our association should take this responsibility.

The first item of discussion was to concentrate the Chaoshan people in Hong Kong under the banner of saving their hometown, to exert the greatest strength in each position, and to concentrate all the strength to do some work that should be done for their hometown and country. The method is for the association to send a letter to the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Disaster Relief Association expressing its willingness to participate in assisting work, so as to closely link the business community and the cultural community. If the association sympathizes, it will nominate Lin Tianduo, Wang Youjian, Luo Yinpu, and Cai Xuetian as the association's fully authorized representatives.

The fate of Chaoshan is one part of the fate of the entire country. Without suffering, there will be no rebirth. The day when the × people are driven out of the Chaoshan territory will be the time to build a new Chaoshan. There will be no vitality; new life will not be produced; pure steel cannot be forged if it cannot withstand the test in the furnace. The entire overseas Chinese nation must resist the war and build the country. Chaoshan must also resist the war and build the country.

The current issue is how to support the long-term resistance of Chaoshan and how to start the work of building a new Chaoshan. The new Chaoshan not only eliminates foreign insults, but also overturns the historical pressure. The politics are clarified, everyone helps each other, unites, and strives upwards. We must use these meanings to comfort the Chaoshan compatriots at home and abroad, and fulfill the responsibility of the Hong Kong overseas Chinese cultural people – everyone agreed to this proposal, and the declaration was drafted by Mr. C and submitted to the executive committee for approval.

In addition to the declaration, a booklet should also be published, containing the process of the fall of Chaoshan, and invite Hong Kong overseas Chinese cultural people to write articles, so that the action has a correct indicator, and the scattered forces are concentrated. The method is to establish an editorial committee and nominate Cai Chusheng, Luo Yinpu, Chen Changwei, Cai Han, Cai Xuetian, Zhang Jiayan, Wang Yongzai, Wu Qimin, Zhu Qizhuo, etc. as members.

Relief for students who have dropped out of school and guidance for refugees are also a major plan for the hometown for a century. It was decided to establish a Chaoshan Student Relief Committee, and Lin Tianduo, Wang Youjian, Zhang Jiazhai, Cai Hansun, and Wang Yongzai were nominated as members.

Chaoshan has its own special Chaoshan dialect. The Chaoshan opera movement for resisting war and building the country needs to be launched on a large scale. There is no shortage of young people in Hong Kong who love opera, and their vitality is waiting to be developed. Therefore, Mr. Yongzai was elected to be responsible for the plan. Cai Chusheng, Tan Youliu and other senior figures in the drama industry have already paid attention to this issue. They will definitely give more guidance.

Regarding participation in the joint fundraising association of all sectors, Mr. Lu Fu was nominated to be responsible for contact. The last item of discussion was the decision to hold a general meeting of all members at the Shengxin Hotel at 1:00 p.m. on July 8th, and to bid farewell to Mr. L, the representative of the association, who will go abroad. It is hoped that after he goes abroad, he will investigate the situation of the Chaoshan overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the Americas, and mobilize the organization and unity of the Chaoshan overseas Chinese to work together to save the country.

The meeting did not end until around 12 o'clock. On the way back, we also talked about the vast number of young people in Chaoshan who have been trained will definitely work harder to mobilize and organize countless ordinary people to assist the government and the army in developing the guerrilla warfare in Chaoshan. These hard-working young people are the soul of the nation and the new life of the hometown. China has a way, and Chaoshan also has a way.

### From July 1st, a Cyclical Water Rationing System will be Implemented in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Water will be Rationed for Six Hours Every Other Day, from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM the Next Morning.

Heavy rain poured down last month, and all reservoirs were overflowing. The Public Works Department increased the supply of drinking water to be open all day and canceled restrictions. However, after only a little over a month, the Public Works Department, considering the large amount of drinking water consumed daily, and in order to prepare for a rainy day, restricted it again. A notice has been issued yesterday that starting from the first day of next month, water will be reduced every other day in Hong Kong and Kowloon for six hours, from 10:00 PM every night to 4:00 AM the next morning. The water supply will be suspended. Hong Kong will be open from 4:00 AM to 10:00 PM daily starting from July 1st, and the supply will be suspended after 10:00 PM. Kowloon will also be restricted in the same way as Hong Kong starting from July 2nd.

### New Business in the Isolated Island: Women's Shoe Shining Company

Leather shoes are a kind of the most popular and the most common shoe, people who are not from the upper class also wear them. That is, even the middle class and even workers also have desire to buy it. At the very least, they also buy a pair of cheap goods at used goods stalls on the roadside. Therefore, the leather shoe industry has developed very much invisibly. Due to the needs, they must seek refinement. Therefore, the designs of the leather shoes also evolved with the times, from flat heels to high heels, from round heads to pointed heads, and recently a new type of cream leather soles has been launched... etc., there are many, many styles, which are indeed very suitable for the needs of the public. However, cream soles...etc., noble leather shoes are the footwear of the upper-class young masters and young ladies. There is nowhere that they are not particular about. Also because of their fastidiousness, they specially came up with the idea of using women to replace them to shine their leather shoes, so that their leather shoes are always kept shiny at all times. This is naturally the happiness of the young masters and young ladies.

Women's shoe shining companies must be set up near the prosperous areas, such as the "Lovely Feet Women's Shoe Shining Company" near the racecourse. The interior decoration is very simple. Apart from five or six women, there is nothing else. Their attire is very strange. They look like half-female students and half-factory workers. When a guest comes, they invite them to sit down very diligently, and then they start working - shining shoes. Their shoe shining is indeed very experienced. The fee for patent leather is 14 cents, champagne leather is 14 cents, ordinary leather is 7 cents, and whitening powder is 4 cents. The busiest time of the whole day is when the lights are on in the evening, because many fashionable men and women have already started to go out. They want to show off, and they keep running in there, which makes them overwhelmed. Their business is also exceptional, and they usually stop around 11:00 p.m., which is just right for the taste of night owls.

### To Raise Funds for Refugee Relief, Hardoon Garden will be Opened. The International Shelter's Radio Class Has Been Training for Six Months and the Performance is Not Bad

The provision of food for Shanghai refugees has always been a problem. Many people in charge of refugee shelters are anxious about the future funding for the refugees. Recently, I heard that someone is contacting the owner of Hardoon Garden, hoping to open it once. The ticket sales after the opening can generate at least hundreds of thousands of dollars. The refugee expenses for the two months of summer vacation can be taken care of with that money.

It is said that Mrs. Hardoon has not yet agreed. For the food and clothing of hundreds of thousands of refugees, Mrs. Hardoon, who likes to do good deeds, does not seem to insist any longer. If this plan can be realized, it would be a great good thing.

Hardoon Garden was opened once one or two decades ago (it is said that the scenery inside is excellent). If it is opened again now, it is indeed a rare event!

The above news can only be regarded as an incidental report.

Recently, I went to visit the children's radio training class attached to the First International Shelter on Massenet Road. At the same time, I also received an unfortunate news, that the shelter has received an order from the general association and is now dispersing the refugees, so that people who have a hometown and a job can gradually leave the shelter. The shelter is expected to be closed in the near future.

Although we cannot say that refugees must rely on refugee shelters forever, the financial difficulties of the relief society are evident here.

The address of the First International Shelter was originally the playground of Aurora University. Aurora has also urged it several times to take it back for its own use. It seems that the First Shelter will have to be closed soon.

When I went there yesterday, I saw the shelter's reed shed door piled high with packages and scattered items. I guess these are the belongings of the refugees who are leaving the shelter.

I had a half-hour conversation with the director of the shelter, Mr. Pan, and the director of the education group, Mr. Li Fucheng. They led me to visit the classroom of the radio class. It was already noon, and sixteen or seventeen-year-old refugee boys and girls were eating their most frugal lunch at their classroom tables.

On the 11th, this radio class invited the managers of several radio companies in Shanghai, such as Mr. Li Weishou and Mr. Yang Shufen, to serve as judges and hold a radio communication performance.

The method of the performance was to use an English manuscript, which was sent by the professor in radio code, and the boys and girls received it on the spot. The second step was for the students to send and receive themselves.

It is said that the performance was not bad that day.

Mr. Li Fucheng said that the students in this training class were originally recommended by the three shelters of the International Shelter itself. In addition, other shelters also recommended many people.

When it first started, there were about fifty or sixty people. Later, those with poor vision and hearing were removed. Now the class has thirty-four students, six or seven of whom are girls.

The training steps are divided into two types. The first is the elementary training class, which focuses on receiving and sending reports. The second is the advanced training class, which focuses on the repair and installation of transceivers. The training time is six months.

According to the current time allocation of the course, six months is of course quite short. If students can work hard, they can of course cope with it.

According to Director Pan, there is absolutely no problem with the way out after six months of training, because there is a large demand for this type of talent everywhere.

The coaches are Mr. Zhang Heqing and Mr. Wang Shuling. They are completely voluntary and do not receive any salary. This spirit is admirable.

In terms of production in the shelter, they are also planning to manufacture red and blue ink. After many experiments, this plan has been approved by the general office and production is expected to begin soon.

It is said that every refugee in this First Shelter is a productive worker. Some have jobs outside and some work in the shelter. It is indeed not easy for a shelter to reach this level.

Incidentally, I also visited the nursery set up in the shelter for the refugees. When I visited, there were about a dozen children aged six or seven sitting at a low rectangular table eating. They were all fat and chubby. One of them stood up and bowed to me. I smiled and nodded to him. He immediately turned around and said to his little friend,

"He nodded to me!"

Mr. Pan and Mr. Li and I all laughed.

The innocence of the children is lovely enough here.

### The Life of Light Bulb Workers

— Yan

Due to a friend's introduction, I had the opportunity to visit the actual work of a certain light bulb factory and interviewed the lives of the male and female workers there in detail. Below is the description of the living conditions of the workers in various departments that I learned from the interviews.

Sorting S

The filament in a small light bulb, its installation shape, is like an "S" shape, so sorting the filament is generally called "sorting S" by the light bulb workers. Sorting S is done by female workers, who are all around fifteen to twenty-five years old, because only such young women have the patience and can carefully and thoughtfully complete this work. This is an extremely long and fine steel wire, which has been refined and cut by engineers using scientific methods before it can be used for assembling the filament on the light bulb. It must be sorted and selected. They need to have sharp eyesight, otherwise this extremely small "S" is almost impossible to see, so the work is very tiring for the eyes and the brain. Working at the desk all day long often makes them dizzy, lightheaded, and backache. Although their wages are slightly higher than those of ordinary female workers, they can only earn five or six cents to seven or eight cents a day.

Making S

This is the work of male workers, using molten glass tubes to stick the two filaments together. They sit next to the fierce acetylene stove all day long, constantly working. Whether it is winter or summer, they are always covered in sweat, soaking their clothes. Their suffocation and unbearable heat are no different from the blacksmiths next to the furnace. They are one of the more difficult types of workers in the various departments, but their wages are very limited, about the same as the female workers who sort S.

Blowing Bubbles

This department is staffed by boys and girls, mostly aged ten to fourteen. Their work is even more painful than the workers who make S, because they work next to the fierce acetylene stove all day long, and they also have to hold the extremely hot glass tube in their mouths, aiming at the flames to suck and blow, suck and blow, until the molten glass forms the shape of a bubble. They are probably still in the learning stage, so their wages are pitifully low, only about one to three yuan per month.

Extracting Air

This is a department staffed by important workers. They must have scientific and chemical knowledge, that is, after the glass bubbles are blown, they must use chemical substances and scientific methods to extract the air from it before the copper head and filament can be assembled. Their wages are higher than those of ordinary male and female workers, about forty to seventy or eighty yuan per month.

Applying Plaster

To assemble the copper head to the top of the bubble, plaster must be applied. This is also the work of the female workers, both old and young. Their wages are calculated on a piecework basis, two to three cents per thousand pieces, so although their work is relatively easy, their income can still reach more than ten to twenty yuan per month.

Soldering Tin

To firmly connect the "S" and the copper head, in addition to the adhesion of the plaster, tin must also be soldered on top, because this is a relatively easy part to do, so it is only done by male workers who are slightly older among the child laborers. But their hardship is comparable to that of those who make S and blow bubbles. Their wages are four to six or seven yuan per month.

Picking Bubbles

This is the easiest part of all the departments. All they have to do is pick out the bubbles with damaged marks. This is done by the female workers and child workers who first entered the factory, and their wages are only one to three yuan. In addition, there is also a piecework system (limited to female workers) or temporary employment, paying three cents for every thousand pieces, and they can earn three to five cents a day.

### Shanghai Concessions Trolley Company Uses Vouchers. The Ministry of Finance Remedies the Shortage of Copper Coins in Shanghai and Will Issue Fractional Notes to Eliminate the Difficulty.

The shortage of copper coins in Shanghai is felt by all industries. The public buses and trolley companies in the British and French concessions have used vouchers to facilitate passengers. The Ministry of Finance will follow the practice of the shortage of copper coins in the interior and issue fractional notes to be transported to Shanghai to remedy the situation. Therefore, it is hoped that the shortage of copper coins will gradually be eliminated in a short period of time. The details are recorded as follows.

French Tram Company Voucher

French concession tram public buses were greatly inconvenienced in business due to the refusal to accept stamps and receipts. To remedy this, the company authorities have been using vouchers since yesterday. These vouchers are divided into one-cent and two-cent denominations, made of cardboard, with Chinese and English translations, limited to use within the French concession. The notice from Mr. Viali, the general manager of the company, is recorded as follows: "The one-cent and two-cent vouchers of this company are only applicable within the French concession. Each ticket seller can only receive a maximum of two yuan to replace the shortage of legal tender, and must not be given at will unless absolutely necessary."

Public Concession Tram Company

Since the copper coin shortage, the British tram company in the Public Concession, although not refusing to use stamps, has found it increasingly difficult for ticket sellers to sell tickets and calculate fares. Therefore, it has taken the same steps as the French Concession Tram Company and has also issued two-cent and three-cent denominations, made of thin cardboard. The three-cent denomination is light lake blue, and the two-cent denomination is unpolished rice color, which is easy to distinguish. The vouchers are printed with Chinese and English instructions, and are printed with red Arabic numerals "3" and "2". The Chinese characters "three cents" and "two cents" are hollow characters. At the bottom of the vouchers, there are rolled eyelets, and at the top, there are printed serial numbers. The company stipulates that these vouchers can not only be used on the trams, but can also be redeemed at the company's office at 185 Suzhou Road.

The Ministry of Finance will issue fractional notes to remedy the situation.

All industries use stamps as small change in their business, and have gradually become accustomed to it over time, so the panic situation is not as serious as it was at the beginning. The problem of the smuggling of copper coins from Shanghai began after the Western Expedition of the National Army, so the government has long paid attention to this. According to news from the banking sector, the Ministry of Finance will follow the practice of the interior to make up for the lack of copper coins, issue fractional notes, and transport them to Shanghai to remedy the situation. Therefore, the difficulty of the copper coin shortage can be expected to be eliminated in a short period of time.

### Shanghai Jottings

Industry Bureau Library Adds Documents and Books

The Industry Bureau Library Committee held its first meeting of the year on the 12th of this month. Committee member Xi Yushu was elected as the chairman of the committee. During the meeting, the committee members submitted a list of Chinese books proposed to be purchased this year for consideration. The list included 127 types of books, valued at approximately 950 yuan in national currency. Among them was a photographic reprint of the "Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times," comprising 808 volumes, divided into six categories: Astronomy, Geography, Ethics, Natural History, Philosophy, and Economics. According to records, the original book was published approximately 309 years ago. Its content spans both ancient and modern times, combining classics and history, and it is truly a comprehensive overview of Chinese classics. The photographic reprint that the Industry Bureau Library Committee intends to purchase is published by the Zhonghua Book Company. At a meeting held on the 14th of this month, the Industry Bureau Board of Directors resolved to approve the entire book list proposed by the Library Committee and to allocate 950 yuan for the purchase of the aforementioned "Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times" and the other 126 types of books.

Shanghai Second Special District Court Burns Prohibited Items

The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, as a matter of established practice, publicly burns confiscated opium, opium paraphernalia, morphine, red pills, and other drugs, as well as gambling and other prohibited items every three months. This has been done 21 times in the past. Now, for the six-month period from July of last year to the end of December, covering the 22nd and 23rd sessions, the items were handed over by the former President Wang Simo to the new President Yang Qi for management. President Yang, together with Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang, held a joint public burning of the narcotics and other contraband from both sessions. A report was first submitted to the higher-level Third Branch Court, which then forwarded it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, designating Zheng Yue, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch Court, to supervise the proceedings on-site. The 22nd session involved the burning of 120 sets of opium paraphernalia, 518 opium pipes, 200-odd pounds of opium, 29 kilograms, 1323 taels, six maces, three fen, and 1226 and a half packets, 989 opium bubbles, 5 pounds, 86 taels, six maces, and 101 small packets of fake opium ingredients, 10 pounds, 51 bags, and one packet of red pills, 846 grains and six packets of white powder, 243 packets of heroin powder, one and a half pounds of morphine, 42 taels, six maces, 2036 packets, half a pound and one packet, 43 taels and one bottle of morphine, 12 morphine needles, and other miscellaneous small packets of drug-making equipment, an uncounted number of gambling paraphernalia, 921 mahjong tiles, 49 dice, 10 prohibited imitation handguns, 821 counterfeit banknotes, 302 obscene books, 390 obscene photographs, nine soft film negatives, 24 glass film negatives, and an uncounted number of fake trademark gift certificates, checks, and miscellaneous items. The 23rd session involved the burning of 308 taels of opium, 149 opium pipes, 55 pounds of opium, 75 kilograms, 13,800 cubic centimeters, 28 catties, 2615 taels, three maces, 320 small packets, and one suitcase of opium, three maces of opium residue, 2538 opium bubbles, 31 taels of opium paste, 161 red and black pills, 4 pounds of morphine, 87 taels, three maces, two fen, 4499 small packets of morphine, two taels, six maces of heroin, 224 small packets, five morphine needles, and other miscellaneous items, an uncounted number of gambling paraphernalia, four mahjong tiles, 4812 Huahui lottery tickets, one general blueprint, two Huahui books, and other miscellaneous items, an uncounted number of prohibited items, three handguns, 47 yuan and five jiao and 61 counterfeit banknotes, 184 obscene books, one blood-stained garment, and other miscellaneous items, an uncounted number of miscellaneous items. The burning began at 2:00 PM and concluded at 6:00 PM in the evening. The representatives dismissed and departed. The ashes were bagged, hired boats, and dumped into the sea outside of Wusong Port.

Compromise Reportedly Reached in Shanghai Pseudo-Police Station Incident

According to foreign sources, in the incident of the "Da Dao" pseudo-police returning to the pseudo-police "substation" on Great West Road, which was sealed off by British troops, the British military commander and the Public Concession police authorities made representations to the Japanese military authorities amidst heightened tensions. The negotiations between the two sides lasted for quite some time, and it is expected that a satisfactory resolution can be reached. According to the propaganda organ newspaper controlled by the Japanese and their puppet regime, a verbal compromise has been reached on the matter, as follows: (1) The barbed wire erected by the British soldiers should be removed; (2) The pseudo-police substation should display a sign with the words "Great West Road Police Substation" at the entrance, allowing people to enter and exit; (3) The above measures should be implemented within one week.

Speculators Manipulate Shanghai Rice Prices, Causing Sharp Rise

Due to speculation and manipulation by hoarding households, massive purchases continued in the bean and rice market, causing prices to continue to rise sharply. Market transactions were exceptionally chaotic. Premium white japonica rice from Changshu rose to over 21 yuan. The Rice Trade Association has suggested to the Concession authorities that they promptly take measures to stop this. As for the overall supply of staple food, there is no risk of shortage.

Economic Notes

### New Financial Stabilization Measures by Sheng Mujie

(Special Shanghai Dispatch) After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the Ministry of Finance implemented emergency financial stabilization measures and supplementary measures to stabilize finances. After 22 months of operation, there have been no major obstacles. Recently, after the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates, the Ministry of Finance implemented a new financial stabilization measure on June 22nd. The content is very simple: in general, payments for deposits up to 500 yuan will be made in legal tender, and payments for amounts over 500 yuan will be made by remittance. Deposits made before August 13th will still be handled according to the financial stabilization measures. Funds remitted to the mainland are not subject to these measures. At the same time, these measures are limited to implementation in Shanghai.

The state of Shanghai's finances during the war was initially stable due to the implementation of financial stabilization measures. Although the situation was tense, the crisis was relatively minor. However, the effectiveness of the financial stabilization measures gradually diminished over time. At the same time, the emergence of the remittance and rediscount system further weakened the effectiveness of the financial stabilization measures in blocking funds. This year, the signs of instability in Shanghai's finances have gradually become apparent. I have discussed these two points before. First, the result of Shanghai's financial prosperity due to the abundance of funds cannot be ignored. Because Shanghai has abundant funds, the current deposits of financial institutions have increased significantly. However, Shanghai lacks proper channels for utilization, and the inward transfer of funds to develop the southwest has not been fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, a large portion of the funds has been diverted to speculative activities, resulting in high commodity prices and distorted industrial development in the concessions. This phenomenon is not only detrimental to the stability of Shanghai's financial market but also runs counter to the government's wartime financial policy. Second, the pressure on foreign exchange. Shanghai's foreign trade has accumulated a deficit of approximately 100 million yuan in the first five months of this year. The monthly trade situation shows that imports have increased and exports have decreased, and the accumulated deficit is increasing, requiring a larger amount of foreign exchange. At the same time, the arbitrage of the Japanese and their puppet regime is also lurking. Therefore, the financial stabilization measures are now almost a dead letter.

Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates on June 7th, the foreign exchange market has been clearly in an unstable state. Although the spot market price is equal to the exchange rate quoted by HSBC, the futures market is extremely sluggish. The difference between spot and futures prices is large, and arbitrage is as high as five points. As a result, speculators are flocking to arbitrage. Shanghai's finances are in a tense state under this situation. Interbank lending rates and remittance rediscount rates are rising. If there is no way to limit the development of this phenomenon, it will still be a very harmful pressure on the adjusted exchange rate. Therefore, in order to ensure the stability of the exchange market, it is only possible to restrain legal tender—this is the greatest reason for the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures.

The most obvious benefit of implementing the new financial stabilization measures is the reduction in the need for foreign exchange speculation and the balancing of currently speculative commodity prices. The most obvious drawback is the difficulty in commercial turnover. At the same time, because the measures are too simple, there are many contradictions in their implementation. For example, a check with a crossed-out amount of more than 500 yuan deposited into a bank is sometimes accepted and sometimes not, saying it is a remittance. The former is of course correct, and the latter is unavoidable. Because the crossed-out amount can originally be paid in cash, the Ministry of Finance's new measures only say that it can only be withdrawn at a rate of 500 yuan per week, and it does not say that the crossed-out amount has become a remittance. In short, the silver and money industries in Shanghai should come up with a detailed supplementary measure to ensure that commercial transactions can still be flexible under the principle of blocking funds.

Finally, after the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures, the remittance rediscount system should be abolished. Otherwise, if the amount exceeds 500 yuan, it is a remittance, and funds cannot be blocked.

### Hongkou Feels Uneasy After the Price of Legal Tender Drops; Capital of "Huaxing" Bank Decreases by 400,000 Pounds

According to the Millard's Review, the recently established "Huaxing Bank" by the Japanese, which issues "Huaxing" banknotes, aims to carry out a trick to obtain foreign exchange. After issuing banknotes, Huaxing Bank can directly or indirectly obtain Chinese legal tender and purchase foreign exchange. The total capital of the bank is 50 million Chinese yuan. According to the original plan, it was intended to gradually convert it into foreign exchange. However, after the Hong Kong Exchange Equalization Fund Committee readjusted the exchange rate of legal tender, not only was Shanghai surprised, but Huaxing was also frustrated. Because, according to the new exchange rate, the bank's capital has decreased by 400,000 pounds. No wonder the Hongkou area was greatly disturbed after hearing about the drop in the foreign exchange rate.

### The Scenery of Chinese Herbal Medicine Shops

— Xin Liang

A Chinese medicine shop, unless it has about a thousand different types of medicinal herbs, shells, and mineral stones, from cheap tangerine peel to expensive antelope horn, is not considered complete.

At the lowest estimate, about four hundred types of medicinal ingredients are used daily. And according to the doctor's instructions, some medicinal materials must first be soaked in honey or human milk, and some must be boiled with salt or rice wine before they can be used.

The Chinese materia medica is like a fruit shop's catalog. For example, watermelon, which is used as a cold drink in summer, occupies an important place in the treatment of heatstroke. Other ingredients such as lotus leaves, lotus seeds, olives (especially the dried ones from Tibet), almonds, longans, persimmons, loquats, and pears are also effective medicines for coughs.

The Chinese materia medica is also like a list from a zoo. Tiger bones can treat rheumatism, and there are also turtle shells, antelope horns, cicada shells, deer velvet (worth 300 yuan per ounce), dead silkworms, rhinoceros horns, scorpions, and centipedes, among others. The last two are relatively rarely used.

Among these, there are three rare and precious things worth mentioning. One is Maba, which is said to be found in the pastures of Mongolia and Manchuria. We can find a horse with a peculiar temperament that often breathes deeply under the moonlight and does not eat for several days. After killing it, we can get a stone-like "treasure" in its stomach, which is the best medicine for treating nervous disorders. There are also such hard lumps in the bones of cows and dogs. These three medicinal materials can only be bought in a few large pharmacies.

Some other Chinese medicines are like things in a general store, including mint for treating colds, garlic for treating stomach pain, wine, vinegar, and salt. It is said that the last one is used to treat internal heat.

Most Chinese medicinal materials are grass roots, while mineral stones and shells make up the majority. Various medicinal materials must be purchased from special places. However, many small pharmacies also buy cheaper goods from other places and sell them as genuine products.

Pharmacies use taels as the unit. Although most medicinal materials only cost a few cents per tael, a typical Chinese medicine prescription for two doses always costs around one yuan.

Someone who works as a "sir" in a Chinese medicine shop must undergo a long period of training before being qualified. The baskets of medicine drawers are arranged against the wall. Each drawer contains various medicinal materials. The person dispensing the medicine must first know the order in which these drawers are placed. Therefore, without three years of apprenticeship, one cannot know how the thousand different medicinal ingredients are placed.

Unlike foreign pharmacies that take the prescription to the dispensing room, the Chinese medicine shop's dispensing clerk dispenses various medicinal ingredients in front of the customer. First, he places the prescription on the counter. Then, he walks between the counter and the drawers, taking out different medicines from each drawer and placing them on several small square papers.

A typical Chinese medicine prescription contains nine to thirteen ingredients. Therefore, he has to go back and forth so many times. When he has weighed the last medicinal ingredient, a clerk responsible for checking the medicine comes to check it carefully to see if there are any errors in the dispensing. After that, he stamps the prescription with a responsible seal. The person dispensing the medicine then takes a ball of soft paper, prints the name and efficacy of the medicinal ingredient on it, and wraps up all the various medicinal ingredients.

An ordinary person really does not know how to use a thin paper, four inches square, to wrap up a certain amount of medicine. He would definitely feel that either the paper is too small, or the paper is folded too wrinkled, or even torn. However, the clerk in a Chinese medicine shop can wrap it up quickly and neatly.

Then, the dispenser uses a large sheet of paper to wrap all the packets together, places the prescription on top, and ties it up with a thin rope. The price is usually written on the prescription. On weekdays, we can always get a 10% discount, and on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, we can get an extra 10% discount.

Some Chinese medicine shops also give away jujubes or other sweets for free to relieve the bitter taste after the patient tastes the medicinal soup.

Now, there are also services that boil the medicine for customers. They put the boiled medicine in two thermos bottles, and each dose costs only five cents. Chinese doctors rarely tell patients whether the medicinal soup should be taken before or after meals, but most people believe that it is better to take it before meals, otherwise the effectiveness of the medicine is easily diluted by food.

### Elementary School Teachers in Shanghai

— Yi

Generally speaking, elementary school teachers are the poorest in the education field. They are busy from morning to night, and their income is only enough to make ends meet. Although Shanghai is a prosperous city, the poverty of elementary school teachers is no exception.

The qualifications of elementary school teachers are as follows: (1) graduates of normal schools; (2) university students; (3) high school graduates; (4) kindergarten normal school graduates; (5) others. The high school graduates mentioned above include senior high school and junior high school graduates. Kindergarten normal school graduates mostly regard kindergarten teachers as the most ideal way out, and they are all women. Other items include former Qing scholars and those from general private schools.

The treatment of elementary school teachers varies depending on the situation of the school. Generally speaking, public elementary schools used to be better than private elementary schools, and private elementary schools varied depending on the development of their school affairs and the treatment of their teachers. In general, teaching is paid according to the number of clock hours. Teachers in the first and second years are paid three cents per hour, those in the third and fourth years are paid four cents per hour, and those in the fifth and sixth years are paid five cents per hour. Therefore, the monthly income of an elementary school teacher is usually around thirty yuan. Those who can earn forty or fifty yuan per month are very few. Generally, kindergarten teachers, especially those who are principals, can get a monthly salary of about thirty-five yuan, while assistant teachers get about twenty yuan. This refers to public schools. Private schools are probably far less than this.

After the war, elementary school teachers in Shanghai, with the exception of a very small number, suffered a huge blow. Most of their schools were in the war zone or near the war zone, so they could not start school for a while, and their lives became a problem. A few lucky ones were able to temporarily find a place to live in schools that were not affected by the shelling, but the majority were unemployed and lived a very miserable life. Later, when the environment was slightly calmer, some elementary schools borrowed one or two temporary classrooms from other schools in the concession to continue teaching, but the treatment of teachers was truly miserable. Some elementary school teachers only got four or five yuan a month in travel expenses, which was really extremely bitter, but the principal was still sighing about losing money. Some elementary schools started new schools in the concession and reopened, but the salaries of teachers were said to be discounted due to the high rent. Those who used to earn thirty or forty yuan can now only get about twenty yuan.

Currently, because the number of immigrants in the concession has increased sharply, the number of school-age children has also increased greatly, and elementary school education has been able to develop particularly well. There are also elementary schools that have moved from the war zone to the concession. There are also newly established schools. Some schools that were originally in the concession have even opened branch schools due to the large number of students. However, elementary school teachers may not be able to live a slightly better life because of this.
