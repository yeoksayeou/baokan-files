### The Mongol Banners Since the War of Resistance Against Japan: Shakdurjab

Since the sudden outbreak of the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese × have been cunningly plotting, vainly attempting to use their military threat and political deception to destroy our country and exterminate our race, in order to achieve their aggressive ambition of monopolizing East Asia. Our highest authorities, in order to strive for national survival and territorial integrity, resolutely launched a nationwide war of resistance and entered the second stage of the National Revolution, which has lasted for more than nineteen months. During these nineteen months, thanks to the heroic efforts of our front-line soldiers and the unity of the people throughout the country, the Japanese ×'s conspiracy for a quick victory has been completely shattered. At the same time, our spirit of arduous resistance has won widespread sympathy and support from the world. All of our citizens deeply understand the importance of safeguarding international justice and national survival, and under the leadership of the supreme commander, we are concentrating our efforts to confront the Japanese ×. Since the start of the war, the × have become more and more trapped, while we have become stronger and stronger. Recently, the anti-war sentiment among the × army has been rising, and domestic uprisings due to repeated conscription have been occurring frequently. These obvious facts are signs that the Japanese fascist warlords are trapped in a quagmire from which they cannot escape, and they are also a guarantee that the final victory will belong to us.

Based on the aforementioned firm belief, the Mongol banner compatriots have always stood on their own posts since the war of resistance began, carrying out the sacred task of defending the motherland! Naturally, we do not deny that the cultural level of the Mongol banners is too low and all facilities are relatively backward. However, we Mongols have a heart full of loyalty to the government and support for the leader, determined to crush the Japanese ×'s conspiracy! In order to accomplish the great mission of resisting Japan and building the country, and to protect the glorious foundation painstakingly created by our ancestors, the Mongol banners have launched a wide-ranging anti-Japanese movement since the winter before last. As the Japanese ×'s frantic attacks and oppression intensified, the vast Mongol people suddenly awakened and set off a wave of anti-Japanese and national salvation, which spread rapidly throughout the western Mongol banners like a prairie fire. In the Darat Banner, in the Jungar Banner, in the County Prince Banner, in the Zasag Banner, and throughout the Ikhe Joo League, there were guerrillas carrying guns and riding horses everywhere, attacking the Japanese × every day and continuously striking the Japanese ×. People like Bai Haifeng, Han Yuchun, Ma Zixi, Naimudai, Qijunfeng, and Bayunying have all written glorious anti-Japanese × historical records.

If we open a map and take a look, we can see that the Mongol compatriots' determination to resist Japan is not accidental. On the one hand, it is certainly to preserve the integrity of our Chinese nation's territory. But from another perspective, the main reason why the Mongol banner compatriots were able to launch their anti-Japanese × movement so quickly and so universally and deeply was that after the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese × used the disappearance of Ishimoto as an excuse to invade Rehe, and then occupied Duolun, changing their tune and overturning the original league system of the Mongols, renaming it a province, in order to pursue their cunning plan of division and conquest. The four leagues and tribes of Jerim, Josooth, Zhao Uda and Hulunbuir fell into the hands of the Japanese × under this conspiracy! Later, the Xilin Gol and Ulanqab Leagues were also no longer ours due to the pressure of the situation. Now, only the Ikhe Joo League remains complete. Under the trampling of the Japanese ×'s iron hooves, the Mongol compatriots suffered greatly. Therefore, tens of thousands of Mongol people fully exerted their strength in the war of resistance under the call of anti-Japanese ×.

Although a very small number of confused people were temporarily instigated by the enemy to act as accomplices, like Prince De, who was young and weak and was surrounded and instigated by a few disloyal and unrighteous ministers and bandits, he willingly became a bridge for transitioning to the direct rule of the Japanese × bandits! No matter how much the puppets bowed their heads and flattered the Japanese ×, in the eyes of the Japanese ×, the puppets were not considered human beings. They could be killed or beaten at will. The shameless traitors did not know how much dirty air they had suffered from the Japanese ×. Therefore, many people with a sense of righteous indignation turned against them one after another. In the military, there were people like Battalion Commander Han Yuchun of the Jungar Banner and Regiment Commander Ma Zixi and Naimudai of the Darat Banner. In particular, in the past few years, several young people from the Ikhe Joo League, such as Qi Bizhang and Hua Deng, who were sent to Japan for further study by Prince De, had also deeply understood that Prince De's collusion with the Japanese was not only a disgrace to the nation, but also put their personal positions in imminent danger. Recently, they returned to the country one after another to participate in the sacred war of resistance. This shows that the failure of the Japanese × is not limited to the military side, and their means of winning people over have also been completely exposed. Now, the Japanese × have concentrated their forces in the Suiyuan-Baotou area, attempting to invade the west. But we have already anticipated this move. We have already organized the people of the Ikhe Joo League, who are at the forefront of the attack, into self-defense forces and guerrillas. The former is an armed organization of the people that does not break away from production, and the latter is an armed organization of the people that does break away from production. These more than 50,000 strong men living in the desert area have already inflicted many severe blows on the Japanese × in the vicinity of Suiyuan and Baotou and in places such as Darat Banner and Jungar Banner in the past. They have been trained into heroic warriors who have fought on the battlefield for a long time. Although they do not have new-style weapons, they have refined horsemanship and accurate shooting skills. During the war of resistance, the Mongol banner guerrillas used their agility and mobile tactics to kill and wound thousands of Japanese devils and consume countless ammunition from the Japanese ×, so that the Japanese × still dare not easily invade the Mongol banners. The people of the country should remember: the Japanese × are rampant and aggressive, and we are at a critical juncture for the survival of the nation. Anyone with blood and courage will give their lives for the country! The Mongol banners are an integral part of the entire Chinese nation, and we have a duty to resist Japan and save the country. We Mongols are determined to sacrifice everything and, in the wilderness of Inner Mongolia, will cooperate with the overall situation and work with the regular army to destroy all the Japanese ×'s poisonous schemes and conspiracies and bury the Japanese × in the desert! At present, we are working hard to strengthen the anti-Japanese armed forces, improve political institutions, and take unified steps to make the atmosphere of revolutionary resistance permeate every Mongol banner tribe, so that the anti-Japanese work can be strengthened day by day and achieve results. Our final victory will surely be realized soon because of the firm determination and progress of the Mongol banner's anti-Japanese work. Chongqing, February 23, 1939

### A Week of World Trends

— Pan Lang

From March 19th to 25th

The extremely turbulent world has appeared unprecedentedly tense and serious in the past week. On the one hand, the aggressor countries are taking an inch and wanting a mile. Following the fall of Czechoslovakia, there is the crisis in Romania and the annexation of Memel; on the other hand, the peaceful countries are being forced to unite. As a result, Britain is considering changing its foreign policy, the French president is consulting with London, and the US government's reorganization bill has been passed. At the same time, the Soviet Union, the guardian of world peace, has successfully concluded its 18th Congress of the Communist Party, and the democratic peace front has made further progress. Although our war of resistance against Japan has turned to a more difficult and serious stage, the struggle on the two fronts is becoming clearer, and the situation of national unity is becoming more optimistic. Victory is beckoning to our soldiers!

The Aggressor Group is Running Wild

The fascist aggression front is still developing in a mad and adventurous way. As they advance adventurously, the contradictions between Germany, Italy, and Japan are also developing. However, in order to promote a new imperialist war and re-divide the world, their collusion is becoming closer and more consistent!

Germany

Since the German aggressors announced the annexation of Czechoslovakia last week, they have been sending troops eastward to use force to help diplomacy, seizing Romania's economic rights and interests and rich resources such as grain and oil, so that the "German-Romanian New Agreement," which actually deprived the country of its independence, was announced successfully this week. On the other hand, under the leadership of Hitler, the German aggressors marched into Memel on the morning of the 23rd of this month, issued an occupation order, and merged Memel into Germany! On the same day, Slovakia, which was officially announced "independent" and separated from Czechoslovakia last week, also signed a deed of sale, and concluded the German-Slovak Agreement with Germany, clearly stipulating that everything was subject to German control. So far, as a result of Germany's plunder in one week, the population has increased by 10 million, and the territory has expanded by 35 million square miles. Now they want to further attack Danzig, Denmark, and Belgium!

Italy

Although the Italian aggressors have not made any major developments this week, they have already begun to drive the rebel army into Madrid on the 24th of this month by alienating the internal unity of the Spanish Republican government! Madrid, the democratic holy city that has stood firm for three years, has fallen into the hands of a few leaders of the Spanish government who "send anti-communists to compromise with the enemy." This is a major lesson for us. In the future, the vast masses of Spain who seek freedom will continue the more arduous anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle in close cooperation with the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which is an inevitable fact, and it is also a fact that the Italian aggressors are not satisfied with the spoils in Spain. It's just that if he wants to develop further in the future, he will inevitably have a direct conflict with Britain and France, and Italy's own strength is not enough to defeat Britain and France without the help of Germany. Therefore, he has to voluntarily be enslaved by Germany, and the Italian Fascist Supreme Council on the 21st of this month decided to continue to maintain the German-Italian axis to confront the "threat" of the democratic countries' united front. On the 23rd, the German newspaper also expressed that Hitler would support Italy's demands and wish Italy success without war!

Japan

Japan, which is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the war of aggression against China, is also eager to take advantage of the opportunity to step up its adventures when its Western allies succeed in their adventures. At the same time, because China's resistance forces are increasing day by day, and the Soviet Union's prestige and tough attitude in the Far East are also a "major threat" to Japan, and the voice of the democratic peace countries' united front makes the Japanese aggressors feel the danger of the future, they are eager to find new countermeasures. Therefore, there was an unprecedented five-minister secret meeting on the evening of the 22nd of this month, but it still ended without results and seemed to continue to consult. As for the Japanese × plan, the first is to adjust the cabinet after the current parliament is closed, drive away Konoe and recruit Katsuda and Tanabe into the cabinet to solve the financial and economic difficulties. The second is to further collude with Germany and Italy to realize the anti-communist agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan into a military alliance, threatening Britain and France in the Far East. The third is to carry out military speculation against China, supplemented by anti-communist and equal political conspiracies, and actively promote the military in central and southern China. Rapidly force our country to submit.

Democratic Countries Strengthen Unity

The call for democratic and peaceful countries to unite has never shaken the world as much as it has this week! And in fact, the movement to consolidate and expand the peace front has indeed had extremely important developments. First, Britain and France have discovered and recognized that the compromise diplomacy has harmed others and themselves, and must be abandoned, and there is a tendency to begin to take active steps to resist fascist aggressors. Second, the United States' policy of uniting democratic countries against fascism to defend world peace is becoming more firm and progressive. Third, the small countries of Europe have once again stated that as long as Britain and France are determined to unite and resist fascism, all small countries will decide to do everything in their power to support it. Now let's look at the trends of various countries:

Britain

The British government realized that Germany had destroyed the Munich Agreement, which was still wet with ink, and annexed Czechoslovakia, making Europe a world dominated by fascism, and the status of the British Empire would be seriously threatened. Therefore, it had to adopt a policy of uniting democratic countries to resist fascism. Such as declaring that it does not recognize Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, such as lodging a serious protest with Germany, such as recalling its ambassador to Germany, such as announcing that the cabinet has decided to maintain close contact with peace-loving countries around the world, such as the successful conclusion of the Soviet-Polish economic cooperation negotiations, such as the departure of Overseas Trade Minister Hudson to Moscow to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on political cooperation, Chamberlain also reiterated Britain's determination on the evening of the 23rd of this month, saying that "if Germany repeats its past actions, it will inevitably cause continuous resistance from Britain and other countries. If Germany threatens independent countries again, we will do our utmost to resist its attempts." Although the British government's attitude is not firm and thorough enough, the vast number of British people who seek freedom, and the increasingly important leadership of the Labour Party and the Communist Party, will become the main force in determining Britain's progress!

France

France's position is more dangerous than Britain's under the intensified attack of the aggressors. When Britain's attitude is still moving towards actively resisting fascist aggressors, France has issued many messages of preparing to resist aggression: what France is stepping up its war preparations, what is secretly implementing mobilization, what the French president consulted with London on the 22nd to discuss British-French military cooperation, what the French president is preparing to visit Roosevelt in the United States to discuss the great unity of democratic peace countries. However, we must not overestimate these messages. What is particularly important is that the French financial oligarchs continue to oppress their government, causing it to move towards a right-leaning and reactionary dead end. Now they are taking the opportunity to use the European situation to thoroughly abolish the 40-hour work week and the remaining better laws of the People's Front, and implement a high degree of exploitation of the working masses and the lower and middle classes. This policy will obviously help the fascist aggressors increase the French crisis from within! Fortunately, the vast number of French people are intensifying their struggle under dual oppression, and their leaders, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, also have a more united step. If the French government does not urgently move towards the anti-fascist road, it will definitely suffer a fatal blow!

America

The United States' anti-fascist and anti-aggression policy is becoming more firm and progressive. This week's facts are manifested in President Roosevelt's stern condemnation of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, and his call for democratic countries to immediately cooperate closely; the US government's formal sending of a letter accusing Germany of illegal violence; the US Treasury Department's abolition of the US-Czech agreement and the beginning of the implementation of economic sanctions against Germany; the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Pittman, proposed abolishing the Neutrality Act, which will be amended and passed with a majority of approval; the brewing of expanding economic sanctions against Japan, etc. are all. The US Senate also passed the government reorganization bill on the 22nd, giving President Roosevelt certain powers to promote his policies. From this, we can see that although the reactionaries in Britain who oppose President Roosevelt's progressive policies are intensifying their shameless and fierce attacks, under the unanimous anti-fascist upsurge in the country, this reactionary force is weakening.

In addition, many small countries that have not been annexed by fascism, such as Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey, are also actively promoting cooperation between democratic peace countries and the Soviet Union to implement a collective security system and defend world peace.

The Soviet Union has achieved new major successes

The Soviet Union, which is completing socialist construction and moving towards communist construction, is the only strong and invincible democratic and peaceful country in front of this new imperialist war in which Hansis re-divides the world. This country has recently achieved another major success. The first is that the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was successfully concluded on the 21st of this month. The conference passed the proposal to expand the national economy's third five-year plan, passed the proposal on implementing the Soviet Union's new intentions to strengthen the party, government, and military forces, and passed the plan to develop national defense forces and oppose fascism, oppose aggression, and support the liberation movement of the people of the world and the anti-fascist movement. As a result of the re-election of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Gagano-vich, Kaganin, Manuilsky, etc. were all elected with enthusiastic support from the whole country, and General Grikoli Shute, who commanded the severe blow to the Japanese × in the Zhanggufeng Incident, was also elected as a member, which attracted more attention from various countries. This conference will have extremely important contributions to the Soviet Union itself and to the people of the world, and the Soviet Union's prestige in the world will also be greatly improved. Second, regarding Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union expressed its support for the British and French proposal to jointly discuss the European situation, and revealed that it would suggest immediately convening a joint meeting of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Poland, and Turkey. Therefore, the political influence of the Soviet Union's peace policy has gained newer, wider, and more significant development in Europe and even the world. Not only do many small countries in Europe and the Near East feel the urgent need to establish a collective security system advocated by the Soviet Union, but also the people, public opinion, and political parties in Britain, France, and the United States are eagerly demanding the immediate realization or strengthening of cooperation with the Soviet Union, and the British and French governments have to actually ask the Soviet Union to participate in the discussion of the European Union. On the 24th of this month, the British Overseas Trade Minister made a speech in Moscow, clearly stating that the Soviet talks were harmonious and of political importance. Third, the Soviet-Japanese fishing zone dispute. On March 15th, the Soviet Union resolutely rejected the Japanese request and implemented the sale of fishing grounds. Despite Japan's repeated threats to attack the Soviet Union, the facts now prove that the Japanese aggressors finally succumbed to the Soviet Union's solemn and tough expression. On the 24th of this month, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "The results of the fishery negotiations held in Moscow on the 22nd of this month are far from the compromise attitude adopted by Japan in the negotiations, but Japan is still determined to continue consultations with the Soviet Union"—this is the second Zhanggufeng Incident! It is another manifestation of Japan's submission to the Soviet Union!

The War Situation of Resistance Against Japan Turns Tense

The seriousness of the European situation has caused the Japanese aggressors to intensify their military adventures in China. Japan's submission to the Soviet Union shows the determination of the × to intensify the threat to force our submission! The reason why the Sino-Japanese war situation has become tense this week is a reflection of the Japanese ×'s military adventure plan against us.

What is particularly noteworthy in the war situation this week is the central China battlefield. North of the Yangtze River, the × army has taken a defensive posture in the Zhongxiang area, shifting its main force south in an attempt to forcibly cross the Xiang River. The × army on this side is attempting to contain our heavy troops in central and western Hubei. And cover the deployment of troops in its "Nanchang Strategy". Fortunately, our army has given full play to the strategy of mobile warfare, constantly counterattacking the flanks and rear of the × army, while avoiding concentrated large-scale battles on the front. As a result, the × army was dispersed by our various small units, while our main force is waiting for an opportunity to annihilate the main force of the × army. The war south of the Yangtze River and on the east line is the focus of this week's war. In order to carry out its "Nanchang Strategy", the × army concentrated its main force and launched a fierce southern attack from the left and right wings of the Nanxun Line, forcibly occupying Yongxiu on the 19th, forcibly crossing the Xiushui River from the evening of the 20th, and on the 23rd, the × vanguard troops crossed Anyi and Fengxin, attempting to encircle Nanchang. To date, the battle on the left wing of the Nanxun Line is in full swing. At the same time, the × army intensified its attack on eastern Zhejiang, bombed and harassed Wenzhou and other places with airplanes, and concentrated a large number of warships in the Hangzhou Bay and the coastal area of eastern Zhejiang. The × in Hangzhou also launched a large-scale forced crossing of the Qiantang River, looking eastward into Yin County and attacking Jinhua to the south, attempting to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and coordinate with the × attacking Nanchang. The × people's plan is that if they capture Nanchang, they can join the × in Hunan and Hubei to the west, drive straight to Changsha, open up the Guangdong-Han Road, and coordinate with the × in southern Guangdong to attack Guizhou and Yunnan. If they retreat, they can also cut off our hinterland transportation, strengthen the rule of their occupied areas in the southeastern provinces, actively rectify, plunder the people's strength, and then plan to advance. However, although the × people's conspiracy is fierce, we are not showing weakness at all. On the north side of Jiangxi, our reinforcements have been arriving continuously since the 20th, and now they are intercepting the invading × at a distance of more than 40 miles from Nanchang. And our army in northern Hunan has also launched a large-scale attack towards the southeast of Yuezhou. Our army on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has also been dispatched, directly attacking the flanks and rear of the × attacking Nanchang. In the eastern Zhejiang area, our army has strict preparations to protect transportation and intercept the × army. More than 1,000 × who forcibly crossed the Qiantang River have been annihilated. At the same time, our army on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has also gone north and south separately, intercepting the ×'s reinforcements to the north, and severely attacking the ×'s rear to the south. It is expected that the result of the × people's Nanchang Strategy will be the overthrow of their elite troops in central China. As for the northern war situation, in order to prevent the × army from being transferred to other battlefields and to give them a major blow, we have already launched a counter-offensive with all our strength. There have been fierce battles in the Jin-Chahar-Hebei border area for days, the guerrilla warfare in various parts of Hebei and Shandong has not stopped, our army in northern Jiangsu has counterattacked Huaiyin and Huai'an, and our army in western and central Anhui has also launched a counter-offensive, recovering Wangjiang. In southern China, the overall situation has not changed. However, the × people believe that the southwest is where the main force of our long-term resistance is concentrated, and there is also an important foreign aid transportation line, so they are secretly preparing for a fierce attack, which is what we cannot ignore when we are watching the war situation in central China.

This new offensive by ×× proves that under the increasingly favorable international situation, we must immediately prepare for further prevention and strikes against the Japanese ×. At the same time, it proves that all latent and overt anti-communist and pro-peace theorists' words and actions can deceive our people, alienate our unity, and cover up the ×'s cruel new offensive. In order to crush the × people's new offensive and the Han-good conspiracy, we must strengthen the front-line combat power in the military and develop guerrilla warfare behind the ×. The Party and Government Committee of the War Zone has been established in Pingzhou, and we hope to make greater efforts in this regard. In diplomacy, it is necessary to promote the world's peace front and strive for more foreign support. In the future, there should be more aspects of development. What is particularly important in politics is to strengthen national unity and implement centralized leadership of democratic politics. Now the People's Congresses in various cities and counties have been established on a regular basis, starting from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the provinces of Guangdong and Guizhou have been scheduled to be established one after another. We cannot but place earnest hopes on them, so as to realize the general mobilization of the spiritual and material strength of the whole nation through the promotion of civil governance, so as to complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country.

### Recent Developments in Shenzhen Rural Work

[Shenzhen Correspondent] "The strength of China's resistance lies in the countryside" is a well-said statement. In terms of manpower, according to general statistics, more than 80% of China's population are farmers. Out of every ten Chinese people, eight are farmers. This means that farmers account for 80% of China's manpower mobilization for the war of resistance. In terms of material resources, China is an agricultural country, and the majority of production still relies on farmers. During the war of resistance, the supply of grain depended on the diligent cultivation and harvesting of farmers. In terms of spiritual mobilization, farmers also possess the excellent qualities of perseverance, diligence, and integrity. These are the pillars of China's resistance and nation-building.

The Shenzhen Rural Welfare Association recognizes this strength and, in response to the demands of this objective environment, is determined to cultivate it. Therefore, in the early stages of the second phase of the war of resistance, it bravely entered the torrent of resistance with a spirit of serving the farmers with perseverance and dedication.

The founder of this organization is Mr. Chen Pishi. Mr. Chen has devoted even greater efforts to completing the entire work plan. The progress of all work is within his confidence and control.

The Shenzhen Rural Welfare Association was established around November or December of last year, shortly after the * Japanese troops withdrew from Shenzhen. However, the real work began in January of this year. All the staff are graduates of famous universities in the country, specializing in education, agriculture, crafts, and political science. They have the flexibility to adapt to the work and are more advanced in their work abilities than many other rural work groups.

There are many difficulties in developing rural work. When the "Welfare Association" started working, it first encountered:

1.  The conservatism of farmers has not been eliminated. For example, they are all law-abiding citizens. When it rains, they thank the heavens. When it doesn't rain, they only blame their fate. Because Shenzhen is mostly mountainous and does not have flowing rivers that can be fully irrigated, farmers have always waited for spring rains to start plowing. To alleviate the suffering of farmers, the "Welfare Association" planned and decided to build dams to store water. Naturally, they first sought the consent of the farmers and discussed the issues of manpower and material burden. However, when it came time to start, the farmers declined in various ways. They said: First, building a dam would hinder the passage of boats. Second, it will inevitably rain, so there is no need to spend so much effort building dams.

2.  The difficulty of raising funds. Because the development of rural work must start from helping farmers, Shenzhen is suffering from the * Japanese army's artillery fire. Without funds to help them in their displacement, it is difficult to start work. However, Mr. Chen Pishi said: "We have never worried about funding. What we are worried about is not doing the work well." Mr. Chen's spirit of working is also a manifestation of the great spirit of the "Welfare Association" in carrying out work under the nose of the * Japanese army.

3.  Shenzhen has its special environment, closely adjacent to the occupied area. Farmers are constantly alarmed, making it more difficult to mobilize work.

Although it is difficult to carry out work under the nose of the * Japanese army, the "Welfare Association" has gradually overcome these difficulties. Now, it is showing a new attitude of growing in difficulty. As a reporter who has served with the association, I will give a brief report on the general situation of Shenzhen farmers:

Promoting Spring Plowing

There are thousands of farming households near Shenzhen. Due to constant * Japanese invasions, the losses have been quite severe. In terms of plowing cattle, according to statistics, there were more than 700 in the past, but now there are only more than 60. The number of differences between them is more than 600. With more than 60 heads of cattle distributed to thousands of households, it is usually not enough to distribute. During the spring plowing season, when every household starts plowing at the same time, the distribution of cattle is obviously lacking. The "Welfare Association's" plan for relief is: First, buy or rent as many plowing cattle as possible from the outside world and distribute them to farmers for use. Second, rush to build reservoirs and irrigate the possible irrigated paddy fields with river water. At present, Shenzhen farmers can use cattle one after another, which alleviates the shortage in distribution. The "Welfare Association" has also received donations of many excellent seeds from Honolulu and the Philippines, which are distributed to every household. The method of manufacturing fertilizer and the method of cultivating straw mushrooms are guided by Professor Lin Lichat of Lingnan University in different regions. Rural loans are also in progress. At present, the rural areas of Shenzhen are showing a vigorous scene day by day.

Running Primary Schools

Every village in Shenzhen has a primary school. Since the * Japanese invasion, most of the teachers have fled, and the students have been forced to wander around aimlessly, and education has become stagnant. The "Welfare Association" runs two primary schools there, one in Caiwuwei and one in Getian. The purpose is to help out-of-school children. First, there is no tuition fee, and the books are distributed by the Welfare Association. Second, the library is established by collecting books from the outside world and students. Third, the content of the teaching materials is letters, abacus, wartime knowledge, political speeches, farming, and singing. The situation of the school is probably like this. At present, there are more than 300 students in total, from the first grade to the sixth grade, and there are also special classes (junior high school level).

Rescue and Military Affairs

After the "Welfare Association" arrived in Shenzhen, in addition to running primary schools, it also implemented wartime education for adults. In terms of rescue, there is protection against poison gas, bandaging, and applying medicine. In terms of military affairs, there is guerrilla warfare, defense, air raid prevention, and evacuation plans. In terms of farming, there is fertilizer manufacturing, soil improvement, and mushroom cultivation. The farmers of Shenzhen are gradually becoming active and will pierce a sharp knife into the chest of the * Japanese army.

After the great work has been launched, Shenzhen, under the nose of the * Japanese army, has become a strong fortress of resistance. In order to have a vivid expression of the facts, the "Welfare Association" has also received a lot of sympathy and donations from people from all walks of life. The Hong Kong government and our government have also given it strict encouragement and sympathy. Under the crazy bombing of the * Japanese army, Shenzhen has become a ruin. The grocery stores have also suffered from the fire. The farmers of Shenzhen are living a more miserable life. However, the "Welfare Association" still stands like a rock, carrying out planned work. The following is an excerpt of its current work plan:

1.  Establishing Collective Farms - As a result of the discussions between Mr. Chen Pishi, the founder of the association, and the local government of Dongjiang, it was decided to establish a collective farm between Dongguan and Bao'an near Shenzhen in the near future to accommodate farmers who have been displaced by the war of resistance. It is said that the plan is similar to the "Sichuan Border Reclamation Group" launched by Mr. Zhu Wuqing in Sichuan. The refugees in Shenzhen, who have suffered from bombing and fire, may have a place to return to.

2.  Establishing Rural Cooperatives - In order to meet the current requirements of the war of resistance, the association decided to establish cooperatives in ordinary rural areas to participate in wartime production to help relieve refugees, adopt group production and consumption, and eliminate the exploitation of usury by parasites in rural areas.

3.  Organizing Farmers and Arming Farmers - In order to penetrate deep into the rear of the * Japanese army, the association will step up the work of organizing farmers and arming farmers to increase their work development and assistance.

4.  Expanding Work - At present, the association's work has only expanded from Shenzhen to Changping, Longhua, and Nantou. The region is still very limited. In order to expand its work, the association is planning a movement to expand the work area. "We have never thought about when the work will end." This has become the association's slogan.

Shenzhen, Nantou, Dongguan, ... have become active in the rear of the * Japanese army. Armed farmers are growing up under the artillery fire of the * Japanese army. It is inserting a sharp sword into the chest of the * Japanese army. This is a great victory in the second phase of the war of resistance. (Minge Society)

### Treasury of Xikang (Part Two)

Composition of Ore Deposits

The Baoxing Sanyuan Liangfei Cave is located in the mountain stream forest of Daihuangkou, about ten miles from the mountain peak and about six miles from the foot of the mountain to the Rongyao Road. The road is narrow and steep, making it difficult to climb. At the foot of the mountain, there are two tablet-style smelting furnaces of the Sanyuan Factory and many forging ponds. Not yet completely destroyed. The factory is located one hundred and twenty miles from Rongjing County and five hundred and fifty miles from Chengdu. Copper must be transported out through a dry foot road of two hundred and ten miles before reaching Ya'an, and then transported by car to Chengdu or by boat to Jiading. The ore beds mined by the Baoxing Sanyuan Liangfei Factory are all in the shape of vertical columns, which the locals call vertical heart mines. The columns are small at the top and large at the bottom, forming a sea-style shape. It is said that the local method of pumping water has reached forty-eight bamboo tubes, but the tubes are not all upright. It is estimated that the depth of the excavation has reached about forty zhang. According to the chemical experiments conducted that day, the copper content of the ore is about 10%, which is two and a half times higher than the average copper content of 4% in the Dashishan copper mine in Baishuihe, Peng County. The copper-producing area around Sanyuan Factory is wide. The Hehegang Factory in the east of the factory and the Qianxi Mountain belly in the west of the factory have obvious outcrops. The Dou Doudi, twenty miles north of the factory, was once mined by Kaiyuan Iron Factory. Its vein is eight miles long, twenty miles wide, and one foot and five inches thick. From this, it can be seen that the economic value of the copper mine in the northern Rongjing area is significant.

Smelting Method

In the past, copper smelting was done using local methods. The forging pond is in the shape of an armchair, with a height of six feet and a diameter of nine feet and a width of eight feet. The first step is to forge the ore with charcoal fire, which takes about ten days. The second step is to forge the ore three times, roast it three times, and beat it three times, which takes about three days. After the copper liquid solidifies, it is dragged away with wooden sticks. The first few calendar years of extraction are water copper, the next few calendar years of extraction are nao copper, and then the next one is zheng copper. The third step is to calcine ice copper. The forging pond is smaller than the ore pond. Lay the layers and turn them over and burn them five times. Copper beads must be found on the surface of the ice copper. The fourth step is to flow copper. It is smelted in a furnace, the door is closed, and the wind is drawn until it turns red. Finally, it is refined in a reverberatory furnace to obtain 99% refined copper. It has been found that if the Rongjing copper mine is mined and smelted in large quantities, it can produce 15 to 20 tons of refined copper per day. However, the ore calendar has not been accurately inspected. If a new smelting method is used, the government must send geological experts and mining experts to conduct multiple surveys before it can be discussed. During the current period of resistance, there is a great and urgent need for refined copper, and the development cannot be delayed. The general opinion is that the copper mine in the mountain stream forest of Daihuanggou, Rongjing, should be tried by the Kang Provincial Government, and the budget for the preparation of funds is 100,000 party-state currency. As for the copper mines in the front and rear Jubazai in Rongjing, it is best to encourage private operation by the provincial government! If the capital is insufficient, the province will advance a part of it. In this way, the people will be eager to prepare for the copper market, and the province will assist in the establishment of funds, and they will surely be eager to prepare and start work first, and the large amount of copper that can be obtained can be asserted.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 25th] In the battles on both sides of the Xiu River and near Fengxin in northern Jiangxi, our army was able to concentrate its firepower and annihilate the stubborn * Japanese troops. In the battle in front of Mantoushan on the 23rd, a * Japanese regimental commander named Iino was killed by our army. On the afternoon of the 24th, another regimental commander, Miyazaki, was shot and killed. On the evening of the 24th, the * Japanese broadcast admitted the death of the two * Japanese chiefs, and said that Iino was from Tokyo. His leg was shot first, and before he could be carried down, he was shot again and killed. As for Miyazaki, it is said that he was from Wakayama Prefecture and had been wounded once while fighting in Dongtai.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 24th] At Coffin Mountain, Wangrennao, Jiabailao, and other places on the north bank of the Xiu River, the * Japanese troops were fiercely attacked by our unit for several days, killing many * Japanese troops. Yesterday morning, the * Japanese troops could not resist and retreated towards the Ruoxi Bridge. The position there has been completely recovered. At this moment, our army is advancing towards Daqiao Hetaizhang Street. The * Japanese troops in Luopu, south of the Xiu River, were bravely counterattacked by our army on the evening of the 23rd, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the morning of the 24th, the * Japanese troops fled eastward in a panic, and the area was also reported to have been recovered. Currently, the remaining * Japanese troops are being wiped out.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 25th] A Japanese Navy spokesman reported on the situation when attacking Yongxiu, 60 kilometers north of Nanchang, saying that Chinese student soldiers suddenly approached the Japanese army within 100 meters and threw grenades, causing the Japanese army to suffer some major losses, which had not been seen in many months. It was also said that the Japanese army was hindered by the influence of bad weather in various battles in northern Jiangxi. Also, the Japanese army in Hangzhou could not make progress.

On the 24th, the * Japanese regimental commander Eshima Hideo and the battalion commander Takagi Kan, two members, were seriously injured in the northeast of Wuning. The intensity of the battle can be seen from this.

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 24th] In order to cover the flanks of their troops crossing the Xiu River to commit crimes, the * Japanese sent a part of their Sixth Division from Ruoxi to Jinzhou, east of our Wuning, starting on the 21st.

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 24th] On the Nantao front, after a part of the * Japanese 106th Division forcibly crossed the Xiu River at Gouziling, between Qiujin and Yongxiu, on the 17th, its main force had reached Tanxi along the highway by the 23rd, and a small number of * Japanese tanks protected the light troops and harassed the south of Tanxi, apparently intending to bypass our Nanchang along the highway and cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. After our army bravely fought back and engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the * Japanese troops, all the * Japanese troops who had harassed the south of Tanxi were defeated. The remaining * Japanese troops have now retreated to Tanxi, and we are besieging them. The morale of our army in the highway area is very high, and a certain official personally inspected the front line to supervise the battle, and the situation immediately improved. In addition, the * Japanese army has been fiercely besieging Wucheng on the east side of Nanxun for a week with a combined force of land, sea, and air. Our certain unit is still displaying its bravery and resisting the war. The battle is quite fierce. As of the morning of the 24th, Wucheng was still firmly held by us. As for the front of the Nanxun Railway, we are still firmly holding a certain place on the south bank of the Xiu River, and there has been no change so far.

The * Japanese Troops in the Zhongtiaoshan Mountains Were Bombed

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 25th] The * Japanese troops entrenched in the Zhongtiao Mountains were heavily bombed by our air force, causing heavy losses. Our army has recently launched a fierce counter-offensive towards Jishan and Zhongtiaoshan. The * Japanese army's conspiracy to invade Xiangning Mountain has been defeated. The * Japanese troops entrenched in Heilongguan, west of Linfen, have increased to 700 or 800, and more than 100 have been added to the original, and they have repeatedly divided into small groups to harass everywhere, so the fierce battles in the area have been quite intense in recent days. The war situation in the Shenchi and Shuoxian areas is silent.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 25th] From the 21st to the 23rd, the fierce battle between the * Japanese and our army on the Heilongguan-Tumen line was still intense. On the 21st, the * Japanese army attacked from Nanyuan and Luojiazhuang, and fought fiercely with us in the Zhoujiazhuang area for ten hours.

In the afternoon of the same day, a * Japanese shallow-water ship, escorted by two * Japanese speedboats, approached the coast to measure, and was swept away by our soldiers with machine guns. The * Japanese troops fled in a panic.

### The Collapse of the Puppet Army in Henan Province: Xu Bingying's Unit of More Than 1,000 Revolted; Zhang Xingchen's Unit Was Dissolved by the * Japanese Army

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] Xu Bingying of the puppet First Army Li Ying's unit revolted in Xiaoyang Village near Linzhang on the 25th of last month, killing two Japanese consoling squad leaders, one named Degen Saburo, and the other whose name is unknown. He also killed the Japanese adviser Sato of Li Ying's unit, Wang ×kuai, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the First Regiment of the First Brigade, Chang Wenming, the ordnance officer of the regimental headquarters, Lieutenant Guan Lu Yaotang, Second Lieutenant Luo Ao, and Wang Yunce, etc. of the brigade headquarters, a total of six people. He then led more than 1,000 men, with complete weapons, and surrendered to our army. Also, Yang Fengcai of the puppet army revolted with 500 men in Linzhang on the 28th of last month. He also defeated a regiment of the puppet army and captured a lot of prisoners. He has now arrived at Jichu and joined a certain unit of our army. It is reported that the Jichu officials have sent personnel to console them.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] Zhang Xingchen's unit, the puppet commander-in-chief of the Party Rescue Army in eastern Henan, has recently completely collapsed. According to investigations, there are four reasons for this: (1) There were three Japanese staff officers in Zhang's unit. Because one of them overstepped his authority, the other two Japanese were dissatisfied and complained to the * Japanese chief Sugiyama in Beiping. Sugiyama ordered that the name of the unit be cancelled and that it be ended immediately. (2) Sugiyama of Xiang sent Zhang Junchen 5 million yuan, but 4 million yuan was seized by our guerrillas near Zhongxiang, causing Sugiyama to be furious and dissatisfied. (3) Zhang did not go to Beiping to explain after losing the money. (4) The Great Heavenly Master Kowtow Society, etc., under the jurisdiction of the puppet Party Rescue Guard Army, have all dispersed. It is also rumored that the * Japanese side will detain Zhang. This is also the fate that Zhang Ruo deserves.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 25th] There is no major change in the * Japanese situation in western Suiyuan. However, the puppet Mongol army in Baosa and other counties in Panshou has repeatedly shown more anti-* Japanese sentiment. The * Japanese are terrified and have transferred 2,000 infantry and cavalry troops from Zhangjiakou to guard Baosa and closely monitor the situation. According to investigations from various sources, the * Japanese army's increase in troops in Baosa this time is purely to prevent the puppet army from revolting and has no intention of invading the west.

### The * Japanese in Yangzhou and Shaozhou Are Stymied and Wounded; In the Battle of Zhaoguan Dam, 200 * Japanese Troops Were Annihilated

[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu, 22nd] The * Japanese troops entrenched in Ba Shao were hit head-on by our defending army in the battle to attack Zhaoguan, and a fierce battle lasted for two days and nights. The stubborn * Japanese troops were finally driven back and the position was recovered. One * Japanese Miyagawa, the commander-in-chief of Yangzhou, was killed, and 200 * Japanese troops were killed. We also made heroic sacrifices. Some soldiers of our Zhang's unit were surrounded by the * Japanese troops and could not escape. They threw several grenades at the * Japanese formation, killing dozens of * Japanese troops. Zhang also died in his post. The deputy commander-in-chief ordered a reward for the sacrifice.

### Kunming Fire: 79 Houses Destroyed, Losses of 400,000 Yuan

[This newspaper's special dispatch from Kunming on the 24th] (Late arrival) At about 3:00 pm today, a major fire in Baoshan, Kunming City, burned down 79 shops, with losses estimated at over 400,000 yuan. The person who caused the disaster has been taken to the police station for questioning.

### Our Heroic Air Force Frequents the Guangdong Territory to Attack the * Japanese Army; Recent Escapees Talk About the Local Situation

[Hong Kong News] After the * Japanese army invaded and occupied Guangzhou, they immediately began to wantonly burn and kill people. Majestic buildings were all destroyed by the * Japanese army's artillery fire. Since May, the entire city has become a field of rubble, and dilapidated buildings are desolate everywhere. According to a person who was recently forced into military service by the * Japanese army and escaped back to Hong Kong,

Since the provincial capital fell, dozens of them were detained by the * Japanese army and forced to work for military transport. During the day, they were forced to do hard labor, and at night, they were forced to burn down houses. If they disobeyed, they were whipped. Dozens of partners could not bear this inhuman life and were arrested and returned after escaping. They were often shot, so they were really badly treated by the * Japanese army and were trapped in a city of sorrow all day long. It was difficult to live, and it was even more difficult to die. Only one meal a day was provided, and they were all rotten meat and rough food that could not be swallowed. In order to survive, they had to endure humiliation for the time being and wait for an opportunity. On the 21st of this month, three * Japanese soldiers forced them to build fortifications in the Baiyun Mountain Airport and other places to prevent our army from counter-attacking. Because of this, they saw an opportunity to take advantage of the * Japanese soldiers' unawareness and beat them to death. Only then did they get this opportunity to escape.

There are very few * Japanese troops invading Guangdong now, and most of them are old and weak, and the team is disorganized and unlike soldiers. An old * Japanese soldier once said to them that he (the * Japanese army) was not a soldier, but was forced by the warlords, so he had to invade your country. He was very reluctant to leave his parents, wife, and brothers. Soldiers like them missed their hometown very much. Their parents were looking forward to their return. He hoped that peace could be achieved soon so that he could reunite with his family and never be a soldier again.

He also said that recently, our planes have been flying over Guangzhou from time to time to bomb. A few days ago, eight of our planes flew over the Humen Taiping airspace and bombed * Japanese warships and * Japanese positions. Just when the * Japanese army was being transferred, the * Japanese army saw our planes circling in the sky and hurriedly fought back with anti-aircraft guns, firing aimlessly at our planes. For a time, the sound of bombs and guns reverberated through the sky. Our planes dropped dozens of bombs in a row, all of which hit the target. Three * Japanese warships sank on the spot, and more than 1,000 * Japanese soldiers also died under the bombs. At the same time, many * Japanese positions along the coast of Humen Taiping were destroyed. The night before he left Guangzhou, near dusk, our magical response team, the amount of which was unclear, flew over Humen again, circling for a few minutes, and fiercely dropped dozens of heavy bombs on the Shatoujiao fort and the * Japanese warships in the nearby sea, before flying away safely. Seven * Japanese warships were heavily damaged and two sank on the spot. Countless * Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, and a part of the Shaqiao fort was destroyed. At the same time, at 9:15 pm that night, our planes flew over the Jiulong Road area to scout for a long time, and then dropped bombs on the Taipingchang area until late at night, before completing their mission and returning to base safely. In recent days, our guerrillas have been very active in the suburbs of Guangzhou, constantly attacking and sabotaging the * Japanese positions and defenses, making the * Japanese exhausted.

### Doude Has Not Been Found; Foreign Newspapers Condemn the * Japanese Side for Specializing in Hostility Towards Foreigners

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A dispatch from abroad stated that the Zilin West News commented on the kidnapping of Doude, the president of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, saying that Doude had been kidnapped for more than a week, and all parties now felt increasingly uneasy about the security situation in North China. It is no wonder that foreigners in the Japanese-occupied areas of Tianjin have moved into the British-administered concessions. However, one thing that must be noted is that Doude was kidnapped in the Japanese-occupied area, and we have reason to believe that Doude is still being detained in the occupied area. All of this proves that the Japanese side has no ability to maintain security. Since Japan itself cannot maintain order in its occupied areas, its recent accusations that foreign authorities in Tianjin and other places are incompetent are unfounded. Assuming that the Japanese side can first pay attention to maintaining security in the occupied areas and not specialize in hostility towards foreigners, the Doude kidnapping case may not have occurred.

### A Japanese Soldier Went Mad; Harada Returned to Japan from China; Killed and Injured Many People for No Reason

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] The military headquarters today issued a public announcement stating that Japanese army officer Lieutenant Colonel Harada recently returned to Tokyo from "Manchukuo" in a hurry. On Thursday night, he suddenly went mad on a train in Yokohama, drew his saber and rushed into a second-class carriage, slashing wildly, killing one person and injuring six. It was obviously caused by excessive stimulation and nervous breakdown. The Vice Minister of the Military Department expressed regret over this unfortunate incident. At the same time, Army Minister Itagaki has ordered several army doctors to rush to the scene of the incident to treat the injured.

### × Intensifies Poisoning of Occupied Areas: Train Carriages on the Tongpu Railway Fully Loaded with Opium Seedlings, Forcing Residents Along the Line to Plant Them

[Central News Agency, Jishi, 25th] × is intensifying its poisoning policy in the occupied areas. During the spring planting season this year, trains traveling south on the Tongpu Railway transported large quantities of opium seedlings and distributed them along the line to various locations. The Zhao Cheng puppet government even set an official price of four yuan per pound for sale, strictly ordering the entire county to plant them quickly, in order to universally poison our people.

### National Government Holds National Covenant Oath Ceremony: Over Four Hundred Staff Members Attend, Led and Instructed by Chairman Lin

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] National Government committee members and civilian, military, and accounting staff held a National Covenant Oath Ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 25th. Chairman Lin, committee members Zhang Ji, Ye Chucang, Li Wenfan, Bai Wenwei, Shakdorjab, Huang Fusheng, Wang Boqun, and others, as well as chiefs of the three departments and staff, totaling approximately 400 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and administered the oath. The committee members and others raised their right hands and recited the oath and the covenant. Chairman Lin then delivered an impromptu speech, explaining the important meaning of the oath. The ceremony was exceptionally solemn and respectful. The ceremony concluded with the speech.

### Large Fire on Huangpu Road in Shanghai: Part of Japanese Consulate Burned Down, Godown of the NYK Shipping Company and Japanese Police Station Reduced to Ashes; Rumored to be Arson by × Anti-War Elements

[Reuters, Shanghai, 25th] A warehouse of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) shipping company here suddenly caught fire at midnight last night and was completely burned down. The warehouse, located across the Suzhou Creek from the Japanese Consulate-General, contained a large quantity of cotton and chemical raw materials. After the fire started, the chemical raw materials exploded. Japanese troops immediately dispatched a team to surround the warehouse and prohibit pedestrian traffic.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 25th] Japanese officials are carefully investigating the fire at the NYK warehouse on Huangpu Road in Hongkou, suspecting arson because the warehouse contained newly arrived cargo. Senior Japanese military and government officials held an emergency meeting at noon today to discuss the matter. When the fire was raging at midnight, the French Consulate sent three fire trucks to Hongkou to assist. The fire was extinguished by 1:30 AM, but the smoke was very heavy. The amount of the loss is currently difficult to estimate. Japanese newspapers claim it reached one million Japanese yen and believe that the losses were entirely borne by the NYK. Documents from the consulate and police station were evacuated, but property could not be salvaged. However, some documents were damaged by wind and snow during transport. It is rumored that the police station of the Japanese Consulate has temporarily established an office at the New Asia Hotel.

[Shanghai, 25th] According to a Domei News Agency report, a fire broke out at the NYK warehouse on Huangpu Road in Hongkou at around 11:00 PM on the 24th, reducing the six-story brick building to ashes. At around 12:00 AM, the fire spread to the neighboring Japanese Consulate-General Police Station to the south. Boundary police, fire brigades, military police, marines, and garrison troops rushed to the scene to rescue. By 12:50 AM, the fire had weakened, but at around 3:00 AM, it flared up again, affecting part of the main building of the Japanese Consulate-General. It was quickly extinguished. A portrait of the Emperor was carried out by Japanese Consul Kato and moved to the Central Elementary School. It is rumored that all important documents from the completely burned down consulate police station were evacuated, and the cause of the fire can be determined to be a planned act by anti-Japanese elements. Therefore, Consul General Miura, Colonel Hirota of the Army, Lieutenant Commander Mitsunobu of the Navy, Lieutenant Colonel Igarashi of the Military Police, Deputy Director Akagi of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and others held an emergency meeting at the Consulate-General to discuss countermeasures. However, according to general observations, the act was carried out by Japanese anti-war elements.

### Shortest Air Route Between Europe and Asia: Only Five Days to Reach the Two Political Centers of China and the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The Ministry of Communications' Yuha (Chongqing-Hami) air route officially opened on the 24th. The Lanzhou, a large aircraft undertaking the first flight on the route, had a silver-gray fuselage and was quite spectacular. The aircraft was piloted by Chief Pilot Lin Jingdai and Co-pilot Chen Hongjia. In addition to a radio operator, the plane carried four passengers from the Soviet Embassy. The Lanzhou took off at 9:00 AM, stopped in Hanzhong overnight, and continued flying west on the 25th, stopping at Lanzhou, Liangzhou, and Suzhou before arriving in Hami that day. After stopping in Hami for half an hour, it turned back, stopping in Suzhou overnight that day, and continued flying southeast on the 26th, stopping at Liangzhou, Lanzhou, Xi'an, and other places before flying back to Chongqing. It is reported that after the opening of this route, it will connect with the Hami-Almaty route of the China-Soviet Aviation Company and, upon arrival in Almaty, will connect with the Soviet Union Airlines route. After the full route is connected, it will take only five days to travel from Chongqing to Moscow, making it the shortest route from China to Europe.

### × Refuses to Return Administrative Rights in Hongkou, Shanghai

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 25th] A Japanese military spokesman declared today that because the Japanese military has occupied Hongkou, the Japanese side currently has the right to administer Hongkou. When reporters questioned whether the Japanese military's occupation of Hongkou was an act of combat against the International Settlement, the Japanese military spokesman replied that the Japanese side believes this occupation does not violate the restrictions of the International Settlement and that the Japanese military is not prepared to occupy it permanently.

Churches in Lanzhou and Pingliang Also Destroyed by Bombing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] According to a dispatch from outside Hankou, the American Consulate General here lodged a protest with the Japanese side today regarding the bombing of the Yu-E Xinyi Association in Fancheng by Japanese planes on the 20th of this month. The protest stated, in brief, that the American side had provided the Japanese side with maps and documents of American church properties in various locations before June, but bombings of church properties continued to occur frequently.

There were no American casualties.

### From Laohekou to Xi'an, Part Two

— Special Correspondent: Geng Ya

Taking a car through a district that has this type of cave dwelling, with dangerous cliffs above and deep streams below, is truly a bit frightening. However, according to a friend, Mr. Wang Zhenhai, most of the bandits in the border area between Henan and Shaanxi have a connection and possess the spirit of Liangshan Marsh, standing up for the wronged, and the awareness of the Gelaohui Society to "Revive Han and Destroy the Manchus." In certain secret social strata, there is still a popular question: "How many large and small strands are there in the hand-held flower umbrella?" The answer must be: "Thirty-six large strands, seventy-two small strands, one hundred and eight pleats." This alludes to the story of the 108 heroes of Liangshan. Another question: "How heavy is the bundle (baggage) on your back?" The answer must be: "Two catties, thirteen taels, five qian, and four fen." This secretly refers to the lost Ming Dynasty Jiangshan, with two capitals, north and south, thirteen provinces, and the four seas and five lakes. There are many more secret languages containing the consciousness of "Revive Han and Destroy the Manchus" circulating in the Jianghu world. If we utilize them properly, we can certainly transform them into slogans for "Resisting Japan and Building the Nation" and implement them together.

Shangxian County is an important town in Shaanxi adjacent to the border area between Henan and Hubei. When the car arrived in the county seat, the streetlights were already on, and citizens came in droves. After getting in the car, we entered the county from the West Gate. There were many vendors on the side of the road, each setting up a paper lantern night market. From a distance, it looked like two bright pearls were placed on the side of the road. Slogans such as "Down with ×寇 (Japanese bandits)," "Down with ××× (Japanese) heads of state," and "United Front, Strive for Final Victory" were written on the lanterns. While admiring the lanterns, we also encountered two columns of lantern ball parades. However, although the vendors were as crowded as a swarm of bees, the goods they sold were only large pancakes, roasted peanuts, and boiled eggs with wine, only three or four varieties. The large pancakes, as big as dustpans, stood next to the lantern balls, not only tempting the appetite of passersby but also boasting the bumper harvest of the first phase of the war of resistance. We visited the county magistrate but did not meet him, so we returned to a hotel outside the city. The military police had already opened our luggage for inspection, indicating that the security here was also very strict.

On the third day, the car passed through the Qinling Mountains, a branch of the mountains guarding Xi'an. We drove uphill for forty li, and near the top of the mountain, the Chunxue Pass, the spring snow had not yet melted. It was also forty li downhill. We arrived in Lantian like a meteor. We could have reached Xi'an that day, but unfortunately, the car had a problem. We spent a lot of effort pushing and dragging it, and in the end, we still stayed in Lantian.

Although the conscription lottery in Lantian had already been held four times, there were still brothers with four siblings who had not finished the drawing. There were brothers with three siblings and two siblings. They were all rubbing their fists and preparing themselves. Since last spring ×, whether in cities or villages, there has been a surge in the number of marriages. Their goal is to have "offspring," so that "someone at home will be able to hold the flag" - this is a reflection of the preparation of these strong men for × work. However, they still use the wasteful ceremonies of large gifts and blaring suona horns from the past. In particular, when the newlyweds first enter the bridal chamber and drink the joint cup of wine, the groom must stand tall on the bed and circle above the bride, adorned with flowers, with his legs, as if he were a reconnaissance plane, spinning in circles. There are many rumors about the meaning, but these are all outdated customs that should be eliminated.

On the fourth day, we drove past thousands of acres of green wheat fields, enjoying the unique product of Guanzhong along the way - flocks of cranes soaring and dancing. In the long sound of the all-clear siren at noon, we arrived in Xi'an, the only ancient capital left in our country today.

At the same time, we also encountered a good opportunity, and we will be able to go to the Yellow River defense line in northern Shaanxi immediately.

### The New Army Established in Battle

— Zhang Changren

Special Dispatch from the Aviation Front in Mount Heng

The first phase of the war of resistance used space to buy time, consuming ×'s people on one side and covering the transfer of people and industries from coastal and riverside provinces to the interior on the other. The second phase of the war of resistance must not only buy time but also maintain space. It aims to obstruct × on one side and enable the rear to concentrate all manpower, material resources, and financial resources, strengthen the strength of the war of resistance, and refresh the offensive lineup on the other. The latter is the most difficult period in the war of resistance in China.

The most urgent requirement during this period is the establishment of a new army, and the most important task is also the establishment of a new army.

Resisting Japan and building the nation is the great cause of the entire Chinese nation. "Building the nation requires building the army." All the people of the country have unanimously joined various departments participating in the war of resistance under this supremely glorious banner; especially the young and strong, thousands of farmers and workers have put down their tools and formed a new army; thousands of educated youths are receiving training suitable for their respective branches of the armed forces. They are like metal ores just out of the tunnel, forged into steel in a large furnace, and have become a torrent of iron.

However, because × is better equipped than us and the extension of the battle line has broken new records in modern warfare, we need a superior force to confront × on the line. We also need more and more armed forces to occupy, expand, and secure areas. In fact, we are not allowed to have enough time to train new soldiers in the rear. We are not establishing a new army in battle.

Perhaps some people think that even regular troops who have been trained for a long time have suffered considerable losses in the past twenty months. Whether the new army, which has just grasped the rifle and is facing the battlefield for the first time, can bear the current heavy responsibility is still a question. This question, in principle, is not without reason, but in fact, it can be concluded otherwise.

Recently, the author found the following examples from conversations with conscription workers, new soldier training personnel, lower- and middle-level military officers who command new soldiers in combat, and the new soldiers themselves.

Why has conscription currently broken through the difficulties and can achieve inexhaustible results in troop dispatch? The fundamental reasons are: first, political mobilization has enabled the majority of the people to understand the meaning of survival only through resisting Japan. Second, political reform has enabled conscription to develop universally, reducing the worries of conscripts, and making reasonable and fair conscription methods simple and effective. Although there are still a small number of people who evade conscription, that is only a manifestation of the timidity of a few individuals. The number of people who avoid conscription due to poor conscription management is gradually decreasing.

New soldiers are often sent to the front line for reinforcement or combat after a very short time in the rear for training because the front line needs a large number of soldiers. In the past, a large number of new soldiers deserted in the rear. In addition to the reasons for evading conscription, the instructors still could not abolish beatings and scoldings, and military life was even harder than family life, which caused resentment among some self-respecting soldiers and soldiers from relatively wealthy families. Now, prohibiting beatings and scoldings has gradually become the absolute principle of new soldier training. Political work for new soldiers is also actively seeking to eliminate their emphasis on material and spiritual life, especially political awareness. This has enabled them to overcome their attachment to their homeland and their homesickness and bravely step onto the front line of resisting ×.

According to lower- and middle-level military officers, new soldiers who fled on the battlefield or were timid in combat are no longer found in the second phase of the war of resistance. Even if there are any, they are only a very small minority. Because the soldiers who have not deserted after being conscripted and trained mostly have the determination to sacrifice for the country, have long put life and death out of their minds, and because of the change in tactics, the advantageous terrain, and the extreme mobility, × is unable to exert its superior weapons. Due to the reduction of casualties and the demoralization of ×'s soldiers, the notion that new soldiers die as soon as they go into battle has been overturned, and the psychology of fearing × has been corrected. They know that fighting does not necessarily mean death, and the chances of survival are very high. × are not three-headed and six-armed, but just some guys who are more afraid of death than themselves. All of this has boosted the morale of the new army. For example, when new soldiers discover × traces in front of the battle, they often open fire without asking whether × has entered the range. After the experience of actual combat, they know that when × does not enter the firing range, it makes × accelerate to approach the firing range. If they wait for × to enter the firing range, then once they are suppressed by a tight fire net, they will scurry away. They know how to respond calmly. Also, regarding the use of poison gas by ×, in the past, new soldiers would know that it was poison gas as soon as they saw a smoke screen rising in front of the battle, and they would be greatly stimulated mentally. Now, even if × uses poison gas, they know how to use the terrain to temporarily avoid it in high places. (In the first phase of the war of resistance, every soldier of × had a gas mask, but now an average of only one gas mask is available for every four or five people. Therefore, they often poison themselves due to wind direction.) As for artillery shelling or aerial bombing, our side suffered considerable damage and was severely threatened by gas when defending positions. Currently, because of the use of deep deployment, not focusing on one line or one point, its power has been greatly weakened. It is common for × artillery to fire hundreds of rounds, while our side only suffers a few casualties. ×'s air force is also unable to find targets, even if they carry out indiscriminate bombings, our losses are also small. The timid psychology of the new soldiers no longer exists, and killing × and achieving results has become a certainty.

Because the new soldiers are not trained enough in the rear, they are trained day and night in front of × after entering the battlefield. A certain unit on the south bank of the Xiu River is practicing shooting in front of ×. Even all training other than formal training is held in front of ×. They are growing rapidly. The lower-level officers, such as squad leaders, platoon leaders, and company commanders, pay special attention to "being a person," and although there is a difference in rank between them and the soldiers, they are affectionate and sincere, like brothers or teachers and friends. When a soldier who is new to the battlefield is performing guard duty, the squad leader or platoon leader often accompanies him to the front and teaches him how to be vigilant and how to retreat, and says, "Don't be afraid here, I will come to see you later." After less than three months, they gradually become brave and alert sentries. Examples like this are countless. In terms of clothing, because the need and the supply are very different, a small number of new soldiers often do not have uniforms, leggings, or straw sandals when they first arrive at the front. They know the country's difficulties and have no complaints. The original brothers want to give them their old military uniforms, tear their torn military uniforms into leggings, and share their old shoes with them. This spirit is the essence of the new army.

The new army still needs to be strengthened in training in terms of skills, but in terms of morality, it is purer than the soldiers of the recruitment era. They are truly the people's army, able to get along well with the people, and there are few problems in maintaining military discipline. At the same time, because an army without political consciousness is bound to be a rabble, the military authorities are injecting the blood of politics into the new army. Currently, each regiment has ×× political workers. In the near future, there will be × thousand workers serving as political instructors in each company. This new blood is our force for counter-offensive, and it will bring to bear its great spirit to destroy the current ×!

What is reported here is only a small part of the infantry aspect. We know that China is establishing a new army in many ways. But from here, we can extrapolate to others. Knowing these things, we can be sure that the sentence "The final victory is ours" will never be empty.

### Movement to Stop German Aggression: Negotiations Underway Among Nations, U.S. Secretary of State Issues Statement of Reproach, Italy's Future Status Draws Attention

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today to condemn German aggression, saying: "Recent changes in Europe are a real threat to world peace. I am truly surprised by this new evidence of international illegality, and it is becoming increasingly clear and undeniable that we must cooperate with law-abiding and well-behaved countries to establish effective economic relations. The United States is determined to continue to strive to strengthen world peace through the rule of law and economic relations, and in fact, only economic relations can create peace." Note: Hull has just returned from a vacation in Florida.

[Associated Press, London, 24th] The "Stop Hitler" movement is now deeply mired in diplomatic negotiations, and there are also differences of opinion among nations. Germany is rapidly moving towards complete control of Europe. Hitler's arrival in Memel with his fleet is like a chance occurrence in ancient times. Since Germany and Slovakia signed a 25-year agreement, Germany has been able to establish important military bases within Slovak territory. All parties believe that this matter has three meanings: First, it forms a vanguard for Germany's invasion of Poland, which is the most important point. Second, it places Hungary under German control. Third, it strengthens Germany's various important military bases for invading Romania. The completion of the German-Romanian agreement allows Germany to develop industries and exploit Romania's resources. Germany's aggressive actions have clearly tended towards the Black Sea. Since the Italian King issued an edict, people here have attached great importance to Italy's position in the new European situation. Since Hitler annexed Memel, Germany has had a tendency to encircle Poland, threaten Lithuania and the Baltic countries, and invade Romania. Therefore, it is believed that Poland, in this environment, is unlikely to join the anti-Hitler group. This week, anti-aggression countries have been using diplomatic means as much as possible to discuss ways to deal with Hitler, but Hitler is still disregarding everything and actively carrying out actions to encircle the small countries of Central and Eastern Europe. However, the eyes of those countries have turned to Italy. Italy has been exhausted after invading Abyssinia and participating in the Spanish war and sincerely desires peace. The general opposition to Britain and the Soviet Union joining hands is afraid that after Britain wins over the Soviet Union, it will become hostile to Italy and reduce the hope of peace. Therefore, they advocate turning to Italy to make peace in order to maintain peace. According to some other opinions, the Italian King's edict is actually a prelude to Italy's request for financial assistance from Britain, and this request is the price of Franco-Italian reconciliation.

The Danzig Issue Will Become More Serious

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th] Hitler returned here yesterday afternoon. Hitler's speech in Memel, in which he said, "The unfair treatment of our people must be revised. I believe that the revision work can now be considered largely complete," has become the center of discussion in political circles here. Political circles have not given any explanation to this statement. At the same time, in view of the recent situation, whether the Danzig issue will become more serious has not been explained, but it is believed that important issues have been resolved one after another, but the unfair treatment of the Treaty of Versailles is still considered not completely corrected. Political circles here are convinced that Danzig's return to Germany is only a matter of time, and the date of its resolution will be compared with the issue of the "Polish Corridor." The solution to the "Polish Corridor" issue will start from the negotiations on the German-Polish non-aggression treaty. As for the other aspect of "revising other injustices," the issue of demanding the return of colonies is crucial. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Goebbels are also said to be following in Goering's footsteps and taking leave to go to Italy. Madrid and Valencia may be occupied by Franco's troops a few days later. At this time, Mussolini may make his colonial demands to France. According to the "German Digest," the solution to the Franco-Italian dispute will be to re-establish the balance of power in the Western Mediterranean and make Spain the fourth great power in the Mediterranean.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 25th] After Hitler arrived here by train, he immediately rushed back to the Fuhrer's residence. The crowds cheered for Hitler's achievement in breaking the treaty. After the United States prepared to stop German aggression, Germany seemed to want to insist on its political and economic aggression plan. Officials announced that the German-Belgian trade negotiations, which began on March 17, have now ended perfectly, and customs cooperation in Lithuania is also being planned. The Latvian government has planned to levy a special tax in the country in order to carry out military expansion and construction.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th] German Aviation Minister Goering, who is currently resting in Saint-Remo, recently made a speech to a reporter from the Italian People's Daily, saying in brief, "I hereby declare again that no matter what accidents happen in the future, Germany will definitely help Italy, no matter what the price. I will go to Rome to pay homage to Prime Minister Mussolini and then go to the Libyan colony in North Africa to visit Governor Balbo."

### Spanish Peace Agreement Expected to be Concluded

[Associated Press, Valencia, 28th] According to officials close to the government, rumors that the peace agreement has been reached and that Franco will enter Madrid this Saturday are completely unfounded. However, according to reliable sources, the delegation of the National Defense Council, which conducted talks in Burgos, has now returned to Madrid, expressing that the process is very good, but the government has not yet issued an official bulletin, and the government is still discussing it. The delegation will also return to Burgos soon to continue negotiations. According to another reliable but unconfirmed report, Franco's delegation recently held discussions with government officials here, but a general peace agreement can be concluded in a short period.

[Reuters, Burgos, 24th] Rumors that the delegation of the Republican government arrived in Burgos and signed an agreement with the Franco government to surrender Madrid have been officially denied.

[Associated Press, Burgos, 25th] The rumor from the French border that Franco's troops had entered Madrid on Friday afternoon has been officially denied here.

[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] According to senior Franco officers on the French border, a representative of the government army arrived in Burgos by plane yesterday and offered to surrender. The only condition was to find a way to allow 17,000 government army personnel to leave Spain, but they did not agree to surrender Valencia and the other nine cities. Franco refused to accept, so he is about to begin a counter-offensive.

### British Aviation and Shipbuilding Industries: Government to Provide Assistance

[Reuters, London, 24th] Labour Party Member of Parliament Mr. Kirkwood believes that when he raises questions in the House of Commons on the 28th regarding the aviation and shipbuilding industries, the response from the Secretary of State for Commerce, Mr. Stanley, will imply that the government has subsidies to assist the aviation and shipbuilding industries. He told reporters today, "The Secretary of State for Commerce, Mr. Stanley, has asked me to raise this issue. If he did not have an important answer, he would not have asked me to raise this matter."

### Hungarian Military Actions: Germany Intervenes; Ceasefire on Slovakian Front; Rumors of Hungarian Withdrawal

[Associated Press, Bratislava, 25th] After Hungarian military aircraft bombed the towns of Kiežmark and Spišská Nová Ves, inhabited by Germans in eastern Slovakia, it is generally believed that the war situation has undergone drastic changes. Hitler is now fully aware of this conflict and seems to be considering taking decisive measures. The German government here lodged a second protest with the Slovakian government on Thursday, and the contents of the protest were also sent to Ribbentrop to be forwarded to Hitler. The leader of the German population, Karmasin, rushed to Vienna and then to Berlin to report.

[Associated Press, Slovakian Capital, 24th] According to recent reports arriving from eastern Slovakia, Hungarian forces are now beginning to withdraw from Slovakia. The temporary ceasefire on the Slovakian front appears to be influenced by suggestions from Berlin. Berlin advised Slovakia not to begin the counteroffensive originally scheduled for this morning, in order to give Hungarian forces the opportunity to reorganize and withdraw. The withdrawing Hungarian forces stated that their plan to occupy southern Slovakia had been prevented by Berlin's diplomatic intervention. It is reported that Slovakian troops are still closely defending the border.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] According to a report from the Havas Agency in the Slovakian capital, Hungarian troops have launched an offensive against Slovakian strongholds. Slovakia also claims to have entered Ruthenia. The two armies clashed in the rain throughout the day. Slovakian aircraft heavily bombed Michalovce, where oil depots and armories were destroyed.

[Associated Press, Slovakian Capital, 24th] Official sources have announced that Slovakian and Hungarian troops continue to fight fiercely today. It is reported that Slovakian troops have repelled Hungarian forces, and both air forces are very active. A communique states that Hungarian forces have heavily bombed various areas in the Slovakian rear, with seven bombers attacking Kiežmark and Spišská Nová Ves. However, the extent of casualties is currently unknown. The situation in the Slovakian capital remains tense, with the general population fearing the possibility of Hungarian aircraft bombing the city.

[Haitong Agency, Hungarian Capital, 25th] The local official newspaper, "Esti Ujság," believes that the Hungarian invasion of Slovakia is justified. The newspaper stated that Hungarian forces occupying border areas would create a natural border that is suitable for both countries' geographical situations and shared interests.

### Italian Troops Not Withdrawing from Spain; Agreement Reportedly Reached in Rome; Franco Willing to Cooperate with Fascists

[Rome, 25th] Well-informed sources here say that Mussolini and Franco have concluded negotiations, agreeing that Italian troops in Spain will remain in the country after the Spanish Civil War ends. Under the provisions of this new agreement, Italian troops will remain in Spain and will not be withdrawn. Mussolini will also send military advisors to Spain to "strengthen" the Spanish army. If this report is true, then Mussolini is not respecting the promise he made to Britain and France that Italian troops would be withdrawn immediately after Franco's forces achieved victory. Mussolini has repeatedly stated that the purpose of the Italian army in Spain is to ensure that the Spanish Republican government does not achieve victory. According to reports from Franco's government, three representatives of the Spanish Republican government have arrived in Burgos, intending to arrange for Madrid to surrender peacefully before the weekend.

[Associated Press, Burgos, 25th] The French ambassador to Franco's government presented credentials to the government. Franco replied that he vowed to work loyally towards friendly cooperation between France and the Spanish Revolutionary forces.

### Mussolini to Deliver Speech Today

[Reuters, Rome, 24th] Sunday is the day of celebration for the Fascist Party, and Mussolini will deliver an important speech, but the exact time of his speech has not yet been announced. It is generally speculated that it will begin at 10:15 AM (standard time).

### Soviet Red Army Conducts Large-Scale Exercise in Western Border Region; Voroshilov Personally Presides

[Central News Agency, London, 25th] According to the Warsaw correspondent of The Times, the Soviet Red Army has begun large-scale exercises in the western border region, stretching from Leningrad in the north to Belarus in the south. Senior officials did not wait for the closing of the Moscow Communist Party Congress but returned to their posts to preside over troop movements. Red Army Commander-in-Chief Voroshilov has arrived in Leningrad, and air defense exercises have been conducted in the Soviet western border region in recent days.

### First Anglo-Soviet Talks Proceed Well, Content Not Released; Hudson Grateful for Warm Welcome

[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson held his first talks with Soviet Foreign Trade Commissar Mikoyan this afternoon, lasting four hours. The talks proceeded extremely smoothly, but the content was not released. Negotiations will continue tomorrow morning. After completion, Hudson will have lunch with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov.

[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] Foreign Trade Commissar Mikoyan (a close confidant of Stalin) returned from leave early to personally welcome British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and the entire economic delegation. The delegation arrived in Moscow today. Hudson told Reuters reporters, "We are extremely grateful for Mikoyan's sincere attitude. The welcome we have received is beyond friendship." Hudson hopes to begin initial discussions today to promote Anglo-Soviet trade relations. At the same time, due to the influence of the European situation, these negotiations also have political importance.

### Over $510 Million Army Budget Approved by U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the army's budget of $513,000,000. This bill is $13 million more than the appropriations bill passed by the House of Representatives a few weeks ago.

### Germany's New Financial Plan: Advance Levies on Industry and Commerce

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Today, the German government announced a new financial plan to pre-collect taxes from industry and commerce. The purpose of this measure is to enable the German government to pay its extraordinary expenses. The pre-collected taxes will be issued by the government as tax certificates, but they will not pay interest. Official sources claim that this measure is intended to cover the expenses of provinces, cities, railways, post offices, highways, and other judicial organs. Industry and commerce must comply with the order to pay and take these tax certificates, and issuing public bonds is only an exception. From May of this year, previously maturing public bonds will be abolished, and income tax will also be increased again. All those with annual income above 2,400 marks must pay additional income tax. The value of these tax certificates will increase over time, increasing by 1.5% after three years. German Finance Minister Reinhardt said that Germany's tax revenue was 6 billion marks in 1933 and has increased to at least 7.5 billion marks in 1938. It will increase further in the next two years. Reinhardt stated that Germany's national expenditures are significant, and raising funds in this way does not require the government to pay interest. These expenses will be shared by the people of the country over decades.

### British Immigration Federation to Send Experts to Northern Rhodesia to Investigate Immigration Possibilities

[Reuters, London, 24th] The Colonial Office has announced that the Immigration Joint Committee (adjusting the affairs of refugee resettlement) is preparing to send a team of experts to Northern Rhodesia to investigate the possibility of resettling refugees there. The investigation team includes Sir Donald Cameron (formerly served in India), Colonel Nicholas (served in Kenya, handling refugee resettlement affairs), Norcock (former Assistant Secretary of the Palestine Government, currently Secretary of Uganda), Kittermaster (former Provincial Commissioner of Northern Rhodesia), and Ksenofontov (assisting the United Jewish Appeal). The investigation team may also go to Nyasaland to investigate the possibility of resettling a small number of farmers there.

### Japan Courts Germany, Returns Caroline Islands; Germany Considers Recapturing Jiaozhou Bay

[Associated Press, London, 25th] The "News Chronicle" here reports that Japan is now planning to return the Caroline Islands to Germany to express friendship and set an example for countries holding former German colonies. However, this is conditional: if Germany obtains all of its colonies from Britain and France, these islands will still be returned to Japan.

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Semi-official political circles are currently discussing the possibility of Germany regaining a colony, namely Jiaozhou Bay. Jiaozhou Bay was occupied by Japan during World War I and then returned to China in 1922. Now it is back in Japanese hands, and Japan is quite willing to transfer it to Germany. The only difficulty at present is how to hand it over without affecting German-Japanese friendship.

### Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief Cries Out: "Rather Fight to the Death Than Surrender Without a Fight!"

[Reuters, Kaunas, 24th] Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis called on his troops today, saying, "Rather fight to the death than surrender without a fight!" He also stated that if Lithuanian territory is threatened, he would never surrender without exhausting all means of resistance.

### Poland to Reorganize Government, Broaden Base to Cope with National Crisis; Three Classes of Reservists Called Up

[Reuters, Warsaw, 24th] Poland is currently undergoing a government reorganization, broadening its base to cope with the national crisis. Future new cabinet members will include peasant party leader Witos, who was sentenced to imprisonment and fled abroad. During his exile, his party members consistently refused to participate in the cabinet. It is generally believed that Witos will be formally pardoned.

[Haitong Agency, Warsaw, 24th] It was announced here tonight that Poland has called up three classes of reservists in the past two days, but this has not yet been officially confirmed. The former Czech envoy to Warsaw left here for the United States today.

Short Commentary

### Illegal Collusion Between Germany and Japan

A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 24th stated that German political circles are discussing the possibility of Germany recovering its colony in the Far East, namely Jiaozhou Bay. Jiaozhou Bay was occupied by Japan during World War I and returned to our country in 1922. It fell into Japanese hands again two years ago. Now, in order to strengthen its collusion with Germany, Japan is even considering handing it over to Germany. Its illegality and shamelessness are naturally condemned by the world. Recently, Japanese × has intensified its collusion with Germany and Italy, and voices for the establishment of a Japanese-German-Italian military alliance have risen again. On the one hand, it is also bending its knees to seek peace with the Soviet Union, which is practicing communism. It can be seen that the Japanese aggressors, in view of the fact that a long-term war will lead to the collapse of Japanese × imperialism, are indeed preparing to further oppress our country, attempting to quickly "conquer" our country with maximum force. However, the anti-communist and pro-peace advocates are still shamelessly covering up this shameless behavior and aggressive conspiracy of the Japanese aggressors, which is something that every Chinese person with a sense of justice should not tolerate.

### Burning Debt Movement

According to news from Hong Kong, the Seamen's Union is scheduled to hold its second burning of national defense bonds and provincial defense bonds on the 29th of this month. Participants also include the Amateur Friendship Society, the Chinese Clerks Association, Zhenhua Middle School, etc. I wonder what the few shameless people who profit from national debt (see the article "The Storm of Deducting Salaries to Buy Prices" in the Hong Kong News section of this newspaper on the 24th) think about this.

The Hong Kong burning debt movement was first initiated by the Seamen's Union, and various groups and individuals actively responded. Together with the one-dollar debt repayment movement, it is a high expression of the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and can also be said to be a concrete manifestation of the spiritual mobilization of overseas Chinese. The burning debt movement can reduce the government's debt and strengthen the economic strength of the war of resistance; the debt repayment movement can enhance the government's credit in the international community and stimulate people's enthusiasm for supporting the government's unity in the war of resistance. We should not only pay the greatest respect to the overseas Chinese who actively participate in this movement but also spur ourselves to encourage our relatives and friends to participate enthusiastically!

### Memelland

— Translated by Dong Ping

Open a map of Europe, and you will see a narrow strip of land; its northeast leans on Lithuania, its southern border adjoins East Prussia, and its west is the raging waves of the Baltic Sea. That is Memelland, which is attracting worldwide attention today.

A brief history of Memelland: It originally belonged to Germany, was seized by Lithuanians by force after the war, and today it has been seized back by Germans by force.

Although Memelland is only a small place, it has been a key issue in previous international disputes. When Central Europe was in crisis last year, Chamberlain paid a visit to Germany and also discussed Memelland with Hitler at length. Whether today's facts are the consequences of that conversation, who knows.

After the end of the Great War, Memelland was under the control of the Allied powers, with French troops stationed there to maintain order. At that time, Lithuania had just broken away from Russian domination and was growing up after the war.

By 1923, armed Lithuanians repeatedly harassed the French troops stationed there. The French commander protested to Lithuania on the one hand and appealed to the Allied powers for help on the other. The British fleet immediately sailed to the Baltic Sea.

But it was too late. Several thousand Lithuanians drove away two hundred French soldiers and formally seized Memelland. The following year, Lithuania promulgated the Memelland Code, allowing Memelland a portion of autonomy. Britain, France, Italy, and Japan also agreed to guarantee Lithuania's territorial integrity and Memelland's autonomy. This situation was then considered to be generally recognized. In fact, this decision by the Allied powers was really a forced cover-up because Lithuania's territory, Vilnius, had been forcibly occupied by Poland, and they had also reluctantly acknowledged it.

In the years that followed, Memelland was entirely in the world of Lithuania. Many place names and street names were changed from German to Lithuanian, hoping to prevent German residents from longing for their homeland. This seems to have been quite successful. In those years, there was indeed not a single pro-German voice. At least, the demagogic expert Hitler had not yet come to power at that time.

By 1933, not long after Hitler came to power, the people of Memelland began to long to return to the embrace of the German Empire. Propaganda and advocacy sprung up like mushrooms after the rain.

By 1934, Lithuania, seeing the situation was not good, sent a large army into Memelland, arresting more than one hundred German leaders and key members, accusing them of plotting to restore Memelland to Germany. Four people were sentenced to death, and hundreds were sentenced to long-term imprisonment.

Naturally, Hitler immediately launched a strong protest, with a tense atmosphere. Lithuania had to soften and commuted the death sentences to imprisonment.

The current "Memelland Hanren" Neumann was one of those sentenced to death. He was later changed to twelve years in prison, but he was released after only four years. In the middle of last week, he was able to wear a dark blue uniform and knee-high boots to flaunt his power in Memelland.

Neumann's opponent is the high-cheekboned Lithuanian President Smetona, who, like Poland's General Pilsudski and Czech Republic's Dr. Beneš, is a revolutionary hero who liberated his country from foreign oppression. His target is Russia.

When he was young, he was expelled from school for refusing to pray in Russian and using Lithuanian. When he entered St. Petersburg University, he became a member of the Lithuanian independence movement.

In Memelland, Smetona does not have much power, because in the local council, the German party occupies 24 of the 27 seats. They all adopted the Nazi salute, cheered Nazi slogans, and organized Nazi stormtroopers.

The air in Memelland is always uneasy. Conflicts between Germans and Lithuanians are constantly occurring. In a major conflict in June last year, the two sides fought on the streets for two hours, resulting in the death of a sixteen-year-old Nazi youth and the injury of more than fifty people. This disturbance made Europe very nervous at the time, with a sense of impending doom.

Later, the storm dissipated—only on the surface.

Last September, after Chamberlain visited Germany, a member of the British House of Commons asked about the situation in Memelland. Chamberlain's answer was: Hitler said that if the Lithuanian government can always abide by the Memelland Code, he would be very happy for Memelland to maintain the status quo.

Pay attention to this sentence: "If the Lithuanian government can always abide by the Memelland Code..." It is easy to find an excuse, even if it is said that the Lithuanian government can no longer abide by the Memelland Code. At least, the residents of Memelland already regard themselves as an oppressed minority.

After the Munich Agreement sold out Czechoslovakia, Hitler personally said that he no longer had other territorial demands. But a few days later, Berlin semi-officially said: This does not mean that the head of state has forgotten his deep concern for Germans outside Germany.

Then in October, Berlin began to attack Lithuania, saying it was oppressing Memelland Germans.

Later, things became clearer. The vice-leader of the Memelland Nazi Party, Berti Le, even gave a speech to the Memelland press: "The separation of Memelland from its German homeland violates the wishes of the Memelland people. Now we all demand to return to Germany. The upcoming election is an expression of public opinion; the demand for Memelland to return to Germany is unstoppable."

As expected, the result of the election was that the Germans swept through like fallen leaves, achieving complete victory.

Hitler's move to incorporate Memelland into East Prussia will not encounter much resistance. Memelland is destined to follow the fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia.

Finally, it went that way. —Translated from the 24th edition of a Spanish newspaper—

### Southwest Import and Export Center: Hong Kong-Shantou Relations Growing Closer; Large Quantities of Inland Produce Shipped from Shantou to Hong Kong; European and American Goods Enter Mainly Through Hong Kong and Shantou

Since the change in the situation in South China, the land and water transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been affected and cut off. The maritime route, which used to go from Hong Kong to Hankou, has shifted to Yunnan-Burma-Vietnam, but the main sea route to Shantou in eastern Guangdong has been maintained throughout. Goods between Hong Kong and Shantou flow smoothly as before. Due to the urgent needs of the times, Hong Kong-Shantou relations are becoming increasingly close. Whether in commerce or economics, they have been greatly expanded compared to before. Evolving to this day, it has become the main center for the exchange of internal and external goods. Agricultural, mining, and local products from provinces such as Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan are concentrated in Shantou in large quantities, then transferred to Hong Kong, and then shipped to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia in batches. The European, American, and Southeast Asian goods, products, and factory products sold to the mainland are also concentrated in Hong Kong, transferred to Shantou, and then transported to Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces through the Shantou highway network. Under this situation, not only is the Shantou market prosperous and active, developing a prosperity rarely seen before, and all industries are thriving day by day, but also the benefits to Hong Kong are also huge.

Domestic Grains Shipped in Large Quantities from Shantou to Hong Kong

The most important of these is the supply of daily necessities for residents of Hong Kong, nearly 90% of which rely on Shantou. Since the outbreak of the war of aggression by × army in South China, although there is still a line of communication between Hong Kong, Macau, and the interior, due to the heavy obstacles in land and water transportation in the interior, all vegetables, livestock, and other local products cannot be transported to Hong Kong via Macau. When the war in Hainan broke out, the supply of various grains from that area was also cut off. The huge amount of daily necessities needed in Hong Kong had to rely solely on Shantou. Therefore, in the past three months, the quantity of vegetables, peanuts, soybeans, sesame, potatoes, wheat, chickens, ducks, and livestock transported from Shantou to Hong Kong has been increasing day by day. Each shipment arriving in Hong Kong contains more than tens of thousands of dan of the above-mentioned grains. Fortunately, the supply of grains in Hong Kong is not affected by the impact of the situation, and the source is entirely dependent on this. As for domestic products such as tung oil, ore, and other industrial products, most of them are also transported from Shantou to Hong Kong for export. According to people in the Hong Kong-Shantou trading houses, due to the route, Hong Kong and Shantou currently hold the reins of our country's export routes. Yunnan-Burma-Yunnan-Vietnam are still behind.

Imported Goods Shipped from Hong Kong to Shantou

Because the highway network of the seven provinces in the Southwest terminates in Shantou, since the completion of the widening of the Shaoguan-Shantou highway, the connection between the southwestern provinces and Shantou and Hong Kong has been further enhanced. The products of the provinces are transported via Shantou and Hong Kong. It is more convenient than the Yunnan-Burma-Yunnan-Vietnam trunk lines. Whether it is products from Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, etc., taking the Shantou route to the sea shortens the journey by dozens of times compared to the Yunnan-Vietnam route, and the cost is naturally saved. The cost of various products shipped from Shantou via Hong Kong to destinations such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States does not increase excessively, and the sales volume is not affected. Therefore, domestic merchants mostly transport various local products for export via the Shantou-Hong Kong line. As for European and American goods imported from Hong Kong into our country, because the sea route between Hong Kong and Shantou is twice as short as the route between Hong Kong and Vietnam or Hong Kong and Burma, a large number of goods are shipped from Hong Kong to Shantou and then transferred to various provinces in the mainland. The volume of foreign goods from various countries transported from Hong Kong to Shantou has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. Therefore, the business of Hong Kong and Shantou trading houses is thriving and expanding day by day, and the products produced by Hong Kong factories and transported to the southwest provinces via Shantou are even more huge.

Shipping Companies Increase Hong Kong-Shantou Liners

As Hong Kong-Shantou cargo transportation becomes increasingly prosperous, foreign shipping companies in Hong Kong believe that the opportunity for the development of the Hong Kong-Shantou line has come, and increasing the number of liners on this route is necessary. According to shipping companies such as Butterfield & Swire, in order to adapt to the demand for Hong Kong-Shantou cargo transportation, they are implementing the addition of ships traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou. It is estimated that there are currently ships directly sailing to Shantou from companies such as Dodwell & Co. In addition, ships from companies such as Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, and other companies traveling on various Southeast Asian routes also take Shantou as a central station, directly reaching ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., before heading south to Hong Kong. The ships of the Java Shipping Company, which travel between Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, and Japan, also pass through Shantou. Now, with the great increase in the volume of goods traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou, various shipping companies are paying close attention to competition in their own industries, hoping to seize the right to transport goods. Therefore, in addition to striving to expand the number of liners traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou, various companies are also competing for direct routes between Shantou and places such as Siam and Singapore. The situation is already becoming acute. Because the volume of products transported from Southeast Asia to China is increasing greatly due to the high demand, and there is also a huge number of domestic products transported directly from Shantou to various parts of Southeast Asia, Shantou has become a very important part of our sea route, providing no small amount of assistance to overseas relief during the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. At the same time, the conspiracy of × people to blockade our sea route is also being strongly attacked and completely shattered.

### ××××××! Japanese Goods Imported into Hong Kong Increase Greatly: Exceeding 1.75 Million Yuan in January; Not Including Those from Other Places and Smuggled in

Japanese goods in the Hong Kong market gradually disappeared due to the impact of the war in the autumn of 1937. By the spring of 1938, the value of goods had dropped from a peak of over 7 million yuan to over 1.267 million yuan. This degree of reduction was equivalent to that during the January 28th Incident. Afterwards, it suddenly and gradually rebounded, and then decreased again to over 880,000 yuan in September. After this period, the value of goods sold to Hong Kong has remained at around 1.2 million yuan. In January of this year, the import of Japanese goods increased to 1,751,228 yuan.

### Most Japanese Yarn Imported

Among them, building materials accounted for 26,811 yuan, Chinese medicine accounted for 54,585 yuan, coal accounted for 115,000 yuan, and food accounted for over 110,000 yuan, including fish (55,500 yuan), potatoes (2,780 yuan), vegetables (1,590 yuan), spices (12,500 yuan), and shiitake mushrooms (36,300 yuan). Paper products accounted for 54,800 yuan, and fabrics and cotton yarn accounted for over 1,197,000 yuan, including cotton yarn (144,800 yuan). In the sundries category, hats accounted for 5,161 yuan, socks accounted for 2,100 yuan, shirts accounted for 3,965 yuan, undershirts (vests) accounted for 2,071 yuan, towels accounted for 2,600 yuan, handkerchiefs accounted for 6,380 yuan, bedsheets accounted for 3,900 yuan, along with other daily necessities, totaling over 129,000 yuan.

### Total Import Value Still Difficult to Calculate

The above statistics are based on officially imported goods inspected by customs. Goods transported through other methods and locations are not included. Various items are necessary for our daily lives and are often overlooked. General speculators often take advantage of this. Although the statistics for February have not been released, the total amount has been confirmed to exceed that of January. British goods, on the other hand, show signs of decline. According to reliable sources in the business community, the statistical figures are difficult to represent the total value of Japanese imports. Furthermore, the import of certain countries' goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong is enough to strike a blow to local Chinese merchants in Hong Kong.

### Acceptance and Transportation of Imperial Airways Mail in Hong Kong: Airmail to Non-British Territories Transported to Border Areas, Then Transferred to Destination

Since Hong Kong joined the complete airmail agreement for first-class mail in British territories, all first-class mail sent from Hong Kong to British territories is transported by Imperial Airways planes, which is faster than before, and senders feel it is more convenient.

### Nautical Feat: Foreigner Huino-Kuroff Plans to Sail a Yacht to Australia; Encountered a Storm in the Philippines; Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday to Go to Shanghai and Try Again

Mr. Huino-Kuroff, a foreigner from Shanghai, has worked on steamers on the Yangtze River for many years, so he has a wealth of navigation experience in the river. On February 1st, he sailed a Chinese-style yacht with a crew and ten curious people, planning to sail to Australia from Shanghai. At that time, the Shanghai newspapers reported on the matter in detail. When he arrived at the coast of Northern Luzon in the Philippine Islands, the entire ship was in ruins. At the same time, Huino-Kuroff also believed that there were too many people on board. According to Huino-Kuroff, the ship was only capable of carrying seven people, but this time it carried eleven people, which was excessive. Furthermore, the ship was in ruins, so he decided to abandon it. He recently returned on the President Pierce from Little Luzon and arrived in Hong Kong yesterday (the 24th). He will transfer to a ship to return to Shanghai during the day. Huino-Kuroff told reporters yesterday about his voyage: "We left Shanghai on February 1st. Two days later, we were attacked by pirates. The pirates were divided into many yachts and opened fire on us from all sides. We also carried two long guns and fired back. Our ship was hit by three bullets, but no one was injured. The ship was equipped with a motorcycle engine and traveled faster, so we were able to escape safely and continued to sail to Little Luzon. We encountered storms twice near that place, and everyone was seasick, but no accidents occurred. It was our luck. When approaching the Philippines, we got lost again. Fortunately, we saw mountains in front of us and moved forward. It was getting dark, so we anchored near the coast. At night, the waves rose greatly, and the anchor was ineffective. The ship was washed ashore by the sea. We tried our best to take care of ourselves and our belongings. At that time, the wind and rain were heavy, and the waves were surging. Although we repeatedly tried to escape from the ship with our lives, we were unsuccessful. The hull continued to hit the rocks and was completely destroyed. The other people on board are still in the Philippines, including two dancers from the DD nightclub in Shanghai. They plan to raise 1,000 Philippine pesos and buy another yacht to sail to Borneo, New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand."

It is reported that the economic problems have been resolved, and construction will begin as soon as a suitable site is found.

### Manufacturers' Inspection Team to Go to Macau in Mid-April: Will Hold Work-Relief to Help Macau Refugees

Because of the prolonged war of resistance, there are more than 10,000 refugees in Macau waiting to be fed. It is difficult to alleviate the situation without revitalizing industry and providing work-relief. Therefore, Liang Houyuan, a representative of the Chinese in Macau, proposed and sent a letter to the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, inviting them to organize an inspection team to Macau to plan the development of industry. The Macau government has expressed sympathy for this and has promised to provide convenience. Furthermore, products produced in Macau can enjoy preferential tax rates when sold in Portuguese territories. For this reason, the Manufacturers' Association submitted a proposal to the board of directors a few days ago and resolved to invite the Director-General, Han Sui-xuan, to go to Macau to handle everything. Mr. Han has now returned to Hong Kong to report to the association. According to Mr. Han, this trip has been successfully negotiated with Mr. Liang Houyuan, the Chinese representative in Macau, and the main principles for establishing factories have been discussed. The results are very satisfactory. As for the trip of the inspection team, it will be around mid-April. After Representative Liang negotiates with leaders from all walks of life in Macau, personnel can be sent to Hong Kong next week to discuss and decide on all matters.

### Establishment of Children's Convalescent Home; Inauguration Ceremony Held at Holy Confucius Church Yesterday;

If we do not quickly revitalize its decline, we will have no way to protect the survival of the nation. The establishment of the Children's Convalescent Home is based on this. Currently, refugee children are gathering in Hong Kong, and charitable organizations have been trying to accommodate them. However, there are many talented people among them. We have now selected dozens of people, provided them with free education, and provided them with meals and accommodation. We will teach them the principles of Confucius and vocational education to promote our country's inherent culture and enable them to have noble morals and strong physiques in the future. Each of them will use their skills and intelligence to serve society and the country." Subsequently, Medical Supervisor Situ Yongjue, Doctor Jiang Faxian, General Manager Cai Zengji, Cao Shanyun, and Vice President Tang Yingkeng successively gave speeches. Commemorative speeches from all sectors were read. Finally, Vice President Lei Yin-sun gave a thank-you speech. The meeting was then adjourned.

### Chengdu Bishop Hoad Talks About the Development of the Yunnan-Burma Road in Hong Kong; Hoad Had Surveyed the Route from Yangon to Yunnan

Bishop Hoad of Chengdu recently came to Hong Kong for business. Yesterday, he spoke to reporters about the situation on the Yunnan-Burma Road. According to him, the Yunnan-Burma Road is of great importance to both China and Burma. It has now become an important international route in the world. In the past, merchants from both countries often traveled and traded on this route. However, it was rugged and difficult, and it took many days. After the improvement and development, it has become a way for China's western fighters. The proposal to build this road did not start today. Knowledgeable people have been talking about it for fifty years, but the timing was not ripe. At the beginning of the year, Hoad rode in a Red Cross ambulance from Yangon to Kunming on this road, and was very impressed by the inspection. From Yangon to Mandalay, the first section is 400 miles, and the road is flat. After reaching Mandalay, continue north, and twenty miles away, it is already steep. From here to Kunming, the road runs over the tops of mountains. Twenty miles ahead is the Shan State of Lashio, which is the end station of the Burmese railway. It is estimated that the highway from there to the Chinese border was completed in the 19th century, but it was only for military use. The railway from Mandalay to Lashio had to be compensated for the cost of construction, so the fare was particularly expensive. From Mandalay onwards, the road is extremely winding, and the axles that pass through cannot exceed one ton in weight. As for overweight vehicles, they can pass through another road. This road is jointly managed by the Chinese and Burmese governments. Without special government permission, free passage is not allowed from Mandalay to Lashio and Kunming. From Lashio to Kunming, the road is subject to inspection. Fortunately, we had notified the governments of both countries in advance, so we were not hindered in any way and received their sincere guidance and special passes. The transportation matters on this road are all managed by the Southwest Transportation Company.

### Flowers of Blood

— Hu Chunbing

—— Reflections on the Writing Process of a Revolutionary Historical Drama

Paying the utmost respect to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the struggle to establish the Republic of China for the National Revolution!

Drama is a popularized record of the act of struggle; without struggle, there is no drama. All great battles in history are the best material for plays, and all great dramas are manifestations of human strife (rather than reproductions).

The link in history of Huanghuagang, which moved heaven and earth, is precisely the most humane and the most flesh-and-blood reality. It is the most dramatic. However, it is a complex historical process, containing deep historical legacies and the relationship of social contradictions at the time. It contains diverse personalities and rich emotions. Only drama can express that great spirit, which is a historical tip and a social crux. But precisely because it is complex, diverse, and full of intrinsic meaning, the writing process of such a historical drama is also very complicated and tortuous.

Twenty-two authors from the Guangdong Drama Association once engaged in this experiment with collective effort. Although the results may not be necessarily good, in the various difficulties discovered, they understood many things they did not know before. At least, in the sense of historical analysis, this is a good method of self-education for drama workers.

The completion of the four-act, six-scene historical drama "Huanghuagang" by twenty-two people within three days is still a miracle in the history of Chinese spoken drama. None of us participated in that battle, nor were any of us contemporaries. Our grasp relied on science—the most correct way of thinking for understanding social history. First, we discussed the position of the "Huanghuagang Uprising" in the history of national revolution, the reasons for its inevitable occurrence, its attributes, its inherent weaknesses, and its significance for today's war of resistance. After reaching the same conclusion, we began to have the rudiments for selecting materials and the criteria for tailoring. Secondly, we began to collect materials. General history, revolutionary history about the narratives of the March 29th Uprising, special history of March 29th, books studying the social situation at the time, martyrs' posthumous works, descriptions of each martyr... as well as paintings, poems of the time, were all materials that we had to study and absorb, in addition to regular common sense and knowledge.

We began to turn this event into a story with a beginning and an end, with flesh and blood. Among these were main plots. The rest were embellishments and insertions. The main plot was nothing but the struggle between the revolutionary camp and the counter-revolutionary camp. The result was the revolutionaries' failure, so this is a historical tragedy.

This failure is one of the glorious milestones on the road to success. It can not only allow later generations to learn the lessons of revolutionary failure, but also show that it was a powerful cause for the birth of the Republic of China on October 10th. Therefore, what dominates the whole play is by no means the inertia of defeatism, but the overflow of the great revolutionary spirit; in an inevitable setback, it sets off the inevitable success of the revolutionary future. We wrote about the inadequacy of the revolutionary camp's organization, heroism, the principle of fighting to the death, and even the prevailing of generous sentimentalism. We wrote about the mistakes in strategy and the sabotage of internal traitors, but mainly we wrote about the greatest revolutionary emotion, also the greatest of human emotions in drama—sacrifice. We wrote about the incompetence and debauchery of the Manchu Qing rulers, and their delusion of "rather giving it to foreigners than to domestic slaves," but we also wrote about their internal contradictions (which was one of the reasons for their ultimate failure), and their unity and superiority in dealing with revolutionary forces (which was the reason for the setback of the March 29th Revolution). Everyone has their own personality, which is a typical trait of a part of the people and a symbol of a phase of society. Everyone has their own contradictions in their personality, but many people will have their commonalities.

The perspective on events, the composition of stories that conform to historical facts, and the creation of personalities full of motive are the first and foremost steps in writing revolutionary historical dramas. The collective creation of Huanghuagang can serve as an example. At least a bad example.

The Huanghuagang incident is a flower opened by the blood of heroes, and the Huanghuagang script is a flower of drama opened by an era of blood.

### Talks on Stage Technology

— Lu Dun

5. The Art of the Actor

"Selflessness" and Half a Self

The art of the actor is to play a person with oneself, to express the body and soul of the character in the play with the actor's own body and soul. Because of this, some people advocate that when the actor is engaged in the creation of performing arts, they should completely deny the existence of the self and must achieve the so-called realm of "selflessness," to "spiritually disguise," in other words, to forget oneself and transform one's entire personality, even one's body, into the personality of the character in the play.

This theory is valid in principle. It is necessary to do so to become an artistic performance. However, to complete this work, it is impossible to deny the existence of the actor's own personality. We do not oppose the highest achievement of performing arts, which is that the actor dissolves the self into the character's personality. However, the completion of this work is also the actor's own artistic creation, which is the result of usual training and cultivation, and cannot be achieved simply by discarding the existence of the self.

The main purpose of the actor's performance on stage is to convey the emotions that must be conveyed, thereby arousing the audience's sympathy and completing the resonance effect of art. However, the emotions conveyed are not "the emotions of daily life." They are not real, but false, artificially created emotions, and the appropriate expression and verisimilitude of these false emotions inevitably require a kind of power to control and manipulate.

Because emotions must be controlled and manipulated, as mentioned above, the actor must be able to control his attention, able to become the master of all his expressions and actions, and the only master is the actor's own brain. Therefore, the actor's own existence cannot be entirely denied.

Therefore, the actor's work on stage is dualistic; it has two personalities. What is expressed is the personality of the character in the play, but behind this illusory personality lurks "half a self." This invisible, latent half-self is like the puppeteer, controlling and manipulating everything, constantly creating the character's personality. In the process of creation, it is also analyzing and criticizing. When performing a laugh, it is also analyzing and criticizing whether the laugh has reached the required degree. Therefore, performing arts is inherently contradictory, and the actor's self combines the creative subject and object.

The creation of performing arts lies in this unity of contradictory opposition. The congruence of the actor's creative emotions and the actor's own intellectuality are mutually restrictive. Therefore, to sum it up in one sentence, it is still Stanislavski's famous saying: "Use willpower to express inspiration." The creation of the actor's art is to express the character's personality as much as possible, but with half a self lurking inside as the master of creation.

In addition, some actors deliberately use various methods to induce their true feelings. For example, when playing a drunkard, he really drinks a lot of wine, so his performance is "real"! Yes, it is "real," but it is no longer art. It is no longer acting, but simply experiencing real life. Moreover, this method can easily lead to an uncontrollable situation at any time.

In conclusion: The purpose of the actor's art is to express the character's personality as much as possible and to convey the emotions that must be conveyed. But these are not the emotions of daily life. They are non-real emotions selected by the actor from experience or imagination and that can be controlled and manipulated by the actor's own self. It is the sense of reality of creation that can be expressed by willpower. (To be continued)

### The Performance of "Huanghuagang" in Guangzhou

— Li Shulun

Last year's performance of "Huanghuagang" in Guangzhou was a combination and expression of collective strength, composed of more than three hundred drama workers and twenty-odd large and small troupes.

Over the course of the year, I still clearly remember the beginning and completion of the "Huanghuagang" performance work, which only took place in ten days. Precisely because of the shortness and urgency of the time, the play was written in separate acts and required to be submitted within two days. After one day of overall sorting and mimeographing, the distribution of the script began.

Following the resolution of the script issue, the entire performance work unfolded in an even more cumbersome and tense manner. At this time, the Education Association became our temporary workshop. Strips of wood, cloth, paints, and all stage equipment were mixed and piled up. From every clear morning to late at night, batches of drama workers engaged in tireless labor. Some put aside their usual affairs, and some took leave from school. All of them sacrificed their own selves to respond to an urgent call and gathered in the set-making workshop. Among them, the achievements of the children, in particular, can never be erased: they pre-spent their work capacity beyond that of adults, occupying the majority of the work, forgetting their age, forgetting to eat, and desperately working alongside the older generation. It was by relying on their spirit and courage of struggling without regard for anything that strips of wood were pieced together into frames and pieces of cloth were cut into gray sheets. In short, an exciting atmosphere circulated in the Education Association, with the sound of nails entering wood ringing throughout the day and night.

At the same time, a large number of actors gathered in the same venue and rehearsed separately by act. It was so hurried and tense, and diverse tasks were carried out at high speed.

By the first night of the performance (the 28th), a small portion of the audience was already quietly waiting for the show to begin. The people on stage were even more frantically producing the set. It was not until the last pillar was painted and a gray sheet was hung up that "Huanghuagang" was able to be represented figuratively in front of more than four thousand audience members.

Because "Huanghuagang" is a play of the masses, there was a complete arrangement for the venue in advance. When each act reached the peak of its climax, a united and orderly chorus and impassioned speakers would be used as a powerful interlude to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Thus, everyone was acting as a member of the masses, exciting themselves and equally exciting others. Finally, in response to the call of "those with money give money, those with strength give strength" for fundraising, there was inevitably a huge and satisfactory harvest.

Extending all the way to the third night, the strength of all the staff was excessively exhausted, but the courage was even more advanced. Therefore, after extreme fatigue, there was a brave decision: that is, to extend the performance to another last night specifically for the workers.

For this, we endured excessive fatigue and rejoiced. We stopped sleeping in the deep night and divided the responsibility for mimeographing more than four thousand tickets among several troupes. The next morning, we personally distributed them to many workers' groups. Therefore, the last night was the most fatal night for lack of work, and also the most feverish night for excitement.

On this night, our drama comrades issued impassioned words for the workers, and the workers responded with enthusiastic applause, presenting us with bright banners, which represented their enthusiastic support for the war of resistance work!

For this performance, we dare to guarantee that every night more than four thousand audience members were aroused by the heroic struggles of the revolutionary martyrs to produce a surging emotional response. Moreover, they believed that the free soul of the Republic of China would rather die than be humiliated, and they would more firmly strive for the final victory of the war of resistance.

Secondly, from this performance, the government has noticed the effect of drama, and for the first time practiced the joint cooperation of both sides. It is precisely because of this that it was able to obtain unprecedented social influence.

Thirdly, in the common work, more than four hundred drama comrades were mobilized, laying the foundation for a unified front in the Guangzhou drama circle.

Fourthly, the later generation of drama workers inherited the legacy of the martyrs and used the spirit of fearless hard work as a commemorative gift, which the drama fighters should eternally maintain.

On the other hand, we undeniably accept the criticism and lessons of this work:

Firstly, due to the length of the script and the slowness of the opening and scene changes, the continuous development of the dramatic story and emotions in each act were unnaturally interrupted; secondly, due to the hasty preparation, each department felt that there were imperfect places in the performance.

However, this touching, unfinished masterpiece stands before us, asking us to gather a more powerful force to reproduce it!

Trends in drama movement

### "Huanghuagang" Performance Postponed to Next Month

The grandest national defense mass drama "Huanghuagang," jointly prepared for public performance by more than forty drama groups in Hong Kong, was originally scheduled to be performed on the nights of March 28th and 29th at the Taiping Theatre to commemorate this great memorial day of the Republic of China. Moreover, it has received the cooperation of the Joint Relief Committee for South China Refugees from all walks of life in Hong Kong, which promised to allocate 1,000 yuan for performance expenses in addition to the theatre rental. However, because the time is too rushed, it is feared that ticket sales and all preparations will not be in time, so it was temporarily decided to postpone the performance to around the fifteenth of next month, so that in addition to publicity, more relief work can be done. Now, various drama groups have begun to step up rehearsals daily at the Hainan Vocational School in Kowloon, and are also preparing all scenery and costumes. In order to provide practical assistance, the Relief Committee also specially selected Lu Guomian, Liu Qingbo, Ye Lanquan, Lin Peisheng, Li Jianfeng, Lu Fu and other seventeen people from the committee's standing council to form a "Huanghuagang" Charity Performance Special Committee at its fortieth general meeting yesterday to step up work. With the joint efforts of more than forty drama groups in the Hong Kong drama community, coupled with the call and assistance of almost all major social groups in the Hong Kong Relief Federation, we believe that the performance of "Huanghuagang" will definitely have unprecedentedly great achievements in terms of both publicity and fundraising.

### From the Mainland

— Tang Ruoqing

My experiences in the mainland over the past few months have given me many new feelings and summaries; returning to Hong Kong with a burning heart, how happy I am!

Indeed, I feel very fortunate, because in the short period of time since I left Hong Kong, Hong Kong's drama movement has made significant progress; people no longer ignore drama, and as a result, the atmosphere of drama has gradually thickened; performances of dramas with contemporary significance, whether in terms of quality or quantity, have also increased; at the same time, the emergence of drama group organizations and the increase in spoken drama audiences have also progressed together; the efforts of newspapers and magazines to advocate for the emerging drama movement can also be clearly seen from the increasing number of "Drama and Film Supplements"... All of this shows that the drama movement is unfolding rapidly in Hong Kong, which is truly the result of the efforts of drama workers, seniors, and partners in or traveling to Hong Kong, as well as the support of cultural figures who sympathize with the drama movement! I, who lack cultivation in drama, should be very pleased to see this gratifying phenomenon; at the same time, I should be very ashamed that I have not been able to contribute even the slightest bit of weak strength to this work!

This sacred war of resistance has brought so much benefit to our Chinese nation! In the months I returned to the mainland, I saw many amazing innovations and progress in various aspects in Changsha and Guilin. Just in terms of drama work, which I am most familiar with, I have gained many new understandings and indelible impressions: the spirit of hard work and endurance of drama workers, the dynamic of vigorous development, the enthusiastic emotions of all levels towards drama, the close connection between military and political organs and cultural groups for drama work, and the practical and universal nature of the war of resistance drama penetrating into the countryside and approaching the masses, truly make us have to rise up and work even harder for the entire movement by abandoning all selfish opinions! Naturally, the environment in Hong Kong cannot be compared with the mainland, so in the work, there will inevitably be various difficulties. However, in any case, I at least hope that we will complete the following two tasks in the shortest period of time:

First, drama performances on stage should progress in terms of both quality and quantity. We must enable drama to have more contact with the audience, and at the same time, the result of each contact must give the audience a good impression and a deep emotion. Only in this way can the spoken drama movement have a foundation in the local area.

Second, we must make drama as popular as possible and hold more public, free performances in various ways, so that it does not become the exclusive property of the upper middle class and ignore the more important working masses.

At the same time, I hope that drama comrades in Hong Kong can have the opportunity to communicate with drama workers in the mainland from time to time, and often accept the situation of domestic activities and progress, so that the Hong Kong drama movement can take consistent steps and work in harmony within the possible scope.

I am very lacking in all kinds of cultivation, and my understanding of drama is also very superficial. I dare not judge whether everything I have said above is correct, but I can only say that it is a little hope from my burning heart. In addition to vowing to do my best to the drama movement of our great era, I sincerely ask for the instructions and encouragement of seniors and partners!

Joint Performance by All Hong Kong Children's Drama Troupes

In order to commemorate the April 4th Children's Day and raise funds for refugee children, all Hong Kong children's drama troupes have specially decided to hold a joint public performance of the three-act national defense drama "Long Live Children" on Children's Day (this play is a collective creation of the Ant Children's Drama Troupe, written by Zuo Ji). The participating troupes include: Ant Children's Drama Troupe, Pioneer Children's Drama Troupe, Xuezhenhui Children's Troupe, Qingnian Tongleshe Children's Troupe, Central Girls' School, etc., and are actively working these days. And have obtained Ouyang Yuqian, Cai Chusheng, He Ailing, Wang Xiaoying, Wu Hanzhen, Fang Yuyan, Hu Chunbing, Situ Huimin, Lu Fu; Zhu Baishui and other gentlemen as the conference consultants; Zuo Ji, Xi Feng, and Zhuo Ming as the directors, stepping up rehearsals. The date and location of the performance have been set for the morning of April 4th at the Central Theatre, and Wang Xiaoying, He Ailing, and others have helped with the theatre rental. The purpose of this performance is to provide relief to refugee children, but due to the urgency of time and the difficulty of selling tickets, it has been changed to a free donation within the venue. As for the performance expenses, donations will be solicited from all walks of life separately. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will be generous in helping to establish this brand-new children's drama movement!

The Red and White Drama Troupe Will Perform the Famous Play "Dance of Demons"

The Red and White Drama Troupe was organized and established three months ago. They are a group of young drama workers from Dongguan County, who have established a long-term war of resistance drama movement in Dongguan County in the past. Now, under the leadership of the troupe leader Lu Keming, they have moved to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, they intend to inherit their past spirit of hard work. On the one hand, they are experimenting with the professionalization movement of drama, and on the other hand, they are also working hard to hold performances for various charitable organizations. Now, their first work has begun, which is to hold a charity performance for the YWCA's Sanguang Troupe to provide relief to refugees. The play to be performed is Chen Bailu's four-act famous play "Dog," also known as "Dance of Demons." The location is Kong Sheng Tang; the date is the evening of April 8th. For this work, they are now rehearsing day and night.

Their lineup is: troupe leader Lu Keming, troupe members include Hu Ruihua, Li Shulun, Xu Guoyu, Ling Ke, He Mantang, Li Zihao, Li Shibing, Ye Zhongzhi, etc. for males; Zhong Ying, Qian Lang, Liao Lulu, Yin Anna, Yuan Huiying, Yin Qi, Xu Fang, Zhou Manlu, etc. for females.

Following this fundraising charity performance, Xia Yan's two famous plays, "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" and "A Year," Xu Qi's "Moon," Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People," etc., will be performed.

Their troupe address is: 2nd Floor, No. 6, Shenzhen Old Street, Mong Kok, telephone 50387.

### Grand Tournament of Football Heroes: Li Hua Cup Final Today; China United's Strength Suggests High Hopes for Victory; Held at the Hong Kong Stadium at 4 PM

(Special dispatch from our newspaper) As Qingming Festival approaches, wind and rain add to the melancholy. We "seek refuge in a secluded paradise" but lament being unable to return home.

With nothing to do, watching a football match is the best option. However, continuous spring rain has dampened the atmosphere. May the heavens not inconvenience the footballers; I truly fear the performance of the Li Hua Cup final match will not be spectacular enough.

This trophy was donated by the now defunct Luo Hua Company. It was first established in 1925. In the past thirteen years, the Western Mercantile team has won the most times.

As the donor passes away, the footballers also experience growth and change. Recalling past events fills us with emotion. Nevertheless, the company has left something behind for posterity, a lasting memorial, so even in demise, they leave behind a "name for generations".

In this year's preliminary round, the Western Mercantile team eliminated the Army United team, entering the championship contention and reigniting their ambition to compete for supremacy. As for the China United team, in the preliminary round, Li Huitang exerted minimal effort, leading a group of young players in a match against the Navy. As expected, they emerged victorious in the battle, securing the right to contend for the championship.

Today's match determines the victor. This is a major event in the football world, and the performance of "two famous teams" is something everyone appreciates. Once they take to the stage, it will surely create a sensation. Let's hope that heaven is kind and shows a "smiling face," so that this good occasion in the football field is not marred by rain.

Ying Tang is not "on the mountain" often this year, but when he is, he carries a strategy from Jinmen, and he will surely sell his skills. I believe that today, he will also "not spare his feet" and win back this "heavenly favor" for China United.

In the China United lineup, everyone is a talented individual, and they are also very experienced. Even if they are marching in the rain, it doesn't matter. With experience, they can control the ball and manage effectively, which is a significant advantage. Moreover, their established coordination is even better.

The eleven players in the Western Mercantile team are also experienced and cannot be underestimated. However, compared to China United, they are lacking in many aspects, so based on my prediction, China United has a greater chance of winning.

Wu Liezhi is a new internal defender, and his skills are quite good. However, yesterday during the Kowloon Club's match against South China South, he was hit by Deng Guangsen's "ballistic," injuring his foot. Today, he may not be on the front lines.

If they are playing in the rain, they will inevitably have to dribble more. The field is wet, and the ball is heavy, so quick passing will not be easy. Today, China United's front line should mostly use flanking attacks between the internal and external wings, and not constantly take the central breakthrough approach. Because running is tiring in rainy conditions, the usual tactics may not be as effective. To achieve victory, remember to act according to the situation.

Jia Da is very cunning in internal rushes, often striking and causing the opposing forward to be offside. Gu Yitang should be wary of the traps set by Bai Jia when he advances.

Gao Shannu and Zuo Zhi are formidable figures. The China United defenders must find a way to pin them down, preventing them from colluding and invading our territory. If we can restrain them, there will be fewer problems later.

After the match, we invite the wife of the Colonial Secretary Smith (President of the Football Association) to present the award. Let's see if this "treasure" falls into the hands of China United or is obtained by the Western Mercantile team. (Football Field Tycoon)

### Kowloon Club's Home Unbeaten Record Finally Broken by South China South; South China South Often Has the Advantage in the Rain; Victory with a 3-0 Score, Raising High Hopes for the Championship

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at 3:30 PM, I boarded the Tai Sing ferry and met "Wang Heng" and Luo Nanke (veteran volleyball players from South China University). After some chatting and laughter, we soon arrived on the other side. In the No. 3 "bus," I also met "Football Affairs Officer" Zhou Runnian, leading a "small team" to the battlefield.

Upon arriving at the battlefield, I saw the players from the Division B teams South China and Guanghua competing in the wind and rain, covered in mud as if they were "soy sauce ducks." I also saw a large gathering with "shelter" on the side facing the sea. This was a scene of playing in the rain.

The Division B match ended with South China South narrowly winning 2-1. Having passed this hurdle, they have reached the final stage. Let's see if the warriors of the coming week can emerge victorious. If they win two more points at that time, the Division B championship, which they haven't obtained for a long time, will be South China's prize.

As the Division B soldiers withdrew, the Division A soldiers entered the field. South China South's lineup was missing a central commander. Domestic fans, upon seeing this, asked each other, "Where did Feng Ershu go?" He is not ill. Someone saw him playing billiards at the South China billiards room on the eighth floor of the Chinese Mercantile Bank in the afternoon, full of energy. Why did he suddenly withdraw before the battle? There must be something strange going on.

Since Ershu was tired and reluctant, Li Enliang was forced to fill the gap. Domestic fans, seeing this situation, were worried, thinking that South China South was not giving it their all in such an important battle. How could they win? Moreover, the Kowloon Club, the "local snake," is not easy to defeat. General passenger cars consider that stadium a dangerous place. Could South China South win without exerting full strength?

However, there is no need for you to worry; South China South has its own methods. Look, they scored a goal in less than a minute after the start of the match. So fast, it was unexpected, and it shows the strength of South China South. Three minutes later, they broke through another barrier, solidifying their victory. Their championship demeanor is truly extraordinary.

As a result of the decisive battle, South China South won by three goals. From this, it can be seen that South China South was constantly gaining momentum and controlling the entire field, ultimately breaking Kowloon's home unbeaten record. This masterpiece is a reward obtained through excellent skills.

Yesterday I said that if it rained, it would be very advantageous for South China South. This is because Kowloon relies on the advantage of being on their home turf, but if it rains, the field and ball will be wet, and their usual steps will be disrupted. Naturally, there will be no advantage on their home turf. The Kowloon players' strategies are not as effective as South China South's athletic training. Therefore, I dared to predict that South China South was very likely to win. And indeed, what I said came true.

He Li's absence due to injury was Kowloon's fatal wound. If he had played, he might have reduced the number of goals conceded. However, although Kowloon had the advantage of being on their home turf yesterday, they were unable to use it, and their defeat was deserved. Even if He Li had been there to guard the goal, he would not have been able to save it.

Our side's goalkeeper position was again held by Bao Jiaping, protecting "South China." But in "peaceful times, his talents are difficult to display," because there were not many dangerous situations in front of the goal, he was quite relaxed. However, he did deflect a corner kick in the first half, showing his wonderful skills.

Among the frontline players, Li Zhaorong and Deng Guangsen were the most swift and decisive. Zhaorong is good at dribbling and maneuvering, and Guangsen is fast and energetic, excelling in variations. As for Zuo Weidou, he was slow and missed opportunities, with nothing good to say. Li Enliang, leading for the first time, was not yet capable, but he was able to work hard and strive for the future to become a great player.

The defenders were all competent, and their defense was solid, giving the opposing forwards a feeling of the difficulty of the Shu Road.

Although Kowloon lost, there is one thing that makes me feel that these local snakes are still formidable. Even though Wu Liezhi was injured in the first half and reassigned to the left wing in the second half, with Pei Er retreating to defend inside, weakening the defense, they were still able to defend to the death and avoid conceding more goals, showing their strength and tenacity.

…Football Field Tycoon…

First Half

[Half a Minute] After the referee blew the whistle to start the match, South China South launched an offensive, advancing on all five fronts. Bei Lishi panicked and lost the ball. Zhaorong stepped forward and lightly swept the ball into the goal in front of the goal [1-0].

[Three Minutes] Zhaorong engaged in close combat, familiar with the road, circling left and right, and executing a brilliant shot. Jie Fuli pushed it away in time, only conceding a corner kick. Douwen crossed it, and Yingqi headed it in, scoring another goal [2-0].

(Fourteen Minutes) Kowloon counterattacked. Tiansheng and Shaohan quickly set up defense. Yishiwuwen crossed from the sideline. Maxweilu jumped and headed but missed. Then, Xiaonuos fired from the right, and Jiaping quickly pushed it away, the ball landing in the wilderness, barely avoiding danger. This was the most dangerous moment for South China South in the entire match. However, although Kowloon had the advantage of a corner kick, the result was unsuccessful.

(Twenty Minutes) Douwen was assisted by Zhaorong and Enliang twice, infiltrating Kowloon's territory, but ultimately the shot was inaccurate and went into the air.

(Twenty-Eight Minutes) Bei Lishi attacked on the forward line, infringing on Rongzhao, and was penalized with a free kick. Rongzhao took the kick and passed it to Guangsen. Guangsen shot with all his might. Wu Liezhi raised his foot to block, and with a bang, he fell to the ground, injured his ankle, and left the field. Guoyachen was reassigned to the wing, and Yishiwuwen returned to defend.

Second Half

The battle reopened. Wu Liezhi, limping, was reassigned to the left wing, Zeng Eryuan to the left inside, and Yishiwuwen retreated to the right forward. The original lineup was greatly changed.

With South China South often gaining momentum, Zhaorong and Enliang advanced together. Approaching the enemy's goal, Zhaorong fired, quickly and powerfully, but unfortunately missed.

(Twenty-Nine Minutes) Guangsen single-handedly attacked the camp. Pei Er was unable to intercept and was cut through by Guangsen. Enliang and Douwen flew in together. Douwen shot the ball into the net from the corner of the goal, making it [3-0].

(Thirty-Three Minutes) Tiansheng and Guowei switched positions, feigning attacks, aiming to confuse Kowloon. Kowloon was also unable to catch up, and their attack slightly slackened, allowing South China South to attack again. However, they gained nothing more, and ultimately won 3-0.

### Men's Basketball: South China Defeats Police; Three Matches Held Today

In the open men's basketball tournament, the first match last night was between Division B teams Li Xing and Chunfeng. The former was last year's Meidu Ding champion and a top team in Division B. However, the team's performance was abnormal last night, leading by only 22-18 in the first half. They gradually returned to normal in the second half, and ultimately defeated Chunfeng 40-20. The second match was between Division A teams Police and South China. One was composed of Chinese and Indian police officers, and the other was last year's inter-school champion. The former's players were all tall and strong, winning with strength, while the latter was known for their agility and skill. As a result of the match, South China won 36-24. South China's ability to win was based on the team's close coordination, excellent positioning, and short-range passing. Therefore, although the opponent was strong and powerful, their strength was ineffective. Moreover, during encirclement attacks, they feinted attacks and shot at the basket with lightning speed, catching the opponent off guard. Although Huang Zuode did not perform exceptionally well last night, the overall performance did not diminish. Zhong Jian and Chen Zanfu's interceptions and passes were skillful. The rest of Liu Senrong, Li Junsheng, and others also fulfilled their duties through teamwork. The police, on the other hand, lacked flexible cooperation and accurate shooting, which was their fatal flaw.

Throughout the match, South China always had the upper hand. Zhong Ling first scored a free throw, opening the scoring. Chen Zanfu and Lan Maoqia also scored baskets one after another, initially creating a score of 11-2. As Chen Jinkui and Zeng Tingkai displayed their skills, they caught up, but still trailed South China 8-14. Afterwards, the game gradually became tense, with each side scoring. At the end of the first half, South China led 15-10. In the second half, Liu Senrong, Zhong Ling, Chen Zanyin, and others from South China were unstoppable, scoring six consecutive goals. The score became 24-10. Then, the police tried their best to counterattack, with Chen Jinkui and Babao Singh making significant contributions. However, they lost to South China 21-32. After playing for a while, South China finally defeated the police 36-24.

In the final match, International faced Chunhe. International was strong and powerful, with accurate shooting. Although Chunhe tried their best to resist, they trailed 16-24 at the end of the first half. In the second half, International's momentum increased, and Chunhe gradually found it difficult to cope. As a result, International won 54-28.

Today's Schedule

Today at 3:30 PM, there will be three more matches held in the gymnasium. The first match will be between Division B teams Pei Ying and Hua Xiong. The strength of both sides is equal. The second match will be between Division A teams Eastern and Guangda. Eastern has many good players, and many of them are athletes who have participated in the World Games. Although Guangda is a newly emerging team, most of them are young and energetic, and they are exceptionally agile in battle. Eastern will have to fight hard to secure the final victory. The last match will be between Division B teams Overseas Chinese and Red Star. Overseas Chinese has a stronger attack than Red Star, and should be able to win. The schedule is as follows:

Division B A

Pei Ying vs. Hua Xiong 3:30 PM

Division A

Eastern vs. Guangda 4:30 PM

Division B B

Overseas Chinese vs. Red Star 5:30 PM

### First Round of Film Introductions: The Citadel

Andrew Manson is a newly graduated doctor, working as a doctor's assistant in a small town. The work is heavy and the pay is low. Moreover, the doctor's wife is stingy and harsh. Manson often feels hungry. Fortunately, he meets an obscure doctor, Denny, a practitioner who is willing to study hard. The two hit it off and immediately become friends. They discover that many villagers suffer from fever due to unsanitary canals, but the authorities do nothing to repair them. Helpless, they resort to a desperate measure: blowing up the canals with dynamite at night. The authorities are forced to rebuild them, and the fever is indeed reduced and eliminated.

Manson saves the life of a newborn infant and receives a small monetary reward. When the doctor's wife finds out, she becomes furiously angry, accusing him of embezzling public funds. He can no longer tolerate it and decides to leave, finding another job in a mining area. However, that job requires a doctor with a family. He already has someone in mind, but has not yet expressed his feelings, let alone married. In order not to miss this opportunity, he falsely claims that he is about to marry his fiancée and temporarily gets the position, promising to take his family to work in a few days.

The woman he loves is Christine Barlow, a schoolteacher in the town where he worked as an assistant. He feels it is time to propose marriage. As a result, he gets both a wife and a job, happily setting up a practice in the mining area. Denny gives him a microscope.

He discovers that many workers suffer from coughs due to excessive dust in the air. After studying many people's sputum, he writes a report and submits it to medical journals, which is praised by medical authorities. At the same time, he is loyal to his duties, going down into the mines to rescue people, and is also supported by the local workers. However, he is too loyal to his duties and incurs the dissatisfaction of Chinkin, a magnate among the workers, for refusing to sign sick leave certificates. One day, Chinkin, falsely accusing Manson of animal abuse, rushes into his laboratory, destroys his months of hard work, and passes a resolution prohibiting him from raising guinea pigs for experiments. Manson argues forcefully, explaining that his experiments are for their benefit, but ultimately fails. Unable to continue his experiments, he leaves the mining area and goes to London to open a practice.

Business is bad in the city, and he is heavily in debt. Eventually, the microscope is also taken away by the creditor. Just then, he is suddenly called to a wealthy family to treat a woman. He then meets her. She is a wealthy socialite. After she recovers, she invites Manson to go out. At this time, Manson gradually abandons his sacred profession and spends his days with her and some pleasure-seeking noble doctors, living a wealthy life. Marrow is dissatisfied with his absurdity, but cannot dissuade him.

Denny, full of hope, comes to London to work with him to do something to help sick children, but is met with a cold shoulder. Filled with anger, he drowns his sorrows in alcohol. One day, after getting drunk, he rants and raves. On the street, he is hit by a car and injured. It would not have been fatal, but it is a pleasure-seeking doctor negligent of his duties who sends him to his death. Manson loses his good friend and wanders the streets, witnessing the suffering of poor children. The words of his deceased friend still echo in his ears, and he suddenly realizes.

For taking a sick child he recognizes out of a poorly managed and negligent hospital and giving it to a lung specialist for treatment, he causes a great backlash from the medical association, because that lung specialist is not a member of the medical association. Although the girl is cured, he cannot escape the slander of being a quack. Manson speaks passionately, denouncing the negligence of the doctors. After he finishes speaking, he and Marrow leave hand in hand, continuing the unfinished work of their deceased friend.

The story is adapted from the famous novel by A. J. Cronin. Directed by King Vidor, starring Robert Donat and Rosalind Russell, it was the top of the ten best English-language films of 1938.

The whole play focuses on Robert Donat's Dr. Manson, and Robert plays the role with ease. His British accent, every word heavy and powerful, is easy to be moved by after listening to a few of his speeches, used to the light and fluent American tone. The performance of a young doctor who has just left school with lofty ambitions to serve the people, is tempted by the environment, tends to pleasure, and finally strives to extricate himself, is extremely profound and moving.

Rosalind has fewer scenes, but plays her role well. Ralph Richardson, who plays Denny, has even fewer scenes, but he is very good.

The dialogue is plentiful without being dull, and it can grab the audience's heart. The direction is handled properly, such as the section where Manson proposes to Marrow, which is light and interesting. The final ending is abrupt, but concise and powerful, leaving people wanting more.

### Analysis of Fan Mail

— Mostly Slick —

In foreign film circles, every slightly famous male and female star often receives many fan letters. Each star receives dozens or hundreds of letters every day, and even needs to hire a secretary to handle the work of receiving and sending letters.

However, the motives of these fans for writing to the stars are often pure, but there are also many slick characters. In fact, they are not as infatuated with their stars as we imagine.

Denham Studios in England was founded by famous producer Alexander Korda. The studio once conducted a study and statistic of fan mail and found the following facts:

(1) Only 20% of fan letters are sincere and earnest.

(2) 10% of the letters are requests for the stars' autographs and photos.

(3) There is a group of people who like to come up with their own ideas. They write to the stars giving various criticisms and advice, recommending what kind of stories, roles, and costumes, etc., are suitable for their personality. This type of letter accounts for about 10%.

(4) Begging the stars for financial assistance accounts for more than 15%. This is also because general moviegoers believe that movie stars are rich, which leads to this idea. Another 10% of the letters ask the stars to answer questions about love or to solve difficulties in their careers. Because they admire them too much, they simply regard the stars as encyclopedias.

(5) 10% of the letters are from certain friendly groups or organizations, asking the production company to allow them to use a certain star's name for publicity.

(6) There is also a type of speculator who writes to the stars asking them to invest in their new businesses (most of these are difficult to recover). This type accounts for the largest number of letters, as many as 30%.

When Merle Oberon was affiliated with the company, many speculators repeatedly wrote to her (at that time, she was the most popular British actress), preparing many investment opportunities for her, saying that a newly invented powder could sell well in the market. In addition, they also wrote to other stars, saying the same thing, wanting to unconditionally give them the opportunity to get rich.

However, it is no wonder that so many fans are speculating. In fact, many businesses are founded by movie stars, such as many dance halls, clothing stores, mobile libraries, document agencies, and actor agencies, etc. In fact, they are very attractive, which aroused the interest of fans, and everyone is busy writing letters to turn the stars' minds.

### From Connection to Work Development

— Xiang Yu

The bugle of the united front has long been sounded, and the manifestation of unified action has already existed. Now we have this action. This means that we should go one step further and actively promote practical work. We do not need to deny that we are in a special environment and our activities are subject to special restrictions. As far as our scope of activities is concerned, we should not hide ourselves and make detours to achieve our goals, but we cannot be like Gautier, a major character in the beginning of French romanticism, wearing a "red half-arm" to attract attention and appear in this deformed alien land with a very thin atmosphere. What we require is practical work, not attention-seeking; close cooperation, not fighting alone. Of course, after the War of Resistance, this tendency has greatly changed, but this tail of the past sometimes reveals itself from the gray coat. We should now eliminate this shortcoming of the past. Anything that is harmful to our current goals, we should first conduct a self-examination and eradicate it completely.

In this remote rear, we do not hear the sound of artillery, and we do not smell the smoke of gunpowder, but there are also many important tasks waiting for us to do. We have our territory, our weapons, and our advancing group. If we do not exert our strength, it is a waste of our human and material resources. At the same time, if literature and art, one of the important departments of a vital and emerging culture, does not take an offensive strategy, it will inevitably retreat and tend to decline. This is a public principle that cannot be violated by all things in the natural world and the social world. One of our main tasks at present is how to seize those backward readers and lift their heads from the anesthesia of those black reading materials to see another world. This requires a lot of hard work. We should study those various yellow news, entertaining reading materials, and all other low-level and sensual reading materials. What is the power of their appeal? How can we break these anesthetic forces? How can we replace them with reading materials that can replace them, so that the readers' inclination gradually changes and gradually tends to be advanced, so as not to be anesthetized by those licentious reading materials and eventually sink irretrievably. This is a work that requires patience and effort, and it cannot be accomplished by shouting slogans alone. At the same time, our so-called new cultural people often have a tendency to look down on everything and despise those so-called erotic writers and the readers behind them. This is a big mistake. We must know that our readers are limited to a few intellectuals, students, and progressive shop assistants, etc. In terms of quantity, they are not very large, far less than the broad masses owned by an author of erotic novels whom we despise. Even if you treat these people with a contemptuous attitude every day, or criticize them with strict words and righteous arguments (of course, we must admit that this theoretical criticism is necessary) and it is justified, they have no words to refute. But our theorists, I must tell you, this article of yours is still written for ourselves to read, because those who read your great work, in addition to us "extras" who have to take a look, the rest are intellectuals, students, and progressive small shop assistants within our circle. Those who write erotic novels do not know about this, and those backward readers who welcome such works simply do not want to read your long articles. This is not to say that we should not write such theories, but that we should talk about how to transform those readers. At the very least, we should not forget those authors and ignore them completely. We write our articles, they write their articles, "the river water does not interfere with the well water," you do your work, we do our work, bow to each other and retreat, each goes his own way, or glare at each other, the walls are heavily guarded. Neither the former laissez-faire attitude nor the latter hostile attitude is a positive solution. We should try to contact them. Even if we cannot "incorporate" them into our camp, we can at least instill some new blood into them, so that they can passively reduce as much as possible those very toxic components in their works and increase the anti-enemy components as much as possible. We can see from the various supplements in Hong Kong that those writers have changed their styles to some extent after the War of Resistance. The turbulence of the great era has made it impossible to stabilize their positions. They also write about the War of Resistance, although not purely, but the facts of the War of Resistance are also used as interspersed materials in the shell of the story. This proves that they are not impossible to promote. The problem is how we can make further efforts.

Speaking of this, I must add a brief explanation. The old authors I mentioned above are of pure conduct. As for those Japanese heretics, traitorous literary theorists, and eulogists of "Wang's" who took the old ticket, we should take a decisive attitude and give them a merciless attack, so that their toxins cannot spread like poison gas and harm the people. We feel that we have talked very little about such an important and realistic issue, that is, the attack on absurd theories, and that escaping from reality is tantamount to abandoning our responsibility. Come on, let us take back those eyes that are looking at the distant stars and focus on the current real problems, not letting it slip away in the slightest. When there is an opportunity, we will jointly make a strong statement and give those theories a merciless encirclement and suppression.

What is said above is mostly in the negative aspects. Now I want to put forward a few tasks with positive significance. It would be great if cultural people could go to the front line and give practical help to the War of Resistance itself. If this is not possible, it is also valuable to contribute to literary and artistic creation within the scope of one's personal position in the rear. Chinese literary and artistic circles should be lacking in theoretical translation, and creation. Both those who carry guns and those who carry pens have their important significance in the battle. We should not underestimate ourselves. What we see in our current publications or what we write under our pens are, generally speaking, lighter works in terms of weight, and a large part of our time, I dare not say, has not been wasted. We naturally do not hope that such meaningless waste will continue for a long time. We hope that everyone in this relatively stable rear can bury their heads and write or translate more systematic or larger and valuable works. As far as the current situation is concerned, publication is of course more difficult. Some cultural institutions simply do not print books, or they are speculative books or lighter books in terms of weight. Hiding it in famous mountains is also a way to comfort ourselves. Speaking of this, I think of the method of the literary and artistic workers' cooperative, where writers gather together to print and sell their own works. Such organizations have already appeared abroad. In China, the Fu Society in Shanghai also had good results last year. The focus of this method is not on making profits, but on developing culture. This meaning is different from other bookstores that are solely for business purposes, and the organization is also different. It is something that we should and should do. If we have a precise plan, appropriate distribution, and good guidance from domestic old writers, coupled with the regular criticism and introduction of publications and magazines under the same goal, I think we can definitely make some contributions to culture.

Here, due to the limitations of the social environment, the writing level is not as high as we hope. Most of the enthusiastic and upward-looking writers have not yet achieved special achievements due to the limitations of their age or their limited cultivation, but it is not that there is no future. Naturally, I hope that those old writers who are responsible for guidance will give them as much guidance and encouragement as possible. At the same time, I also hope that they will learn more from famous domestic writers and excellent foreign writers. The more effort they put in, the more they will gain. Do not be complacent because of some achievements, nor be disappointed because of a failure. Everyone should be courageous and have extremely strong self-confidence, even a little bit of self-conceit. It was probably the German writer Kleist who often wanted to take the crown from Goethe's head. Every young writer should have such ambition. This is not to say that having such ambition is enough, but that after having such ambition, they should strive to achieve it. It is not difficult to achieve success and become famous in the literary world. After Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front was published, he became famous overnight. At that time, he was still living in Switzerland and did not know that he had become a celebrity. Literary and artistic workers, let's work hard together. The arrival of this new momentum is the beginning of new work, that is, the first sound of our efforts inspired by this driving force.

Attack——Written by Hong Feng

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"What?"

"You want to find a pistol?"

"Don't worry"! She thought again: "Dangerous people are always afraid of danger"! Therefore, "pistol" gave her a new enlightenment--. She secretly looked for a sharp knife used for picnics, hid it in her coat, and brought several handkerchiefs and a piano rack in front of him, which he stared at with electricity. At the same time, she held the handle of the sharp knife with one hand, and wanted to pierce his throat. While she was fumbling for his collar with the other hand, he said to her:

"What? Are you plotting something"?

This sound, like steel rubbing against each other, made her hand, which was fumbling for his collar, fall down numbly and tremblingly; because she was the weaker, the reason of the weaker could not control the risky action. However, her thoughts were sensitive, and she knew that the hand that had touched happiness and failed in the past would inevitably bring misfortune, and needed to be arranged in a place where this misfortune could be eliminated, so as to avoid suffering more hardships. Therefore, she moved that hand to his chest and fiddled with his scarf! She deliberately said aggrievedly:

"Who knows you would be afraid of me"!

"What do you want to do with your hand"!

He immediately opened her hand and let his own hand resist her approach. She was even smarter and automatically backed away a little:

"I just wanted to look at your scarf..."

He believed it, and felt uneasy and ashamed after misunderstanding others; he asked her in a tone of forgiveness:

"Do you want my scarf? Don't you have one?"

She used this topic to continue the conversation, and she said:

"I have one, but I can't find it"!

He took off his own scarf and put it around her, which was sympathy, but it was a waste. What she gave was nothing more than a deeper antipathy and hatred, or a kind of residue after cheating. Although she kept saying:

"Thank you"! (Eighteen)

### The Future of Hong Kong's Literary and Artistic Movement

— Du Ai

Since the War of Resistance, the number of literary and artistic workers who have gathered in Hong Kong from all sides cannot be counted. The literary and artistic supplements in newspapers have increased compared to before, and the scope of art is expanding. However, what can be called a "movement" has not yet been organized. Some time ago, many comrades in the literary and artistic circles seriously noticed this phenomenon and unanimously believed that it was necessary to quickly establish a connection to replace the scattered state of "fighting alone".

This proposition fully reflects the urgency of objective requirements at present. Although Hong Kong is a special region, because this place is closely connected to South China, its status as a major international passage for our country still occupies a considerable position even today after Guangzhou and Wuhan have fallen. In terms of cultural rations, it is also in a position to supply the Dongjiang and Southwest areas of Guangdong, although the extent of this supply is still very insufficient. In recent months, the guerrilla warfare in the Dongjiang area has accelerated, and a large number of young people have run into the occupied areas from Hong Kong. The development of this situation has made the supplements here increasingly find works by new literary and artistic soldiers from the Dongjiang area. On the other hand, because of the close transportation relationship, people in the mainland also hope to obtain cultural rations from here as much as possible. The above situation makes the workers in our literary and artistic circles understand that: Establishing a regular connection, where everyone can often meet and exchange opinions on writing, is not only necessary for the literary and artistic movement in Hong Kong itself; it will definitely have a good effect on the mainland as well.

In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, some people have recently been working to establish the Hong Kong Branch of the National Interim Writers Association. This is a matter of infinite joy. After the establishment of the branch of the Writers Association, it will be a powerful axis of the Hong Kong literary and artistic movement, which is what everyone expects!

The issue of the united front in literary and artistic circles has been hotly discussed for many years. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, friends in Hong Kong who are engaged in literary and artistic work have turned their pens to the War of Resistance, but the organization of the united front has not yet been built. There is no doubt that the establishment of this branch of the Writers Association will complete this work. We hope that writers of various factions will converge in this branch, establish close ties with each other, and work closely together for a common industry and move forward hand in hand.

The development of the war is urgently demanding a large number of working cadres in various departments of the struggle. Therefore, regularly holding literary and artistic gatherings and training a large number of literary and artistic working cadres is also one of the important tasks at present. In addition, establishing a wide communication network, setting up a guidance department, establishing new relationships with writers in the mainland, publishing organ publications, regularly reporting on the situation of literary and artistic movements in various parts of the country, so that workers in various places are connected on one line, these are all tasks that should be started immediately.

Although the crazy attack of × people has destroyed the center of literature and art, new literary and artistic positions are being built everywhere. The establishment of the branch of the Writers Association will not only bring the Hong Kong literary and artistic movement to a new stage, but will also play a powerful role in defending South China.
