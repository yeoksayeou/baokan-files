### The Spanish Problem and the European Situation

On the 11th of this month, British Prime Minister Chamberlain visited Rome, one of his main objectives being to discuss how to resolve the Spanish Civil War. It is said that Chamberlain carried with him a statement from the Spanish Republican government, which included two guarantees: (1) that if the government forces were to win, Spain would not become a communist state, but would continue to be a democratic country with a liberal parliamentary system; (2) that the Spanish government would never adopt anti-Italian policies... After the Rome talks, although Anglo-Italian relations did not worsen compared to the past, Chamberlain's hopes were not realized, and his envisioned consistent peace policy following the Munich Agreement failed to materialize, which is a fact. The reason for this is that, on the one hand, Mussolini aims to dominate the Mediterranean, and in the two and a half years since the Spanish Civil War, the Italian troops who participated in the war have suffered countless casualties, so there is no reason to abandon intervention halfway and withdraw volunteer troops. On the other hand, France's diplomatic failure at the Munich Conference and its shaken national strength can be said to be unprecedented. Therefore, learning from past mistakes, it resolutely rejected Italy's demands for "natural desires" and could not satisfy them. This is the fundamental reason for Chamberlain's journey starting with enthusiasm and ending with disappointment.

According to reports from various news agencies in recent days, the rebel army led by Franco has approached Barcelona, and all government personnel have also moved elsewhere. From this, it can be seen that the situation in Barcelona is critical. Moreover, with Italy sending a large number of aircraft and three regular divisions to help the rebels besiege the city, its fall may be imminent. Even if the fall of Barcelona does not mean that the rebels have won the final victory, it is undeniable that the power of fascist countries will expand, and European peace will be more seriously threatened from then on. We will now describe our views below:

1. Recalling Franco's rebellion in Morocco on July 17, 1936, because the German air and naval forces intentionally provided him with support, he was able to cross the Strait of Gibraltar in one fell swoop and occupy several strongholds in mainland Spain. Internally, a part of the reactionary forces rose up in response. Moreover, in the two and a half years of the war, the manpower and military supplies from Italy and Germany have not only been continuously supplied but have also increased, so they have been able to maintain a military advantage and their occupied areas have continued to expand. Judging from the recent battles, the capture of Barcelona, an important fortress of the government forces, seems to be no longer a problem. Since the beginning of the war, the Republican government has united with its people, but because the United States announced the implementation of the Neutrality Act, refusing to supply it with arms, and Britain and France adopted a non-intervention policy, canceling its right to purchase arms and blockading the French border, withdrawing volunteer troops or prohibiting volunteer troops from joining, the Republican government was completely isolated and helpless. Therefore, no matter how enthusiastically the people supported it, and how bravely they resisted and sacrificed, its military eventually had to retreat step by step and be in an unfavorable condition, causing Barcelona to be surrounded on all sides. If Barcelona unfortunately falls into the hands of the rebels, the European balance of power will be completely destroyed, and the security of Britain and France, especially France, will be more seriously threatened. The fascist momentum will inevitably leap forward, and the whole of Europe will be plunged into turmoil. The gain or loss of Barcelona has a significant impact on European peace, and even world peace.

2. When Italian Foreign Minister Ciano delivered a speech in Parliament last November 30, declaring that Italy would do its utmost to protect its own interests and to satisfy its "natural desires," the members immediately shouted the slogan of recovering the colonies. Therefore, after that, the diplomatic relations between France and Italy became increasingly tense, and Italy deployed troops on the borders of Tunisia and Djibouti in North Africa, with a tense atmosphere, as if a conflict could break out at any moment. According to European visitors, the situation in the Red Sea is still extremely serious, and Mussolini has not given up his strategy of intimidating France. In Mussolini's mind, he originally wanted to ask Chamberlain to mediate when he visited Rome, so as to achieve his fantasy of gaining gains without bloodshed, but France insisted that Britain should not interfere in Franco-Italian issues, so Mussolini failed to achieve his great desire in the Rome talks, and his inner depression and resentment can be imagined. Although Italy's military equipment and financial resources are currently inferior to those of France, fascism takes killing, bloodshed, and aggression as its highest ideals. Since Mussolini's successful invasion of Abyssinia, his desires have become even more inflated, and he has received the secret support of his partner Hitler. Therefore, his relations with France have turned from embarrassment to anger, and it is not absolutely impossible for him to turn falsehood into truth and move from intimidation to actual action. Especially after Barcelona falls into the hands of the rebels, the Mediterranean Sea will gradually be under Italian control. At the same time, Barcelona is close to the Pyrenees Mountains in France. Once it is lost, it will increase the possibility of a Franco-Italian conflict.

3. One month after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Britain and France jointly proposed a non-intervention policy, the purpose of which was to prevent the scope of the war from expanding and spreading to the whole of Europe. Recently, Chamberlain wrote to Labour Party leader Attlee, stating: "The government believes that if the ban on arms shipments to Spain is lifted and arms are supplied to the Spanish government, the result will inevitably expand the war, and the impact will be unimaginable." In our view, "cutting off the fire" is the only effective way. Simply refusing to supply arms to the Spanish Republican government, watching it collapse, and allowing the rebels supported by the aggressor front to win is tantamount to putting European peace on a solid foundation. This attempt is like "climbing a tree to catch fish." The consequences may be even more unimaginable. Moreover, once the rebels win, Italy's dominance of the Mediterranean will become even more of a problem. At that time, Britain's transportation with its territories in the East will be cut off, and the situation will be far more serious than it is today, and human peace will be in danger. Therefore, the gain or loss of Barcelona is also closely related to the security and interests of Britain.

4. Italy is determined to withdraw from Eastern Europe, which it has dreamed of infiltrating for many years. After its victory in Spain, its aggression against Southern Europe and Africa will be even more active. At that time, while Britain and France are busy dealing with Italy and have no time to take care of other matters, Hitler will take the risk again and promote his long-cherished Eastern policy. Romania and Ukraine will undoubtedly become his future targets of attack. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." If precautions are not taken in advance, the crisis will be impossible to contain once it breaks out. The Spanish problem is closely related to European peace and even world peace. Therefore, in order to prevent a second world war, democratic countries should provide the Spanish Republican government with practical and active assistance.

On the evening of the 23rd, the British Prime Minister gave a speech to recruit volunteers for national defense, saying: "We will never start a war, but we may be forced to participate in a war started by others." Judging from these words, British foreign policy seems to be changing, but we hope that Mr. Chamberlain can take further action. This action does not necessarily mean war, but it will make a great contribution to world peace!

### Growing Up in the Storm

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Lin Heng

A Specific Account of the Establishment of the Huiyang County Detachment of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard

(I)

The warm sun just revealed its golden brilliance, shining on the desolate Huizhou city, and illuminating the lovely and pitiful East River. Small boats crawled in the river, and numerous tiny waves reflected a silvery white light. A light breeze carried foul and unpleasant odors, blowing in gusts, touching people's bodies and nostrils, making them feel that the thin single layer of clothing they wore would not easily get them through the harsh winter, and also reminding them of the scenes of burning, killing, and looting by the Japanese invaders last year!

Here, on the upper floor of the library of a local county school, bright red and green banners were hung on both sides, reading: "Youth Unite, Consolidate and Expand the United Front of Youth." In the middle was posted: "Order and Oath for the Inaugural Meeting of the Huiyang County Detachment of the East River Regional Team of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard." In the center of the hall was placed a rectangular table. More than fifty young, lively, and lovely people had already gathered on both sides, chatting and laughing in groups. Everyone possessed a cheerful mood, their hearts seemingly saying: "I am happy because, starting today, I am a member of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard." Everyone had the same hope, waiting for the arrival of Special Commissioner Huang from the county party headquarters.

After a while, amid enthusiastic applause, Special Commissioner Huang ascended the stairs. The youth, who had been standing and sitting in a disorganized manner, quickly gathered together, and the entire floor fell silent. The meeting began with the singing of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard song:

"We are the valiant anti-Japanese vanguards, we are an iron-willed team, we are not afraid of the brutality of the * people, nor are we afraid of hardship and pain... Hey! Comrades, strive hard to fight for freedom for the motherland."

After the chairman announced the reasons for convening the meeting, applause erupted like thunder. Ms. Ruan began reading the congratulatory message from the regional headquarters to the county headquarters, followed by a speech and seal presentation by the representative of the regional headquarters.

Suddenly, dozens of strong fists were raised high, and dozens of voices gathered together to recite the oath:

"I... am willing to sacrifice everything, placing anti-Japanese resistance above all else... Under the highest principle, I will strive for national salvation work, implement the Three Principles of the People, support the government, support the leader, be loyal to the national revolution, and fight for the establishment of a free and equal New China based on the Three Principles of the People..."

"The enthusiasm of the youth in Huiyang is their advantage... But their work often starts and ends without finishing, and they are very undisciplined, which is their shortcoming. The Anti-Japanese Vanguard is organizing them... I hope the Anti-Japanese Vanguard can continue to actively lead them and expand and consolidate the county headquarters..." Amid enthusiastic applause, Special Commissioner Huang finished his instructions.

After the selection was completed, all members began a recreational program with enthusiastic handshakes: a solo performance by "Little Devil," a solo performance by "Song Bug," and a chorus with chicken crowing, symbolizing that the county headquarters was growing up before dawn and had to continue to work hard to approach the light—and there was the sound of a dog barking, indicating that some dogs were jealous of this child's birth, telling him to be vigilant and not let poisonous dogs bite him! There was an international news report by Mr. Rokuchi Dan (played by Liang Jun) about anti-war information in Japan and the current crisis in Japan... The recreational program was very rich, making everyone feel that this was an unprecedented and enthusiastic gathering!

The clock has struck three. Before the meeting adjourned, Mr. Chen gave a report:

Comrades, this morning we received an unsigned letter. Now, I will read it to you:

"Comrade Zu Baichang: Because of an unsatisfactory thing that happened today, I couldn't sleep peacefully, so I got out of bed and talked to you:

'...Yes, many young comrades in Huizhou, seeing their hometowns torn to pieces by the devils, are willing to dedicate their blood and sweat, even their lives, to the struggle for liberation... Very enthusiastic Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades resolutely organized the youth, making the youth of Huizhou stand on the battle line of work, how excited and grateful the youth of Huizhou are!'

"The matter is too bizarre. Yesterday they were still shouting to 'unanimously join the Anti-Japanese Vanguard' and 'Long live the Anti-Japanese Vanguard,' but today they are all opposed to joining the Anti-Japanese Vanguard... We know that they are being induced by another party, and as a result, some have left the Anti-Japanese Vanguard. Therefore, I am very concerned that the organization of your Anti-Japanese Vanguard Huiyang County headquarters will stagnate. No—definitely not. The national fighting spirit of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard will not retreat with a single ripple..."

When he read this, Deputy Captain Yang and several female comrades cried, but Mr. Chen continued to read:

"...We hope that you will organize the Huiyang Anti-Japanese Vanguard based on the task of organizing youth! (To be continued)

### The People of Wuhu Suffer Under the Double Oppression of the × Pseudo Regime (Continued) Large and Small Traitors Run Rampant, Controlled by Us Five Miles from the City

Including stolen clothing from the poor, all confiscated and sold collectively. The organization for selling stolen goods is beautifully named the Cooperative, with Wang Shancheng concurrently in charge. Because his younger brother, Zidong, studied in Japan and is proficient in Japanese, he can get close to the × side and sell the stolen money. In addition to reporting most of it to the Japanese side, the rest is divided up by the puppet cliques. Among the puppets, although Zhu Xiufeng holds the position of pseudo-chairman, he has no real power. The other puppets often have internal conflicts due to conflicts of interest, causing Wang Xiaofer, Wei Minqiang, and Song J眉mei to be detained and dismissed by the Japanese side one after another. At the same time, local hoodlums such as Ren Fengchang, who performs martial arts and sells art, Tao Xifen, a former employee of the × Japanese Consulate, and Peng Yangwu, who once served as a translator at the × Hospital, are all hired by the × army and hold pseudo-positions, all relying on their power to run rampant. The order in the city is extremely chaotic. This is because the Japanese army has no discipline, breaking into people's homes to harass women and demand items, which has become commonplace. Therefore, nine out of ten residential areas in the city are empty, and no one dares to live there. Most of the houses along Zhongshan Road are occupied by × people, who open shops. In addition to cotton yarn, tobacco, groceries, sugar, and noodles, there are also many brothels and restaurants. Each Japanese merchant also sells drugs, so the atmosphere of drugs is everywhere, and more and more civilians are addicted to them. Except for × people's businesses, most are of a trafficking nature. Regular shops are rare. All the buildings in the port, except those that have been destroyed, are now occupied by the × army or Japanese, regardless of whether they are public, private, or organizational residences. The owners can not only not recover them, but also are not allowed to inspect the houses. × military vehicles rush wildly through the streets at high speed, and the number of innocent people killed under the wheels is unknown. Although the × army occupies Wuhu, it can only garrison the city. Beyond five miles from the city, it is completely under the control of the guerrillas. The × army stationed in Wuhu once attempted to establish contact with the × army in Wanzhi, 20 kilometers from Wuhu, but failed because of interception by the New Fourth Army and other guerrillas. The Wuhu County government is still located in Gongdi in the southeastern countryside of the county, and the administrative system has not been interrupted. The pseudo-autonomous association has now been reorganized into the "Pseudo-XXX Office," with Zhu Xiufeng still serving as the pseudo-county magistrate. Wang Mengshou, Yu Shuoping, and Bao Guangqing serve as pseudo-section chiefs and made a shameless debut on New Year's Day. It is said that they are planning to levy various harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies to cover the expenses of the pseudo-office. The people are suffering endlessly under the double oppression of the × army and traitors.

### The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee Opens, President Chiang Arrives and Delivers the Opening Address, Determining That the × People Are Bound to Fail Based on Past Facts, Completing the Great Cause of the War of Resistance with Revolutionary Spirit

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] Chiang, President of the 9th Central Executive Committee, delivered the opening address at the Fifth Plenary Session. The main points of the content are:

(1) The task of this plenary session and the spirit of perseverance that our war of resistance and revolution should have.

(2) At present, our top priority is to recognize the purpose of the war of resistance and the situation between × and us, and to strengthen our determination and confidence.

(3) There is a reason why × Country is bound to fail. Its examples:

(1) Violating the established steps of its mainland policy;

(2) Its attempts to subjugate without fighting "frozen war and quick decision" and "quick peace and quick conclusion" have all failed;

(3) Strategic failure: — 1. Not knowing the enemy and ourselves; 2. Only trying to be clever and take chances, violating the principle of 'clumsy but quick'; 3. Stopping troops deep in the enemy's territory, trapped in a difficult situation;

(4) Political failure:——(1) Manufacturing puppets and using scum to deepen the corruption of soldiers; (2) Diplomatic policies are fragmented and contradictory, and becoming increasingly isolated and dangerous;

(5) Not understanding Chinese history and national strength, and not understanding the characteristics of the current era and the development of the Chinese revolution.

(4) The inevitable failure of × is our inevitable victory. We should strengthen our spiritual strength, persevere in the war of resistance, and fight decisively with all our strength, and we must not compromise and surrender halfway.

(5) From our own review, in history, geography, culture, national spirit, and economy, there is a foundation that makes × inevitably invincible.

(6) The direction of the development of the national situation must tend to maintain faith and harmony. The various democratic countries are also strengthening their preparations and determination to curb aggression. We should follow this path of development of public reason and justice and implement the national policy of persevering in the war of resistance to the end.

(7) China's war of resistance is a war of sorrow and a war of righteousness. It is to save China and make a contribution to East Asia and the world. Since we occupy the advantage of a sorrowful army, which is nine victories out of ten, the righteous war will surely succeed.

(8) Knowing ourselves, knowing the × people, and recognizing the inevitability of the development of the environment and things, we can understand the number of success or failure.

(9) From now on, we must start from scratch without any dependence, and work hard according to the situation of the × people.

(1) Use our unity and solidarity to deal with the wild disorder of the × people and overcome the superior with the inferior;

(2) Give full play to the advantages of our agricultural country, economize, persevere, and deepen the weaknesses of the industrial country of ×;

(3) Use the advantages of our good timing and favorable location, step up all wartime construction, and promote the crisis of social collapse in ×;

(4) Truly practice the Three Principles of the People and overthrow the militarism of ×.

(10) We must recognize the revolutionary responsibilities of the party and ourselves, establish a vow to be responsible and dedicated, and strive to the end, work hard, hard, and preciously to win the victory of the war of resistance and complete the great cause of the revolution.

### Full Text of the Opening Address

Comrades, this plenary session is being held at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance, and its significance is very significant, and the task is particularly difficult. I have repeatedly pointed out recently that our war of resistance should be divided into two stages. Before the fall of Guangzhou and the withdrawal from Wuhan, it was the first stage. After the withdrawal from Wuhan, it was the second stage. The task of the first stage was to consume the strength of the × people as much as possible, cover our preparations in the rear, establish the foundation for a long-term war of resistance, and complete all the arrangements on the strategic and political fronts for our second stage of the war of resistance. The task of the second stage is to inherit the achievements of the struggle in the previous stage, implement all the plans that we have made in the first stage, and give full play to our strength in the war of resistance, in order to achieve the goals of victory in the war of resistance and success in national construction. Therefore, this plenary session is a major key for us to turn from defense to offense, from defeat to victory, and to determine the rise and fall of our survival with our efforts. When we come to this key of survival, rise, and fall, the comrades attending the meeting should review the facts of the past, determine the plans for the future, raise the spirit of struggle, and start from scratch to the end. Recently, the situation of the war of resistance, on the one hand, our military and popular morale is stronger than before, and the internal and external situation is also becoming more and more favorable. All the people in the country believe that the danger of our country has passed, and they are very optimistic about the future of the country. The psychology of inevitable victory is also strengthened, but the mission of our party is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, all comrades must be more concerned about the future of the party and the country, and study the strategies and plans that have existed in history. I believe that the spirit of our revolution is only to ask whether we ourselves are doing it, that is, to ask whether we ourselves are revolutionizing or not. In other words, it is to say whether we are resisting the war or not. If we can do it and resist the war to the end, then we are not afraid of having no plans and no solutions. We must know that the real method of our revolution is to "control the clever with clumsiness" and "to overcome the crowd with the few", and move forward based on our Three Principles of the People. If we can sacrifice and struggle like the spirit of the first phase of the war of resistance, and can go further, seek truth from facts, then the war of resistance will surely be victorious, and the construction of the country will surely be successful, without any doubt. If not, or knowing but not acting, or acting but not exerting effort, or working hard for a while but not being able to persevere, or being active at the beginning but passive halfway, only talking about form but not seeking reality, or having only aspirations but no concrete plan, or having a plan but not being able to execute it vigorously, then the favorable opportunity will be easily let go, and the improved situation will not make up for the facts. Therefore, the root of all success or failure lies in whether we have a revolutionary spirit and whether we have confidence and determination. With this determination, we can have the confidence to develop an effective plan. With strong confidence in revolutionary national salvation and the inevitable victory of the war of resistance, we can not be afraid of difficulties, not be afraid of dangers, and implement the plan we have made in order to succeed. Therefore, I ask our comrades that the first thing is to establish determination and confidence. Where does determination and confidence come from? It is necessary to have a correct understanding of our war of resistance goals and the situation of the war of resistance. Only with a correct understanding will determination not be the courage of blood, and can persevere in the struggle to the end without slackening. Only with a correct understanding, our confidence is a reliable confidence, and can be persevering. Why do we resist the war? It is because we want to preserve the survival and freedom of the country and the nation, and to follow the Three Principles of the People to revolutionize and save the country, and people do not allow us to survive at all, let alone allow us freedom. At this time, if we cannot resist the war and fantasize about compromising halfway, this is to stop halfway. In this way, our nation will be completely destroyed, and generations of children and grandchildren will forever be slaves and livestock, never to recover. If we cannot resist the war to the end, our country will be reduced to a vassal state and colony of ×, and from then on, international justice will be completely overturned, and world peace will never be guaranteed. The ambition of our Prime Minister's life to advocate revolution, save the country, and save the world will all be in vain. (To be continued)

### In the Nineteenth Month of the War of Resistance, Our Cash Has Not Decreased, with Silver Deposits of 2.2 Billion in the United States, According to Sources in the Ministry of Finance

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 25th] According to sources from the X side, they received news from the Ministry of Finance that the statistics of Chinese silver deposits in the United States are 2.2 billion yuan. Although China is in the midst of a long-term war of resistance, the silver has not decreased.

### I and the British Government Sign a Navigation Agreement; China-Soviet Navigation Negotiations Will Also Be Completed; A Landmark Advance in China's Aviation History

[Reuter, Chongqing, 25th] This agency has received a reliable report that the new routes for British Imperial Airways aircraft and departing vessels will be established immediately. At 5:00 PM this afternoon, the Chinese and British governments signed an agreement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here, with an exchange of diplomatic notes. British Embassy representative Greenway represented the British government. As for the content, both parties agreed not to release it temporarily. After the new route is established, Imperial Airways aircraft can fly from Burma via Kunming to Hong Kong. This is the first time the Chinese government has allowed foreign aircraft to fly over its territory. At the same time, Chinese aircraft can also fly from Kunming to Burma. It is also heard that negotiations on establishing a passenger and postal air route between China and the Soviet Union will also be completed.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 25th] Executive Yuan President Kung Xiangxi announced to the press that the National Government has signed a contract with Britain stipulating joint railway and air transport arrangements between China and Burma. In the future, British Imperial Airways aircraft can also fly from Rangoon via Kunming to Hong Kong, and Chinese airline aircraft can fly to Rangoon. This is the first time that British Imperial Airways aircraft, purely foreign airline aircraft, have been permitted to fly within Chinese territory. Kung also stated that no force can destroy this close cooperation, and his attitude is extremely optimistic.

[Reuter, Chongqing, 25th] President Kung formally announced that the Chinese government has concluded an agreement with Imperial Airways for two-way air mail and passenger transport. Chinese people can travel directly from Yunnan and Burma to Europe and London, England, with the condition that Chinese aircraft can travel between China, Burma, and Hong Kong. The Sino-American-owned China National Aviation Corporation will represent the Chinese side in fulfilling these conditions. This condition is of utmost importance to Sino-British ventures. In addition to the new air routes increasing Sino-British commercial interests, the new air transport will also bring the peoples of China and Britain closer, resulting in deeper understanding. This understanding is extremely important for international peace and prosperity. President Kung also mentioned that after this new plan is implemented, a magical story from centuries ago, that of camel caravans carrying silk and other products across the desert from China to Europe, taking months or years and overcoming countless difficulties, will be recalled. This primitive means of transportation was replaced by ships, and now China welcomes a new page with air transport. Subsequently, President Kung also described the upcoming establishment of an air route between Yunnan and Burma, and he hopes that a railway connection between Yunnan and Burma will soon be established. President Kung concluded by saying that he is very pleased that Imperial Airways' desire to establish routes between India, Yunnan, and Hong Kong has now become a reality. He has now received government orders to sign this agreement.

Progress in Sino-Philippine Diplomatic Relations

[Associated Press, Manila, 25th] At the closing of the second session of the Philippine National Assembly last night, Philippine President Quezon delivered a speech advocating for the amendment of immigration laws to allow a limited, proportionally allocated immigration for Chinese, Indians, and other Asians who are currently denied entry.

### Economic Survey Team to Inspect the Yunnan Border

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 25th] In order to develop the economic resources of the Southwest and Yunnan, the Chinese government has formed a special economic survey team to inspect the southern border. The survey team includes experts in economics, finance, industry, and engineering, in order to study the agricultural and general conditions of the area, as well as to survey natural resources. At the same time, the committee will study what methods to use to obtain these natural resources. The committee is currently planning to organize model villages, expand industries, and construct several industrial zones. The establishment of this committee by China demonstrates its determination to build up the Southwest, so that it can be self-sufficient even if external transportation is completely cut off.

### Confiscated Counterfeit Currency; Military Affairs Commission Orders Garrison Troops to Confiscate; The Northern and Southern Puppets Stage New Drama Again

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] The Military Affairs Commission has ordered garrison troops in various locations to confiscate counterfeit currency and reward those who report it, turning it over to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to be used as financial weapons to destroy the puppet organizations.

[Reuter, Beiping, 25th] Yesterday, the Joint Committee of the Northern and Southern Puppet Organizations held a meeting. Judging from the published minutes, it seems that no major resolutions were made. However, the committee decided to send envoys to establish embassies in Japan and "Manchukuo" and to study the economic situation in order to establish a stable economic system in China and North China. This indicates that the Shanghai and Nanjing areas will follow the same pattern as North China, attempting to make the counterfeit Joint Reserve Bank of China banknotes the only currency. The committee issued a statement supporting former Prime Minister Konoe's declaration of December 20th of last year, and falsely denounced President Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters as enemies of the nation. Regarding the setting of new tax rates or the establishment of a new central government, whatever discussions may have taken place were kept secret, and the details remain unknown.

### The Central Government Strengthens War Resistance Efficiency; Chairmen of Battlefield Provinces to be Announced Soon

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] In order to increase the efficiency of the war effort, the Central Government will have military personnel concurrently serve as chairmen of battlefield provinces. Sun Lianzhong will head Henan, and the announcement will be made within days. In addition, Li Zongren will head Hubei; Yu Xuezhong will head Jiangsu; and Shangguan Yunxiang will head Anhui. Unless there are changes, the announcements should be made successively.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] It is heard that recently some people have suggested to the Central Government that chairmen be appointed for the northeastern provinces to restore legitimacy. The Central Government is still considering this due to the relatively difficult situation in the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] After the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, a large number of Central Committee members will be sent to work in the war zones. Zhu Lingqing will go to a certain province.

### Military and Party Affairs Undergo Unification; Detailed Measures Under Discussion

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 25th Dispatch] The Central Government is currently working hard on the issue of unifying military and party affairs. Detailed measures are still under discussion. For military affairs, in order to fight a long-term war, in addition to adjusting and supplementing the military forces of various routes, a steady and solid approach is adopted.

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 25th Dispatch] Communist Party representative Peng Dehuai recently visited Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing and expressed that the Communist army could be placed under the command of the Central Government, and that the Northwest Border Region Government could also be abolished. Detailed measures are reportedly under discussion.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] The Central Government has finalized measures to expand the Wartime Party and Government Committee. Chiang Kai-shek will serve as chairman, and Li Jishen will serve as vice-chairman.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 25th Dispatch] For the convenience of commanding military operations, the Northwest Headquarters has decided to establish a headquarters in a certain county of Gansu Province. Director Cheng Qian will depart within days, but some personnel will remain in Xi'an and Hanzhong to handle affairs.

### Ministry of Education Plans to Promote National Social Education

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] The Ministry of Education has drafted a plan to promote national social education. It has decided that from the county level upward, each unit will establish a social education organization. All secondary schools and above will form social education promotion committees. Staff will be trained separately by the Ministry of Education and various cities and counties.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th] Since taking office, Education Commissioner Zheng Tonghe has earnestly reorganized education in Gansu Province, focusing on the reorganization of personnel and the expansion of quantity. He has drafted a practical education plan that is divided into seven categories: higher education, secondary education, primary education, compulsory education, social education, vocational education, and health education. The total required funding for the 28th year of the Republic (1939) is 12,618,826 yuan, a doubling compared to the previous year. This implementation plan was submitted to the Provincial Government meeting on the 24th, and it was decided to convene a local education administration conference on February 1st to discuss and implement the plan separately.

### Central Government Discusses Administrative Improvement Plan for Several Days; Divided into Ten Areas Including Domestic Affairs and Foreign Affairs

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] Our two-year administrative plan includes specific measures for improvement in ten areas: domestic affairs, foreign affairs, military affairs, economics, finance, education, judiciary, Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, overseas Chinese affairs, and disaster relief. The Central Government has been discussing these measures in detail for several days in order to implement them.

### Fierce Battles in Guerrilla Areas; Japanese Troops Increase and Rampage in Shandong, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Chahar; No Changes in Stalemate Positions on Various Fronts

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] The Japanese have recently increased their troops and are rampaging in various occupied areas. There have been fierce battles in Shandong, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Chahar in recent days. Yesterday, the Japanese troops in Shandong attacked North Shandong and Jiaodong in several routes, and fierce battles are underway.

[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 29th Dispatch] Our new deployment in Guangdong has greatly strengthened our forces and will launch attacks in several routes. According to military intelligence last night, the Japanese troops in Zengcheng attacked Daguan'yin again but were repelled. There have been no changes in Taipingchang and Shengang. More than 1,000 Japanese troops in Huaxian City are being besieged by us. 2,000 Japanese troops from Sheshan are advancing to Sanshui. The Japanese troops on Weizhou Island have increased by more than 1,000, and a warship from the Japanese fleet is also in Beihai. There are no changes in northern Hunan. The two sides are still facing each other across the Xiushui River between Nanchang and Xunyang. In northern Hubei, the two sides are facing each other at Sanxingqiao near the Beijing-Hankou Railway in western Hubei. More than 5,000 Japanese troops in northern Henan are trapped in Huaiyang, waiting for reinforcements. In western Shanxi, there are fierce battles on three routes: Zhangjiazhuang, Xiabaishuang, and Hejialing. Japanese troops in Jiangxian have increased by 6,000-7,000. Japanese troops in Yonghe were defeated and have fled back to Xixian and Zhongyang. The siege of Lishi is still ongoing.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] Fierce battles are still raging between Jingshan and Zhongxiang in central Hubei. Our fresh troops have been dispatched and launched a counterattack starting on the 24th. The fighting is extremely fierce. A certain military officer said: "The Japanese troops in southern Shanxi have concentrated their forces to six and a half divisions. There are four and a half divisions just from Hejin to Fenglingdu, indicating an intention to invade Shaanxi in a big way. However, it is still difficult to guess where they will cross the river. There will be a major battle between Shanxi and Shaanxi in the coming days. The movements of the two divisions of the Japanese army in central China are currently unclear; they may be transferred to reinforce this area.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th Day] Military information states that our troops recently destroyed one li of the Pinghan Railway north of Yuanshi, and recovered more than 1,000 jin of electric wires. Transportation on the Han Railway has been disrupted for several days. Also, our troops destroyed the Zhengtai Railway near Jingxing and recovered 500 jin of electric wires. They also fought with the Japanese troops for one hour, killing more than 20 Japanese troops. Furthermore, the Jinpu Railway near Dezhou was severely damaged by guerrillas.

[Local News] The situation in the Beihai area has been tense for days. Yesterday, it was even rumored that a naval battle had occurred between a Japanese warship and our garrison on Weizhou Island and near Beihai. However, key officials in Guangxi's port considered the news hard to believe. A certain military expert familiar with the military situation along the coast of Beihai indicated to reporters yesterday at his office using a map to explain the situation in Beihai. According to him, the waters along the coast from Guangzhou to Beihai are extremely shallow, and vessels with a draft of five or six feet cannot dock, let alone warships. Warships of several thousand tons can only dock in areas where the range of the cannons cannot reach the shore. If the Japanese want to land in Beihai, they can only rely on motorboats and rubber boats, and it will take a long time to approach the shore due to the wide beaches. In this situation, if the garrison has enough machine guns, it will be difficult for the Japanese to land. However, there is a deep-water port near Guangzhou Bay called Longmen Port, which the Japanese may use as a feint to the west while attacking the east. Furthermore, military authorities in the Beihai area have dispatched Zhang Yan and Deng Shizeng to be in charge, and they have recently consulted with General Bai Chongxi regarding the overall plan. The morale of the people along the coast is very high, and if the Japanese come lightly, they will suffer a major blow.

[Reuter, Chongqing, 25th] According to official statements, Chinese aircraft bombed and strafed Weizhou Island on the 23rd of this month.

Agreed at the negotiation site on the east bank of Dege on the 8th day of the 10th month of the 21st year of the Republic of China (corresponding to the 9th day of the 8th month of the Water Monkey year).

4. The Course of Renewed Disputes

Although the agreement was signed, it was only a temporary military agreement. The fundamental problem of Dajin Temple was not addressed, so the discord was not eliminated.

During the war of 1931 and 1932, the temples of Dajin Temple were completely burned down by soldiers. The lamas of the temple also fled across the Jinsha River to Tosho under the protection of the Tibetan army. After the military actions ceased, the Tibetan side soon sent Daiben Chuke to Liu Wenhui, Regiment Commander Zhang of his army, and Jiang Yuwen, the magistrate of Dege County, to raise the issue of the Dajin Temple lamas returning to the temple. At the same time, Ya Huo Jian De, the representative of Dajin Temple, went to Nanjing to request permission to return to the Dajin Temple in Gansu. At that time, the National Government's attitude was very good, not only allowing them to return but also providing 20,000 yuan to repair the temple, while also instructing Liu Wenhui to negotiate specific measures with the Tibetan side. As a result, representatives from the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Command and the Tibetan Kashag (i.e., the Cabinet) held a meeting in Benrong Dam in the spring of 1934 to discuss the resettlement of the Dajin Temple monks. Due to incompatible conditions, the Dajin Temple lamas dispersed midway and looted a large group of Shaanxi people in the convoy with weapons, killing many people and burning down the Dengke County government, plundering its property, and fleeing back to the west of the Jinsha River. Negotiations broke down, and the garrison naturally dispatched troops again to suppress and pursue them. The Tibetan side also deployed troops to confront them, and a posture of imminent eruption was again established. Later, Qiu Lisheng, the newly appointed magistrate of Dege County, personally crossed the Jinsha River to discuss matters with Daiben Chuke, negotiating for several months. Finally, on January 9, 1935, eight articles of regulations for the resettlement of Dajin Temple lamas were established in Dege County. Because it is a historical diplomatic document, it seems worthwhile to publish it, so it is transcribed as follows:

Regulations for the Resettlement of Dajin Temple Lamas

Following the agreement made in Daze by the representatives of the Border Defense Headquarters and the representatives of the Tibetan Kashag, misunderstandings arose due to inconsistencies in the documents when the representatives of both sides were arranging for the resettlement of the Dajin monks in Benrong Cha. The Dajin monks fled, committing murder and robbery along the way, nearly leading to a complete breakdown. Both sides dispatched personnel again to discuss solutions. The Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Headquarters appointed Qiu Lisheng as its representative, and the Tibetan Kashag appointed Chuke Daiben as its representative, to newly establish the following eight articles of regulations:

(1) The Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Headquarters has vowed to widely solicit donations for the main hall of the Dajin Temple and to persuade all sectors to contribute. It will also send personnel appointed by the donors to supervise the construction. The Tibetan side must also donate and assist in fundraising.

(2) All original lands of the Dajin Temple will be returned. Grain will still be paid as before, and the same Fanggu Wuya and other duties will be performed as the surrounding lama temples. There must be no delays. In the future, those who wish to study as lamas in the temple will still follow the old rules, but the government must appoint a headman in the village to manage them, selecting suitable candidates based on the suitability of people to land.

(3) The Tibetan side is responsible for pursuing the bandits who robbed the goods of the Gansu and Shaanxi merchants and killed the merchants at Dajin Temple, and for compensating for the value of the lives. If the goods are not returned in full, compensation will be paid according to the lost items as listed. The amount of compensation for the lives will be paid according to the law. However, the injured merchants must not overreport, and the Dajin monks must not underreport. The Dajin monks who committed robberies will be held fully accountable by the Tibetan side and punished according to the law to uphold national law.

(4) All guns and ammunition belonging to the monks of Jin Temple will be handed over to the Khenpo, sealed in the treasury, and guarded by local government troops. When returning home across the river, personnel from both sides will be sent to supervise the inspection and carry out registration. In the future, if the monks need protection when doing business, they may request the government troops to provide protection.

### The Situation in the Western Front is Extremely Serious; Barcelona is in Danger; Rebel Troops Approaching the City on Multiple Routes, Fierce Fighting; The Government is Determined to Fight to the End

[Associated Press, Madrid, 25th] General Rojo, famous for defending Madrid, told people that whether Barcelona falls or not, the government army will fight to the end. We are now fighting for freedom, so any sacrifice, even sacrificing our lives, is not worth mentioning.

[Associated Press, Lerida, 25th] According to air force personnel reports, the port of Barcelona is in a state of extreme panic. People are rushing to seize the few merchant ships that are still docked there, but most are rejected because they cannot load any more. In addition, countless fishing boats and civilian boats have left the port, heading towards the French border. Some capsized due to overcrowding.

[Reuter, Lerida, 25th] The Spanish government has moved to Girona, leaving one person from each department in Barcelona, while Foreign Minister Del Vayo is in charge of everything. The government army is still retreating north to establish a new front line.

[Reuter, London, 14th] The Spanish rebel troops have now advanced to where Barcelona can be seen and is within artillery range. Manresa has been completely surrounded, and the rebel troops on all routes are still advancing rapidly. The rebel troops are gathering along the west bank of the River Llobregat (from Manresa to the coast). A senior rebel commander told Reuter that after this morning's attack, the enemy's last line of defense along the River Llobregat has been completely breached. After Franco occupied Gavà, Manresa, and Valladolid, he has controlled a 35-mile area of the River Llobregat from the estuary to the inland. Chaoli is located on both railway lines from Barcelona to the French border. Its occupation is tantamount to the government army losing a "lifeline." The Moorish troops of the rebel army have crossed the Barcelona airport and reached one mile from the outskirts of Barcelona. The rebel troops are now shelling the area. It is reported that by noon today, the rebel army has captured two thousand people.

[Central News Agency, in a town near Barcelona, Spain, 24th] On the Catalan Autonomous Region front, the Nationalist army launched an attack on Barcelona on multiple routes. The first route, the Moroccan native troops led by General Yagüe, reached the southern outskirts of the city, one and a half kilometers away, at 7:00 PM today. They immediately opened fire on the city with artillery and occupied the suburban airport. The second route occupied the nearby highlands and then took advantage of the situation to rush towards Barcelona. The third route crossed the Rio Llobregat (southwest of Barcelona) and reached within the artillery line of the Barcelona defenders. The fourth route occupied the city of Marisa (north of Barcelona) at 6:30 PM today and took advantage of the situation to encircle the government army's rear, aiming to achieve a pincer attack.

[Central News Agency, Lerida, 24th] The Western Nationalist army reached the outskirts of Barcelona at 10:00 PM tonight.

[Reuter, Perpignan, 24th] The foreign missions stationed in Spain have moved from Barcelona and Cardedat to Figueres in the border area. British Consul General Rogers and part of the French Embassy staff are still temporarily staying in Barcelona. The Spanish Foreign Ministry was contacted by long-distance telegram from here at 7:30 PM this evening, and the response was still very calm. However, the headquarters of the rebel army stated that the last line of defense in Barcelona has been breached, and thousands of defeated government troops are surrendering. According to reliable sources, President Azaña has arrived in Madrid. If the rebel army pursues relentlessly, the fall of Barcelona is only a matter of two days.

[Reuter, Paris, 24th] Spanish Foreign Minister Del Vayo set off to return to Barcelona today. According to news from the rebel headquarters, Barcelona is now under artillery fire. The government army is retreating into the city tonight. The rebel army is now approaching the southern and western suburbs of the city, and another force is encircling the city 20 miles to the north.

[Central News Agency, Valencia, 29th] Two squadrons of Nationalist army bombers bombed Valencia yesterday, dropping about 100 bombs in the districts of Guivico and Narazisi, destroying many houses. A certain foreign warship docked at the pier was also hit by fragments.

[Haitong News Agency, Perpignan, 20th] The International Military Commission, sent by the League of Nations at the request of the Spanish government to monitor the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers from Spain, has left Barcelona with all its documents and arrived here to continue its work.

[Central News Agency, London, 25th] It is reported that the British cruiser Devonshire and the destroyer Grenade have finally docked in Barcelona, preparing to transport British expatriates out of the country. It is currently unknown whether British diplomatic personnel are still stationed in Barcelona.

[Reuter, London, 24th] It is rumored that the British government will first allocate 20,000 pounds to the International Committee to relieve the suffering of Spanish children, and will make further donations later.

### Former British Under-Secretary of State Cranborne Urges Britain to Resist Aggression; Expresses Pessimism Towards Compromise Policy; Britain Should Strengthen National Defense with All Its Strength

[Central News Agency, London, 25th] Former British Under-Secretary of State Cranborne delivered a speech yesterday in Weymouth, southern England, stating that the weakness of Britain's defense forces only hastens the approach of war. I am not optimistic about the compromise policy adopted by British Prime Minister Chamberlain. The dictators have tasted bitterness and have lightly initiated military action to achieve certain successes. It is impossible to ask them to abandon their inherent policies. If we want to maintain our national freedom and European culture, we can only strengthen our national defense with all our strength to create an impregnable barrier.

### Lancashire Cotton Weaving Industry Asks for Government Assistance; Sends Delegation to Visit Chamberlain

[Reuter, London, 25th] The Lancashire cotton weaving industry is now asking the government to find ways to help. Yesterday, representatives of employers and workers in the industry visited Prime Minister Chamberlain, who met with them. Oliver Stanley and Ernest Brown were also present. The delegation strongly stated that the cotton weaving industry has been hit hard by the depression and urgently needs government assistance. The reason for the depression is that some countries want to revitalize their own cotton weaving industries, so they spare no effort to subsidize their weaving industry merchants to compete, while also building tariff barriers to exclude foreign goods. The delegation also submitted a memorandum, requesting the government to protect the interests of the cotton weaving industry, especially the provisions relating to colonies and trusteeships, in future trade negotiations with other countries. They also requested the government to immediately provide assistance to rayon exporters, because countries competing with the industry either subsidize their domestic industries or have very low wage levels. Therefore, the government should find ways to ensure that the export of textiles to countries that have trade agreements with them, or their colonies, strictly adhere to the formula of "spun in England, woven in England, made in England." The Lancashire industrial area should be regarded as a special area and enjoy government assistance to create new industries. The delegation also denied that the Lancashire industrial community has become obsolete. Under the same conditions, Lancashire's products will definitely be able to compete with the same components and the same low prices all over the world.

### German Foreign Minister Arrives in Warsaw Yesterday; Will Visit the Polish Foreign Minister

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop left here at 9:00 AM this morning for Warsaw by ordinary train. Mr. Ribbentrop was accompanied by his wife and senior officials from the Foreign Ministry. Upon arriving in Warsaw, Mr. Ribbentrop will visit Polish Foreign Minister Beck this afternoon and socialize with Polish political figures. He will stay for two days before returning to Germany.

### US Consulate Protests to Japan: Japanese Customs Officials Confiscate Reporter's Photos

[Shanghai, 25th (Foreign Dispatch)] It is reported that Japanese special agencies have recently ordered all Japanese photography studios and photographers to submit their photos for inspection. Yesterday, the special agency sent personnel to various well-known photography studios to convey the order, which was rejected by all the studios. They have reported the matter to the concession police.

[Shanghai, 25th (Foreign Dispatch)] The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury’s" Chinese special correspondent, Mr. You Hua, brought several of his photos to Shanghai, but they were confiscated by Lian Chang, a Japanese employee of the Jianghai Customs. The matter has been reported to the US Consulate, and a letter of protest is ready.

### Far East War Prolonged: Japan's Crisis Deepens. Remarks by Swedish Archaeologist; × proposes inviting British PM to visit Japan

[Reuters, Copenhagen, 24th] Swedish archaeologist Mr. Andersson, who has studied in China for many years, stated that if the Far East war is prolonged, Japan's future is truly bleak. He told a reporter from this agency that he expects Japan to establish a military dictatorship within the next four months, and popular protests within eight months. He also said, "If China resists to the end, Japan will inevitably move towards ××."

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] Today's "Kokumin Shimbun" published an editorial stating that there is growing support within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for inviting British Prime Minister Chamberlain or Foreign Secretary Halifax to Japan to investigate the truth of the Far East situation and negotiate directly with Japan. If this plan can be realized, it will greatly help resolve the issues between Britain and Japan. The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have recently visited Munich and Rome, so a visit to Japan is also possible. Furthermore, since Britain loaned money to the "Chiang regime," its policy towards Japan "seems to have a threatening undertone." It is greatly feared by Britain that Japan will eventually control all of China (?). Unless greater attention is paid to the current situation. Even if the United States, Britain, and France take joint action, Japan will not waver in its determination. Whether British politicians will come to Japan to see the current situation in the Far East with their own eyes and have a heart-to-heart talk with Japanese leaders will contribute significantly to world peace.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated, "Japan is currently in communication with both the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, requesting an investigation into the arrest of eight Japanese residents in Singapore." The eight include representatives from Mitsui and Mitsubishi corporations. The spokesman also criticized Philippine President Quezon for advocating the abolition of immigration restrictions, saying that Japan welcomes Mr. Quezon's goodwill, the purpose of which is obviously to resolve misunderstandings between Japan and the Philippines and promote friendly relations between the two countries. Furthermore, "Kokumin Shimbun" suggests that Chamberlain visit the Far East. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "This is a very good idea, but unfortunately the journey is too far."

### Famous Spanish Painting to be Entrusted to the League of Nations for Preservation

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 25th] The Spanish government possesses a world-famous painting. Spanish artists, given the deteriorating situation in the Spanish Civil War, have requested that the League of Nations preserve the painting on their behalf. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol said that if the Spanish government sends the painting to the League, the League will hang it in the League of Nations building.

### Chinese and Japanese Authorities Still Forbid Food Supplies into French Concession

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Hankou report: Two Chinese who were recently arrested have been released. Although the Japanese side claimed they were communists engaged in anti-Japanese activities, there was ultimately no concrete evidence. The Japanese authorities are still prohibiting the import of food into the French Concession, but Japanese merchants are secretly transporting food in. The French authorities seem to acquiesce in this, as the number of residents in the concession should decrease as a result.

[Associated Press, Hankou, 25th] The Japanese continue their strict blockade of food and vegetables to the French Concession in Hankou, only supplying a small vegetable market within the concession. This measure is entirely aimed at the Chinese refugees in the concession.

### Result of Compromise Diplomacy: Aggressors' Great Activity; Italy Said to Have Conscripted Reserves; Dangerous Country Foils Coup Plot

[Reuters, Rome, 24th] According to semi-official sources, a small number of specialists in the Italian army have been conscripted for training, but political figures claim to be unaware. They also stated that they had not heard of the rumored Italian conscription of 200,000 reserves.

[Central News Agency, Ecuadorian Capital, 24th] A coup plot was recently discovered in Ecuador, resulting in multiple arrests. The rebels originally planned to attack the Garapaniro military camp first, then dispatch personnel to detain the Ecuadorian President and cabinet members. Among those arrested by the government are several military officers. The mastermind was willing to act as a puppet for rampant Nazi propaganda.

### Memel District, US: Chairman Willing to Act as Puppet; Rampant Nazi Propaganda

[Central News Agency, Kaunas, Lithuania, 25th] The Chairman of the Memel District Committee, Bertulon, formerly a member of the National Socialist Party, gave a speech yesterday to officials at all levels in the district, stating that Lithuanians in Memel must accept National Socialism and that all anti-National Socialist propaganda should be prohibited. Bertulon also implemented the Nazi salute in official gatherings.

### British-German Economy: Report by Governor of Bank of England on Negotiation Process

[Reuters, London, 24th] The Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, visited the Foreign Office today for a lengthy discussion with Foreign Secretary Halifax. Halifax mainly sought Norman's opinion on how German economic policy would change after Schacht was removed from his position as head of the German National Bank. The two also discussed the current negotiations in Berlin on the Jewish question, aiming to establish an agreement for expulsion.

### German-Polish Agreement to Expel Jews

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] The agreement between Germany and Poland regarding the expulsion of Polish Jews from Germany at the end of October last year was signed this evening.

### Manchukuo Establishes Consulate General in Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Manchukuo has established a consulate general in Hamburg, Germany, to handle all matters.

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Today, Mr. Nieken, director of the Raw Materials Group of Germany's Four-Year Plan, stated that German cars will now be equipped with German-made synthetic rubber tires. He said that changes in the manufacturing process have reduced tire prices, and two major factories are accelerating this manufacturing. Gammerlin cancels tour.

### Changes in Spanish Civil War: Gammerlin Cancels Tour

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 25th] According to this morning's order, General Gammerlin's tour of non-French territories has been canceled due to changes in the military situation in Catalonia.

### Soviet Heavy Industry Committee Establishes Six Committees

[Haitong Agency, Moscow, 25th] The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet has ordered the People's Committee of Heavy Industry to be divided into six committees as follows:

People's Committee for Fuel Production, headed by Kaganovich; People's Committee for the Electricity Industry, headed by Atop; People's Committee for the Steel Industry, headed by Merklov; People's Committee for Light Metals Industry, headed by Samoilov; People's Committee for the Chemical Industry, headed by Tairisov; People's Committee for the Building Materials Industry, headed by Susin. Not avoiding any cost.

### Britain Determined to Protect Export Trade, Not Avoiding Any Cost

[Reuters, London, 23rd] British Overseas Trade Minister Mr. Sun stated this evening at a banquet of the German Chamber of Commerce in the British Empire that he declared with authority that Britain's export trade is extremely important to British interests and will be maintained at any cost. Britain hopes to conduct trade not to harm other countries, but to develop international trade in stabilizing economic conditions. He expressed hope that the ongoing practical negotiations between Britain and Germany will result in increased trade between the two countries, eliminating deadly competition and restoring friendly trade under normal conditions. Mr. He also stated that Germany's economic difficulties are not due to exchange controls, liquidation, and payments, but mainly due to the vigorous development of the domestic market under the military needs of the Four-Year Plan.

### Strong Earthquake in Chilean Capital

[Associated Press, Chilean Capital, 25th] A strong earthquake occurred here at 11:23 this afternoon.

Brief Commentary

### Spanish War, European War, and the Far East

The Spanish war has reached an extremely critical stage. There are reports that Fascist forces have invaded Barcelona. The European situation will therefore appear increasingly urgent and critical. In addition to a detailed discussion in today's editorial, we feel that several points should be brought to the attention of readers:

First, the Spanish war, like the Sino-Japanese war, is part of a new imperialist war launched by Fascists to divide the world. The victory of Italian-German Fascist aggressors in Spain is not only a failure for Spain's democratic republican politics, but also a failure for the two democratic countries of Europe, especially Britain and France, and will also profoundly affect the anti-Japanese war in the Americas and even our country. Looking at today's dispatches, it can be seen that with the Fascist victory in Barcelona, France is in national distress, the anti-appeasement wave in Britain is rising, and the United States is fearing that Germany, Italy, and Japan will establish a base in Spain to disrupt Latin America. Japanese Army Minister Itagaki and Navy Minister Yonai are even making wild claims that they will use greater strength to disrupt Sino-Vietnamese transportation and advance westward and southward, since British and French attention is focused on Europe. We must not ignore the increasing collusion and aggression of the Fascist aggressor countries of Japan, Italy, and Germany!

Second, the main reason that Italian-German Fascist forces have been able to achieve victory in Spain is that the British and French appeasement policy of non-intervention has actually helped the Fascist aggressors. The aid of the Soviet Union and other countries to the Spanish government has been blocked, while large numbers of German and Italian troops, warships, and munitions have been given full freedom to advance. Secondly, the anti-Fascist united front in Catalonia has failed to achieve adequate consolidation and expansion, and the Fascist aggressors' diversionary forces, such as Trotskyists, have used slogans such as opposing the Communist Party to create divisions, which has had a significant impact. This is another lesson that we must pay special attention to and accept in our anti-Japanese war.

Third, if Barcelona completely falls under the iron heel of the Fascist forces, the difficulties faced by the Spanish government will naturally become more serious, but the Spanish people's struggle to uphold democracy, freedom, and anti-Fascism will absolutely not cease. At the same time, aid from the US, the Soviet Union and other countries to the Spanish government will naturally be more difficult, and even if Britain and France quickly shift to a policy of aiding the Spanish government, it may be too late. But the time of final despair has not been reached. The US revocation of the embargo on military supplies to Spain will become a reality, and the British and French policy of aiding the German and Italian aggressors and the Spanish rebels will be dealt an even more severe blow. If the democratic and peaceful countries, under this new stimulus, become more consolidated and united, immediately stop subsidizing the aggressors, and strike the aggressors with force, then the European crisis still has hope of being saved. Otherwise, the Fascist victory in Spain is not the realization of European peace in Chamberlain's mouth, but precisely the beginning of a European war! Then the greater rampancy of ×××× will naturally be an intentional matter!

### Former Secretary of State Advocates: US Abolish Neutrality Act; Roosevelt Asks Congress to Approve Delay in Philippine Independence

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Hoover's Under Secretary of State, Mr. Castle, recently gave a speech at the Republican Women's Club, advocating the abolition of the Neutrality Act and replacing it with a new law. He said, "We should be prepared to deal with all events. This law should grant our government the power to act freely."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] US President Roosevelt yesterday submitted a report from the US-Philippine Joint Preparatory Committee to Congress for approval. The report recommends that the Philippines' economic independence be delayed until 1960. According to the original US plan, the Philippines would be granted economic independence in 1946.

### Ukraine under Hitler's Covetous Eye

— Hugh Folers

Translated by Zi Nong from the British "Spectator" Weekly, Issue 5765

If someone were to ask me whether Hitler will attack Ukraine? I dare answer thus: "Definitely, but he will attack when the time is ripe." In the past five years, Hitler has truly been unable to sleep or eat peacefully, coveting this fertile land, eager to obtain it as soon as possible! But the Soviet side has also long been on guard against Hitler's eastward advance. From the large-scale trial of military and political prisoners in Moscow last year, and from the speeches of Soviet leaders, we know that there is a 1,000-mile-long "Maginot Line" composed of steel and concrete along the Soviet eastern border from Lake Louga to the Black Sea, which was fully completed in 1937. The recent urgent fortification near Leningrad is to defend against attacks on the waterways of the Gulf of Finland, and the Soviet Union's use of huge sums of money for military construction - especially the army and air force - is also aimed at the fanatical Fascists. Because this year, in this world, only force can answer force, and only war can end war.

From the book "Mein Kampf" and other Nazi propaganda materials, we know that Hitler's greatest and ultimate goal in advancing eastward is Ukraine. He was eager to try when he seized power in 1933. We know that since 1920, Mr. Rosenberg has been mobilizing Ukrainians in major European cities - especially Paris and Prague - to strive for Ukrainian independence. Some Ukrainians righteously oppose this traitorous attempt, while others have fallen for the enemy's plot, attempting to use various secret organizations to secede from the Soviet Union and become independent. Rosenberg initially consulted with Russian nobles and Tsarist courtiers who had fled to Berlin on everything, and then colluded with the leader of the Tsar's Imperial Guard, Ukranian Skroloberky, and invited him to visit the second-in-command Nazi General Goering. From then on, they organized a Russian Nazi group, with a branch organization as far away as Harbin, Manchuria. This was confessed by the leader of the European Russian Nazis, who was tried in Sweden last March. This organization also provided military training and sent special agents into the Soviet Union to spy on special military and political intelligence. The special agents in Ukraine also used various cunning methods to lure wavering elements to revolt.

From this evidence, it can be determined that Hitler will establish an "independent" Ukrainian state, with its borders including Ukrainian lands belonging to the Carpathians, Poland, and the Soviet Union. However, before Hitler realizes this country governed by Nazis, will there be a conflict with the Soviet Union? Regarding this, it is best to examine the ideological form of Ukrainians.

In Europe, there are about 45 million Ukrainians, and in the United States and Canada, there are about one million. Among them, 35 million live within the borders of the Soviet Union. Not only are Ukrainians different from other ethnic groups in the Soviet Union today, but their historical divisions have long been clear. Anthropologically, the difference between Ukrainians and Great Russians is that the former is of Tatar descent and the latter is of Finnish descent. However, to turn the words around, because of the intermingling and intermarriage with each other, ultimately they do not have much difference, and linguists cannot easily find the Ukrainian dialect.

However, in religion, Ukrainians often clash with each other, because Poles belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while Imperial Russia during the Tsarist era belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church. Later, they compromised with each other and established a new "United" Church, using Slavic prayers that transcend the Roman Pope.

Before the European War, the governments of Poland, Russia, and Austria prohibited the activities of Ukrainian nationalists. However, they often acted when the opportunity arose. Therefore, they made a sensation during the European War and the Soviet Revolution. At that time, there were independent Ukrainian republics in the territories of the Soviet Union and Poland, but they soon disappeared. Now, Poland absolutely prohibits the activities of Ukrainians, and the Soviet Union also prohibits them to a limited extent, that is to say: anti-Bolshevik secessionist rebel actions are absolutely prohibited.

However, if Poland does not have the support of other countries, Hitler can easily stir up an independence movement in Polish Ukraine. There is already a very complete and powerful Nazi organization in Poland. The November riot in Chember was initiated by this Nazi organization, and similarly, perhaps larger-scale riots are just beginning, and will erupt as soon as there is an opportunity.

In the Soviet Union, Hitler wants to agitate Ukrainians to hoist the banner of national self-determination and secede from the Soviet Union, which is extremely difficult. Because at this time and place, the Soviet Ukrainians wholeheartedly support Bolshevism and are loyal to their motherland. Like other citizens of the Soviet Union, they are fighting for the survival of the entire country. Now there is no so-called religious animosity, and they believe in the Soviet Union with one heart and one mind. This concept is very strong, as can be seen from the spirit of the current Spanish government troops' heroic struggle. However, in addition to this steel-like morale, they also have a strong army. Now, to use Hitler's words to describe the Soviet army, it is "the strongest army in the world, the strongest tank force, and the strongest air force." This is the answer to the Nazi invasion!

### Hong Kong Government Plans to Establish Nine Wartime Hospitals in Response to Emergency, Preparing to Rescue Those Injured in Air Raids When War Breaks Out, and Establishing 21 First Aid Stations, One Every Two Miles

The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to cope with the arrival of an emergency, have actively set up complete and necessary measures for defense, especially in terms of air defense, and have spared no effort. According to the Hong Kong Telegraph yesterday morning, the authorities are now planning to set up nine great hospitals and twenty-one first aid stations to cope with emergencies. The mission of each hospital is to rescue residents injured by air raids. All rescue work in the hospital is undertaken by the St. John Ambulance Brigade. A part of the work is assisted by people with air defense experience designated by the Air Defense Committee. The establishment of hospitals and first aid stations will be located throughout Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories. A first aid station will be set up every two miles. Currently, the authorities need about 4,000 air defense personnel to be dispatched. This kind of talent is being actively trained. In the future, successful training will definitely have good results in assisting air defense. As for the location of the 21 first aid stations, the authorities have assisted the Air Defense Committee in selecting suitable locations, and they will be opened as soon as all matters are ready. According to reliable sources, the Air Defense School, which has been built, will be opened. The school is usually a consistent transmission of air defense knowledge, but in wartime it will become a total first aid station.

### Kong Seun Hall Welcome Reception: Li Zhengyao's Speech, Unite All Hong Kong Students and Youth, Implement the Warsaw Peace Pact and Work Hard for the War of Resistance, ××××××××××××××

Li Zhengyao, the Hong Kong student representative who attended the World Youth Peace Movement Conference, returned to Hong Kong the day before yesterday. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Various Hong Kong organizations and schools, to show their welcome, specially held a welcome reception at 7 p.m. last night at the Kong Seun Hall on Caroline Hill. More than a thousand representatives and members from various schools attended.

After that, representatives from the Youth Association, the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association, the Eastern District Education Federation, and community organizations and schools delivered speeches. Finally, there was a recreational performance, which was well-organized and did not end until after 10 p.m. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Li's report, Supporting China and Opposing Japan:

Mobilizing the World

Chairman, respected seniors, fellow students, the content and results of my attendance at the Second World Peace Conference have been described in detail in yesterday's and today's newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them. This conference fully demonstrated the youth's abhorrence of aggression and their love of justice and peace. This conference mobilized youths from various countries to jointly swear and sign the first covenant in the history of the world youth movement, the Warsaw Peace Pact, which is a serious warning from the youth to the fascist aggressors in order to protect their own happiness. The conference also, based on the spirit of assisting the invaded to stop the war, launched a widespread global movement to support China and oppose Japan, support the Spanish movement, and support the Jewish boycott of German goods. Truly and effectively uniting the youth of the world and effectively implementing sanctions. Besides the youth, the general public internationally also sympathizes with our country. However, according to my observation, only one-third are providing practical assistance to China. This still needs us to develop and expand publicity in order to win more strength for China. Therefore, Chinese youth, in the second stage of the War of Resistance, should shoulder the sacred task of resisting the war and building the country. (3) I hope that the Hong Kong student fortress – the Student Relief Association – will be further consolidated and expanded, so that the work of the Student Relief Association will become more and more perfect and the work of the Student Relief Association will continue to progress. But the progress and advancement of work require the practical guidance and guidance of Hong Kong compatriots and all sectors of society. Secondly, we hope that all youth groups in Hong Kong will break down the barriers between each other in the past, unite, connect, and open a new page for Hong Kong youth.

### Tuberculosis! Tuberculosis! The Number of Deaths from Tuberculosis is Alarming, As Many As Five Thousand Died Last Year, Most of the Deceased Were Poor Chinese, The Authorities Launch Anti-Tuberculosis Publicity Campaign

In Hong Kong, tuberculosis has been gradually spreading recently, and the number of deaths is alarming. According to official statistics, about 5,000 people died of tuberculosis in Hong Kong last year, including men, women, and children. Most of the deaths were poor Chinese. The gradual increase in the number of deaths from tuberculosis has attracted close attention from the health authorities, and the anti-tuberculosis movement is being promoted. The government officially announced tuberculosis as an infectious disease on the 18th of this month, which is indeed

One of the Anti-Tuberculosis Steps

In order to arouse public attention to the dangers of tuberculosis, the health authorities are jointly promoting the anti-tuberculosis movement. Yesterday, they specially published anti-tuberculosis pamphlets and distributed them to the public. The pamphlets are simple and concise, listing the dangers of tuberculosis and its prevention methods, pointing out that tuberculosis is caused by the transmission of tuberculosis bacteria. Tuberculosis bacteria can be transmitted through air or food to the whole body. Although there are many ways of transmission, this is the most common. Special attention should be paid to the microscopic debris formed by dried sputum on the ground, which is transmitted to the body by the wind. It is also dangerous to use the tableware used by tuberculosis patients, so you must pay attention. The pamphlet suggests

Defensive Methods

As follows: In order to avoid tuberculosis transmission, it is advisable to enjoy more sunlight and fresh air. The windows of the living room should be opened day and night to allow fresh air to circulate. Food should be taken lightly nourishing things, such as meat, fresh fish, eggs, beans, green vegetables, peanut oil, and fresh fruits, etc. Rice should be red rice, and at the very least, one-quarter of red rice should be mixed into white rice. When cleaning the house, you should try not to let dust fly. Do not spit at will in the house or on the street. It is especially important to avoid spitting in trams, buses, trains, ships, and other public places. If you are unfortunately infected with tuberculosis, consult a Western doctor as soon as possible and run its guidance, if possible

Seek Medical Attention Early

Then it can be cured. If you are recuperating at home, you should live in a separate room to avoid infecting family members or neighbors. Tableware and other utensils should be prepared in a separate set to avoid confusion. You must especially refrain from spitting indoors. Sputum should be spat into a spittoon. If everyone can run the above methods, the tuberculosis will be reduced, and public health will be guaranteed. Qizhuo

Our Newspaper Special

### Our Newspaper's Film and Drama Weekly Hosts Film and Drama Seminar

— Qizhuo

A Cultural Department Promoting the War of Resistance and National Construction

Paradise – this is not just a beautiful name; in Hong Kong, it really is the location of "paradise." Beautiful flowers and trees cover the simple and exquisite sunflower shed in the foothills of the suburbs. It is clearly a beautiful picture of "naturalism." The clear breeze stirs the melodious music of the broadcasting machine, and yesterday's sun was so gentle and warm. Our newspaper's Film and Drama Weekly invited leading figures and enthusiastic workers from Hong Kong's film and drama circles to hold a seminar here. It really is a rare event where the timing, location, and people are all in the best possible condition.

Although convener Mr. Lu Fu arrived at Paradise a little earlier to prepare to receive the guests, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, Cai Chusheng, and Fei Mu had already arrived. The high enthusiasm of these leading figures is really inspiring.

Here, three people are in a group, there, five people are in a group, and they open the talk box in a close and intimate way. Everyone likes to learn from the leading figures, which goes without saying. It is also an interesting thing to see Jiang Ming, Li Jingbo, and other pillars of the Chinese Art Troupe on the stage, appearing in front of them in their original faces.

Those present included: Ouyang Yuqian, Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, Situ Huimin, Tan Youliu, Hu Chunbing, Zhao Yingcai, Lian Guan, Li Qing, Jiang Ming, Li Jingbo, and more than 30 other gentlemen. Everyone felt that this seminar convened by our newspaper's Film and Drama Weekly had great significance. In particular, everyone gave a lot of praise and encouragement to our newspaper's promotion of the New Culture Movement.

At 1 p.m., everyone gathered around a long table. Chairman Lu Fu very sincerely delivered an opening speech: "Since its inception, our Shenbao Film and Drama Weekly has received the love and help of all the leading figures and enthusiastic workers, which makes us feel infinitely grateful on the one hand, and on the other hand, we feel the great responsibility. Now, in order to further connect emotions, launch collective discussions, establish correct theories and criticisms, and promote the film and drama movement at this stage, we have specially initiated this 'Film and Drama Seminar'. We are honored that all the leading figures and comrades have taken the time to participate. We hope that in this seminar, we can make a comprehensive review of the current situation of the film and drama industry, and at the same time make our comrades have closer ties with each other.

The form of this seminar is very casual. We hope to hold it regularly once a week, each time identifying a working theme as the center of discussion. Today, we have set the central topic of discussion as 'Establishing Progressive Film and Drama Criticism', because critical work is very important in promoting the film and drama movement; at the same time, we also take the current performance of the Chinese Art Troupe as the object of discussion. I hope that all the leading figures and comrades will express their opinions on this issue and have detailed collective discussions."

Under everyone's urging and applause, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian could no longer decline and stood up to speak. He made a very wonderful introduction to the style that film and drama should have at the current stage and how to establish progressive criticism. Then, Mr. Cai Chusheng was polite for a while before starting his great theory. The chairman advocated that the form of the seminar should be natural and lively, and you can just talk while sitting. However, Mr. Cai insisted on standing up, saying that he could see everyone's expressions only when he stood up. Three humorous words about his own industry caused the whole audience to laugh. How should film and drama match the needs of the people's self-defense and resistance to the war? How should we stand firm in the storm? Mr. Cai said this issue was so moving, especially when he said that we practitioners should grasp the correct consciousness, endure the current hard life and continue to struggle in order to win the victory tomorrow, it was even more to the point and touched everyone's heart, and Ge Yangxian even said again and again, "Yes, yes, it should be like this."

Mr. Hu Chunbing explained the topic of "Film and Drama Criticism." The main meaning is: criticism is a review of work; criticism should be creative, continuous, and guide theory.

When Mr. Ouyang heard this, he immediately stood up to agree with Mr. Hu's opinion and reported on his work experience in a low-level environment. A tense, lively, and interesting atmosphere gradually filled the venue.

Mr. Fei Mu said that criticism should not be based on too high standards, and the author and director should be forgiven for their sufferings. He also suggested that the Chinese Art Troupe should report on how they performed so that everyone could have a basis for criticism. Everyone agreed with this opinion.

The similarities and differences between film and drama, as well as how to overcome shortcomings and develop characteristics, were also discussed. Mr. Ouyang also expressed sympathy and explained that the works of curves and straight lines are equally important in the performance; the works of side and front are equally valuable in their art and can achieve better results. All the valuable materials for the War of Resistance and National Construction are within the scope of performance.

Everyone was so happy that the questions became more and more distant and the discussions became more and more extensive. Mr. Fei Mu keenly suggested that we should not talk about film and drama for the time being, but only about the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe. After Mr. Tan Youliu, Lian Guan and others made many valuable opinions, Chairman Lu Fu made a summary. The establishment of progressive film and drama criticism has come to a conclusion, and this is the end for the time being. After everyone went outside to eat noodles, take photos, and talk and laugh, they returned to continue the unfinished seminar.

The second stage of the seminar focused on criticizing the Chinese Art Troupe's current performance.

Mr. Cai Chusheng and Hu Chunbing expressed their praise and admiration for the Chinese Art Troupe's hard work attitude, hard work spirit, and good influence on the drama movement. The reporter saw that Jiang Ming and other members of the Chinese Art Troupe were secretly pleased after hearing this.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian reported in detail how they performed, and repeatedly stated that the group belongs to society, not to individuals. He is just a helper and server in the Chinese Art Troupe era, not a leader. This remark not only made us understand many unknown things, but also deeply moved by Mr. Ouyang's sincere attitude.

The seminar reached its peak. Mr. Chu Linsheng made a clear and correct criticism of the two plays "Getting Carried Away" and "Ode to Righteousness." Everyone listened very attentively, and Mr. Ouyang and the members of the Chinese Art Troupe took notes with an open mind. This kind of well-intentioned and forward-looking criticism, and the willingness to accept criticism, is a good example for the general public to follow.

Mr. Cai only spoke for nearly two hours, but everyone seemed to have "gained everything. Mr. Ouyang and Mr. Cai sympathized and felt the same, and added to each other, thus complementing each other.

Mr. Fei Mu also had fresh opinions, and several others, such as Mr. Tan Youliu, also had wonderful supplements. The future of these two scripts revealed unlimited dawn.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian said that such a seminar is really rare!

"Such criticism allows us to improve, this is an unprecedented teaching, and it is exactly what we need." "We have really returned with a full load!" Jiang Ming, Li Jingbo and others expressed their joy one after another.

The chairman thanked everyone for taking the time to participate in the event, and reported on the plan to hold seminars in the future.

"Thank you Shenbao for convening this seminar." After Mr. Ouyang Yuqian and others said in unison, everyone reluctantly said goodbye. At this time, night had fallen and thousands of lights were lit. (Editor's note: For discussion details, please refer to the Film and Drama Weekly published this Sunday)

### A Complete Picture of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Dong River (Part 3) – Travel Notes Returning to Huizhou, No. 5

— Bai Wei

III. A Glimpse of the Countryside

Although ravaged by the × people, the rural areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Dong River mostly retain a scene of contentment. Indeed, the tranquility and beautiful scenery of the countryside are extremely worthy of our praise and longing. Especially for those who have long lived in the city, once they enter the embrace of nature, they will find that the wilderness is very rich in a kind of intoxication and allure. Although in this winter season, one cannot see the boundless golden rice fields; the green fields, the swaying sugarcane groves, and the vegetable gardens remain as before. Moreover, many villages are starting to set up sugar mills to squeeze sugarcane, listening to the creaking of the sugarcane-carrying wheelbarrows, accompanied by the rumbling sound of the cane-crushing mills, and smelling the faint fragrance of sugar, which will make people repeatedly recite the white-description verses of the poet Fan Chengda. Without the invasion of the × people, how happy the farmers would be in this abundant year! The gunfire of the × people has shattered the happy environment of many farmers.

Although the year is bountiful, farmers still suffer due to transportation difficulties. The middle and lower reaches of the Dong River are only seventy or eighty li away from Huizhou, but the prices of agricultural products are surprisingly different. Taking the main agricultural product, rice, as an example, the market price in Huizhou is seven yuan, while in Sucun it is only four yuan or so. As for other products, such as pork, it costs seven jiao per jin in Huizhou, but only four jiao or so in Sucun. The relationship between transportation and economy is so close. It is now heard that merchants are hiring guards to purchase and transport goods. However, the benefits still fall on the brokers and merchants, and the farmers never get much profit. If banditry cannot be eliminated, the countryside will hardly be able to recover and grow strong from the ashes. Even those who have not experienced such calamities are like this, let alone those who have!

Although the scenery of the countryside gives people a lot of excitement, there is also a sad and dark side. The landlords' excessive exploitation is one aspect, and robbery, opium, and gambling also cause hidden pain. The reporter has revealed what he has seen, hoping to create a healthier anti-Japanese base.

It is said that during the period when the × people surrounded the area and just retreated, cases of "open robbery" and stealing cattle were quite frequent. Villages with large and powerful families are mostly quiet; but villages with small and weak families have become the prey of the villains. Once night falls, it is their time of terror, and they are worried about the cattle on which their lives depend. Therefore, they can only carry their only rifles and keep watch all night on the earth hills or the watchtowers. If there is any alarm, they immediately beat the drums to call for help. When the reporter stayed overnight in Sucun, he once heard this sad sound of drums. In places where there is no government, guns are power, and guns are amulets. The market towns during the busy season have become arenas for the competition of guns from various villages, and you can see all kinds of pistols and all kinds of fighters. Recently, the county government has restored its power, and the elders in the villages have also come out to maintain order, and this trend has been greatly curbed. It is expected that the winter plowing and the future spring plowing will not be disrupted. In short, if we don't drive away the × people, we can't expect to live and work in peace. The × people are precisely the lair of bandits.

Opium is quite common among the upper class in the countryside. A small number of landlords, bullies, and young masters of landlords are addicted to opium. They do not use it solely for medical needs but mostly for the fashion of enjoyment. They no longer need to work hard and only waste their time facing a lamp. This is truly a major crisis for the nation and the race. Fortunately, they are only a small and small part of the exploiting class in the countryside, not the vast masses of laborers. Moreover, after strict prohibition, even if it cannot be completely eliminated, the number will also decrease to some extent.

Gambling was naturally very prevalent when the × people were entrenched. The enemy's intention was to destroy our nation with all kinds of crimes. Although it has subsided slightly after the enemy left, a few local tyrants still harbor them, sitting and sharing the spoils. There are still seven or eight "red treasure" and "pai gow" games in one or two market towns, which have become an open secret. If it is not prohibited, the farmers' blood and sweat will be completely ruined here, and the harm will be more universal and deep-rooted than opium.

The anti-Japanese sentiment of the farmers during the war is extremely high. They hate the enemy and also extremely detest the traitors. The work of investigating traitors and preventing espionage activities in the countryside is quite strict, and it is difficult for anyone who is unfamiliar or different to pass through. One month ago, the villagers captured an enemy spy with conclusive evidence in Tonghe Market, not far from Sucun.

Overlooking the Entire City of Boluo from Hulu Ridge

IV. The Ruins and Walls of Boluo City

Boluo County is thirty li away from Huizhou by water and about one hundred li away from Shilong. It was originally not an important area in military terms, so the × people stationed very few troops there before the retreat. However, although Boluo City is not a military stronghold, every military disaster will inevitably visit it. In the Liu-Yang War of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, it was burned and looted. This time, there was not a single piece of intact property. The locals say that Boluo is robbed every fifteen years, which is quite consistent with the calculation.

The reporter stayed in Sucun and other places for a few days and returned to Boluo City on the fifth day. Boluo is surrounded by water on three sides, with the southeast gate facing the river and the west gate next to the stream. The short city walls are leaning on the green and rippling bays, mixed with tall and strong old kapok trees, which is already a pleasant sight. And Hulu Ridge stands majestically in the corner of the city, overlooking the entire city, and its shape is also very majestic. Taking a walk inside the city, one will feel a strong color of the feudal era. Ancient ancestral halls can be seen on every street, especially in the area of the West Gate, where they are lined up one after another, which can be called the "Ancestral Hall Street." The long flagpoles, the white stone flagpole bases, the golden and splendid plaques, the strings of long titles in golden letters, and the Spring Festival couplets that tout the family history fully reveal the prestige of the local gentry who passed the imperial examinations. And the flying eaves of the study rooms and the vermilion railings and glazed tiles also fully express the architectural beauty of the East. But ×××××, without any consideration, all of this has now been turned into ashes. Some were completely burned down, and some were left with only the gate tower, still supporting the noble face of the owners.

Transportation and Travel

### What I Saw and Heard in Xi'an – A Trip to the Northwest

— Mai Qunyu

A prosperous market and a higher standard of living are directly proportional, so Xi'an is no exception. Goods from outside, after undergoing layers of exploitation, are more than twice as expensive in Xi'an as in Zhengzhou, and in some cases, even three times as expensive. Even local products are twice as expensive as before. Renting a house used to cost only 20 yuan per month, but now it has risen to 70 or 80 yuan; and when moving in, one must send more than 20 jin of pork to the landlord as a gift for moving into the house. With rice as precious as pearls and firewood as precious as cinnamon, "it is not easy to live in Chang'an."

Going from Shanghai to the northwest provinces is originally very simple. There is a Eurasian plane that goes directly there, arriving in the evening after departing in the morning, but the travel expenses are too high, and it is not easy for those without wealth to take it. Otherwise, the train is the most convenient, and one can reach Xi'an directly from the North Station in two days. The travel expenses are also very economical, with third-class tickets costing more than 23 yuan. If you want to be more comfortable, you can take second-class tickets, which cost just over 50 yuan. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the war clouds have filled this route, and it has long been impossible to travel.

In the autumn of the 25th year, I traveled to the northwest, passing through Xi'an. At that time, Longzhong and southern areas were occupied by the Red Army, and traffic was cut off, so I temporarily stayed in Xi'an to wait for the trains to resume.

Xi'an was the capital of ancient emperors, and famous historical sites are scattered throughout the suburbs. The scenery recorded in history and described in the poems of the Tang Dynasty has all disappeared. Among them, the Huaqing Pool in Lintong can be tried by tourists for its "smooth hot spring water," but the buildings are no longer the same as before. What can be used by poets and writers to chant and sing are only the ruins. In addition, the stele forest in the city and the antiques in the provincial library are the most historically valuable. The Longhai Road is a dividing line between the new and old eras of Xi'an. The old and incompetent city, affected by the collapse of the countryside, had already stepped into the path of decline; since the Longhai Road extended into it, the transportation has been developed, and people and economic capital from other provinces have flowed in along the railway. At the same time, the "剿匪" (bandit suppression) headquarters was also moved here, so the market has become prosperous and advanced rapidly.

To meet the needs of merchants and travelers, hotels and restaurants have become extremely developed. Among the hotels, the Xijing Guest House is the most complete, followed by the Northwest Hotel and the Garden Hotel. The restaurants are mostly Tianjin restaurants, and the prices are surprisingly high. The commercial district used to be Nanyuanmen, but now the number of shops has greatly increased and is spread throughout the east and west streets. New-style buildings have been gradually erected in the northern district, and as the number of buildings has increased, the land price has increased from one hundred yuan per mu to more than ten thousand yuan. In terms of road administration, the progress is extremely rapid. The streets have been extended in all directions in just two years of construction. Among them, several main roads are paved with asphalt, but there is still a scene of "incense burners on sunny days and mud on rainy days." The city's transportation, entertainment venues, and everything else that southern cities have are all available. The current Xi'an has indeed become a modern city.

The people of Guanzhong are tenacious, hardworking, and thrifty, but many are addicted to opium. Is this due to the environment? It is said that Guanzhong produces a large amount of opium, and the government's tax revenue from this item is the largest, and the military expenses of Guanzhong rely on this to maintain. Recently, the national government has explicitly banned opium, and opium planting has been banned. Those who are addicted to opium are subject to compulsory smoking cessation, and this method has been extremely successful.

The traffic between Xi'an and Lanzhou, which has been longed for, finally resumed on November 7.

There are two routes from Xi'an to Lanzhou. One is the Xi'an-Lanzhou Road via Pingliang and Jingning; the other is the Longnan Road via Fengxiang and Tianshui. The Longnan Road is used by commercial vehicles, which carry passengers on freight cars. There are no canopies on the top, and passengers sit on top of goods or luggage. The fare is 15 or 16 yuan, and there is no timetable because it is used to transport goods to Longnan and carry passengers incidentally. The Xi'an-Lanzhou Road is state-owned, and the facilities are of course better than those of commercial operators. According to the Xi'an-Lanzhou Road's own publicity, it is the most complete and comfortable. I also thought so in my mind. For the sake of comfort and sightseeing on the road, Huang Huaqing and I decided to step onto the Xi'an-Lanzhou Road.

On November 13, we stepped into the Xi'an-Lanzhou Road Bus Terminal in the faint morning light. At that time, the station was already crowded with passengers and messy luggage. The ticket office was already surrounded by passengers, and I, who arrived later, could only stand behind in disappointment. Later, with the help of a businessman, I finally got a ticket. The ticket price was 26 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen. Free luggage was 25 kilograms, and anything beyond this limit was 3 jiao and 8 fen per kilogram. The luggage fee I paid was 36 yuan. For those going to the Northwest, the luggage should not be too much, and the simpler the better. When I saw the bus, the phenomenon I saw was very different from my ideal. In the car, you must bow your head to walk. There are 30 seats in total, divided into 6 rows, with each row only a foot or so apart. Each row has 5 seats, which are assigned to the seat. In winter, wearing one or two more clothes, one row cannot accommodate five people at all. The seats are spring leather chairs, which are barely satisfactory. If the car is full of guests, there is no way to pass through. The car is small and the top is low. Is it to reduce the wind resistance? It is a question. As for the departure time, it is absolutely not accurate. It was originally scheduled to depart at 8 o'clock, but it was delayed until 10 o'clock to leave the station in order to wait for someone, which has already made the passengers suffer. When arriving outside the city, the mechanic privately transported goods and stopped for a while, and then drove into the uneven Xi'an-Lanzhou Road. The sand filled the car, as if it were falling evening clouds.

At fifty past, we arrived at the south bank of the Wei River. Across the bank, Xianyang stands by the water, and the scenery is beautiful. This is the ancient crossing of Weiyang, one of the eight scenic spots in Guanzhong. The predecessors have a poem: "The long sky is the same color across the stream, like snow, the reeds carry the fishing boat; where is the old man on the river going? The misty waves are still like the autumn of the Han Dynasty." It is to chant this place; but now there is a bridge to pass through, without the need for boats. Xianyang is the industrial area of Guanzhong, with factories standing in forest formation; Xianyang in the Qin Dynasty was forty li northeast, and the Zhou Dynasty was in Biyuan, north of the city. When the car crosses the Wei River, passengers get off the car and walk on foot, because the bridge is narrow and there is a danger of overturning. After crossing the Wei River, the general Xianyang heads northwest, with sand and dust filling the sky, and breathing is greatly hindered. Fortunately, I brought a nose mask to reduce the inhalation of mud and dust. The car meanders along the mountain, reaching the summit, and the passengers in the car have already suffered a lot.

At one o'clock and a half, we arrived in Qian County, hitting the lunch peak, and the car stopped for an hour. Qian County was Qianzhou in the Qing Dynasty, located in the mountains, with a circumference of 9 li and 3 li and a population of 10,000. What I saw was that most of them were addicted to opium, their clothes were ragged; women over 11 years old were all bound feet. The products are pears, persimmons, cattle, sheep, and woollen fabrics. We left here at 2:30 and took the mountain road. We only saw overlapping peaks, and every few miles, we saw three or five families. We passed the Jianjun Town at 3 o'clock, and arrived in Liquan County at 5:30. When the car arrived at the station, the station hotel was full because the buses from Lanzhou had arrived earlier. However, the other private hotels were all stationed by troops, and the problem of sleeping was difficult to solve. Merchants and travelers could only sleep on the ground; while Huang and I, with the help of a Henan businessman, found a place to stay in Ningxia (to be continued)

### It Only Takes 80 Hours to Travel from Zhejiang to Guangxi by Train – Passenger Tickets Cost More Than 22 Yuan

[Jinhua Correspondence] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the only complete railway after the War of Resistance, and it is now the only transportation artery for passenger and freight transportation in the interior. Now, in order to facilitate passenger and freight transportation, the railway is actively preparing for the joint transportation of Zhejiang and Guangxi, and it has already opened to Guilin from Jinhua for the first time at 12:00 am on January 9. There were quite a few passengers. A total of seven carriages were attached, including first-class, second-class, third-class, sleeper carriages, and dining cars. Except for short stops at major stations along the way, the train will run directly to Guangxi Province. It is expected to arrive at Guilin Station at 9:30 am on the 13th, which will take a total of 80 hours. Ordinary passenger tickets are sold for 22 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen. Afterwards, there will be two departures per week, on Mondays and Fridays. The train leaving from Guilin to Zhejiang will depart from Guilin at 19:00 and arrive in Jinhua at 18:20 on the fourth day. The departure dates are scheduled for Wednesdays and Sundays.

### Guangxi Province's Highways and (5)

— Pan Taifeng

And Its Scenery Along the Route

Beiliu is located northwest of Yulin, 29 kilometers away. There are many scenic spots in the northeast mountains. Goulu Mountain is 10 li away from the city and has a circumference of 20 li. Stone peaks stand in forests, and caves are intricate. The mountain scenery and water reflections are enough to rival Guilin. Taoist books call this "the twenty-second cave." It is said that Ge Hong used to cultivate here. To the left is Taoyuan Cave. The entrance to the cave is very narrow, with stone walls above. Looking from a distance, it looks like a screen. Huixian Rock is 20 li away from the city. A waterfall flows down from the top of the rock, and there is a hall to block it. The water splashes down from the eaves like rain. Another Nanmen, outside Su Lou, is built facing the river, next to a small pavilion, where Su Dongpo once drifted. There is a stone tablet with a picture of Dongpo. Leaning on the building and looking around, the landscape is picturesque. The specialty is sand pears, with an annual output of more than 12,000 dan. Those from Tang'an Township and Heshang Garden nearby are the most famous. They taste sweet, clear, and without residue, and the color and quality are tender and beautiful. The price is twice that of ordinary pears. Tang'an also produces lychees. There are only a dozen or so lychee gardens near the market, but because of the sweet and clear taste, they are listed as one of the famous products of Guangxi Province. In terms of industry, there are many paper makers. The products are called Fu paper or Wanjin Fu paper.

Rong County is 288 li away from Beiliu and 57 kilometers southwest of Yulin. It produces pomelos and plants cinnamon bark oil. It produces paper, and its production is similar to Beiliu. A considerable number of residents in the territory go abroad to make a living. During the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China, they remitted more than 3 million yuan home every year. However, as more overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia became unemployed and returned, the remittances have also been reduced to more than one million. Nandou Mountain is located 35 li south of Rongshan. Taoists call it the twentieth cave. It is said that Ge Hong often rested here while refining elixirs in Goulu. There are eight peaks in the mountain, called Douzi, Ma'an, Die, Yunlan, Xianglu, Xianren, Zhongfeng, and Danzhu. Among them, Badie is especially known for its beauty. Yangshan is located 15 jia to the east. It is said to be the hometown of Yang Taizhen. There used to be Yang Fei's Well on the mountain, but now it is blocked by smoke. Only Yang Fei's Temple is left for people to mourn.

Wuzhou is 153 kilometers away from Rong County. It is located at the intersection of the Guijiang River and the Xijiang River. It is backed by mountains and facing the water, and it is the gateway to Guangxi. In the 23rd year of Guangxu, the China-British Burma Treaty opened it as a commercial port at the same time as Sanshui. Its underground leads to Guangdong and Hong Kong, and its upper reaches connect to Yunnan and Guizhou. Merchants travel in an endless stream, and freight is frequent. In recent years, the trade volume has reached 40 million yuan. Customs houses are lined up, and it is the largest commercial port along the Xijiang River. The nearby rural villages produce pomelos and tea. The latter is known for its Liubao tea. The industry includes Guangxi Tung Oil Factory, etc. The city walls have been destroyed, and the roads are paved with wax-green stones, which is quite beautiful. The mountains at the riverside are connected to the clouds, and about a quarter of the residents live on the water. Most of them are connected by several boats and wooden houses are built, which are called row houses. Bridges are built from the row houses to the shore, spanning dozens of feet. The docks of various steamship companies are mostly like this. The famous scenic spots are called the Eight Views, namely, Guijiang Spring Rafting, Yunling Clear Scenery, Longzhou Stone Pillar, Hejiang Sunset, Quanniu Night Ferry, Lei Pond Moon Reflection, Volcano Evening Flame, and Yongjing Spring Fragrance. The Guijiang River is clear, and where it merges with the Xunjiang River, the clarity and turbidity are clearly distinguished. The water west of the city is called the Yuanyang River. Boating on it is elegant and otherworldly. The first thing that catches the eye of foreign visitors entering Wuzhou is Chicken Cage Island, standing in the heart of the river, like a wild bird startled and floating with the waves. In the old days, there was a floating cloud pavilion on the island, but now it has collapsed. Baihegang is located at the confluence of the Fu River and the Xijiang River. The mountains are green and the water is beautiful. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the British built a consulate on the top of the mountain. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was taken back and transformed into Binjiang Park, and a swimming pool was built at the foot of the mountain for people to swim and rest. The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall is in Chashan in the northeast. Guangxi University is located on Butterfly Mountain on the opposite bank. The foreign-style buildings are tall and magnificent, and the scenery is extremely good. The school buildings are distributed very widely, and students and staff have to cross several mountain tops to go to and from, so the school motto is "Climbing the Slope," which is also unique. On Butterfly Mountain, during the summer and autumn seasons, butterflies flutter, and the name of the mountain is truly true.

2. Liuyu Line See Section B above.

3. Yongjing Line See Section D below.

4. Yushi Line Shijiao, also known as Panneng, is located on the border between the two Guangdong provinces. The highway comes here from Choulin and connects to Pingshijiao by water. It passes through Luchuan, a distance of 127 kilometers. It is currently contracted by the Tongli Company. This road connects to the highway in Guangdong Province and ends at Cunjin Bridge. After passing this road, it enters the Guangzhou Bay concession, which is the only shortcut from Hong Kong to the southwest after the Guangdong Incident. Unfortunately, due to military reasons, the road has been automatically destroyed, and passenger and freight transportation has been frequently suspended, making it necessary for those entering the interior to take the route of Haiphong, bypassing foreign countries, which is extremely inconvenient.

5. Bobo Line The route runs south from Yulin to Bobai, a total of 41 kilometers. It is also a gravel road, passing through Fengchetang and Chuanbu two stations. It was built after the 25th year of the Republic of China. Bobai produces vegetables that are thin, brittle, and have an exceptionally delicious taste. The sales reach as far as Hong Kong and Guangdong. There are two ancient sites in Bobai County. One is the Lvzhu Well, located at the foot of Lvluo Ridge in Pingshan Village, Xixiang. Lvzhu was a beauty in the Jin Dynasty, born here. She married Shi Chong and died by falling from a building after her husband died. It is said that drinking water from this well will surely give birth to a beautiful daughter. It is a myth. There is also a Lvzhu Temple next to it, built during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. The other is Huayuan Mountain, located under Shuangjiao Mountain in Langping Village. Shi Chong of the Jin Dynasty once built a garden here. In the past, the towers and pavilions were extremely magnificent, but now it is just overgrown with weeds, leaving only the old site. In addition, there is a warm water pond 30 li away from the city at the foot of Dongling Mountain. It is several feet deep and more than a zhang wide, with gushing springs that are boiling hot and contain sulfur, which can be bathed in. There is a stone room under the mountain, and stone mushrooms often come out in the room, with moist shapes and colors. In front of it is a cave, with a spring gushing out, and the coolness is striking, which is a strange phenomenon compared to the hot springs. It produces stone lotus, which looks like wood ears and tastes similar to Ge Xianmi.

6. Guigui Line The route runs north from Guixian County to Guiping, a total of 67 kilometers. It is a sand and mud road, passing through Daxu, Shilong, Guanqiao, and Mengxu four stations. It was also built in recent years. Guiping was the land of Xunzhou in the Qing Dynasty. The Xun River comes from the east and divides into two streams here. The one flowing south is the Lijiang River, and the one flowing northwest is the Qianjiang River. The water transportation in this province takes this as a ferry, so the goods are loaded and unloaded quite frequently. The nearby area produces a lot of rice, as well as pomelos and peanuts. The most valuable is Xishan tea, with an annual output of only a few dozen. There is a Meng mine nearby, with reserves of 900,000 tons. The Dateng Gorge in the north of the county is a famous scenic spot with historical significance. The gorge is located under Hongshiji, surrounded by four mountains, stretching for hundreds of miles, and there are countless caves. The north of the gorge is the dwelling place of the Yao and Miao people. On both sides of the Sand Bay, the river flows rapidly. The Dateng is dozens of feet long and thicker than a dipper. In the past, the Yao people often used this to cross the river to rob. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wang Shouren suppressed the Yao people, cut this vine, and greatly defeated them, and the Yao disaster was put down. Therefore, it is also called Duanteng Gorge. Looking back along the beach, one can imagine the half-success and great achievements of the sages in the past. Jin Guo Xishan is located above Lingshui, with green pines and bamboos welcoming people along the way. There is a Li Yushi Temple at the foot of the mountain, and Hualong Temple in the mountain, both built in the old days. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Lu Rongting rebuilt the Longquan Pavilion, and in the fourteenth year, Li Delin added the Zhongshan Feige, Yanquan Pavilion and Xie, all secluded and elegant. If you want to see the distance of thousands of miles, then you can visit Xiangyan, high mountains and flowing water, and you will feel the ocean is vast. The famous scenic spot in western Guangxi is said to be the best here. Tonggutan is located west of Xishan, and the sound of the water is like a drum. Further west is called Yanglan Sand, with a nine-story pagoda standing by the river. The so-called Yanglan Pagoda Shadow is one of the four scenic spots in Xunzhou.

The Rongwu Line runs north from Rongxian County to Wulin Pass, a total of 80 kilometers, passing through Rudu, Pingshan, Dengming, Luchen, Dazhong, and Daan six stations. It was first measured in the 13th year of the Republic of China and completed and opened to traffic in the 16th year. The road passes through rugged mountain roads, with the largest slope reaching 10%. In the 19th year, it was contracted by merchants, and the road surface was in disrepair and the bridges were mostly decayed, so there was little traffic and the business was sluggish. In the 21st year, the road bureau managed it itself, adding gravel and improving the bridges, and it gradually improved.

This cotton is a section of the Rongli Highway. According to the original plan, the entire line will be extended to Lipu to connect to Guilin, which is a major north-south trunk line in the eastern part of this province. Wulin Pass is located on the south bank of the Xun River and is also a water and land terminal, but it is not as prosperous as Guiping.

D. Centered on Yongning

Yongning was the seat of the Qing Dynasty Nanning Prefecture, the former capital of Guangxi Province. It is located in the southern part of the province, on the north bank of the Yu River. It was opened as a commercial port in the 24th year of Guangxu. In terms of water transportation, it can go up the left and right rivers to the border between Yunnan and Vietnam, and down the Wu River to reach Guangdong. Therefore, trade is quite prosperous. In terms of land transportation, it leads west to Longzhen and south to Qinzhou, controlling Dongyue and protecting the southern border, and connecting the western Guangdong to the Beihai. It is an important place for national defense. The surrounding area is 50 li east to west and 70 li north to south, with vast plains and abundant agriculture. The most famous industry is copperware, and the products are copper basins, fire basins, etc. Since the advent of foreign enamelware, it has also declined slightly. The new industry includes Nanning Leather Factory, etc. The nearby mineral products include antimony, tin, coal, iron, etc., which have not yet been mined. The residents are said to number 100,000. The municipal facilities are quite successful, and the streets are especially clean. The most special thing is the "Special Chali District," where the three industries of smoking, gambling, and prostitution are concentrated for easy management. This is not found in other provinces.

### Planning Improvements for Tea Production and Sales This Spring

— Xie Yaoyuan

Tea is one of China's major export commodities, with an annual trade volume of over 30 million yuan. It is of great importance to China's national economy. Unfortunately, due to poor management, it has gradually declined. Now, with the Trade Commission implementing control, the tea industry is showing signs of recovery. However, many long-standing problems cannot be eradicated overnight, and if control is not properly managed, it may become an obstacle to development. The author has been working in this industry for many years, and what I have seen and heard has left me with many feelings. I have repeatedly considered this issue. However, I am aware that this matter is of great importance, and with my limited knowledge, how dare I make any pronouncements? However, even a fool's thousand thoughts may yield one good idea. The writing of this article is also intended to elicit expert opinions, and I hope that experts and those involved in the tea industry will pay attention and discuss it.

II

There are two fundamental reasons why the tea industry has gradually declined: one is the manipulation of the market by foreign merchants, and the other is the lack of progressive spirit in management. Please allow me to elaborate on these points:

The manipulation of the market by foreign merchants: China's import and export trade has historically relied on foreign merchants and foreign firms, leaving us at their mercy. This is not limited to the tea industry alone, but its negative impact is particularly severe in the tea industry. Chinese tea exporters, if they wish to sell tea overseas, must in fact go through foreign firms. In other words… (To be continued)

### Selecting Interport Representatives: Preliminary Matches to be Held Soon; Teams Composed of "Ideal Team" and "Possible Team" to Compete

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In active preparation for the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Match, the Football Association plans to select top players from the local scene in the near future, forming an "Ideal Team" and a "Possible Team" to hold one or two selection matches. However, the date has not yet been set.

This is an excellent move. Firstly, the Football Association can use this to earn some money for the reception of the Philippine team in Hong Kong. Secondly, it allows the "Ideal Team" representatives to study their teamwork during practice in preparation for the upcoming battle.

Yesterday, a Football Association committee member consulted with Lee Wai Tong to inquire whether he could participate in the preliminary matches, considering that the Football Association has already internally designated him as a member of the Hong Kong representative team.

According to reliable sources, although the Hong Kong team representatives will only be officially selected after the preliminary matches, the selection committee members have already made up their minds. It is said that the proposed lineup is roughly as follows:

Tam Kwan Kan (South China Chinese), Lee Tin Sang (South China Chinese), Mak Siu Hon (South China Chinese), Steele (Navy), Dickson (Navy), Leung Wing Chiu (South China Chinese), Hau Ching To (Eastern), Da Costa Silva (St. Joseph's), Lee Wai Tong (South China Athletic Association), Fung King Cheung (South China Chinese), Armstrong (Navy).

### Women's Basketball Tournament Concludes Successfully: Southwest Si Si Wins the Final Match

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The 1938-39 Ordinary Grade Women's Basketball Tournament, after more than a month of intense competition, concluded successfully last night. The championship was won by Mui Fong.

According to the schedule, there were originally three matches last night, but the first match, Paul versus Mui Fong, did not take place. Only the Southwest versus Snow Flower and South China versus Si Si matches were held as scheduled.

At the start of the first match, Snow Flower took the offensive. Qiao Bin and Man Hong were very active, but on the Southwest side, Su Zi and Chan Hing were very tight, putting on a diligent performance. Before long, Pui Chi and Shui Sum each scored, their momentum was overwhelming, and the Snow Flower defenders could not stop them, only able to watch the basket and sigh. The first quarter ended with Southwest leading 11-4.

In the second quarter, Southwest's offensive slightly relaxed, and Snow Flower launched a major counterattack. However, despite Yan Hong and Qiao Bin being lively, they often missed the final shot. This was truly Snow Flower's misfortune. On the other hand, Pui Chi, this little girl, was charming and full of life. Her shots were as easy as picking things out of a bag. Because of this, Snow Flower still could not avoid losing 8-18 in this quarter.

After the break, the defenses of both sides performed well, and the progress was very slow. Snow Flower had a chance to turn the game around in this quarter, but unfortunately, Qiao Bin and Man Hong were lively but not very good at shooting. In addition, Su Zi and Chan Hing guarded them very closely. Therefore, Snow Flower could not avoid losing 10-20 in this quarter.

In the final quarter, the situation changed again. Pui Chi, Zhizhi, and Shui Sum were very active, and the Snow Flower position was almost trampled by them. The Snow Flower defenders could not stop them and lost ground frequently. In the blink of an eye, Hua Zhi scored, and Shui Sum did not let others have all the credit and also scored. On the other hand, Snow Flower, Qiao Bin, and Man Hong missed many opportunities to win. At the end of the game, Southwest shouted victory and returned with a score of 38-13.

In the last match, South China versus Si Si, before the match, most people expected South China to win. However, South China was short of Irene, and in the end, Si Si took the two points. This really angered the supporters of South China.

After the opening, South China launched a fierce attack. Yue Mui and Yuk Fun advanced quickly towards the opponent's position, but they always returned empty-handed as if they were entering a treasure mountain and leaving with nothing. On the other hand, on the Si Si side, Kan Fong and Wai Bo often scored, and Sin Wan's performance was also satisfactory, saving many dangerous balls. The first quarter ended with Si Si temporarily leading 7-3.

In the second quarter, South China's bad luck continued. Yue Mui and Kwan Fen missed many chances. On the Si Si side, Kan Fong's shooting was like divine assistance, every shot hit the mark. Although Sin Wan was brave, it was all in vain. In this quarter, South China only scored one goal by Yue Mui, and was otherwise like having empty sleeves. By the end of the first half, South China was even further behind at 5-18.

In the third quarter, South China actively counterattacked. Yue Mui's performance gradually improved, and Chu Kong and Suk Fu were also assisting from the side, increasing the score. The Si Si players were very discouraged in this quarter. Fortunately, they had scored a lot in the first two quarters, so South China could not catch up. By the end of this quarter, Si Si was still leading at 21-12.

In the next game, it was a matter of life and death. The South China players, united in hatred, fought with all their might. Leaving aside the mistakes of the past, Yue Mui worked hard to counterattack and scored frequently. On the other side, Sin Wan defended the pass like a 'woman' guarding the border, putting in a great effort. But unfortunately, there was too little time, and South China had lost too much in the first two quarters, so it was not easy to recover the lost ground. Yue Mui tried to catch up to 23-26, and the referee's whistle blew to end the game. (Basketball Fan)

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment……The Down-and-Outs' Exposure

Berrower Steal

Is a madcap comedy. The story is about a playboy in high society who is always boasting. Once, he boasted to his wife and daughters that he had bought a villa in Riviera. Unexpectedly, his unintentional lie was taken as fact by his wife and daughters. It so happened that his daughter was getting married, and they planned to hold the wedding in the villa. Because the liar had spoken those words and was unwilling to disappoint his beloved family, he was forced to borrow a villa from someone else and temporarily pretend to be wealthy. At the same time, he invited a group of good brothers to impersonate important guests. Later, due to being surrounded by that group of swindlers and being watched by detectives, and at the same time, his daughter discovered that she had fallen in love with the wrong person, the situation became increasingly chaotic. Finally, when he could no longer maintain the charade, he bravely revealed his own secrets for the sake of his beloved daughter.

Frank Morgan's skilled and experienced acting produced a lot of laughs. The male and female leads, John Beale and Florence Rice, also added a lot of romance with their performances of sexual pursuit in the film. Overall, this film is an entertaining work.

Queen's Peace, Model's Paris Convention

Artists and Models Abroad

Is the first all-color comedy of 1938, starring Jack Benny and Joan Bennett. With a lively and humorous theme, excellent and beautiful colors and sounds, and madcap and comical performances, it gives the audience endless relaxation and joy. Undoubtedly, this film is an entertaining masterpiece.

Jack Benny leads a large team of American potters, trapped in Paris, without a penny to their name. Later, in a cafe, they meet the daughter of an American oil tycoon. By chance, they run into a scam and mistakenly believe that she is a girl who has fallen on hard times like them, so they invite her to join their group. The rich young lady, who is used to a life of luxury, agrees in order to seek excitement and fun. So they live together, with no fixed abode, no fixed meals, and wandering around aimlessly. As a result, the lucky Jack Benny is loved by this rich lady.

The performance of the actors in this film is also quite neat, including the yacht brothers and a large number of physically excellent female actors. The fashion show is the best of the performance, and is the most praiseworthy advantage of this film.

Eastern……Beauty Fades Easily

You're Only Young Once

This is a very conscious film that gives young men and women enlightenment on love. The story is very simple, depicting a very happy family. The master is an upright and intelligent judge, with one son and one daughter, both in their youth. When they go on a trip to California, his children all enter the wrong path of complicated love. Fortunately, their father painstakingly corrects them and rescues them from danger.

In terms of actors, Louise Stone is of course the most successful. His portrayal of the yearning for the youth of the young people, and at the same time his own sincere attitude, are very clear. Shirley Parker and Mickey Rooney are also very well-suited.

Dahua……Little Bully

The Little Tough Guy

Is a group of urchins in "Slums". Two very capable actors did not perform in this film. The plot is similar to previous works: a group of urchins are eventually arrested and sent to reform school to be reformed. The performance is also better.

Scenic Star……1938

Fashion Parade

Vogues of 1938

Is a musical and dance color film plus a new fashion show. The story tells of a reality-show family who does not want to get married, so she tries to get the fashion store not to sew her dress on time in order to delay. However, the fashion store cannot agree to her because of its reputation. As a result, she has to run away and work in the store as an extra.

Warner Baxter and Joan Fontaine are both competent. The color is especially successful.

New World……True and False Wu Zetian

Cantonese film

Is a product that attempts to use seductive sensuality as a selling point. It uses a stage actress with a strange and promiscuous nature as the central figure of the film, and uses her portrayal of Wu Zetian on stage and her promiscuous private life as the material for description. The bizarre and absurd content may cater to low-level tastes, but the so-called seductive and sensual scenes are not daring enough, which only disappoints "dirty old men" and makes ordinary audiences feel numb.

### One of the Sports Enterprises in Hong Kong: Kearney's Different Gymnasium

— Wang Xuezheng —

Health and strength are the mother of success in all undertakings. Strength is an essential element of the War of Resistance. Strength is also an art, an art of life.

Chinese youth must possess health and strength to shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation and wash away the shame of being called the "sick men of East Asia."

To acquire health and strength, the most effective, simple, and safe method is to actively engage in freehand exercises and apparatus exercises. Although exercise can enhance health and strength, for an athlete who aspires to fame or to reach the peak of achievement, it is necessary to first possess the essential elements of building strength. Therefore, if we first engage in freehand gymnastics and apparatus exercises to gain health and strength, and then engage in other sports such as ball games and track and field, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. For those with weak bodies, engaging in ball games and track and field may not only be unhelpful to their health but may even be detrimental. For those who are already strong, engaging in ball games and track and field while also supplementing with freehand exercises and apparatus exercises can yield the greatest results.

The effectiveness of ball games and track and field in enhancing health and strength is far below that of freehand gymnastics and apparatus exercises. Although I have discussed the characteristics of freehand gymnastics and apparatus exercises with readers before, it may be worthwhile to mention them again. The points are listed below:

(1) They are suitable for men, women, old, and young, whether strong or weak.

(2) Economical in terms of location - only fifteen minutes a day is required. They can be performed indoors or outdoors, as long as the air is circulating and there is enough space for a few people to stand.

(3) They can enable the even development of all parts of the body, and can also concentrate on training one or several parts of the body.

(4) They are most effective in training internal organs, strength, and muscle development.

(5) They can treat various gastrointestinal diseases, indigestion, constipation, insomnia, and other ailments, and can also strengthen the main organs of the heart and lungs.

(6) They are easy to practice and do not require a long period of learning.

(7) The risk of injury is far lower than in other sports. (To be continued)

### Alice Marble's Secret Method for Conquering the Tennis World (II)

— Translated by Old Comrades of the Court

Luckily, I recently unearthed a good thing: an article written last year by the current American women's tennis champion, Miss Alice Marble, on the secret method for women to conquer the tennis world. Although she was already among the world's top ten players when she wrote the article, she had not yet achieved her grand ambition of becoming a champion. However, around the time this article was published, she won the U.S. National Women's Singles Championship. This makes the article even more valuable, especially since it contains words of profound wisdom.

This article is not only essential reading for girls who aspire to improve their tennis skills, but it is also beneficial for those in the tennis world to read. Many of the secret methods for conquering the tennis world mentioned in the article are also applicable to men. Moreover, according to recent news from the United States, Miss Marble is expected to travel east around the spring and summer of this year to perform and learn from others. Hong Kong is a must-stop on her itinerary, and it is possible that she will give one or two performances here. Therefore, even if you are not on a tennis team but have a passion for watching tennis, you should first read the female hero's work, see how she describes her arduous training that led to her success, and the various playing methods she advocates. Knowing her struggles and methods will make watching her performance in person all the more interesting. The following is Miss Marble's article. "Translator's note."

Our American women's tennis champions, from Mary K. Browne, Molla Mallory, Suzanne Lenglen, Helen Wills (now Mrs. Moody), Helen Jacobs, and BettlNuthall, to the current Anita Lizana (at the time, in 1938, the 1938 Women's Championship had not yet been held, so... because Miss Lizana was the 1937 U.S. Open Singles Champion, the original author did not yet know that she herself would soon be the champion), all achieved their success because they possessed excellent techniques. Among them, some may criticize Jacobs' underspin slice, but I (Miss Marble referring to herself, hereinafter the same) believe that this technique is best suited to her and is her defensive weapon, and I consider it a wonderful technique that I have never seen before. Hasn't she won the U.S. Open four times and Wimbledon once? If her technique were bad, how could she have achieved such enviable success?

In my current opinion, if you want to conquer the tennis world, you must work hard on perfecting your technique. Speaking for myself, the technique I have now is thanks to Mrs. Browne.

In 1931, when I first participated in the National Championship, my skills were still immature, and I was defeated by Miss Harris of Kansas City. I cannot clearly express how I felt at the time, but my expression must have been very sad. Mrs. Browne's comforting gesture at the time proved that I was indeed disheartened to the point of being pitiable.

At that time, Mrs. Browne and I were complete strangers. I was a girl who had just entered the hall of fame, and she was a powerful female hero who could look down on everything. Given such a vast difference in status, there was no real possibility of us meeting. However, after my defeat, she approached me with great sympathy and said, "Is there anything I can do to help you?" This was the first thing she said to me.

Hearing her sympathetic tone, I was truly surprised and overjoyed. Oh, she was the champion at the time, and I was just an unknown newcomer. And yet, she was willing to teach me voluntarily. How could I not be overjoyed? At the time, I naturally wanted to be her disciple and learn with an open mind. However, she didn't know anything about me at the time. She just asked me this, "Alice, you are a talented athlete. I feel that you have a good understanding. I want you to pay attention to the match between Wills (now Mrs. Moody) and Britain's Wei-Storr tomorrow. After the match, I want you to tell me how many times they used slices, drop shots, and skillful spins throughout the game. If you can do that, I will have a way to help you."

### The Tendency Against Formalism

— You Qiu

The tendency against formalism in theory is not to oppose the application of thought formulas, but to oppose the misuse of formulas. The main opposition is to remembering only the mechanical application of formulas while forgetting their true meaning.

The new philosophy's way of thinking provides us with the sharpest tool for recognizing reality and understanding the past, present, and future of reality. Therefore, we use the formula of materialist dialectics to analyze and see through the complicated and obscured reality, so that we can penetrate the surface, set aside chance, and discover the truth. However, there is a difference in the degree of difficulty in applying it compared to mathematical formulas. The new philosophical way of thinking has now broken away from the metaphysical and mysterious stage. It is no longer abstract talk or a diagram on paper. It must be applied in real practice and must have real potential. It can use this dynamic logic to solve all real problems.

However, when we apply these formulas, we make the mistake of thinking that it is as easy as substituting them in a mathematical formula. Without a comprehensive and in-depth observation and analysis of the object of reality, we simply impose a formula based on our superficial understanding. Then we claim that it is the clearest experience, the most reasonable deduction, and the closest thing to the truth. This is the tendency of formalism.

We must understand that these formulas are produced for reality, not reality for formulas. Engels said: "Dialectics is nothing more than the science of the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society, and thought." ("Anti-Dühring") He also said: Dialectics is "the science of the general laws of motion of the real world and human thought." ("Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy") According to this, without a deep and insightful analysis of reality, there is no way to discover its "general laws." If we simply impose a formula, it is a misuse of the formula, which will lead to wrong results. Conversely, if we have a deep and insightful analysis of reality, we will naturally discover the "general laws" of reality. At this time, even if we do not explicitly label the formula, our analysis and deduction will be permeated with the essence of dialectics. This is the true application of the formula.

The easiest example is when we talk about the popularization of literature, which is the issue of using old forms. We will mention the formula "content determines form." But simply saying "content determines form" while ignoring a comprehensive observation and failing to effectively link this formula to reality is incorrect. Unconditionally pouring the new content of the War of Resistance into old forms (such as Cantonese opera and ballads) without changing the form at all, then how can we say "content determines form"? This is wrong. When applying "content determines form," we must not forget that form has a necessary reaction to content. Therefore, if we blindly pour new content into old forms without disturbing the old forms at all, then there will inevitably be a reaction from the form to the content. The old forms, which are almost purely feudal in color, will more or less damage the new content, and at the same time, make everything a failure. Therefore, Mr. Zhou Wen said: "The problem of 'utilizing old forms' today is actually the problem of 'reforming local literature.'" So, utilizing old forms is also creating new literature. Without such an understanding, simply shouting "content determines form" is falling into the tendency of formalism.

However, if we only shout about utilizing old forms is to create new literature, while neglecting the practical difficulties and only hoping to produce the highest level of literary works in a short period of time, and attacking all attempts at exploration, then this is ignoring the "motion and development" of things, which is not in accordance with the "law of motion and development" - dialectics. In this way, it is also the tendency of formalism.

If we want to join the effectiveness of the War of Resistance as the general engine, we must fully utilize the correct way of thinking. The tendency of formalism, we must admit, hinders correct thinking and the establishment of correct theory.

### Air Raid Alarm

— Ren Jun

One of the Miscellaneous Poems in Wartime

A sharp whistle,

Radiates in the long sky

A signal that seems to smell of blood;

——The air raid alarm has sounded again——

Sound it a few more times, alarm ah—

Although you bring terror and shock;

But also bring the greatest vigilance,

——Let every compatriot open their eyes of hatred—

Isn't it so? At your thrilling long howl:

Gritting their teeth, holding back the feelings full of resentment towards the enemy,

Thousands of people are standing on one side at the same time

Simultaneously glaring at the common destiny!

### A Dream

— Lin Huanping

Last night, I had a strange dream. I woke up covered in sweat, but after thinking about it, I felt quite happy.

It was like this:

In the dream, I saw a hideous, ferocious monster, yet also like a man, with hands and feet, standing on the edge of a vast wilderness. Behind it seemed to be an unfathomable trap.

Its body was very large, at least five times larger than me. It was naked, with dark brown skin. It held a spear in its hand, about fifteen feet long, with a very sharp point. It was using all its life's strength to make a gesture of attacking me. Seeing this, I couldn't help but be terrified and sweating profusely. If it were to throw it at me and pierce my heart and brain, wouldn't I have to go to King Yama's office to register for reincarnation? But I mustered my courage, calmed down, and thought to myself, it is an ignorant giant beast that is human but not human. Man is the spirit of all things. There is no reason for me to be harmed by it. It is reasonable for me to subdue it.

Having made up my mind, I stood firm and assumed a posture of responding to the situation. At this time, I also had a wooden stick in my hand, but it was less than three feet long and very small, so it was useless. The surroundings were an empty wilderness, and I couldn't find anything that could be used as a weapon. I then decided to adopt the strategy of "using the enemy's spear against the enemy's shield." I was also thinking of a plan to "lure the enemy deep," so that it would throw the spear over. Looking down at the ground, there happened to be a five-inch square stone. I thought, if I hammered its head with this, it might make it faint. So, I quickly bent down and picked it up. Just then, it was quick as lightning, it was afraid that I would throw it over immediately and kill it, so it threw its spear with all its strength. I quickly turned sideways and raised my left hand holding the stone. The tip of the spear just happened to hit the stone, not only not hurting my hand, but also falling to the ground, so I quickly picked it up with my right hand.

My strategy was successful - its weapon was in my hands.

At this time, I had two weapons: a stone and a spear. Seeing this situation, the monster panicked. Its eyes darted left and right, clearly looking for a weapon. But there was nothing around it that could be used as a weapon. At this time, I was not arrogant in victory. Because it was strong and had long and thick hands and feet, if it were to desperately charge over, wouldn't I, this weak and sickly man, be in great trouble? So, I considered my tactics again. I suddenly remembered the several sets of Shaolin Temple boxing techniques that my father had taught me when I was a child. I had an idea—if it jumped over to scratch me with its claws, I would hold the spear tightly with both hands and push it down, with the spearhead resting on my left knee on the ground and the spear tip pointing obliquely upwards. When it jumped over with all its strength, its head would just be inserted into the spear tip, and its trachea would be punctured. It would have to fall to the ground. At this time, I would hammer its head a few more times with the stone. In this way, it would have to go back to see King Yama before I did.

While I was thinking about the tactics, countless friends suddenly appeared around me, some with guns, some with grenades, and some with knives... I didn't wait for them to speak, I first said to one on my left holding a grenade:

"You give me——"

I had just grabbed a grenade from his hand and raised my head to look carefully when the monster was so terrified that it was running in its own urine and its face changed color. At first, it was slowly, but then very quickly, falling into the trap behind it. We went closer to take a look. It turned out that it was standing on the bank of an ice floe, and under its feet was a bottomless swamp full of muddy water. It had been submerged and could not be seen. ... Morning of January 23, 1993.

Morning Liu You

A large tree that has grown up, even without fruit, is decorated by a cluster of green leaves, making it youthful. A little bird that has just grown feathers can already sing very cutely, expressing that it is a clever little animal. These little birds are mature buds, and they symbolize the morning.

Every morning, I always look forward to meals, looking forward to this day, this precious day, so that my journey of invention will not be in vain.

Every morning, I always have a dedication, wishing for one day in my life; at this time, I am the most refreshed, the most happy, and it can also be said that I am the most great and the most sincere.

In the early morning, I have washed away my sins of yesterday, and in my innocent heart, I am about to grasp my strength, break out of the thorny path, jump out of the rugged path, and wait for the new arrival.

From the faint light of dawn until the sun rises high, the radiant sunlight guides us to a bright future. The rooster's loud cry is an alarm clock, or it is an exhortation. Morning will never make us sad or desperate.

There is a morning every day, and every morning is equally precious, and it is deeply loved by everyone.

Every morning is a sign that we will get good fruits!

### The War of Resistance and Freedom

— Bai Ying

The American writer, Roger William Ries, recently published an article in the American "Forum" magazine entitled "The Ideal of Liberty." His opening remarks are worthy of our reflection. He said that a professor at Columbia University in the United States quoted the following passage to ask the general public:

The state and its institutions belong to the citizens of a country. Whenever they feel oppressed by the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional rights to amend it, or their revolutionary rights to overthrow it.

He asked if the above passage was "red." Some of the audience thought that these words came from Lenin or Stalin, and they expressed great disgust. When he told them that the words were originally said by Lincoln, the audience nodded and agreed that it was the truth.

The United States is one of the few democratic countries in the world where people can think freely and speak freely. However, in the above example, we can see that the people of the United States - at least a part of them - have not yet obtained true freedom, because in their minds, there is still a prejudiced concept of freedom. If these words were not said by Lincoln, but by Lenin or Stalin, they would express disgust. This attitude shows that they have not yet obtained the true meaning of freedom in thought and speech.

However, this does not mean that the United States has no freedom. The United States is one of the countries in the world that gives the most freedom to its people. Originally, the concept of freedom, if understood apart from the epistemology of practice, is empty and false freedom. A small part of the people in the United States (and other countries as well), because they have been poisoned by fascist propaganda, view the words of Stalin and Lenin as untrustworthy. They seek truth based on their prejudice against people, and as a result, they ruin the freedom that they can and should enjoy.

We know that the United States is a highly capitalist country. The freedom that is valued here is individual freedom. They believe that the freedom of democracy lies in the fullest development of individual freedom. This is like some Christians believing that developing the good side of an individual's nature can create an earthly paradise, but this view of overemphasizing individual freedom is open to criticism.

The philosophy of materialism tells us that the category of freedom maintains a relative relationship with the knowledge of practice. The deeper our knowledge of practice, the greater our realm of freedom. The relationship between knowledge and freedom is also applicable to the relationship between knowledge and truth.

If we deviate from a certain degree of the category of truth and only focus on the development of individual freedom, then the freedom of each individual will inevitably hit a wall, as in the aforementioned case of the United States.

The situation in China during the War of Resistance is exactly the opposite. During the War of Resistance, the individual freedom of the Chinese people seems to be quite restricted. Many soldiers who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield lost not only their individual freedom but also their individual lives. The general pseudo-pacifist argument against all wars in the international community is based on this individualistic point of view.

In fact, the freedom that we have lost in the War of Resistance is only false freedom. What we are shedding blood to fight for is true freedom——truth. When a nation is under foreign aggression, the entire nation has no freedom to speak of, let alone individual freedom. But because the War of Resistance is a struggle for truth, a struggle for the true freedom and peaceful survival of the nation, and a practice of knowing the category of truth, the freedom obtained in the process of the War of Resistance and ultimately is the true freedom of mankind.

To conclude this article with a practical example as evidence: If we reflect rationally, has there not been an astonishing progress in the most important freedoms of speech and thought before and after the War of Resistance? This is an ironclad guarantee of the freedom that the War of Resistance has given us.

### Marching Jottings

— Li Huiying

People were getting a little thirsty, and it happened that there were several thatched tea houses ahead, so I pulled Comrade Gao, who was lagging behind, along with me and walked into the middle one.

This tea shed was built by the roadside and leaning against the dilapidated house. Two square tables were placed under the shed, dirty and black, attracting green-headed flies to hover over them. As soon as they saw the two of us old generals sitting down, the middle-aged male owner came out of the house and stood by the table.

"Is there tea?"

Looking very unnatural, he took the local earthenware jug and poured two cups of tea.

I took a sip, no good:

"This is cold, how can we drink it? Is there any hot tea?"

He shook his head. We knew that, until today, walking in the countryside wearing yellow military uniforms would be very inconvenient. Even though times are changing and time is moving forward, the minds of the people remain as hard as stone. Do we blame them? Do we resent them? This old debt has been written for too long, and there is no way to trace its roots.

"Old man, boil a pot for us, we'll pay you, we're not drinking it for free!"

These words touched their hearts, and the person became less rigid and even apologized with a smile on his face:

"Generals, please forgive me, don't blame me for being a petty person, I'll tell them to boil it."

A fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl in the house crawled out of the straw pile and went to the stove to start a fire.

The shed owner then began to tell us about the difficulties of his life, talking endlessly, in such a kind and earnest manner that anyone would think we were old friends who had met again after a long time.

But we were not listening to his disorganized long talk, we were instead looking at a few men in short clothes in the next shed. They were stretching their arms, rolling up their sleeves, scolding and quarreling for a while. The situation was just like dividing stolen goods unevenly. Then, "Could they be traitors?" This thought immediately flashed before my eyes. Gao was also sizing up this group of freaks. (To be continued)
