### Armed Peace and a World Federation

Last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain appealed to the nation to support the government's policy of seeking peace through armament. On the other hand, news from New York indicates that prominent American international relations expert Mr. Streit has just published a new book, stating the necessity of an organized federation of democratic countries in the world. Mr. Streit believes that "only through the rapid unification of democratic countries can world order and happiness be maintained." Chamberlain and Streit share the same goal of maintaining world peace, but their methods differ slightly.

Chamberlain strongly stated: "In today's world, military stockpiles are piling up like mountains, inevitably causing concern and even incidents; a single misstep could trigger a major war." He further stated: "If war were to break out, no corner of the world could escape its impact." This is a realistic assessment. However, regarding the measures to be taken to prevent such a crisis, Chamberlain stated: "Only by arming itself can Britain safeguard its rights and freedoms and avoid swift attacks by others." Britain's national policy is to seek peace through armament, and we have no fundamental objection to this principle. However, today's world struggle is a struggle between blocs. For the past seven or eight years, the aggressive nations that have disrupted world peace have already formed a de facto international bloc, and their looting and encroachment are mutually reinforcing and colluding. Because their actions are collective, Germany and Italy can disregard the major European powers of Britain and France, acting arbitrarily throughout Europe and even encroaching on Africa. Japan in the East dares to "swallow bombs," invading North China from our Northeast, then Central China, and then South China. Now, the occupation of Hainan Island has created a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific. The root cause also lies in the aggression of this bloc. The major powers, originally the decision-makers in world politics—Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union—have been at a loss in the face of the rampage of these aggressive nations for the past seven or eight years. The fundamental reason is that the democratic countries being invaded cannot resist the aggressive bloc with collective strength.

Mr. Chamberlain's national policy of "seeking peace through armament" is certainly not wrong, but the armament of Britain alone, that is, the independent action of Britain alone, is still not enough to achieve peace. At the time of the "September 18th Incident," because Britain could not cooperate with the United States to sanction Japan, the destruction of the balance of power on the mainland led to the situation today, and the destruction of the balance of power in the Pacific has already begun. Military conferences between Germany, Italy, and Japan are also being held in Berlin, with Japan advocating an attack on the Soviet Union, while Germany and Italy emphasize simultaneous attacks on Britain, the United States, and France. In this case, there is only one way for democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to stop the aggressors' frenzy: to unite effectively and quickly exert collective pressure on the aggressors. Therefore, Mr. Streit suggests: "To solve world problems, democratic countries should unite under joint control on diplomatic matters"; and states: "Currently, the fifteen democratic countries of the world should organize a large federation." The organization of a large federation by the fifteen democratic countries of the world may be too idealistic at present, but at a minimum, the four major democratic countries—Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union—should quickly unite and act against the aggressors. The most fundamental key lies in whether Britain deeply feels the necessity of the close connection of these four major countries and whether it has the sincerity to take joint action. The British side has repeatedly stated "the connection between Britain and France," but rarely mentions specific ways to connect with the United States and the Soviet Union.

Now, let's briefly review the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the aggressors. Leaving aside the strong attitudes that the United States and the Soviet Union have expressed towards the aggressors in the past, looking only at recent facts, the opportunity for Britain to connect with the United States and the Soviet Union can be considered quite ripe. On the American side, there is already a great sense of threat from top to bottom: "The United States is at any time likely to be attacked by Japan in the Pacific. At this time, the United States will confront the three dictatorial countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy." (Republican Congressman Mott's speech in the House of Representatives yesterday); another Congressman, Marsh, also warned Congress, saying: "Once a policy of concession is adopted, it will be endless. An inch can be conceded, then a mile can also be conceded." On the 22nd, the US Ambassador to France, Mr. Bullitt, also said: "America's geographical isolation is a thing of the past. Now, America is engaged in military reorganization and is committed to defending the democratic front." American public opinion is mostly dissatisfied with the isolation policy, and actively supporting the democratic front is not a problem.

Secondly, the attitude of the Soviet Union goes without saying. Recently, Japan has repeatedly threatened the Soviet Union under the pretext of fishery treaty disputes, but the Soviet Union has remained unmoved. Yesterday, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, again met with Litvinov to negotiate the fishery treaty issue, lasting for two hours. Togo even threatened the Soviet Union with Tokyo's instructions, saying: "The Japanese government has decided to take any necessary steps to protect Japanese fishing in Soviet territorial waters." However, Litvinov replied: "If the Japanese government does indeed engage in fishing with Japanese warships as reported in the Japanese press, then disputes will inevitably be difficult to avoid, and the serious consequences that arise may go beyond the scope of local incidents." Its stern and resolute attitude towards the aggressors is evident on paper. The Soviet Union is naturally willing to cooperate with Britain, the United States, and France to sanction the aggressors.

Britain should quickly "seek true peace with true armament"!

### World Trends in a Week

— Pan Lang

From February 18th to 24th, 1939

The two weeks between mid-February and late February included the Lunar New Year. Regarding the evolution of world and Chinese affairs during this period, we published an article entitled "World Dynamics During the Spring Festival" the day before yesterday, listing the major events of the seven days of the Spring Festival to report to readers. Now, in addition to what has already been mentioned in the above-mentioned article, we will give a brief report on the events that occurred in these two weeks, especially in the latter week:

Full-Scale Resistance, Overall Stability

In the past two weeks, the situation of our country's full-scale resistance war has remained extremely stable. Since the × army in South China landed on Hainan Island on the tenth of this month, although it has continued to reinforce its troops in an attempt to occupy the entire island,

its strength is ultimately limited, and its troop strength is still insufficient. After our military and civilians fought heroically, it is still being blocked in various coastal areas. According to the telegram on the 23rd, the × army has suffered nearly 10,000 casualties to date, which is a quarter of its landing strength. If we can quickly provide practical assistance to the military and civilians resisting on the island, then even if we cannot quickly drive out all the ××, we can still exert its role in containing most of the × troops, which will help the development of the overall resistance situation. In the West River and North River areas of Guangdong, our army has actively shifted from confronting × to taking the form of counterattacks in the past two weeks, and the East River area has also been able to continue to hold a large number of × troops in stalemate. Therefore, the new offensive plan of the × army in South China cannot be realized. In North China, the × army continues to reinforce Jin and Yu in an attempt to concentrate its forces to cross the river and invade westward, while stepping up attacks on various guerrilla areas in an attempt to eliminate the dangers to the rear after the westward invasion. Therefore, in the past two weeks, the situation has been fierce on both sides of the Yellow River in southern Shanxi and northern Shandong, and there have also been tragic battles in various places in Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, eastern Shandong, and northern Shanxi. However, because our army's frontal interception was victorious, the entire Yellow River line remained unshaken, and the battle progress after ×, and the victory reports from various routes in Sui and Cha, made the so-called New Year's Day offensive of the × army in North China unable to unfold. In Central China, the two armies north of the Yangtze River continued to clash at times. South of the Yangtze River, our army's counterattacks on Yueyang, Wuchang, and various places north of Xiushui prevented the × army from realizing its plan to cut off the communication routes from Zhejiang East, northern Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan.

Great Victory of Our New Air Force

In the past two weeks, our country's new air force has successively assisted in battles and made contributions in various war zones across the country. × warships on the Yangtze River and × positions north of the Yellow River have suffered particularly heavy losses. In the fierce battle over Changsha on February 15, our army shot down seven × aircraft. In the fierce battle over Lanzhou on the 20th, it shot down nine × heavy bombers. Including fuel and bombs, each aircraft costs about one million US dollars. Including the cost of education and training for air service personnel, the total loss is more than ten million US dollars. And it has been verified that 23 × army air service personnel have died, which is a terrible loss for the × air force. On the 23rd, 23 × aircraft invaded Lanzhou again. Our new air force resisted heroically and shot down six more × aircraft, with no losses to our army. Since the second phase of the War of Resistance, such great success of our country's new air force is first due to our country's government's national policy of actively building a new air force, second is due to the automatic assistance of friendly governments and people such as Britain and the United States, and third is the Soviet Union's assistance in building an invincible air force base in the Northwest. The failure of the × army's westward invasion of Lanzhou this time shows the consolidation of the Northwest defense on the one hand, and also shows the first major blow to the Japanese aggressors from the close cooperation between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union on the other hand.

Significant Progress in Politics and Diplomacy

The Sixth Plenary Session and the Fifth Plenary Session held during the transition period of the new stage of the War of Resistance clearly demonstrated the common policy of the two major political parties in China to strive for victory in the War of Resistance under the common principle of building the country with the Three People's Principles, and demonstrated the common policy of the two major political parties uniting all parties to lead the people to improve politics and complete the great cause of resistance and national construction. The third session of the National Political Council from the 12th to the 21st of this month further demonstrated the common demand of the people of the whole country to support unity

and persevere in the War of Resistance. Under the leadership of the supreme leader, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, this conference passed as many as 88 important proposals related to military national defense, economy, finance, internal affairs, diplomacy, education, and culture. Regarding the major gains of this conference! This newspaper has already reported in "World Dynamics During the Spring Festival" the day before yesterday. It is particularly noteworthy that the motion to support the national policy of resistance and the motion to support Chairman Chiang's stern criticism of the Konoe statement actually expressed the deep hatred of the people of the whole country for × people, traitors, pro-Japanese anti-communist elements, and their propositions! It expressed the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country for the government, the leader, the development of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the close cooperation of various anti-× parties to persevere in the War of Resistance. In addition, resolutions such as the amendment of the conscription law, the improvement of the judiciary, the national spiritual mobilization, and the organization of special committees are all important resolutions that meet the needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance and national construction. And Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his opening and closing remarks, especially pointed out that "the historical mission of this conference is to enrich the political foundation of the Three People's Principles, especially to establish a permanent and genuine democratic political foundation, which occupies a very important and glorious position in the history of China's political system." Along with the progress of our country's politics and the new adventures of Japan × in the Far East, the diplomatic situation is also becoming more and more favorable to us. The Soviet Union's aid to China movement is of course actively developing, and the British government is also considering further aid to China. On the 22nd, British Foreign Secretary Butler also reported in the House of Commons that the British National Bank would approve an increase in the amount of export credit loans to British commercial firms to 75 million pounds, and allocate another 10 million pounds to commercial firms to handle "development projects."

Japan Changes Adventurous Strategy

Since the Japanese aggressors have suffered serious resistance in their military actions in China, the dispersion and lack of troop strength and the domestic economic difficulties and the crisis of the people's anti-war sentiment have further hindered their new offensive plans, so the voice of "Japan × changing its strategy towards China" has spread everywhere. The new strategy of the Japanese aggressors is to shift from focusing on the Northwest to focusing on the Southwest, and at the same time, it is actually based on the solid defense of our Northwest and the powerful military preparations of the Soviet Far East, so that Japan × changed its strategy of first attacking the Southwest and threatening Britain and France. Thus, there is the strategy of occupying Hainan Island, , thus, there is also the strategy of seizing the Shanghai concessions! The ultimate purpose of this strategy is naturally to promote the realization of the so-called "Japan 'Manchukuo' China Group" and the "New Order in East Asia," while the current purpose is to cooperate with Italy and Germany in preparing for a new strategy in Europe, threatening Britain and France in the Far East. The first step is to have Britain and France cut off the transportation of China-Burma and China-Vietnam, cutting off China from obtaining foreign aid from the Southwest, and the second step is to have Britain and France pressure our country to negotiate peace and surrender.

The Question of Unity Between Britain, France, and the United States

The new offensive launched by the Japanese aggressors and the Italian and German aggressors in the East and West, , has raised and expanded the surge of anger among the revolutionary parties and progressive people in Britain and France against the government's compromise movement, and at the same time, it has forced the rulers of Britain and France to realize the crisis of the future of their compromise policy. , has forced the British government to consider its tougher attitude. After protesting against the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, it has also clearly announced that the British government will not hesitate to take decisive action to deal with the illegal atrocities of the Japanese planes bombing the British border at Luohu. The close attention of the two regions and the two countries to the Hainan Island incident, the passage of the British government's plan to increase 800 million pounds of national defense bonds on the 21st, the French Prime Minister's declaration on the 22nd that "France's policy is the same as that of the United States, and France cannot cede an inch of land," and the increasingly close cooperation between Britain and France and the consultation between Britain and the Netherlands on joint defense against aggression, show that Britain and France have a tendency to unite to resist aggression. However, this tendency is not firm enough and needs to be consolidated and developed by the anti-fascist and anti-aggression people's front in the two countries. As for the United States, President Roosevelt declared on the 18th that he opposed fascist aggression and called on the forces that love democracy and peace to unite. American reporter Mr. Streit's book "Today's Federation" suggested organizing a federation of democratic countries to solve world problems, which aroused the attention and support of all Americans. According to a report by the American Public Opinion Association on the 22nd, the association's recent poll of public opinion showed that the majority supported the United States giving up its isolation policy and supported "If Germany and Italy attack Britain and France, the United States should do everything possible to help Britain and France." This shows the enthusiastic support of all Americans for the anti-fascist aggression policy, and the opposition forces such as Hoover will eventually fail. The passage of the new national defense bill by the US House of Representatives on the 15th further proves that the policies pursued by Roosevelt have gained the support of the vast majority.

Increased Prestige of the Soviet Union at Home and Abroad

What I would also like to specifically report here is that the domestic and international prestige of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, is increasing day by day. The new trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Lithuania has been concluded, and various agreements to adjust Soviet-Polish economic relations have also been signed in Moscow on the 19th of this month after weeks of consultation. This is enough to show the new success of Soviet foreign policy, making Poland gradually become a wing of the forces of peace from the clutches of German aggressors. In addition, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the countries along the Black Sea is also being coordinated. The new British-Soviet trade agreement has already started, and negotiations on the Soviet Union's purchase of warships from the United States will also be actively carried out. With the start of the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's international status has been further enhanced. This is naturally an optimistic phenomenon for the democratic peace front. As for the Soviet Union's aid to China movement, which is manifested in the strengthening of our Northwest defense, the growth of our new air force, and the suspension of Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations, the serious situation of Soviet-Japanese border and Soviet-Japanese maritime conflicts, etc., is very obvious. On the 23rd of this month, the entire federation enthusiastically celebrated the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Red Army and declared to the world the determination of the entire federation's Red Army and workers and peasants to defend the socialist motherland and resist fascist aggression. In addition, the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be convened on March 10, which will surely have more important decisions and strength to develop the strength of the peace front and eliminate the forces of the fascist aggression bloc. We should actively participate in and resolutely fight for the Chinese nation's liberation struggle and the world's anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle with greater courage and perseverance. We must win, and we will definitely be able to win—

### Industrial Cooperation in Our National Economic Mobilization [Continued from yesterday]

— Shou Miancheng

Small factories have simple organizations, making it easier for the authorities to reach a consensus and act swiftly. Fourthly. The location of small factories is more flexible, allowing them to benefit from sourcing materials and selling products locally. Fifthly. Therefore, although small factories have their shortcomings, they can still have their own strength. Moreover, if they can be operated in a cooperative manner, they can also have organizations such as cooperative societies and federations of cooperative societies, so that they can have both the advantages of large and small factories without their disadvantages. This is the third point. China is rich in resources and vast in territory, but transportation is inconvenient, so small indigenous industries are almost everywhere. The development of China's industry will certainly not lead to the complete elimination of such small industries and household industries. However, we must actively improve the production organization and manufacturing technology of such small industries and household industries. Industrial cooperation is the most appropriate way. This is the fourth point.

Furthermore, from the perspective of rural areas, China is still an agricultural country today, so economic policies must focus on the prosperity of rural areas. However, to achieve the prosperity of rural areas, it is necessary to develop rural sideline occupations, which can be operated in a cooperative manner. The income of Chinese farmers is only a few tens of yuan per year. Without income from sideline occupations, even in a bumper year, it is still not enough to meet the needs of supporting the old and raising the young. Therefore, sideline occupations are the main source of supplementary income for Chinese farmers. This is the first point. In addition, agriculture is seasonal in production, and there must be a considerable amount of time to allow rural labor and time to be utilized. This is the second point. If we consider the economics of agricultural management, if agricultural products can be processed and then transported and sold, not only can the value be increased, but it is also easier to preserve. This is the third point. Agricultural management will inevitably gradually tend towards collectivization, so surplus labor in agriculture must be planned for in advance. The development of rural sideline occupations has the effect of absorbing this surplus labor. This is the fourth point. Moreover, industry has the power to enlighten thinking. If industry can be gradually distributed in rural areas, the degree to which rural people adhere to old methods will inevitably change rapidly, and scientific thinking can be deeply rooted in the people. This is the fifth point.

The above points refer to general situations. At this time of war, the importance of industrial cooperation is even more felt. Before the war, most of China's industries were concentrated in the coastal provinces. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, the limited and weak foundation of our national industry has been completely destroyed by violence. To remedy this, the government has moved factories from the front to the rear as much as possible, which is a good solution. However, at this time, the major cities in the rear are also often subjected to aerial bombings. Without air defense facilities, they may still be destroyed. Therefore, all industries that do not need to be manufactured in a concentrated manner should be dispersed in the countryside. The scale of these factories will not be very large, and a cooperative approach should be adopted. Moreover, in wartime industries, in order to unite labor and capital, it is even more necessary to adopt a cooperative organization. However, the aftermath of these factories is not the urgent task of industrial cooperation. Even if a cooperative organization can be used to improve the management of these factories, it is not enough to compensate for the losses of the industries in the front. It is necessary to improve the organization and technology of the original small industries and household industries throughout the country with cooperative efforts, and create new ones from them. Then, its contribution to the production of wartime industries is indeed significant. If we want the industrial raw materials and industrial labor in the war zone in China today to still be utilized by our side, I am afraid that organizing industrial cooperation in rural areas in the war zone will also be necessary.

All of the above are reasons why China should vigorously promote industrial cooperation. The specialized agency promoting industrial cooperation in China today is the China Industrial Cooperative Association. The association is actually established with funds allocated by the Executive Yuan. However, because it was initially initiated by the Westerner Rewi Alley in July last year, and there were plans to request financial assistance from other countries, it is named an association. The association is now promoting its work separately in several regions, including the Southwest, Northwest, Southeast, Central South, and Sichuan-Kang regions, and has achieved some results, but it is still far from ideal. Because I am aware of the importance of this task and the difficulty of the work, I would like to briefly describe the points that should be paid attention to below, based on my limited knowledge.

First, the organizational structure of the Industrial Cooperative Association itself should be strengthened. The scope of the association's business covers the entire country, even war zones and remote provinces, so if its own organizational structure is not sound, it will not only be unable to actively promote the progress of business in various regions, but also be unable to passively supervise the business in various regions. I have carefully examined the nature of the association's business and believe that, first, its powers should be relatively centralized to facilitate the exercise of all powers. During wartime, actions must be particularly swift. If those responsible are constrained by others in everything, it will be difficult for them to achieve anything. However, at the same time, the work of the offices in various regions must be relatively autonomous, because the environment of the offices in various regions is different, and they must respond flexibly to achieve results. If they must ask the head office for instructions on everything, progress will be difficult. Therefore, the administrative structure of the association must properly determine the method between centralization and division of labor, so that it is neither too scattered nor too constrained, and the work efficiency will be improved. This is the first point.

Second, the relationship between industrial cooperation and general cooperative administration should be adjusted. Since the importance of industrial cooperation is as described above, and now there is a nationwide association engaged in promoting it and responsible for investment, the cooperative authorities in each province will be too busy to welcome it and will never refuse to promote it. However, because both parties can promote this cooperation, the so-called rural cooperative committees in each province are a customary term, and their work is not necessarily limited to rural areas. Moreover, the association is also trying to promote industrial cooperation in rural areas. Moreover, the cooperative authorities in each province also belong to the Construction Department, so the confusion in the duties of both parties is unavoidable. In addition, since industrial cooperation is also a type of cooperative, it will undoubtedly be subject to the constraints of the Cooperative Law together with other cooperative organizations, and the cooperative authorities in each province are the executive agencies of the Cooperative Law. I believe that the cooperative authorities in each province should not strictly enforce the Cooperative Law, so that the promotion of industrial cooperation will encounter various obstacles, because China's Cooperative Law is generally aimed at rural cooperatives, and focuses on the needs of rural credit cooperatives. Other relevant regulations are also the same. In normal times, it may not be fully applicable to industrial cooperatives. Since the outbreak of the war, the situation has become very different. Therefore, at this time, the legal basis for industrial cooperatives should be temporarily relaxed, as long as it does not violate the spirit of cooperation. As for guidance, the Industrial Cooperative Association should set up promotion associations in various places, invite local cooperative administrators to participate in the guidance work, or the association's regional offices and sub-offices should absorb the original cooperative administrators in various places to concurrently serve as positions in the association. If the personnel are already connected, the work can be adjusted. This is the second point.

Third, industrial cooperation should be made to match its name and reality. The purpose of promoting industrial cooperation is to promote industrial production in a cooperative manner, not just the promotion of industrial production. Therefore, the spirit of cooperation between workers and investors must be earnestly cultivated, so that this type of factory can indeed be more meaningful than ordinary factories, and the relationship between labor and capital can be fundamentally improved. Otherwise, merely possessing the beautiful name of cooperation without the spirit of cooperation will not only not help the improvement of the cooperative movement, but will also confuse the public's hearing, which is very inappropriate. Moreover, there are many ways of industrial cooperation, and the degree of cooperation is different. Therefore, if it is said that it is not easy to organize a strict and formal industrial cooperative at this time in China, there are also many ways to adapt. The principle is to fully express the spirit of cooperation. This is the third point.

Fourth, the cadres of industrial cooperation must be trained. This training can be carried out for cooperative personnel and industrial personnel. The industrial cooperation movement is a nationwide movement, and the number of cadres needed will be very large. Although some of the work can be entrusted to the original staff, I am afraid that it will still be necessary to supplement them in large numbers. Moreover, China's past cooperative training paid little attention to industrial work. Although the Cooperative College had a special subject on industrial cooperation, and also had supplementary courses such as industrial and commercial management, the number of trainees was small, and they could not all be employed. Therefore, this cadre training is essential. In provinces with more cooperative guidance personnel, if it is possible to contact the provincial cooperative authorities to draw cooperative guidance personnel from various counties in stages for training in industrial cooperation and industrial common sense, it is a win-win situation. As for the training of industrial personnel, several central factories of different industries should be designated as training locations, recruit workers, and earnestly train them, so that the trainees can have practical opportunities in addition to technical training and cooperative training. This is the fourth point.

Fifth, the operation of industrial cooperation must be economically sound. The operation of various cooperatives in China in the past has mostly failed to achieve economic viability, which is a great regret. The reason why we advocate cooperative organizations is not only to increase the number of cooperative units, but to ensure that cooperative organizations can indeed make the operation of enterprises more economical than before they were organized into cooperatives. Although what we call economy may not be measured by monetary figures, it must at least be able to have a firm grasp of sound development under certain circumstances. Therefore, before an industrial cooperative is established, the capital, factory site, labor, machinery, technology, raw materials, market, transportation, and member composition of a certain industry should be carefully investigated and planned. If there are many organizations but they are not sound, it is better to have fewer organizations and strive for their perfection. The development of industrial cooperation is the basic work of national industry, and it should be able to continue to grow and last for a long time. It is essential not to organize and release quickly to show the speed of the association's work, because if the cooperatives fail one by one in the future, the responsibility will also be borne by the cooperatives. Whether the association's work is tense or not can be observed from many aspects, not just the number of cooperatives. This is the fifth point.

Sixth, the development of industrial cooperation should have a comprehensive plan to provide assistance. In terms of regional division, it is now being carried out in separate regions, but in fact, due to transportation and political relations, the scope of each region is still too broad. Guizhou and Yunnan seem to be able to form a separate region, or even one province as one region. The central location within the region should also be properly planned to ensure that it is suitable for raw materials, machinery, power, market, transportation, and member composition. In terms of business, the question is which industry to start with in order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. Finally, there is also the question of organizational steps. Should we focus on creating new businesses, or should we reorganize existing industries into cooperatives, or should we merge several small industries in a cooperative manner? It is also worth studying. If there is no predetermined plan, then it will feel that cooperatives can be organized everywhere, and industries can be organized into cooperatives, and it will inevitably feel that there are too many threads and there is no way to start. Even if we try hard to start, we will inevitably feel that human and financial resources are being wasted. Due to the lack of talent and funds in China, we must ensure that every bit of strength can be used in the most economical way. Therefore, we must determine a plan, grasp the facts, distinguish the priorities, and proceed step by step. During this wartime, everything is relatively chaotic, and it is impossible to ask for a detailed plan. However, having this plan as a guide for progress, and then supplementing the deficiencies of the original plan at any time and place, is not too late. The value of having a plan is only to determine a concrete direction. However, the drafting of the plan must be based on facts, so investigation work is also essential. At this time, it may not be possible to send personnel to various places for detailed investigations due to time and expense constraints, but it may be possible to select several central locations as investigation areas, and entrust the local government to conduct investigations in other places. Now, every county in the country has instructors. If they can be used well, widely solicited, and then send specialists to conduct on-the-spot inspections of those that are more valuable, the cost will not be high and the results will be significant. It may be worth trying. This is the sixth point.

### Fierce Fighting in Northern Henan and Southern Shanxi; Our Army Captures Wuzhi County Seat; Tension in Southern Guangdong as Enemy Ships Continue to Increase

[Special Dispatch from Guilin on the 24th from Our Newspaper] Our army on Hainan Island is still engaged in a bloody battle with the enemy. Patriotic civilians are active everywhere, posing a great threat to the enemy. The enemy has been unloading a lot of munitions on the island, apparently intending to occupy it for a long time. Enemy ships are arriving on the Qiongzhou sea, attempting to land and invade our Xuwen. Our railway, Beihai, and Weizhou Island in the Gulf of Tonkin also have an increased number of enemy ships. According to military judgments, the enemy has a final conspiracy to invade Guangxi. It is reported that the enemy plans to start operations next month. Our defenses there are very solid, and the enemy will suffer heavy losses if they invade.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 22nd] More than 1,000 enemy troops stationed in Chengmai Old City, Qiongzhou, are forcing merchants and civilians to register. On the 19th, more than 100 enemy troops, accompanied by more than ten tanks, invaded Fushan (near Jiaji in eastern Hainan). Our army is in a stalemate with the enemy.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 24th from Our Newspaper] Many enemy troops have been transferred out of Guangzhou. Our guerrillas are taking the opportunity to attack the suburbs, with frequent skirmishes. The enemy is still rushing to build fortifications on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangjiu Railway, seemingly taking a defensive posture.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an on the 24th from Our Newspaper] Although the enemy at Hejin and Fenglingdu has been attacking for days, they have not succeeded due to the heavy shelling by our river defense artillery. Our guerrillas are still attacking the enemy along the Tongpu line at any time. Our counter-offensive in southern Hebei is progressing. Yesterday, the guerrillas attacked Daming and achieved some gains. The war situation in Shandong is improving. The enemy dares not advance eastward due to our interception. Our army will launch a large-scale counter-offensive.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] The more than 500 enemy troops in Wuzhi have been under constant attack by our army and are now unable to stand their ground. They fled in full force at 8 pm on the 20th, some to Xiuwu and some to Muluan Township. Our regular army has recovered Wuzhi and is now stationed in the city. Also, the wooden bridge erected by the enemy between Wuzhi and Muluan Township has been destroyed by our army.

Surprise Attack on the Enemy by the Xiang-E Special Forces

[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 23rd] Taking advantage of the enemy's unfinished sweeping and mopping-up operations, our Eastern Hubei guerrillas used the opportunity of the abolished Lunar New Year to launch fierce attacks on the enemy along the river. They successively recovered Longping, Wuxue, and Tianjia Town, and also attacked and forced Danchun East Gate. Except for the enemy in Longping, who was annihilated by our army, the enemy in Wuxue and Tianjia Town suffered heavy casualties, totaling no less than 1,000. Even more military supplies were burned and seized by our army. Now, the heroic guerrillas who have recovered Wuxue and Longping have voluntarily withdrawn to avoid being sacrificed by enemy naval shelling, but Yangcheng Mountain is still under our control. More than 500 enemy troops from Huang'an, accompanied by two artillery pieces, recently suddenly invaded northward and occupied our Qiliping yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 23rd] Since our army launched fierce attacks on various places near Yueyang, the enemy has suffered heavy casualties. The railway east of Yueyang has recently been destroyed by our army section by section, making it impossible to transport reinforcements. The enemy in the city has been firing artillery for days to put on a show of strength.

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 23rd] Since Yangloudong was recovered by our army, the enemy in northern Hunan has been extremely panicked and hastily mobilized troops to encircle our army in four directions. Our army saw through their trick and set up ambushes in advance. The enemy launched an attack on the 21st and fell into our ambush, suffering many casualties. Our army believed that Yangloudong had no long-term defensive value and has moved to a certain place nearby, launching surprise attacks from time to time, making it difficult for the enemy to rest for a moment.

Our Army Counter-Attacks in Jiangsu and Anhui

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 24th] The enemy entrenched at the railway station in the eastern section of Suihai continued to invade eastward towards Xin'an Town. Our army met them head-on and fought for several hours. Due to the enemy's heavy artillery fire, our army temporarily retreated to nearby villages, waiting for reinforcements to launch a counter-offensive. The enemy in Lianyungang has been encountering attacks from our army every time they invade westward, and they have not been able to make progress. The morale of the soldiers is generally low, and there have been several cases of soldiers committing suicide by jumping into the sea because they miss their families.

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 24th] More than 600 enemy troops of the Kodama Detachment stationed at Xishui Kou and the Jinpu Line in northern Anhui invaded Wei County on the 20th of this month. Fierce fighting broke out with our army in Xiao County in the Wazi Kou and Yonggu area, with aircraft providing cover and assistance. Our army responded calmly. Due to the enemy's heavy artillery fire, our army suffered heavy casualties and was temporarily withdrawn by County Chief Peng. They reorganized their forces and returned to the county in recent days, and sent civilians to form an anti-enemy force. At dawn on the 17th, they launched a fierce counter-attack on the enemy in Gushan. The enemy's Yun Detachment of more than 100 troops and the puppet army of Mi Ganchen were surrounded by our three sides. Our army fought bravely, occupied the mountain, and threw more than 100 hand grenades at the enemy in the market. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and only dared to fire with machine guns and artillery without daring to attack. After a stalemate of half a day, our army returned to its defensive position and continued to launch night attacks on the enemy, forming a stalemate with the enemy.

### Military Commission Announces Weekly War Situation — February 15th to 21st —

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The spokesperson of the Military Commission stated that the war situation on the north and south lines in the past week, from February 15th to 21st, has been more active than in the past. Our loyal and brave officers and soldiers, in the spirit of fighting harder as they fight, are fighting to continue their efforts. In particular, the brave men of the air force have been killing the enemy effectively, giving the enemy the most fierce blow, making the people's morale and spirit clear about the future of victory in the war of resistance, and have a firm grasp of it. A summary is given below:

Guangdong

The situation on the Guangjiu, Yuehan, and Guangsansui lines has not changed much. The enemy in Dongguan Taiping launched an attack on Bao'an on the afternoon of the 6th with a combined force of infantry and artillery. Another unit landed from Nantou on the morning of the 17th, echoing the Xiaotai enemy army. Our position was slightly shifted. Soon a large force of our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce pincer attack on the enemy from the front and rear, taking advantage of the night. The enemy fled to Humen and Dongguan. Our army recovered Shian that night. It is estimated that more than 800 enemy troops were killed in this battle, and Dongxiao can be captured immediately. More than 1,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded in Huaxian, northern Guangdong. The enemy troops in Haikou, Qiongshan, and Chengmai on Hainan Island were jointly counter-attacked by our army and civilians, and more than 3,000 were killed. On the 16th, they landed in Sanya Bay in the south of the island and invaded Yulin in an attempt to contain our army. Our army has divided its forces to intercept them. Also, on the 21st, several enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Chengmai and were shot down by our army.

Shanxi

Since our army besieged and surrounded Heshun in eastern Shanxi, there have been fierce battles this week, killing more than 1,000 enemy troops. On the 17th and 18th, large forces were also dispatched to bypass the remnant enemy in Xiyang and Pingding. The city of Heshun will be captured soon. The enemy troops in Jiangxian, Henglingguan, and Hengshuizhen have recently increased to 5,000. For days, they have been using superior artillery fire to cover their attacks on Dongguanzhuang and Mishi Tou and releasing tear gas. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely and fiercely, but the enemy has not succeeded. The day before yesterday evening, they turned to Nanniudan, south of Guanzhuang, to launch a flanking attack, but were ambushed by our army halfway. Corpses were scattered everywhere. They are still in a stalemate.

Hunan and Hubei

The front lines in northern and central Hubei are quiet, and our army and the enemy are in a state of confrontation. The enemy entrenched in Jinniuzhen, southern Hubei, was attacked by our army on the afternoon of the 15th. Due to our heavy artillery fire, they suffered heavy casualties and released a large amount of poison gas in a stubborn resistance. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, and more than 2,000 enemy troops killed themselves. Our officers and soldiers took the opportunity to charge and kill, and the enemy collapsed. That night, Jinniu was recovered. The remnant enemy fled to Heshengqiao. The two important places along the river, Jinkou and Huanglingji, southwest of Wuchang, were also successively recovered by our army. The remnant enemy fled to Wenkou, Tongcheng, Beigang, and Wanjia Mountain. Yangloudong Yanzhan, west of Puxi, was captured by our army, so the enemy's land and water transportation south of Wuchang and north of Yueyang is now completely cut off.

Henan

The war in southern Henan is quiet. However, the enemy entrenched in Xinyang was heavily bombed by our air force the day before yesterday, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. More than 2,000 enemy troops in Muyindian, Zhiwu, and Bo'ai in northern Henan invaded eastward in several directions starting on the 17th. They were ambushed and intercepted by a unit of our army, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties, fleeing back along the original route. It is estimated that more than 1,200 enemy troops were killed. Also, more than 2,000 enemy troops in Xinxiang, Yuanwu, and Xiaojizhen were met head-on by our officers and soldiers, and the enemy suffered more than 1,300 casualties. Also, more than 1,000 enemy troops competed from Qinyang eastward and were hit hard by a surprise attack by a unit of our army on the 15th. The remnant enemy fled in a panic to Wuzhi, and our army pursued and attacked them, annihilating more than 400 enemy troops.

Other Areas

Our army in southern Hebei launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the enemy in recent days. In the battle of Qinghe on the 17th, more than 900 enemy troops were killed. In the battle of Daming on the 18th, more than 1,500 enemy troops were killed, and the three counties of Jiaoyang, Erning, and Rendi were successively captured. Hejian and Lixian are also continuing to be besieged and will be captured soon. In Fanchang, southern Anhui, our army inflicted heavy losses on the enemy invading from Digang. More than 1,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded, and the commander of the Changze unit was also killed by our army. In addition, Zhou Xuanchen's puppet army of more than 3,000 troops in Xuzhou, Liu Huzhen's puppet army of more than 2,000 troops in northern Sui, and Yu Zhiqian's puppet army of more than 3,000 troops all defected to our side this week and cooperated with the local our army to bravely kill the enemy. The enemy was at a loss and felt a serious threat. In the air battle in Lanzhou on the 20th, nine enemy aircraft were shot down, and the enemy's air raid plan was completely foiled. From the above, our army on the land lines has repeatedly won victories, and air battles have also achieved great results, making the enemy exhausted and suffering great mental trauma. It is a great rejoicing for all our officers and soldiers in the war of resistance.

### Third-Party Mediation of the War Is Impossible; Foreign News Reports Are Inaccurate; Official Responsible for Correction

[Hong Kong News] According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 9th of this month, Chongqing political figures made a statement to Reuters reporters, stating that peace negotiations between China and Japan must be resolved in a Far East international conference, and that the current Sino-Japanese war situation depends on the European situation. If the European situation adopts a compromise and concession strategy, the international community may exert pressure to force China and Japan to hold negotiations to end the war. Later, a certain translation department received a telegram from General Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission, absolutely denying this statement. The telegram said, "The so-called statement by our political circles is untrue and is based on hearsay. It should not be taken seriously. In addition, the rumors of third-party mediation of the war are also fictitious. Please find a way to correct them."

### Residents Evacuate from Chongqing, Chengdu, and Guiyang to Avoid Casualties from Air Raids

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 24th] According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang yesterday ordered the Executive Yuan to instruct the people of Chongqing, Chengdu, and Guiyang, as well as banks, telegraph bureaus, post offices, etc., to evacuate quickly, and to encourage banks to build new houses along the highway, provided that these buildings must be equipped with air defense facilities. This evacuation work will be carried out by the Supreme National Defense Commission and must be completed before March 10.

### The Yunnan-Burma Road Will Be Taken Over by the Ministry of Communications; The Road Bureau Advocates the Use of Domestic Rubber-Tired Vehicles

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 23rd] After the Yunnan-Burma Road is taken over by the Ministry of Communications, all procedures have been completed and it can be taken over soon. In order to save gasoline, the Road Bureau has added rubber-tired vehicles to be pulled by livestock. Except for the rubber tires, all are domestic products. The journey takes more than 30 days, and the freight is two-thirds to three-quarters cheaper than by car.

### Trial Flight of China-Burma Air Route: China National Aviation Corporation Plane Flies from Chongqing to Rangoon

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 24th] After long preparations for the China-British air route, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) dispatched staff member Tan Huan, along with driver Xia Bo, on the morning of the 22nd, flying a small Stinson Reliant SR-7 aircraft piloted by Peek Clough, from Chongqing to Yunnan, directly reaching Rangoon for the first trial flight. A Douglas aircraft is scheduled for an official trial flight on the 28th to connect the air routes of Europe and Asia.

[Hong Kong News] According to news from the Hong Kong office of CNAC, the China-Burma air route (between Chongqing and Rangoon) will commence operations from Chongqing on the 28th of this month. The aircraft used will be a de Havilland DH.86 type, piloted by Captain Sha Bi. Subsequently, there will be two flights per week, connecting with Imperial Airways (IA). However, IA aircraft will not be able to conduct trial flights until the 1st of next month. It is understood that the route of the China-Burma flights follows the Burma Road. IA has constructed radio stations, temporary airfields, and other facilities, which have also been completed. CNAC has ordered two new DCZ-type aircraft from the United States, valued at US$250,000, which are expected to arrive in Hong Kong by the end of this summer. This new type of aircraft can carry 24 passengers and has a maximum speed of 230 miles per hour.

### Preventing Counterfeit Legal Tender: National Financial Conference to Discuss Measures - A Large Influx of Counterfeit Currency into Occupied Areas

[Our Special Dispatch] Recently, in addition to the rampant issuance of military scrip and counterfeit banknotes by the 'Joint Reserve Bank' in North China, Japan has been counterfeiting our legal tender, instigating Chinese traitors and Japanese-Korean ruffians to circulate it in a mixed fashion, attempting to undermine the credibility of our legal tender. The people of our country are paying close attention to this Japanese conspiracy. To understand the government's preventative measures against this counterfeiting of 'legal tender' and the opinions of the economic sector, our reporter interviewed a certain banker to inquire about everything.

According to the banker's opinion, Japan's domestic economic weakness is already clear and obvious, and there is a danger of it collapsing this year. Japan has repeatedly used various economic schemes within the occupied areas, attempting to compensate for its own poverty, but the results have ultimately failed to materialize. As far as is known, in the occupied areas, the inflow of Japanese counterfeit banknotes and non-redeemable military scrip, up to the recent period, amounts to approximately 25 to 30 million Japanese yen. This batch of Japanese banknotes is being used to massively purchase agricultural products such as food and cotton, attempting to use the power of the Japanese yen to invade the Chinese market. However, these Japanese banknotes are only being forcibly circulated and often encounter rejection from the people. Therefore, the Japanese are also counterfeiting "legal tender" to deceive people, counterfeiting banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China in Tokyo, transporting them to our country for use. It is reported that the first batch already transported to our country amounts to 3.5 million yuan. This kind of counterfeit "legal tender" is widespread in the occupied areas, and it has also been discovered in the Guangdong war zone, but the amount is not large. This kind of action by the Japanese is unprecedented among modern civilized nations. The method of promoting this counterfeit currency is to mix it with the salaries and wages of bogus organizations and bogus personnel and factories, but merchants and the public are strictly preventing it.

Regarding the issue of preventing counterfeit legal tender, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance will present it for discussion at the National Financial Conference to be convened at the beginning of next month, studying a practical prevention method. The Hong Kong banking sector is also preparing to send key personnel to attend. The location of the meeting is said to be in Chongqing. This meeting is of great importance to the war economy, and it will definitely be able to come up with effective measures to prevent counterfeit legal tender.

The banker also told the reporter that the Ministry of Finance currently has eight measures in place to crack down on counterfeit legal tender, but the measures only address how to stop circulation, and not fundamentally prevent the counterfeited currency from being mixed in. Therefore, it is anticipated that supplements will be made at the National Financial Conference. The measures for cracking down on Japanese counterfeit banknotes are listed below:

(1) All Japanese counterfeit banknotes, regardless of location, are strictly prohibited from circulation or acceptance. The aforementioned Japanese counterfeit banknotes refer to banknotes issued by the Bank of Chosen and military scrip issued by the Japanese army, counterfeit "Joint Reserve Bank" banknotes, and other similar banknotes issued by the Japanese puppet regime. (2) If the armed forces or other agencies in any war zone discover anyone hoarding, transporting, or circulating Japanese counterfeit banknotes for the Japanese side, in addition to confiscating all of the banknotes, the perpetrator shall be sent to the local or nearest military law agency and charged under Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors for assisting the Japanese side in disrupting finance. The same applies to those who intend to profit by exchanging legal tender, currency, or remittances for Japanese counterfeit banknotes. (3) Regardless of the amount, all Japanese counterfeit banknotes confiscated in accordance with the preceding article shall be submitted to the local or nearest military and political leader for inspection on a case-by-case basis, and forwarded to the Military Affairs Commission for processing by the Ministry of Finance. (4) The Ministry of Finance shall provide a discretionary bonus based on the amount of Japanese counterfeit banknotes received from the aforementioned confiscations. (5) If any public or private groups, military personnel, or civilians within or outside any war zone know of any secret organization or individual hoarding, transporting, or circulating Japanese counterfeit banknotes, they shall immediately report it to the local military and police authorities for arrest and investigation. After the perpetrator is apprehended and interrogated, in addition to being punished in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, the Japanese counterfeit banknotes seized shall be handled in accordance with Article 3 of these measures. (6) All military and political agencies shall strictly keep the names of the original informants confidential and report them to the Ministry of Finance for a discretionary bonus. (7) If anyone is found to have concealed information regarding the matters stipulated in Article 5 of these measures, after investigation by the military and police authorities, they shall be charged with collaboration with the enemy. Those who falsely accuse others shall be severely punished in accordance with criminal law. (8) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval. (End)

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A dispatch from Beiping states that since the "Provisional Government" announced on the 19th that legal tender would be accepted at a discount, the amount of legal tender in the market has gradually decreased. The "Provisional Government" has also issued an order that anyone holding legal tender may exchange it for "Joint Reserve Bank" banknotes at various banks before the 19th. On that day, the Hebei and Jidong branches of the bank extended their office hours to allow people to exchange their banknotes, but only a thousand yuan was exchanged throughout the day. The general public did not go to exchange them. Other branches of the "Joint Reserve Bank" exchanged around 5,000 yuan in five days. Banking observers believe that wealthy people not only do not exchange legal tender, but are actually hoarding it.

### Shanghai Garrison Makes Unreasonable Demands: Municipal Council Considers Response - Police Search Door-to-Door in Central District of International Settlement - Witnesses Say Several People Have Been Arrested

[Central News Agency Dispatch, Chongqing, 23rd] A Shanghai dispatch states that the demands made by the Japanese side to the Municipal Council on the 22nd are said to consist of four items: (1) arresting terrorists; (2) expanding the power of the Japanese police in the Municipal Council; (3) reorganizing the Municipal Council; and (4) reserving the right for Japanese troops to take extensive measures within the Settlement when necessary. The demands also stated that in order to avoid international disputes, they did not want to take severe actions for the time being, but that the demand to increase the number of Japanese police officers must be achieved. According to foreign sources, the Municipal Council is currently considering countermeasures, but it is understood that the number of Japanese police officers has already been repeatedly increased, and there is no possibility of further understanding.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A Shanghai dispatch states that Municipal Council police, accompanied by Russian commercial groups carrying rifles and machine guns, conducted door-to-door searches tonight in the area around the Sincere and Wing On department stores on Nanjing Road. It is reported that several anti-Japanese bombing and shooting incidents have recently occurred in the area, and the small alleys in the vicinity have been searched, as many of the alleys contain opium dens, gambling dens, and tea shops where terrorists may be hiding. All hotels have also been searched, and several people have been briefly questioned. According to police officers, the search time tonight was from 10:00 PM to 11:30 PM, and no prior notice was issued. However, the police officers refused to answer questions about the results of the search, whether any pistols, grenades, or military supplies had been found, or whether anyone had been arrested. According to witnesses, they had seen several people being arrested. The authorities may formally announce the results of tonight's search in a few days.

### Tashiro Visits British and French Consuls, Also Threatens Tianjin Concessions

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A Tianjin dispatch states that the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Tashiro, separately visited the French Consul-General, Li Bi Li, and the British Consul, Hoberti, on the evening of the 22nd, hoping that they would pay attention to the activities of anti-Japanese elements in the concessions, and warned that if the concession authorities were unable to do so, the Japanese side would automatically take countermeasures. It seems that the Japanese actions in Tianjin are echoing those in Shanghai, and they have been preparing for a second inspection, with the possibility of another blockade. Since the 22nd, the Japanese side has installed electric fences on the newly built roads surrounding the concessions, and will also resume stacking sandbags and electric fences at intersections with the British and French concessions.

### Closing Ceremony of the People's Political Council: Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Address (Continued from Page 3 Yesterday)

Instruct and Guide the People of the Nation: Our Fellow Councilors Cannot Shirk This Responsibility

We must lay the foundation for democracy during the War of Resistance. We must not only enable the people to genuinely develop the ability to exercise political power, but also make them understand the true meaning of democracy. We, the councilors, are the leaders of the people. We must take on the responsibility of instructing and guiding, protecting the interests of the country and the interests of all the people. We must unanimously exercise the authority of just public opinion to stop actions that undermine national laws and systems and weaken the entire war effort under the guise of freedom and democracy. We must make all our compatriots understand that military administration must be implemented now for the War of Resistance, and political tutelage must be implemented for nation-building. There must be no falsehoods or obstacles in between. We must learn from past mistakes and diligently follow the steps outlined in Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s teachings to lay a permanent and sound foundation for true democratic politics. Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s life-long struggle in politics was aimed at realizing the Three Principles of the People and returning power to the people. However, people who have not been trained can never govern. Dr. Sun Yat-sen encouraged us in the intellectual class and our revolutionary comrades to act as nannies for the masses and to fulfill the responsibilities of a teacher and guardian in the position of public servants. This lesson is truly the path that must be followed for the success of nation-building.

Must Practice What We Preach: Set an Example for the People

We must regard the masses as the entirety of the country, as our masters. We must teach them, train them, and nurture them, and finally return power to them. We must wait until they are all established, and democratic politics will be realized. To fulfill this mission, we must, both inside and outside the council, set an example, respect laws, abide by discipline, and fulfill our responsibilities with the utmost loyalty. The ancients said: "When one is upright, things are done without orders." They also said: "Those who teach others by their own conduct are followed." To be a model for the people, we must practice what we preach, be responsible, and abide by discipline. Every word we speak must be responsible to the country, and every action we take must comply with laws and discipline. With this spirit, we can set an example for the people, and the people will naturally accept our guidance. Then, the people we have instructed and influenced can implement true democratic politics. The government's purpose in convening the People's Political Council is for us to jointly take responsibility, to act as Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou. The government hopes that by the time the military phase ends, the work of political tutelage will have been completed simultaneously. In other words, it hopes that the day of victory in the War of Resistance will be the day when the foundation for nation-building is firmly established. The government has such expectations of us, such earnest hopes. How should we strive to not fail them? Whether democratic politics can be established, the responsibility lies entirely with us. Whether the country and the nation can be revived, the responsibility also lies entirely with us.

Important Resolutions of the Conference: Promote Their Implementation One by One

The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is the realization of the Great Harmony world, the freedom to realize the programs, which is also the outline recorded in the Book of Rites. If we, the councilors, promote it with a spirit of love and concern, we can create a national atmosphere of diligence in production and mutual assistance. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang hoped that the entire nation would devote itself to strengthening unity, actively fighting, and intensifying construction in three areas. Many resolutions from this conference have further concretized these points. We, the councilors, must also promote and take the lead in putting them into practice to mobilize society and promote the effectiveness of their implementation. Our People's Political Council is not an ordinary advisory body. We are a leadership body that shares weal and woe, fights together, and safeguards the country in times of peace and danger, leading the fight against foreign aggression. It is truly where the strength of the people relies on concentration, and we councilors, not only sit and work hard, but others can also rise up and implement it. This spirit of not avoiding difficulties or hardships has already earned us great reputation. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, the success or failure is even more important. After this meeting, you will go to various places. It is hoped that you will uphold the common will and resolutions of this conference, contribute your sincerity and strength, enhance our national spirit, and promote our country's inherent morality. For the several most important resolutions of this conference, such as strengthening the military service system, implementing spiritual mobilization, promoting economic construction, and rectifying the Baojia system in various places, it is especially hoped that you will take on the responsibility of advocating and promoting them, each according to the work you are responsible for, making efforts separately, and seeing them all put into practice. Not only will the government receive a lot of help, but it will truly benefit the country, the nation, and all compatriots. As this conference comes to a close, I think of the arduous work ahead. For the fellow compatriots in various places who are sharing the wind and rain on the same boat, I am filled with hope. I wish you all joint efforts to make the War of Resistance victorious and nation-building successful! (End)

### Establishing a Democratic Rule of Law System: Laying the Foundation for Nation-Building - Proposal by Shen Junru and 50 Others - Passed by the Fifth Session of the People's Political Council

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The Fifth Session of the People's Political Council passed the "Proposal to Establish a Democratic Rule of Law System to Lay the Foundation for Nation-Building" proposed by Shen Junru and 50 others. The original text is recorded below:

The principle that our politics should be based on democracy and the rule of law to complete nation-building is well-known to the people of the country. As the War of Resistance becomes increasingly favorable and nation-building is beginning, we should especially encourage the spirit of democracy and the rule of law and establish a democratic rule of law system, so that political tutelage can achieve substantive results early and lay a solid foundation for constitutional government. The reasons are listed below:

(1) In our country's political customs, all improvements are made from top to bottom. Now, not only does the country have unprecedented unity, but the entire nation also has a commonly respected leader. If we can take this opportunity to have the leader lay the foundation for democracy and the rule of law and establish a permanent national system, it will be easy and effective. The opportunity cannot be missed. This is the first.

(2) The establishment of the foundation of democracy and the rule of law requires at least ten to twenty years of effort. The people of our country have been advocating democracy and the rule of law for four or five decades, but there has never been a continuous promotion in the past five years. Now that we have a commonly respected leader, we should make the greatest effort as quickly as possible, so that in the next ten or twenty years, China can have a solid foundation of democracy and the rule of law, and progress to become an ideal modern free country. Time cannot be delayed. This is the second.

(3) In the past ten years, our country has made significant progress in politics and military affairs. However, this progress was made by the efforts of a few people. The systems that should exist in politics or economics have never been established, and the spirit of abiding by the law is also very widespread. For the sake of the country's long-term interests, all facilities must be institutionalized as soon as possible. This is the third.

(4) In recent years, our country has become increasingly unified, and the power of the government has also expanded. Many things that previously belonged to the private activities of individuals now fall under the government's jurisdiction. If the people's right to participate in politics cannot keep pace with the expansion of government power, it will inevitably create an authoritarian state, which will have a very negative impact on the future of the entire nation. Therefore, we must seek to gradually increase the people's right to participate in politics. This is the fourth.

(5) The world's major powers are forming two major groups: democratic and anti-democratic. Even British Prime Minister Chamberlain seems to be establishing the initial foundations of democracy and the rule of law under the influence of these two major groups. Therefore, seeking common ground and responding to each other can increase the sympathy and assistance of the democratic group for our War of Resistance, and in the long term, strive for world peace together. This is the fifth.

(6) The sense of responsibility of public servants at all levels must be inspired and cultivated before it can be automatically developed. Therefore, how to enable public servants to be responsible depends on the political atmosphere, especially on how those in higher positions can make them take practical responsibility. As for the rule of law, one must first establish oneself with the spirit of abiding by the law. Abiding by the law should be a consistent habit for superiors and subordinates, but high-ranking officials should especially lead by example. Taking practical responsibility is the foundation of democracy, and abiding by the law is the prerequisite for the rule of law. Both of these need to be cultivated as soon as possible. This is the sixth.

Based on the above reasons, we hereby make the following recommendations:

(1) Government actions should be legalized. Since our country takes the rule of law as an ideal goal, all government actions from now on must be based strictly on existing and effective laws. If actions are taken independently and laws are treated separately, then the laws will not be able to establish trust between superiors and subordinates, and the habit of abiding by the law cannot be cultivated. After any law is established and promulgated by legitimate organs and through legal procedures, before the law is formally amended, relevant government actions should take it as the standard, and should not violate, neglect, or misinterpret it for the convenience of temporary personnel matters.

(2) Government facilities should be institutionalized. Our country is currently in a revolutionary period, and the actual political and economic systems are largely incomplete. In the past, all facilities, such as personnel appointments, depended on the leaders in charge, so that things had no fixed rules, officials had no fixed positions, responsibilities were not divided, and the system was unclear. If the leader trusted them, they could overstep their authority; if the leader had no prior relationship with them, they would simply seek to earn a living. This is the old-fashioned bureaucratic system of the state, not the modern national system of officials. This is a temporary gathering of governance by people, not the permanent rule of law of the state. Therefore, all facilities of the government from now on must be institutionalized, so that the entire organization of the government becomes a sound function. Once launched, each department can exert its greatest and most vigilant efficiency, so that this entire function conforms to the principles of modern government administration. The important reforms that should be carried out in related systems are described below:

(A) The civil service system must be established. Personnel appointments must be based on talent, so that the virtuous are in position and the capable are in office. Historically, in our country's officialdom, personnel appointments were often based on relatives or acquaintances, with the likes and dislikes and closeness of the leader as the standard for personnel advancement and demotion. This has been the accumulation of thousands of years, and has now been somewhat corrected, but unfortunately it is still far from being completely eliminated. In addition to this, it seems that there is nothing more important than implementing the civil service system (also known as the civil service system) in all parts. After the widespread implementation of this system, on the negative side, it can restrict the abuse of private power; on the positive side, it can exert fairness and encourage talent. This is the great way to embrace the people.

(B) The powers and responsibilities of public servants must be clearly defined. In today's political circles in our country, public servants either have power without responsibility or responsibility without power. As a result, often no one is responsible for anything, and it is impossible to hold anyone accountable. In the future, powers and responsibilities should be clearly defined, so that those with responsibility must have sufficient power to match it, and then everyone can do their best, and the practical responsibility for success or failure will also have a clear source.

(C) The organization of agencies must be clear. One thing should never be entrusted to several agencies for execution, otherwise no agency will be willing to take full responsibility. If they cannot take full responsibility, they will clash with each other, and nothing will be accomplished. Moreover, our country's government agencies often act independently and have little contact with each other. If something requires cooperation with other agencies, it is often impossible to obtain the necessary cooperation. Therefore, the relationship between agencies must be clear to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.

(3) The government system should be democratized. The aim of our country's politics should be democracy, which is a consistent requirement from top to bottom. Therefore, what is currently being discussed is not this aim, but how to achieve this aim gradually and steadily. The following methods are hereby proposed: Before constitutional government is implemented in our country, the fact that politics should be guided by the Kuomintang and that the government should be organized by the Kuomintang has been recognized by the people of the whole country and should not be changed. However, the government organized and guided by the party should still be accountable to the people. If the people express dissatisfaction with the government in accordance with the law, and the government still cannot find a way to satisfy the people, the party should make corrections or reorganizations based on the severity of the situation. The party should use the existing People's Political Council or an improved and strengthened People's Political Council with more representation of the people as a body of public opinion, and use gradual methods to give it the power to supervise the administration in accordance with the law. Whether the above suggestions are appropriate is respectfully awaiting public decision.

### British Foreign Secretary Reaffirms Close Anglo-French Ties, Not a Threat to Third Countries, No Mediation Planned for Franco-Italian Dispute

[Reuters, London, 23rd] In response to questions in the House of Lords today regarding Anglo-French relations, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration on Anglo-French unity was clear and unambiguous, and that it would be a great mistake to think there were any reservations in it. "To explain it in a common analogy, the Prime Minister's declaration is like the warning sign often seen at country road corners: 'Main Road Ahead, Proceed with Caution.'" The purpose of the declaration was such. There was no difference of opinion between Britain and France on any issue, so there was no need to repeatedly state the connection between the two countries. Soon, the British people will welcome the French head of state (referring to the French President and his wife's visit to Britain in response to the British King and Queen's visit to France last year), which will be an opportunity to solemnly reaffirm the unity between Britain and France. Halifax stated, "The people of Britain and France have long considered the unity of the two countries to be beyond question, but some quarters have had various misunderstandings, so we have had to use emphatic language to clarify it. Our unity with France is not only due to geographical circumstances, but also to the convergence of interests and the similarity of views between the two countries. These factors that promote the unity of the two countries are the best guarantee of their unity. Some people believe that in certain circumstances, one country's policy subordinating to another would be dangerous, but in fact, this danger does not exist." Halifax emphasized that the unity of Britain and France was not intended to threaten third countries, and never would be. The past actions of the British and French governments and their efforts to maintain peace were enough to prove this point. Halifax then discussed the Franco-Italian dispute, saying, "In one sense, the Franco-Italian dispute has no major relationship with Britain," but in another sense, the Franco-Italian dispute has a direct and close relationship with Britain, because we have a close relationship with France, and we want to improve our relationship with Italy, and we want to do everything we can to maintain harmonious relations." Halifax went on to point out that neither France nor Italy had expressed a desire for a third country to mediate, so unless the two countries had this desire, there would be no mediation of the Franco-Italian dispute. Currently, the Italian government has not formally stated its points of contention with France. Halifax then mentioned that Britain often suffered from misunderstandings, saying, "Everyone in the world knows that there are no warmongers in the country now. We dare say that there is no party or politician in the country that advocates aggressive war, and this kind of warmongering policy cannot gain national support. However, there are people in other countries who are mistaken, they think that our hope for peace means weakness, cowardice, or lack of determination. I want to clearly state that this kind of view is completely wrong. Leaders of various governments have repeatedly stated that war is not beneficial to the victor either. This view has truth, and the people of Britain and France are familiar with it, so it is not surprising that they accuse us of using war as a tool to implement national policy. But this does not mean that the people of Britain and France are unwilling to use force to resist foreign threats to their lives, independence, and major interests." Halifax then quoted Hitler's words in "Mein Kampf," saying that the Germans had miscalculated the British Empire and its people before the last war, saying, "Our resources are still very rich, our spirit has not changed, we do not want to test our abilities, because we firmly believe that war can only increase difficulties, and any problem can be resolved through full and frank discussion. What the government hopes most is that the international situation will allow us to seek solutions to some of the problems that concern us. On the other hand, anyone who understands the British people will know that when necessary, the British people of today are as determined to defend their freedom as they were in the past."

[Reuters, London, 24th] In the British House of Commons last night, Labour MP Mr. Fletcher asked whether the government's policy was still not to conscript a large number of infantry to be deployed to the European continent. The Prime Minister replied that the government's policy was to proceed in accordance with this year's army plan, and that the plan was drawn up in accordance with the needs of various parts of the world. Mr. Fletcher then asked how this was consistent with Home Secretary Hoare's announcement last year that we would cooperate with France if it was attacked. Chamberlain replied, "I think this question is not appropriate to discuss much in the current situation."

[Central News Agency, Rome, 23rd] According to well-informed sources and Italian newspapers, Britain is currently trying to mediate the dispute between France and Italy. It is reported that the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Noel Charles, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano have met in the past few days to discuss the adjustment of Franco-Italian relations and general European issues. The Rome People's Daily correspondent in London said that according to British sources, Sir Noel Charles and Ciano discussed the question of Italian and French territory.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 23rd] The British Daily Express published news saying that Prime Minister Chamberlain wanted to mediate between France and Italy. The Carino newspaper commented that Italy absolutely does not need a mediator. The Italian people are very clear about the rights they should enjoy. If the land they should get cannot be obtained by peaceful means, then it should be occupied by force. In any case, even if Italy accepts a third party to mediate, it would rather have German leader Adolf Hitler do it.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] Local officials recently announced that the sea, land, and air of the French port of Djibouti in East Africa are now defended by 3,000 indigenous soldiers, 30 aircraft, cruisers, and torpedo boats. It is impossible for other countries to take action against this port. Regarding the Italian newspaper report that Britain intends to mediate between France and Italy, local people say that Italy has been in a stalemate for three months since it abolished the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. If there is any international mediation action, it will only allow Italy to extricate itself from this stalemate.

### Naval and Air Bases, US House of Representatives Passes Bill to Add Them, But Vetoes Guam Fortification Bill, Congressmen Urge Attention to Japanese Ambitions

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] The bill proposed by Vincent, Chairman of the House of Representatives Naval Affairs Committee, to spend $62 million to add 12 naval aviation bases in the Alaska Peninsula and the Paşama Region in the Pacific Ocean, was continued to be discussed by the House of Representatives and passed with 193 votes to 164 votes. The amendment proposed by New Jersey Democratic Congressman Satterlee to remove the clause on building an airfield in Guam from the original bill was passed by a large majority of 368 votes to 4 votes. The total cost of all other clauses in the original bill was also reduced from $53 million to $48 million. The bill will be transferred to the Senate for discussion.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The bill to allocate $5 million to improve the Guam naval and air base was debated in the US House of Representatives for three days and was finally vetoed today. However, according to the rules of the US House of Representatives, the motion can still be reconsidered.

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Local diplomatic experts commented on the House of Representatives' veto of the Guam fortification bill, saying that this was the first step in testing the United States' future determination in the Far East. Some officials who supported the bill said that the bill was "an answer to dictators" and believed that the vote count had been enough to prove that the United States was gradually abandoning its isolationist policy. Others believed that the Philippines should also be fortified at the same time as Guam to achieve a strategic advantage.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] When the House of Representatives discussed the national defense plan, Republican Congressman Mott said that in the days to come, Japan would attack the United States in the Pacific. He warned that the United States was in danger of being attacked by a coalition of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Congressman Wickson criticized Congress for ignoring Japan's ambitions and shouted, "Japan bombed the Panay without asking us in advance." Mr. Maas urged not to give up an inch of sovereign territory, softening day by day is endless, if an inch is lost, "the country is in danger," and so on.

German Newspapers Maliciously Criticize

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The German "Posen Daily" declared today, "We cannot find the face of his peace angel from Roosevelt, but only see his resentment towards communist countries." The newspaper believed that the US's increasing defense of Guam and establishing naval bases in the Pacific were all revealed to the British former Foreign Secretary Eden during his visit to the United States last December. The newspaper said, "It is unknown whether Eden's suggestion was a personal opinion or whether he was ordered to do so, but there are only two possibilities. First, whether there is a secret plan between Britain and the United States to allocate world territory. Second, whether the United States' attacks and propaganda against Germany and countries friendly to Germany are only to divert people's attention in order to promote its important policies. Which of these two is true depends on whether the Pacific naval base is indeed Eden's suggestion." The newspaper concluded, "Is it possible that the United States will listen to the words of a third country and place its hidden danger before Japan?"

### Leon Blum to Visit the United States Soon to Discuss the World Situation

[Associated Press, Rome, 24th] According to reports from the Italian official news agency, former French Prime Minister Leon Blum will soon visit the United States to discuss the world situation with President Roosevelt.

### Relations Between Italy and Albania Deteriorate

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] According to people from Albania, relations between Italy and Albania have recently deteriorated. Italy is now planning to occupy many Albanian ports. The Albanian government is consulting Yugoslavia and purchasing arms to strengthen its national defense. It is said that King Zog I of Albania is about to abdicate. Local political figures recently commented that when Mussolini withdraws his volunteers from Spain in the future, he may want to find a way out in a place adjacent to Italy in order to appease public opinion. If Italy takes this action, then the mutual relations between the country and Yugoslavia will definitely be extremely tense.

### Soviet Red Army Celebrates Army Day

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 24th] The Soviet Union held celebrations for the founding of the Red Army yesterday. All Red Army soldiers, sailors, and airmen swore to be loyal and brave to the country, obey discipline, and perform their duties with extreme caution. After each soldier and officer took the oath, they signed the oath to show their seriousness.

### Netherlands Orders Two Giant Cruisers

[Reuters, The Hague, 24th] According to authoritative sources, the Dutch government has ordered two giant cruisers, each capable of traveling at 33 knots per hour. After the ships are built, they will become the largest of the Dutch warships.

### Japan Building Ships in Large Numbers to Compete with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Admiral Yonai to Submit New Plan to Parliament, Ship Construction Program Strictly Secret

[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th] Japanese Navy Minister Yonai recently announced at a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Subcommittee that he would soon submit a new ship construction plan to Parliament to compete with the ship construction plans of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other powerful countries. Therefore, he will submit a supplementary budget to Parliament at the end of this month. Navy Minister Yonai once declared in mid-last month, "When the US Congress holds meetings, naval ship construction plans are often discussed, and all relevant parties cannot ignore this matter. Japanese naval policy is not a policy of implementing threats and aggression, but the situation may change, so the Japanese government must re-examine its naval plan." The details of the Japanese naval plan have not been disclosed. It is generally believed that even after it is submitted to Parliament, it will not be made public, because the Japanese navy has kept its ship construction plan extremely secret since it withdrew from the London Naval Conference. Since Japan is not restricted by any naval treaty, it does not have to make its naval plan public or exchange opinions with other countries. However, Japan may exchange opinions on naval plans with Germany and Italy. It is not yet known whether this new naval plan is an expansion of the "Third Naval Replenishment Plan" currently under construction or the "Fourth Naval Replenishment Plan," but its intention is obviously to increase the strength of the Third Plan. According to the Japanese naval replenishment plan, it began as early as 1930. At that time, after the London Naval Treaty, the First Naval Replenishment Plan was formulated, scheduled for three years, allocating 372,000,000 yen (equivalent to £22 million). However, this plan was not completed until 1936, with 4 cruisers of 8,500 tons, 1 aircraft carrier of 7,100 tons, 12 destroyers, 9 submarines, 1 submarine tender, 13 small ships (such as light gunboats, etc.), and 14 seaplane teams. In January 1933, the Japanese Congress discussed and passed the Third Naval Replenishment Plan, stipulating that it be completed by the end of 1936, including 1 aircraft carrier of 8,000 tons, 1 cruiser of 8,500 tons, 7 destroyers, 6 submarines, 1 minelayer, 8 mineboats and submarine chasers, and 5 seaplane teams. In July of the same year, Japan, in view of the competition among the major naval powers, further expanded the Second Plan, adding 1 aircraft carrier of 10,000 tons, 1 cruiser of 8,500 tons, 7 destroyers, and 3 seaplane teams. The total cost of the Second Plan was approximately 600 million yen (equivalent to £35 million). In 1937, the Japanese Navy began the Third Replenishment Plan and included the funds for the new five-year ship construction plan in the budget and submitted it to Parliament. This naval plan required approximately 1.2 billion yen (equivalent to £70 million), of which approximately 800 million yen or more was used to build new ships. The official secrets of the ship construction program for this plan are strictly guarded, but it is generally believed that there are 4 battleships of 40,000 tons (equipped with several large cannons with a bore of 16 inches), 2 aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc., and the strength of the seaplane team is enhanced. This plan supplements the Third Ship Construction Plan that began in 1937. Japan is now striving for an unlimited naval race.

### Giant Boeing Plane Flies to Honolulu

[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 24th] The Pan American Airways Boeing giant clipper airliner, flying from San Francisco to Hong Kong, arrived in Honolulu today. The plane is worth 10 million US dollars. This is its maiden voyage. The interior is very luxurious and has a room prepared for honeymooning couples. The plane's speed is 150 miles per hour.

### British Colonial Supplementary Budget Debated in the House of Commons, MacDonald Requests Appropriation

[Reuters, London, 24th] When the House of Lords discussed the £3,044,000 colonial supplementary budget yesterday, Colonial Secretary MacDonald requested an appropriation of £7,500 for the Gilbert and Ellis Islands. MacDonald explained that since the progress of air traffic in recent years, some islands that were originally unimportant will be important stopover stations in the trans-Pacific voyage. Christmas Island and Canton Island are examples of this. There are currently three such islands, and officials have been sent to each island. The £7,500 is for the salaries and office expenses of these officials. Regarding Canton Island, MacDonald said that Britain also wanted to obtain it. Now Britain and the United States have generally agreed to adopt joint management in the next few years. The two governments are now discussing all management methods in detail, and a satisfactory decision will be made soon. At the same time, both parties have representatives on Canton Island.

### Franco's Guarantees Satisfy Britain and France, Recognition in Two or Three Days, France to Request Confidence from the House

[Reuters, London, 24th] Local British authorities do not believe the current widespread rumors that Britain and France will make a final effort for peace in Spain before recognizing the Franco regime. They firmly believe that formal recognition can be announced in two or three days. At the same time, as far as Britain is concerned, there is no intention to propose exchange conditions in the recognition.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Regarding the evolution of events in Spain, rapid progress has now been made to the climax. Since the French representative to the Franco government, Billard, met with the rebel general Cordara this morning, Daladier will not present the debate in Parliament, but will directly ask the House of Representatives this afternoon to express confidence in the government's legal recognition of the Franco government. It is believed that France's formal recognition can be announced on the 27th, and Britain may also hold it at the same time. Mr. Billard said that after his meeting with General Cordara last night, today's meeting has come to an end. He had obtained a good impression during his talks in Burgos. The Paris talks were only to discuss unfinished odds and ends.

[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] After consultations, British and French representatives believed that Franco's guarantees were satisfactory, and only some minor issues remained, which would not affect the recognition of the Franco government.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] It was learned that the French Foreign Ministry sent Mr. Billard to Burgos and arrived last night. His mission was to notify General Franco that the French government had in principle decided to give the Spanish rebel government legal recognition. It was learned that the legal recognition will be implemented at the beginning of next week. Parisians believe that the British government will announce the recognition of the rebel government on Monday as well.

[Reuters, The Hague, 23rd] According to official announcements, the Dutch government has decided to legally recognize the Franco government.

### New Dawn in the European Situation (Continued)

The current situation is indeed much better than it was then. Especially on the issue of the Sino-Japanese War, the active attitude of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has already allowed us to say: As long as we do not compromise halfway and the puppet regime of the traitors cannot play a role, then, even if we do not talk about our own strength, just in terms of the current international environment, the fate of our resistance to Japan's defeat is now sealed. However, on the issue of the Spanish Civil War, the international trend is not very optimistic. The biggest misfortune of Spain is that it does not have a common border with the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. What borders it is France, which is led by a government with an attitude that is not very stable. In the last newsletter, the reporter pointed out the role of the Spanish Civil War in the current European situation. In recent days, the position of the government army has become more stable than before. If the international community intensifies its assistance to the government army, it will not be too late. However, according to the news we received, French Foreign Minister Bonnet believed more than a month ago that the government army had lost its momentum and began negotiations with Franco's representatives. What is the fantasy of this move? Speaking of which, it is ridiculous; that is, to win over Franco! In the past two days, the French government has clearly announced that it has sent representatives to station in the rebel capital. This is the first step in recognizing the rebel government, which is a disguised concession to Italy that has to be made under the opposition of the United States.

Whether the fantasy of the current French government can be realized is another matter. What is important is that on this issue, the future of the international situation is indeed tied. The German and Italian plan after the Spanish rebels completely win, as far as is currently known, is roughly: On the one hand, Italy and Germany create tension in the Mediterranean, and on the other hand, they force France to make concessions to Italy on the issue of African colonies.

Anyone well-informed here agrees that what Mussolini has in mind is another "Second Munich." However, the victim of this conference has changed from Czechoslovakia to France. So far, the French authorities are opposed to such a conference. When Chamberlain went to Rome to talk a month ago and passed through Paris, Daladier clearly informed him that France, in any case, opposed resolving the dispute between France and Italy through a conference, and would rather negotiate directly with Italy. In the event that direct negotiations failed and an international conference was needed, France would be willing to join the United States according to President Roosevelt's plan and hold a broader international conference to negotiate all urgent mutual disputes.

The glimmer of dawn that is currently appearing is whether it will finally promote the clarification of the international situation, or whether it is just a delaying tactic of Hitler's. It cannot be determined now. However, in the event that the three aggressor countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan further expand their posture of challenging the world, then the main reason will definitely be the result of the wavering of a certain part of the peace front. - We can probably say that.

### Bombing of Lo Wu Incident, Japan Responds to British Protest, Apologizes and Compensates for Losses, Guarantees No Similar Incidents

[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] Local political circles are quite satisfied with the Japanese government's reply to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie's protest over the bombing of the Kowloon New Territories and the sincere apology. According to the contents of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's reply to the British ambassador, it has been stated that it guarantees that similar matters will not occur again, and also agrees to fully bear the responsibility for compensating for the destruction of property. This is the first time that the Japanese side has agreed to compensate for the loss of destroyed property and strictly punish the perpetrators. The British ambassador was ordered to request the Japanese government to publish the truth of the incident in the newspapers so that the Japanese people would understand the whole case, because the Japanese newspapers only reported that a warplane mistakenly dropped a bomb on the British concession (see another article on Hong Kong news in this newspaper).

### Mussolini's New Farce

— Translated by Dong Ping from P.Lfsovsky's original work, adapted from the "Moscow News"

It was still last year, November 30th, when the unexpected Ciano blustered in Congress about the so-called "natural inclinations" of Fascist Italy. Italian parliament members then began to clamor and vociferously shout slogans about "Tunisia," "Nice," "Savoy," and "Djibouti."

This demonstration out of nowhere was obviously the start of Italy's anti-French movement, with the aim of forcing France to return to Italy some territories and European colonies that she had 'illegally' taken from Italy.

The performance of the first act of this "movement" was like a bolt from the blue for the British and French leaders who had just returned happily from Munich. So, the two governments jointly inquired to Rome, asking for an explanation. Ciano's reply was that the anti-French demonstrations were purely "natural" and the Italian government could not be held responsible.

This meant that the anti-French movement was not officially directed. However, on December 17th, the Italian government sent a note to France, proposing to abolish the Franco-Italian agreement of January 7, 1935. That agreement was signed by Mussolini himself and Laval, and was supposed to resolve colonial disputes between France and Italy. Such a notice of abolition was simply a declaration that the Italian government was now outright refusing to recognize the status quo of the colonies and was preparing to launch a struggle to redraw the colonial map.

Italy's territorial demands from France are not really a new trick. It's just a renewed version of an old one. Even in the period before 1935, Franco-Italian relations were frequently strained. At that time, Italy also made forceful demands for a large amount of colonial land and political rights from France. However, the current demands are significantly different from those of the past.

Italy's previous demands were mostly focused on the Lake Chad area in Africa, but this time they were not mentioned. Conversely, the issues of Corsica, Nice, and Savoy, which were not mentioned last time, are now all brought up. Tunisia is still placed at the forefront of the demands as before, but last time the demand was only for judicial and political rights, while this time it is a straightforward demand to possess the territory.

If we make a detailed comparison of Italy's demands in these two periods, it is evident that Italy's main goal now is to seize military strongholds in the Mediterranean. In reality, Corsica, Nice, and Savoy are of no economic value; however, they are extremely important militarily. In future wars, dominance in the Mediterranean will clearly depend largely on the Toulon-Corsica-Tunisia triangle defense line of France; this line will undoubtedly be much more powerful than Britain's naval bases in the central or western Mediterranean – Gibraltar and Malta. The joint activity of the British and French navies on the French defensive triangle not only controls the entire Mediterranean but is also sufficient to blockade Italy, leading to her utter defeat.

Therefore, Italy will spare no effort to sabotage this French defense line in the Mediterranean, and it is not surprising that she has now made such land claims out of thin air.

If Nice and Savoy are taken by Italy, they can easily be used as bases for attacking southern France. As a result, Toulon, France's key point in the Mediterranean, will be directly threatened. If Italy gets Corsica, she will be able to establish a first-class naval base in the western Mediterranean. Similarly, if Italy also grabs Tunisia, then she will be truly formidable. She can completely control the straits between the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean, fundamentally cutting off the British and French naval transportation lines between Gibraltar, Malta, and Suez.

As for Djibouti, before the Italo-Ethiopian War, it occupied an important position in France's colonial policy as a fulcrum for expansion into the Red Sea, East Africa, and Abyssinia. Although its importance has been reduced after Italy annexed Abyssinia, it is clearly still a territory that France must fight for.

Today, Djibouti's most important role is as a coaling station for French ships sailing from Europe via the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. The importance of this route to France is self-evident, as it directly extends to France's most important colony in the Far East, Indochina. Djibouti is also economically important because the railway from there to Addis Ababa is the only channel for Abyssinian goods to be exported. Before the Italo-Ethiopian War, the amount of Ethiopian exports passing through there accounted for four-fifths of the total.

If Italy seizes Djibouti and this railway, then she will not only obtain substantial economic benefits and further dominate Abyssinia, but she can also greatly enhance her political and military position in the Red Sea. Deceiving France and attacking England are both very possible. Because once Italy dominates Djibouti and French Somaliland, she will immediately seriously threaten Britain's base in Aden. Moreover, she can use Djibouti as a pillar to compete with Britain for control of the southern gateway to the Red Sea.

Italy's demands regarding the Suez Canal are different in nature from the others. The impact of this demand alone is far greater on Britain than on France. Therefore, Italy does not dare to be as active in this demand as in the others. At this time, she is only demanding to jointly manage the canal with France.

From the above, the facts are extremely obvious. If Italy can truly obtain all these territories one by one, then the military and political situation in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea will be fundamentally broken, and she will undoubtedly become the leader of these waters. She will not only be able to break through the British and French naval blockade but can even freely cut off British and French transportation lines at any time and any place. These will inevitably change the overall situation of the future European war.

Furthermore, Fascist Italy's anti-French movement is not her own national policy, but a product of the German-Italian Axis, used to prepare for the outbreak of a second world war, in order to fulfill her dream of redrawing the world map.

Brief Commentary

### Rejection of Fortifying Guam

Washington, 24th—According to reports, as a result of the U.S. House of Representatives discussing the $52 million national defense budget, the $5 million Guam fortification proposal has been rejected. This matter is likely to attract attention from all sides.

The purpose of the Guam fortification plan was to counter Japan's naval construction in the Pacific mandated territories and to prepare favorable conditions for future naval negotiations with Japan. At the same time, there are two indirect meanings, namely, on the one hand, to help maintain British and American Far East interests, and on the other hand, to help China's war of resistance against Japan.

Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected this proposal, it will certainly be disappointing, and it is also greatly contrary to U.S. interests. At the same time, it will make the recent threats of the Japanese aggressors against Britain and France even more rampant. However, we should also recognize: (1) The member of the Republican Party, Sefen, proposed to reject this Guam fortification proposal, and the number of votes passing the rejection was 205 to 168. It can be seen here that there are still quite a large number of Congress members who oppose rejecting this proposal, and the reactionary views of the Republican minority leader, who violate the interests of the vast majority of the American people, are even more obvious, and their prestige among the masses will be even lower. (2) According to the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, this rejection must be submitted to the Senate for review, and there is still a chance to reject this rejection. (3) The case of constructing naval and air force bases for $48.8 million has been passed by an absolute majority of 368 to 4 votes.

Therefore, we can foresee that the U.S. policy of assisting democratic and peaceful countries in opposing Fascist aggression will not change in the future. Because the United States has no other way out than this, we hope that the American people can make greater efforts to launch a life-and-death struggle with all the reactionary elements who violate this principle.

### Military Commission Establishes a Snitch Box

In order to welcome the public to report traitors and corrupt party, government, and military officials, the Military Commission has specially set up a special snitch box in Chongqing, hoping that people from all walks of life will fully expose the bad guys, and write their real names and addresses so that they can be summoned at any time. The authorities are determined to keep all secrets, and if the information is true, they will be rewarded separately. From this, it can be seen that our authorities are determined to severely punish corruption in accordance with public opinion. This method can be promoted throughout the country. However, this method cannot be regarded as perfect. It is best to hope that the authorities can follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of the Three Principles of the People, and promote the implementation of democratic governance. On the one hand, quickly establish local assembly councils in various provinces, cities, and counties. On the other hand, refer to the village and street people's congresses that the Guangxi authorities have worked hard to promote, and the effective democratic political methods implemented in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, so that people from all walks of life can exercise their democratic rights in people's congresses and other forms of gatherings. Moreover, all corrupt officials can only lose all protection when true direct democracy is implemented.

### Horse Racing Tickets Sell Like Hotcakes!

The Hong Kong Spring Racing Season will begin today. For the matter itself, no comments will be added for the time being. But it is noteworthy that as of 10 am yesterday, the Hong Kong Jockey Club's horse racing tickets for one dollar a dozen Derby had sold more than 427,000 tickets. It is expected that ticket sales will not be difficult to exceed 500,000. The number of tickets issued this year has broken the highest record in previous years. Among the number of people who are enthusiastically buying horse racing tickets, Chinese compatriots account for a very large proportion. In this irrational society, there is no need to criticize those who are keen on making a fortune by chance, but we hope that all Hong Kong compatriots can remember the ancient lesson of "no eggs are left intact under an overturned nest," and stop pursuing personal gains and neglect the great cause of resisting the war and building the country, which is related to the eternal welfare of the country and the nation and themselves. At the very least, do not let the results of the "debt repayment movement" of the same "one dollar" fall behind the sales of horse racing tickets, so as to be a laughing stock in front of friendly people! For the peace of mind, let's enthusiastically donate to the motherland!

The Hong Kong-based army, navy, and air force have recently been ordered to conduct frequent exercises. According to sources, live-fire exercises were held at the White Sand Ring Artillery Unit at 6:30 pm and at night yesterday. The sound of artillery fire was deafening and could be heard far and wide. The other artillery units will also conduct drills during the day, and the army authorities will issue a notice at that time. In addition, in order to enhance the naval defense capabilities of Hong Kong, the British naval authorities have specially dispatched two blockade engineering ships to Hong Kong in order to blockade the port when necessary. The first ship arrived last month, and the second ship, the HMS Barrier, only arrived yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Kowloon Naval Dockyard. Not long after arriving, a fire suddenly broke out. The engineer's inner room's trousers, socks, blankets, and other items caught fire, and thick smoke billowed, filling the room. When the sailors saw this, they immediately raised the alarm. Before long, the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station heard the report and immediately dispatched police to provide assistance. However, the door of the room was locked at the time and there was no way to enter. So they broke down the door and cooperated with the crew to put out the fire with water.

Granting Naval Defense Rights, the British Government Issues a Formal Order

Recently, the London Gazette published a Hong Kong Naval Defense Order, authorizing the Navy Department, in accordance with the 1931 Colonial Naval Defense Ordinance, to entrust personnel provided by the Hong Kong government or the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force with general naval tasks. It is reported that this unit in Hong Kong was established in accordance with the 1933 Naval Volunteer Force Ordinance, and the British ship HMS Cornflower was designated as a training ship the following year. It is currently moored southwest of Jia Lidao. The current captain is Bishili. The above-mentioned order therefore authorizes the Hong Kong legislature to have the power to allow the government to maintain and use warships, and clearly stipulates that the personnel of the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force must: (1) serve on land or at sea, whether inside or outside Hong Kong. Except for the changing regulations formulated by the legislative aspect based on the Hong Kong environment, they shall abide by the current regulations of the British Navy, (2) be assigned to any ship, agency, or outside of Hong Kong, regardless of whether it belongs to Hong Kong service or training, (3) Those who perform general duties of the British Navy in times of emergency shall form the British Naval Volunteer Reserve or a part of it as the British Naval Reserve, and the rest as the British Naval Volunteer Reserve.

Guaranteeing the Safety of Refugees, the Hong Kong Authorities Will Negotiate with Japan

After the Japanese aircraft recklessly bombed Shenzhen yesterday, the refugees in the refugee camp there were all moved into the New Territories. The situation of the authorities handling the comforting affairs was announced by Secretary for Health Situ Yongjue yesterday. According to the reporter's investigation, in addition to reporting to the British government to protest the bombing of British territory by Japanese aircraft, the Hong Kong authorities are also in the process of obtaining a definite promise from the Japanese side to designate several sections of land in Shenzhen as refugee areas, so that the same incident as the previous day will not happen again in the future, so that the refugees who have now moved into the British boundary can return to their original Japanese camps and live in peace. This matter is currently under negotiation. According to sources close to official medical circles, it is said that this matter is expected to be realized in a few weeks. As for the Japanese aircraft wreaking havoc in Shenzhen, tens of thousands of refugees poured into the British boundary. The authorities opened the Fanling, North Station, South Station and Man Kam To refugee camps to accommodate them, all of which were overcrowded. In addition, other valleys have not yet been opened. According to the authorities' survey on the 18th of this month, the number of refugees remaining in the camp was 6,900, including 1,393 in King's Park, 621 in Ma Tau Chung, 1,162 in North Point, 17 in Lai Chi Kok Hospital (Chinese Army), 780 in Ma Tau Chung (Chinese Army), and 2,583 in Kam Tin, totaling 6,996.

### The Emergency Relief Association Allocates Funds Again to Relieve the Disaster in Huizhou, Allocating $20,000 in Fractional Notes

The Hong Kong Emergency Relief Association for Refugees, because of the heavy disaster situation in Huizhou, Bobai and other counties, had previously allocated a total of hundreds of packages of old clothes and wheat bran, which have been distributed almost completely, like a drop in the bucket. The members of the association's Huizhou branch committee, for the sake of continuing relief, especially the Baptist Church sent Pastor Ross Ming and the Catholic Father Bi, etc., to Hong Kong to discuss with Sheng Wei Jiali Mo and other pastors. The Hong Kong Emergency Relief Association for Refugees has now allocated another $20,000 in fractional notes to relieve the refugees in Huizhou and Bobai.

### Candidates for the Next Session of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, New Lineup of Directors Difficult to Produce, Only One Representative of the Insurance Industry Has Been Selected So Far, Many Wealthy Merchants Have Replied with Polite Refusals

The candidates for the directors of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, one session per year, have been produced on the 14th of this month. A total of 27 wealthy merchants were selected as directors and letters of appointment were sent to them. At the same time, letters were also sent to inns, pawnshops, insurance companies, piece goods stores, foreign goods stores and other industries, recommending industry representatives to take charge of the hospital affairs. However, according to the reporter's investigation yesterday, as of now, although the wealthy merchant directors have been publicly selected some days ago, and each of them is a wealthy merchant with high expectations, some of them have already sent letters to the Eastern Hospital declining the appointment. As for the industry representatives, letters were sent to various industries to recommend them, and these letters have been issued for more than ten days, but only the insurance industry has replied to elect Lian'an Insurance Company as the representative director. There are still eight or nine other industries that have not yet produced representatives. Therefore, the formal election period is still far away. It is reported that in recent years, it has been very difficult to select industry representative directors. Therefore, industry representatives in the current board of directors only account for three, and it will be difficult to obtain a majority in the next session.

### Soong Ching-ling, etc., Issue an Appeal Letter, Requesting Donations to Comfort Refugees

(The original letter is omitted) Those who donate money and goods from all walks of life can hand them over to the local Bishop or the China Defense League (telephone 28930 or 25820).

### Established Without Approval, Police Detectives Search and Arrest the Chinese Seamen's Union, Formally Brought to Trial by the Central Magistracy Yesterday, Huang Yalen and Others Charged with Forming an Illegal Society

On February 3rd, British Detective Assistant Ma Fei and Detective Yilishi once led a team of Chinese detectives to search the Chinese Seamen's Union on the third floor of No. 19 Peel Street in Central, and seized many documents, including official documents, envelopes, stationery, and receipts. Three men, Huang Yalen, Liang Jiu, and Zhu Baoyan, were arrested. Afterwards, they were charged with the case. This case has been brought to court several times. It was not until yesterday afternoon that it was formally tried by He, the third court of the Central Magistracy. The three defendants all hired lawyer Shi Luhua to defend them and denied guilt. The prosecution was handled by the Deputy Attorney General of the Hong Kong Government, Williams.

Charges

The charges against Liang Jiu and Zhu Baoyan are recorded as follows: (1) It is said that the three men had committed the crime of assisting in the establishment of this illegal Chinese Seamen's Union on the third floor of 19 Peel Street around February 3; (2) It is said that the three men were members of this illegal Chinese Seamen's Union on the third floor of 19 Peel Street around February 3; The second defendant, Liang Jiu, was further charged with a third crime, saying that he was the leaseholder of the third floor of No. 19 Peel Street, and committed the crime of allowing the floor to be opened as this illegal Chinese Seamen's Union. During the court hearing yesterday afternoon, Williams from the prosecution first stated the case to the magistrate, and cited examples to explain the reasons why the three defendants were charged. After Williams finished speaking, he immediately summoned Li Qiu, the rent collector of the building owner Xiao Hanming, to testify.

Search and Arrest Process

Afterwards, Ying Yi Li made a testimony and answered lawyer Shi's cross-examination, saying that he had not seen any signs when he went to search. Later, Assistant Ma Fei testified that after searching out the third defendant's business card, Chinese Detective Hua Ming made a testimony, saying that the first defendant had reported to the Chinese Affairs Department in early January, wanting to establish this association. Yu had visited him twice, and on January 26th, the first defendant invited Yu and Guo Zhaoji to lunch on the sixth floor of the China Department Store. During the meal, the first defendant told Yu that the Chinese Affairs Department had not allowed the establishment, and Guo also said that it could be moved to Shenzhen in the near future. However, Yu estimated that the defendant would not be able to move to another place in this shortest period of time. At this point, lawyer Shi stood up to speak and defend the defendant, saying that the former Hong Kong Seamen's Industrial Union was an illegal society, but other groups may not be illegal. The current association has nothing to do with the Hong Kong Seamen's Industrial Union, which was banned by the government in the past. The magistrate then postponed the case until 1:15 pm next Friday for retrial.

### One Year of Service on the Battlefield

— Zhang Rentao

Report on the Work of the Kowloon Community Relief Federation's Northern Service Group

I believe anyone with a decent memory will recall that our group – the Kowloon Battlefield Service Group – was formed in August of the year before last to participate in the sacred national liberation war of our motherland, to represent the anti-Japanese spirit of Kowloon's compatriots who refused to be slaves of a conquered nation, and especially to serve our motherland. Several dozen of us, under the leadership and with the help of Mr. Du Qizhang, a Hong Kong gentleman, organized and set off.

When we departed from the warm southern land that evening, crowds of enthusiastic well-wishers thronged to the Guangdong-Hong Kong pier. The songs of national salvation resonated among the masses in the colony. Mr. Ying Guan, short, sharp, and spirited, led the welcomers, shouting moving slogans: Only return when the X people are driven back! Rather bleed and sacrifice than retreat… These slogans moved us to tears. We waved our handkerchiefs, bidding farewell to Hong Kong, to this island where we all had resided for a time, amidst the singing of "To the front lines, let's unite and drive our X people out of China..." All of this, even today, a year later, still appears before my eyes.

Our group dared not betray the expectations of the Kowloon compatriots. From our departure from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, and all the way through Hankou to Nanjing, whether on the ship or in the train, we devoted our greatest efforts to propaganda work. In many places we passed, compatriots unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation requested to join our group, wanting to serve on the battlefield with us. However, due to various difficulties, we politely declined each request.

Upon arriving in Nanjing, due to various objective constraints, we had no choice but to join the war training class organized by the Military Affairs Commission. Several members who had studied in Japan also participated in special training classes for those who had studied in Japan. This was in August and September of last year.

The training life was quite arduous. However, in order to realize our future work on the battlefield, we endured it for the time being, without any doubt. To participate in the cause of national liberation, hard work and endurance were essential. The training period was three months. However, due to the changing war situation and the tightening siege of Nanjing, we followed the war training class out of Nanjing in the dead of night on November 17th of last year (the 26th year), undertaking a forced march of more than 1,300 li. The marching life was even more painful. Regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow, we carried our own padded clothes, quilts, belongings, and a rifle and ammunition every day, walking sixty or seventy li, or eighty or ninety li. Sometimes, we even had to push handcarts ourselves. The hardship was truly indescribable. During marching breaks, we also carried out propaganda, performing plays, singing, and engaging in individual conversations... Because we were a group of Guangdong natives, we spoke "Guangdong Mandarin" with a "southern accent." The people found it difficult to understand. But this linguistic difficulty was gradually overcome through constant work. Now our northern language is "smooth sailing" and used everywhere.

The march ended at Jingdezhen, a famous porcelain production site. However, more than a month had passed, and we had walked more than 1,300 li. The provinces traversed on foot were Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi. On New Year's Eve of 1937, we held our graduation ceremony in Jingdezhen.

After graduation, we Guangdong compatriots, under the command of "two hundred outstanding cadres dispatched to the First War Zone to serve," departed from Hankou to Zhengzhou, Henan (the location of the First War Zone). In order to familiarize ourselves with the special environment of the war zone and strengthen political education, we underwent a second training, participating in the political brigade of the Political Training Office of the First War Zone. Due to the urgent need of the anti-war environment, after three weeks of training, we were assigned to various counties as "civilian movement instructors." Except for Zeng Mei and Zhuang Zhifu, who were sent to eastern Henan, most of the members of the service group were assigned to western Henan.

I have been in Dengfeng County, western Henan, for half a year. During my work in the past half a year, in addition to promoting the teachers of the county to organize the "Dengfeng County Teachers' Federation," promoting the people of Donghua Town and Maguchuan to organize the Cultural Circles National Salvation Association, and promoting the middle and primary school students of the county to organize the Student Federation, in the work of arming the people, because County Magistrate Liu Xiaoran also valued civilian movement work, although I dare not say that all the people of the county have been armed, but in the recent review, more than 7,000 people from the first district of the county participated in the Anti-Enemy Self-Defense Team, more than 5,000 people from the second district participated in the Self-Defense Force, and more than 5,000 people from the third district also participated. This fully proves that the people have a high degree of awareness of the war of resistance and know that participating in the organization is the expansion of power.

Recently, although I have left Dengfeng, and some people who do not understand the big picture are afraid that the people have organized power, due to the gradual expansion of the organization of the self-defense teams and guerrillas, these brave and broad masses will one day pick up their own guns and drive out the XX devils.

### Tell Japan

— Translated by Jiancun, translated from the "Smeshe" newspaper

Japan has quickly apologized for invading Hong Kong's territory and has also agreed to compensate for the loss of life.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, Japan's attitude was simply dismissive, but Tokyo suddenly expressed repentance yesterday. What was the reason?

We know that the Japanese military issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon that was fundamentally untrue, saying that only one Japanese plane had invaded British territory and dropped only one bomb, and even lied that the Japanese consul in Hong Kong had apologized to the Governor of Hong Kong.

In fact, the Japanese Foreign Minister only offered an apology after meeting with British Ambassador Sir Craig yesterday. Undoubtedly, its swiftness is no different from the apology to the United States for sinking the USS Panay.

This can prove to the world that there is such a thing as the Japanese administrative structure and its martial relations.

No one believes that the Japanese government needs to apologize to people forever. This is a disgrace to the civilized world, but the Japanese government's control over its navy and army is even weaker than the Shanghai Municipal Council's response to terrorist incidents. In this situation, the only thing to do is to let its irresponsible soldiers continue to fight, and the Japanese government is prepared to continue to apologize. However, in the near future, I am afraid that one day there will be an incident that cannot be resolved by an apology.

Although Japan has apologized quickly this time, this incident is far from over. London believes that the British government is prepared to issue a stronger ultimatum to Japan after a formal protest than any time after the Sino-Japanese War.

In diplomatic terms, it can be said that if those irresponsible soldiers who truly control Japanese policy continue to infringe on our rights, Great Britain will no longer tolerate it.

Now is the time for Great Britain to take action. As far as Hong Kong is concerned, we hope that the British government can give Japan a public warning, just like France warned the Spanish rebels, that is to say, if it offends again, , , it is obviously not enough to just give the Japanese commander a verbal warning!

### Kowloon Bandits Rampant Two Robberies Occurred in Succession Yesterday Morning A Passenger Boat in the Typhoon Shelter Was Hijacked Late at Night A Farmer's Family in Kowloon Tong Was Also Visited by Thieves

Two robberies occurred in the Yau Ma Tei Typhoon Shelter and Kowloon Tong in succession from 0:00 to 3:00 yesterday morning. The details are recorded as follows:

Cargo boat and passenger boat No. 5597 was robbed. Last night, it was moored in the Yau Ma Tei Typhoon Shelter. The female boat owner, Su Daixi (25 years old), her aunt, and two children, a total of four people, were sleeping soundly in the boat. At 1:00 yesterday morning, three bandits suddenly boarded the boat to rob it. One bandit held a sword, and one bandit held a sharp blade, threatening everyone in the boat, and stuffing their mouths with orange tongs to prevent them from making a sound. They also tied their hands behind their backs with rope, and then imprisoned them in the boat. The three bandits searched leisurely for about forty minutes before whistling away. The boat owner, Su Daixi, went to the police station yesterday morning to report the case and requested an investigation. She said that she had been robbed of 130 yuan in cash, a pair of gold rattan bracelets, a ring, and clothing, totaling a loss of about 200 yuan.

A farmer was robbed. The farmer, Zhou Huan, cultivated for a living. He lived with his mother, Hou Jiaoxin, and his partner, Zhu Lianying, in a small house on the hillside above Kowloon Tong. At 3:30 yesterday morning, five bandits armed with sharp swords broke in to rob them, tied everyone up with rope, and then searched the house, looting 13 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 cents in cash, 29 chickens, 2 geese, and 1 duck, worth 39 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 cents. After the incident, the victim went to the police station to report the case.

### Frequent Freight Hong Kong Foreign Shipping Companies Plan to Increase Sailings on the Hong Kong-Burma Route to Connect Yunnan-Burma Freight and Supply Demand

Since the situation in South China has changed, the maritime traffic between our country and Europe and the United States has gradually shifted from Guangzhou to the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam routes. The traffic between Hong Kong and Rangoon alone has been affected by the war. All goods shipped from Europe and the United States to China are shipped directly to Hong Kong, and then transferred to Haiphong and Rangoon, and then to Kunming. Therefore, the traffic on the Hong Kong-Burma line is becoming increasingly close, and the frequency of freight traffic is unprecedented. Therefore, the demand for smooth and fast communication between Hong Kong and Burma in the future is even more urgent. According to the shipping industry here, after the shipping in North China and the Yangtze River was monopolized by the X people, the ships that used to sail were all stopped. Therefore, shipping companies have long paid attention to the Hong Kong-Burma route business, especially British shipping companies. Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, the two companies whose ships have stopped sailing in North China and the Yangtze River, are now planning to send more ships to join this route. As for other inland river shipping companies in Hong Kong, they are also rising up to compete in order to expand their own business and decide to sail on the Hong Kong-Burma route in the future. According to news from Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies, the two companies are currently considering increasing the number of ships sailing on this route. As soon as the plan is completed, it can be realized.

### X Has Not Re-entered or Set Fire Nantou Is As Peaceful As Ever Customs Officer Talks About Shekou Customs Working As Usual

(Shenzhen Express News) Nantou, Baoan County, was captured by 300 X people on the 17th of this month. Our army then counterattacked victoriously on the morning of the 20th with two companies of political police and recovered Nantou. Yesterday, a rumor suddenly spread that X had fallen into Nantou again, saying that 400 X people had reoccupied the county government at 6:00 yesterday morning and set it on fire.

The Situation in Nantou Is As Peaceful As Ever

After hearing this news, the reporter inquired from the Baoan authorities and learned that it was not true. In order to investigate the actual situation, he rushed to Nantou to observe the situation in the city, which was stable as ever. There was no trace of X. Only the ruins near the county government and the Wenjia Ancestral Hall, which were burned down by X that day, presented a desolate scene. The people ignored the X army's request to organize a puppet maintenance association. The X army's threat to reoccupy Nantou only slightly revealed a state of panic.

X Plane Throws Absurd Leaflets Again

Yesterday morning, several X planes flew to Nantou and hovered over the entrance of the port, and dropped absurd leaflets, forcing the people to quickly organize a puppet maintenance association and hold a puppet county magistrate election. The X planes then flew to Shenzhen and also dropped a large number of such absurd leaflets there. As for the claim that X set fire to Nantou, it is even more absurd, because there is no trace of X there. It is found that Shekou, about one mile south of Nantou, has our country's customs. The customs officers are still performing their duties as usual and have not retreated. The Baoan small boat to and from Hong Kong still opens the port as usual at noon. As for the cargo boats from Shekou to Hong Kong, they are loaded with a large number of cabbages and set sail.

Shekou Customs Works As Usual

According to news from Hong Kong, yesterday's Western newspapers in Hong Kong reported that the customs officers of Shekou Customs had retreated. The reporter of the mainland agency specially inquired about this from Pu Liecha, the Kowloon Customs Commissioner, yesterday afternoon. He replied that Shekou Customs was still working as usual. A group of customs officers was sent from Hong Kong to Shekou this morning (yesterday). The group of customs officers returned to Hong Kong in the afternoon. In fact, the customs did not retreat, and Shekou was as peaceful as ever. The newspaper report was not true. It is said that Shekou is about one mile south of Nantou, the county seat of Baoan. Most of the goods from Nantou and western Baoan to Hong Kong are transshipped through Shekou. The land is the Chinese border, and the sea is the Houhai, which belongs to the British border.

### County Councils Established Separately in Various Counties of Guangxi

The Guangxi Provincial Authorities have recently begun military affairs in the later period of the War of Resistance, and urgently need to cooperate effectively with the people to make the military and the people into one, and achieve the ultimate goal of victory. After Director Bai Chongxi returned to Guangxi at the end of last year, he convened a military and political conference of the whole province. Regarding the political aspects of Guangxi Province, it was decided to adopt an open style and strictly implement autonomy throughout the province. At that time, it was decided that democratically elected county magistrates would be implemented in all counties starting in January of the 28th year. Due to the lack of time to handle it, the establishment of county councils in various counties was first started. After the county councils are established, the provincial council will continue to be established. After the provincial council is established, the election of democratically elected county magistrates will continue to be held. It was found that the preparation and election of county council members was to first send supervisors to each election district. The supervisors of each district were based on the scope stipulated by the original people's regiment area. Each district sent 1 supervisor. Lu Yiyao was sent to the Yulin District, and Chen Shuxun was sent to the Wuzhou District. The supervisors of Guilin, Longzhou, Baise, Xunzhou, Nanning, and Liuzhou districts have also been properly assigned. The county council members will then be elected separately, and the list will be submitted by the supervisors of each district to the provincial government for approval. It is said that the county councils of all counties will be fully established on March 1 of this year, and the provincial council will also be established on April 1. It was also found that the township, town, village, and street chiefs in Guangxi Province were all filled by cadre trainees in the past. Recently, an order was received from the Provincial Government's Appeasement Office that the qualifications for all township, town, village, and street chiefs in the province are not limited to cadre trainees. Anyone who has a reputation in the township, town, village, or street can be appointed, and each township and town is allowed to freely elect natives to be appointed, so that there will be no barriers to handling local affairs.

### X Builds Pontoon Bridge in Jiujiang in an Attempt to Flank Jinli

[Heshan Express News] According to X in Jiujiang, in order to respond to the actions of the X army in Conghua, they are ready to move. On the 22nd, they built a pontoon bridge on the coast of Jiujiang that leads directly to Gubao in order to launch a light-armored attack and flank our garrison in Jinli. At the same time, X, who were entrenched in Makou, bombarded Jinli with heavy artillery for several days in an attempt to capture this important military point in Xijiang and invade Cangwu along the Xijiang River. Our army has been prepared for this for a long time. If X offends, we will give them a heavy blow.

### Traitor in Haikou Plots to Betray the Country The People Fully Understand the Righteousness Not Fooled by Mao Mou

[Beihai Express News] X, who landed on Hainan Island, were fiercely resisted by our Wang troops, and have not been able to enter the interior to this day. Forced to do so, on the one hand, they telegraphed Guangzhou for assistance, and on the other hand, they used Han Hao Mao Moumou to lure the people and establish a security maintenance association in Haikou. Our local compatriots fully understand the righteousness and mostly retreat into the interior, unwilling to humiliate their ancestors. At present, there are only a very small number of people left in Haikou. All buying and selling has stopped, and the situation is like a dead market.

### Traitor in Qiong Captures Fushan

[Beijiang Express News] The military authorities here sent a telegram to the Southern Route, saying that X troops who captured Haikou divided their troops on the 19th and went west to the township of Chenmai County, Fengying. Along the Chengfeng Highway, they passed the old county seat of Chenmai and captured Fushan. Because the road was a sandy plain, our army did not set up defenses, so Fushan was immediately captured.

### From Swatow to Saigon (Continued)

— Hua You

I asked him, "What does this mean?" He replied with a trembling voice, "That's for paying taxes." At that moment, I used a commanding tone and told him to place it with the items that needed to be taxed. At the same time, I searched him further and discovered that the jade ring was actually taken from his trouser leg. I scolded him a few times, and his face turned green and then red as he said to me, "Take the things and pay the tax!" Just then, a "Madame" turned her face from the right, as if inquiring about the truth. I wanted to report him, but she might not punish him, since rabbits mourn for foxes and creatures sympathize with their own kind. Moreover, the lost item had been recovered, so I followed the teachings of the sage, "A gentleman does not go to extremes," and lightly spared his dog's life. Otherwise, not only would I have broken his rice bowl, but he might have had to spend a few years in prison. Although most French people in Annam are greedy, the colonial government, like those of other countries, hates such dishonest behavior. After this farcical play ended, I took the items they deemed taxable to the tax department to hear the tax officer's instructions. I thought that those few discarded items would cost no more than a few dollars at most, but unexpectedly, it was twenty-two dollars. Because I only had five dollars with me, I had to wrap the items in the bedspread and hand them over to the Xiamen-speaking manager to be temporarily stored in a warehouse. When I went to pay the tax at half-past two that afternoon, I discovered that the small clock had been stolen. This warehouse clearly had someone guarding it, yet things still went missing. Wasn't this a strange affair? Therefore, I negotiated with the tax officer, who promised to investigate. After a while, a Vietnamese person brought it back. According to the Xiamen-speaking manager, the clock was taken by the French person who inspected my luggage. He also told me that because compatriots sometimes don't have enough money, items stored in the warehouse can be picked and chosen by the French customs officers at any time. For example, fountain pens, raincoats, woolen blankets, and hot water bottles, if they are a little better, are taken by them. By the time you bring money to pay the tax, there is nothing left for you to pay for. It is best to get a written receipt listing what items you have first, so you can hold onto the official document; otherwise, there is nothing you can do about it. But they would never give you such a receipt; they can only give you an entry permit. The weak are prey to the strong; it is truly an eternal principle.

When I had paid the tax and gotten my things back, I thought the procedure was complete. I announced the event that had been bothering me for half a day. At this moment, I still felt my power was too weak; one person's strength could not match theirs. But I couldn't help but declare it to them, while not wanting them to understand what I was declaring. So I abandoned the Chaozhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Annam dialects and spoke in our national language. It goes without saying that the French didn't understand, and even the "Ma Zhen" interpreters from various gangs inside couldn't understand what I was saying. When the tax officer asked the translator sitting next to him what I was saying, they all shook their heads to indicate they didn't understand. I raised my head and walked out of the gate of the baggage inspection station. I thought to myself, "You don't understand my words, and that is exactly my successful plan." After returning to the Yong'an Hotel, I handed the things over to my wife to sort out, and I went to the Chinese Consulate to find my old Yenching University classmates, Zhuo Huanlai and Shen Zuxun (note: Mr. Zhuo is the current Deputy Consul of the Republic of China in Saigon). When they heard me describe how the French customs officer forcibly took my jade ring, they were also very angry. They told me to go back and write an official letter, and then they would negotiate on my behalf. That evening, I personally delivered the official letter to the consulate. The next morning, the consulate called to invite me to come. After arriving at the consulate, Consul Zhuo introduced me to Mr. Xu Nai (note: Mr. Xu is from Zhenjiang and is currently a trainee consul) and introduced me to him. Mr. Xu asked me about the details of the French customs officer forcibly taking the jade ring and asked if I could recognize the customs officer's face. I said that I could recognize his face, but I didn't know his name. He said that as long as I could recognize the person, that would be enough. So we sat in the consulate's car and sped off to the baggage inspection station.

When we arrived at the entrance of the baggage inspection station, the iron gate was tightly locked. Mr. Xu handed his business card to the Arab guard, who quickly opened the gate. We walked to the tax officer, and he handed over his business card. After the tax officer shook hands with Mr. Xu and greeted him, he asked what business brought him here. At this time, Mr. Xu told him about their customs officer yesterday forcibly taking the jade ring and coming to demand it back. The tax officer retorted, "If our customs officer took his jade ring, why didn't he mention it yesterday?" After Mr. Xu heard his words, he turned around and asked me if I had mentioned it to them. I repeated the words I had said to the tax officer after paying the tax yesterday to Mr. Xu. After Mr. Xu relayed my words to the tax officer, he pondered for a moment. He seemed to remember, and finally nodded in agreement. At this time, he ordered many customs officers to come out for me to identify. When I pointed to the customs officer and said, "That's him," how pitiful he was; his face turned green. The tax officer asked him if he had taken my jade ring, and he confessed very honestly. But he said that I had given it to him, and at the same time, he pulled a Vietnamese person out to testify. Mr. Xu asked me if I had given it to him. I said to Mr. Xu that I didn't know him at all, so naturally there was no question of friendship. "Do you think I would give it to him? Furthermore, the government office is not a place for gifts. Even if I gave it to him, could he take it?" Mr. Xu, based on my words and his exceptionally proficient French and legal expertise, refuted the French officials to the point where they were speechless. Finally, they said very unhappily, "Come and get it at half-past two in the afternoon." So we were victorious. Mr. Xu told me that when I came to get the jade ring in the afternoon, it would be best to bring a few strong people with me, because he was afraid that something unexpected might happen.

That afternoon, I mustered my courage and went with Mr. Zhang Xiangjin, the No. 1 "Ma Zhen" of the Yong'an Hotel, to retrieve the jade ring. Although it was half-past two, the tax officer had not yet come to work. The Vietnamese person who abused his power and kicked the luggage opened the iron cabinet and took out the jade ring, asking me if this was the one. I took it in my hand and examined it, nodding to him. But he said that the tax officer had not yet come, and he didn't know if he wanted to pay the tax. "You can wait for him for now." It wasn't until three o'clock that I saw the tax officer driving into the baggage inspection station in a car. I had previously believed that the French were punctual, but now I knew that their officials were just as bureaucratic as those in our country. When the tax officer walked into his office, the one I regarded as abusing his power actually told him how precious and valuable my jade ring was, meaning that he wanted him to levy a heavy tax so that I couldn't get it back. At the time, I was thinking: if he really wanted to do that, then it would only reveal their pettiness. So Mr. Zhang also said to me: "If he wants to levy a heavy tax, then we won't bother with him and ask the consul to negotiate with them again." After hearing his lackey's words, the tax officer took the jade ring and flipped it over and examined it for five minutes before saying to us: "Pay three cents in tax." This method of his could clear his compatriots of the name of thief - they didn't forcibly take your things, it was to leave a tax! When I heard that he wanted to levy a tax, I said to Mr. Zhang that I wouldn't pay. The things were taken away by them, and now I'm coming to retrieve them, but instead I have to pay them tax, which is wrong. At the same time, I also felt that in any country, women generally cannot avoid wearing some decorations. For example, in their France, have their women never worn jewelry? When they travel to our Republic of China, do we often levy taxes on such small items? The jade ring I brought is not a commodity. This proves that I am not a merchant. In any case, I cannot pay these three cents. When Mr. Zhang heard my words, he said to me, "I dare not say that your reasons are insufficient, but you must know that our country is too weak, and when we come to their colonial territory, we must suffer a little loss. Listen to me." After he finished saying these worldly words, he took out his wallet and completed the matter.

### Today's Soccer Games at Happy Valley with Continuous Good Shows: South China Brothers Split to Fight Eastern and Hong Kong Club, Guanghua vs. Police and Middlesex vs. Scott are Also Expected to be Spectacular

[Our Report] In this year's First Division Football League, during the five-month competition, no team has not strived to create and build its position. Until now, it has entered the important stage of the second round, and the championship issue will reach its final moment, and the date to resolve it is not far away.

Regardless of whether the current status of each team is high or low, their courage to create and build in the past is always the same. The difference lies only in the quality of their skills and the strength of their abilities. Therefore, they are divided into two paths: creating success and building failure. The team with the high status is the future champion, and the team with the low status is the one that lags behind halfway. But no matter which team it is, it always has to avoid a blank in the score table. Even if what they get is the least, it is still a victory created with blood and sweat.

Speaking of the championship, it is still a mystery waiting to be revealed. However, according to the situation, the Navy and South China South are already in a transcendent position in the current standings. There is no doubt that the championship and runner-up will only be contested by these two teams. Therefore, it can be said, "Heroes of the world, only you and I, my lord." As for the Eastern, which is currently in third place, it is three points behind South China South, and its hope seems weak. However, the battlefield is extremely changeable, and perhaps in the near future, the Eastern will be able to overtake the others because of someone's success. After all, the number of successes and failures is difficult to predict. The Navy and South China South dare not guarantee that their future will be smooth sailing. Worrying about gains and losses is inevitable. If those two teams have setbacks in the future, then the Eastern will naturally stand out.

Let me calculate the accounts of those three teams up to now, and then talk about today's games. Readers can understand how important the success or failure of those three teams will be in influencing the overall situation by following the chart. According to the table above, the Navy not only has one more point than South China South, but the Navy has played sixteen games, while South China only has thirteen games. Therefore, the Navy's hope of winning the championship is stronger. Although the Navy still has to compete with South China South for the second time, it is uncertain who will win. But even if South China South can win these two points, it still has to win all other games in order to complete the great cause. Otherwise, I am afraid the championship will still be the Navy's. Also, based on the past records of those two teams, the Navy has only lost once to South China South, and there have been three draws. Other than that, they have won every game. South China South has ten wins, no draws, and three losses. Therefore, compared to each other, the Navy has lost fewer points due to defeats than South China South. So based on this point, I am really worried about South China South's future. As for the Eastern, because its position is slightly behind, it can only sit and watch the success or failure and take advantage of it from the middle.

The sensational Hong Kong-Philippines international game created a page in history in the lively scene of the past few days. Now, when I think back, I really feel that grand events do not always last. However, the soccer world in Hong Kong is always active. Today, there are multiple games in the First and Second Divisions. The opportunity for ordinary fans to seek excitement continues and will not stop completely. Look, another good show is starting today.

All four First Division teams are dispatched, so it is inevitable that there will be a scene of internal strife. This is the Eastern against South China Hua. These two happy rivals are meeting for the last time in this league. Let's see what kind of accounts will be settled again.

South China South will fight the "bankrupt" Hong Kong Club. There is no doubt that South China South will win. The battle location is the same as Eastern vs. South China Hua at the Hong Kong Club grounds, held one after another. Continuous good shows, it's up to you whether you watch them or not.

Guanghua is against the Sino-Western Police. This game is evenly matched and will be very interesting. The match between Middlesex and Scott will also attract the attention of the soldiers.

According to investigations, South China South will still use the same lineup as the one that eliminated Kowloon Club in the Silver Shield semi-finals. The military appearance is neat and the strength is extremely strong. Using this to fight the talent-depleted Hong Kong Club, the number of wins and losses can be known without waiting for the end of the war. It can also be determined that the Hong Kong Club's lineup at that time will be a mixture of Second Division players, because Skinner and Bickley have left Hong Kong and returned to England a few days ago, and Fula was injured in the chest during the international competition and was hospitalized for treatment and has not yet recovered. It is truly a case of "one leak and continuous rain." What will the "football gentlemen" of today think?

South China South's lineup is as follows. As for the Hong Kong Club's lineup, it is currently unknown. What is known is that it will be a combination of First and Second Division players playing together.

(South China South)

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan

Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Hua Cai

Wen, Li Zhaorong, Feng Zhongxiang, Li Enliang, Deng Guangsen

Since South China Hua's hope has been lost, the battle record has become worse and worse. Therefore, Coach Mo has decided to find a way to train up-and-coming talents for future use. Therefore, today's left-wing position plans to be taken by Tan Zhen. Tian Rongfa may also be used. Other than that, there are no major changes. The strength is still good. The Eastern will use the original lineup, driven by hope, it must be so. It seems that the Eastern's chances of victory are also very high. The lineups are as follows:

(Eastern Club)

Liu Xianhan

Miao Guohua, Zeng Zhongyun

Wei Quan, Song Sheng, Liu Shizan

Hou Chengtou, Xu Jingcheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu

(South China Hua)

Tan Jun'gan

Liu Mao, Liang Bowei

Xie Jinhong, Lin Depu, Liu Weipei

Yi Zhenhui, Qu Shi'e, Liu Songsheng, Chen De, Tian Rongfa, Yang Genbao, Yang Shuiyi

The Guanghua generals are courageous in improving, and the spirit of the entire army is excellent. Although the past record is extremely mediocre, this is another issue and cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Now that they are willing to humbly seek further education, the efforts to find a way will have results. Today's battle against the Police, because the strength of both sides is similar, they can just give full play and contribute their respective skills, and perhaps the victory can be found here. The lineups of the two armies are on the left.

(Guanghua Club)

Li Guoqi

Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng

Huang Huaji, Yang Zixiang, Zhang Shuhui

Huang Jingcong, Zou Wenzhi, Qian Chifen, Zhuo Shijin, Liang Bingjin

(Police Club)

Mai Hadi

Chen Guangyu, Bi Liban

Norf, Bi Lidun, Bai Jia

Mo Shi, Hou Lu, Fan Guicai, Hua Liya, Huang Wengui

The American military and Scott have become supporting roles in the championship stage, so the outcome of this game is irrelevant to the overall situation. But in terms of strength, it seems that the American military is slightly better, because its front line has Pearson, Su Shi, etc., who are dangerous elements, and the rear has Bi Lidi, Shi Han, etc., who are well-known defense generals. Therefore, I think that these two points will continue to be the difference, and if it is not what the American military gets, it will be a draw at most. The lineups of the two teams are as follows (Tai Sui of the Stadium)

Middlesex

Ji Chen

Shi Han, Gu Ba

Wei Jianchen, Bi Lidi, Fei Shi Wo Da

Ma La Bu, Su Shi, Ti Wan, Ge Ni, Pi Ya Chen

### Award Ceremony for the Charity Relief Cup Volleyball Tournament Held Yesterday; Allied Forces Defeat the Champions by a Narrow Margin; The Three-to-Two Battle Was Quite a Spectacle

The Charity Relief Cup volleyball tournament, organized by the Hong Kong Chinese News Reporters Association, concluded yesterday after three days of intense competition. South China University (Nanda) emerged victorious, winning the championship. The association held an award ceremony at the Paul’s Sports Ground at 4:00 PM. The chairman of the association, Huang Yu-gen, gave a brief report, thanking all participating teams and enthusiastic spectators. Mrs. Chan Chak then presented the awards. Nanda, the champion, received a large silver cup from the South China Relief for Refugees United Association. Pei Ying, the runner-up, received a large silver cup from the Women's Relief and Disaster Fundraising Association. After the awards ceremony, a commemorative photo was taken, followed by a demonstration match between the Allied Forces and Nanda. The referee was Yu Yong-can. Both teams put on an energetic performance, earning praise for their technique and spirit. Nanda initially demonstrated its champion's prowess, with Xu Heng and Huang Ding-fen utilizing a combination of smashes and blocks, while Li Fu-shen and Xiao Dian-lian provided support. They won the first set 21-14. However, their coordination faltered slightly afterward, allowing the Allied Forces to counterattack successfully, winning the next two sets 21-17 and 21-18. Nanda, not daring to be negligent, rallied and won the fourth set 21-11, tying the score at 2-2. In the final set, Nanda reverted to its old habits, making frequent errors. The Allied Forces, with Wu Hua-xiong, Zhong Hua-chao, and Liu Xi-wen at the forefront, displayed their full potential and defeated the champions 21-11. The lineups for both teams are as follows:

Allied Forces Team

### Faint Evening Light as They Battle the Australian League; Philippine Team Defeated 2-1; Philippine Team Returns South by Ship Today

The Philippine football team traveled to Australia by ship the day before yesterday to compete against the local league team. Unexpectedly, nine of their players were late to the wharf and missed the Tai Shan ship, which departed at 9:00 AM. Only four players went ahead. In the afternoon, the nine late players took another ship to Australia. As a result, when the fans began to arrive at 4:30 PM, they only saw the local team warming up, with no sign of the Philippine players. Many spectators had high expectations. It was not until 6:00 PM that the Philippine team finally arrived. In the fierce match, the Philippine team initially showed its strength, with Bao Sai-li scoring a goal in the first half, giving them a 1-0 lead. Three minutes into the second half, Australian left-winger Li Gu returned the favor, tying the score at 1-1. Then, as the evening grew darker and the ball became harder to see, the Australian team, familiar with the terrain, found it easier to control the game. Australian center-forward Chen Li seized an opportunity and sent the ball deep into the Philippine goal. The Australian forwards rushed forward. Wei Lan-nuo-hua managed to touch the ball, but could not stop Ji Li-lu's push. Player and ball tumbled into the net, making the score 2-1, and the Australian team ultimately reversed the defeat to win the game. The lineups for both teams are as follows:

(Australian League Team)

Jia Hua-lu

Luo Ba-du Li Bao-gen

Ge Lu-hua Chen Li Shi Wei-lu

Li Gu Luo Bi-shi Ji Li-lu Gao Li-su Xiao Luo Bi-shi

(Philippines)

After the match in Australia, the Philippine team took a ship back to Hong Kong late that night. Yesterday evening at 8:00 PM, the South China Athletic Association held a banquet for the team at the Ying Jing Restaurant, attended by dozens of people. The event ended at around 10:00 PM. It is reported that the Philippine team is scheduled to leave Hong Kong for the Philippines on the Lan-nuo ship this afternoon.

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment… Marie Antoinette

Marie Antoinette

This film is a great success in every way. Every scene is filled with moving romance and suspenseful tragedy. Furthermore, Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power, in their first collaboration, exquisitely portray the tragic fate of a French queen. Their acting in the film reaches the highest peak of artistic expression.

Norma Shearer plays an Austrian princess full of enthusiasm and hope, who unfortunately marries the intellectually dull Louis XVI. Disappointed, she indulges in a life of luxury and excess, and falls in love with the Duke of Axel Fersen. However, she ultimately fails to gain the understanding of the people due to her waste of national funds and indulgence in desires, as well as Louis' incompetence, which leads to widespread poverty and the outbreak of revolution. In this tumultuous era, her extremely tragic fate is created.

The film vividly brings this moving historical event to the screen. The sets and costumes are also extremely magnificent. At the same time, the film provides a very realistic depiction of the queen's extravagant life, the environment that shaped her character, and the situation of the French Revolution at the time, further enhancing the film's authenticity. This "Marie Antoinette" is a work highly worth recommending to the audience.

"艷妻扮婢記" ("The Glamorous Wife Posing as a Maid")

A hilarious and crazy romantic comedy. The story is quite interesting, depicting a marriage full of jokes. Remi Land plays an American athlete who returns from Paris with his newlywed wife, but in order to save his father from bankruptcy, he has to feign an engagement with the daughter of an old shipping company boss. Unable to accommodate his wife, this new bride has to temporarily hide her identity from her mother-in-law and father-in-law and act as a maid, resulting in many jokes in this special situation.

The leading actress, Olin Bairelina, plays this humorous and lively role, which suits her personality very well. Her performance in the film is satisfactory. Remi Land's acting is also wonderful and interesting. The director handles the film in a very light and lively manner, making it a great work for entertainment.

Oriental… "惡霸橫行" ("Racket Busters")

Racket Busters

The first half is rather dull, but the second half is quite tense. Overall, it is still a good film in the "gangster education" genre. Humphrey Bogart, known for playing thugs, gives a subtle and detailed performance here. George Brent is also good. Allen Jenkins plays the inherently comical role well. Gloria Dickson is completely redundant and unnecessary.

Dahua… Beau Hunks

Beau Hunks

Cathay… Little Miss Broadway

Little Miss Broadway

Shirley Temple is undoubtedly recognized as the most popular "little singer" on the screen right now. Having her star in this film is, of course, a shrewd business move by 20th Century Fox.

As for the plot, it's the same old tired formula, extremely superficial and vulgar. The only watchable scene is when she leaves the orphanage and separates from her friends. The rest is quite disappointing.

Shirley has grown up a bit. Thanks to the Hollywood film merchants, she has developed a "grown-up tone," of course, a "Hollywood-style" grown-up tone. The genuine innocence of a child is not left much, and soon, it is believed that even this will be destroyed.

The song and dance are passable, but the scenes are not grand. The last scene, the "courtroom theater," is also unremarkable.

### On the Literary Quality of Correspondences

— Huang Sheng

The main function of correspondence is to quickly report on all aspects of social reality and dynamics. What differentiates it from ordinary news is that it not only bears the task of reporting on factual events, but also the higher task of improving the reader's literary cultivation and ability to understand social reality. Therefore, it occupies a very respected position in newspapers.

For such correspondence, we cannot but emphasize its literary quality. It must be written artistically by the correspondent; in other words, a correspondence should be a piece of reportage, because reportage is precisely about quickly reporting on all aspects of social reality and dynamics. For correspondence to be welcomed by readers, it must have literary techniques.

"I don't have enough refined skills yet, so I can't write novels, so I'll write reports first." This is mistaking reportage for something inferior to novels, and in particular mistaking reportage as "naturally" being technically inferior to novels; such misunderstandings, as reflected in works, are sloppy writing: this is the serious instruction that Mr. Mao Dun gives us.

And in the minds of writers, there is an even more serious mistake, which is mistaking correspondence for something inferior to reportage, and in particular mistaking correspondence as "naturally" being technically inferior to reportage; such misunderstandings, as reflected in works, often result not only in sloppy writing and a lack of editing, but also in a lack of content!

Therefore, this misunderstanding must be quickly corrected. The difference between correspondence and ordinary news lies in the presence or absence of literary quality. Correspondence without literary quality is simply the deliberate lengthening of ordinary news. For newspapers, it is not only "naturally" unable to obtain a respected position, but can even be said to be an "obstacle" that hinders the layout.

Nowadays, general correspondences tend to be the correspondent's "travelogues," richly decorated with descriptions of scenery or scenes with great people. In short, they are so-called "beautiful sentences": but this is only the outer garment of literature, and not the literary quality that we mean. What we mean is: the writing of correspondence must be governed by general literary principles.

For example, in a place, what we hear and see is a very complex set of phenomena. Which ones do we report? This requires selection. In an event, which points do we report and which points do we omit? This requires editing. How do we report the selected material vividly and realistically? This requires the technique of "imaging."

This is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that we need to have a correct viewpoint, and strive to find the connections between various phenomena and the causes and effects of various events in the social upheavals. With a correct viewpoint, the selection and editing mentioned above will be effective. A simple correspondence, she must also "have the ability to see the general from the specific, and the whole from the individual." This is mainly what we mean by "literary quality."

Current general correspondences all show that the correspondent's work is not deep enough, their ability to grasp reality is poor, and their literary techniques are lacking. From the correspondences, we only see reports of isolated phenomena, descriptions of trivial facts, and abstract records. For example, reporting on the dynamics of the people in an area after a robbery is: "Since the × people withdrew from ××, the people in the city and various villages have returned one after another. Although they see the broken walls and have no home to return to, they do not show pessimism or resentment, but instead strengthen their determination to resist the war. Now those whose houses have been burned down are mostly living in temporary thatched huts. They are holding their teeth, determined to regenerate on their own strength, and engage in the work of resisting the war,..." Such correspondence is simply too far from literary quality. Therefore, it is impossible for him to make readers gain a sense of reality, and even less to improve literary cultivation and cognitive ability. The war of resistance has promoted the development of correspondence in newspapers, and only newspapers can publish a lot of correspondence. The fact that all correspondence can be literary constructs the fully developed form of reportage. This constant appearance of accurate and vivid reports of social reality and dynamics will improve people's understanding of reality, their concern for social reform, and the strengthening of practical life; at the same time, it has also built the foundation for the high development of literature. We emphasize that correspondence should have literary quality, and it has this great significance.

### The Essential Elements of New Literature

— Qin Wen

Once it comes to the realistic school, literature focuses on the exploration of life issues; it overthrows the playful attitude of literature for the sake of literature. The purpose of problem-oriented literature is to promote ideas, instill knowledge, and cultivate character, so as to educate the masses. It is merely using the essence of literature. Therefore, whether it is a work of naturalism or neo-idealism, or the anti-Japanese war literature that the teachers urgently need, it must be truly beneficial to life. New literature is a powerful weapon to instigate revolution, and in addition to being upright in its doctrine, there are three important conditions that are worth noting.

First, it must have the power to agitate. New literature must, of course, have a demonstration, but more importantly, it must have the power to inspire readers. It must not only tell readers what to do, but also make readers unknowingly follow the prompts and implement them step by step. There are many sacred precepts and maxims of sages in the world, but they are coldly left in libraries and have nothing to do with the world, because they are static and dead. New literature should be alive and dynamic; this requires the author to embrace passionate feelings and write truly and thoroughly in order to deeply touch readers and make them active. Negative exposure methods also have a considerable place in new literature, but they must also contain the power of agitation, so that readers will involuntarily feel angry and go to eradicate those ugly things.

Second, it must have a good influence; the words and sentences of classical literature are very beautiful and pleasing to read, but for readers, they can often only give some vague impressions. Romantic literature, although enthusiastic and easy to like, focuses on emotional provocation, and often lacks concrete prompts for proper life issues. After making people praise, they just feel fluttering and at a loss. Some people are good at rhetoric and write in a fanciful way, and some people are good at catering to psychology and speak eloquently. This can be said to be a considerable success for the author personally; but as far as the impact is concerned, it is not necessarily beneficial to society, or even harmful. New literature must be able to have a good influence. In addition to having the passion to encourage, it must also have a proper prompt. The so-called criticism of life and guidance of life are necessary conditions for new literature. Whether it is said explicitly, implicitly, or reactively, it must be able to have a good influence.

Third, it must be able to liquidate a powerful effect; there are some works that can have a good influence on some people, but it is limited to accidental opportunities and the effect is not great. This is due to the lack of universality. There are some works that can have a good influence on people with abundant knowledge, but the general public who have not received much education cannot understand them, and the effect is not great. This is because it has not been popularized. New literature must have universality and must be popularized. Taking the masses as the target, it is always necessary to prepare to get a powerful effect when it is liquidated.

Among these three essential elements, the relationship of "influence" is the greatest. "Liquidation" only has the problem of the size of the effect, and "agitation" only has the relationship of whether the effect can occur. If the impact is not in line, it will be harmed instead, so the relationship is the most important. Then, when we estimate the value of a work, we must not take the superficial words as a prerequisite, but we must carefully examine its intention and judge what influence will occur.

### Declaration

— Ren Jun

Let us shoot the night dead with a gun!

Let the fragrance of gunpowder replace the fragrance of violets!

Let all the flowers and plants wither under the hooves of horses!

We want to sing new songs

Lyrics made of blood and tears,

Because we are all warriors of the new era!

Let the mummies appreciate the poems of love!

Let the fossils chant the beautiful words!

Let the muses forever weep in the cold palace!

We want to ride warhorses,

Raise our guns--

And sing the new song in the battlefield!

We want to sing new songs,

The new song must be sung loudly by 450 million throats:

Sing until the discolored mountains and rivers are restored!

Sing until the dark night of Asia shines!

### Liujia Pond

— Hen

The reeds of Liujia Pond have been cut, leaving only short sections of roots. If a strong wind rises, the waves in the pond always want to submerge them; but, when the wind stops, the water is still the water. The roots of the reeds are still the roots of the reeds.

Every day, as usual, there is a fishing boat parked on the shore of Liujia Pond. And every day, as usual, two or three soldiers in yellow uniforms always circle around the place where the fishing boat is parked at Liujia Pond.

It was getting late this day, and the sun was about to climb to midday. The fishing boat was moving on the ripples of Liujia Pond, and an old man, bending forward and backward, was rowing the oars. The boat was slowly approaching the shore. Strangely, a soldier in a yellow uniform was already standing at the place where the boat stopped every day, and when he saw the fishing boat rowing over from the ripples of the pond, a look of joy appeared on his face.

As soon as the fishing boat approached the shore of the pond, the soldier in the yellow uniform immediately jumped on the boat, looked around the boat with sharp eyes, and the joyful face temporarily changed to a dead color; then he looked at the fisherman who was rowing, and the fisherman also looked at him.

The soldier in the yellow uniform.

"You," the soldier in the yellow uniform pointed at the fisherman, and then made gestures of length, lack, can jump, things in the water, and then said: "Have or not?"

"Yes," the fisherman lifted the cabin board under his feet. Some water was poured inside, and you could see four or five carp writing in the water cabin. When the soldier in the yellow uniform saw it, he changed back to his original joyful look.

The soldier in the yellow uniform stepped from the front cabin of the boat to the fisherman, squatted down his short body, picked up the carp in the cabin with his hand, raised his head and looked at the fisherman's face and said: "Heart, heart" and continued to use a rope, one, two, three... tied together, the fisherman looked at him, understood the smile in his heart, and lightly moved the oars in his hand, the fishing boat left the shore.

The fishing boat was more than twenty feet away from the shore. The soldier in the yellow uniform was still busy tying the fish, not knowing that the boat was close to the center of the pond. The fisherman looked at the shore and saw no other soldiers in yellow uniforms, so he gritted his teeth, used the strength he used to tear the fishing net, and lifted the strange soldier squatting on the boat, and threw him into the water. Fish and soldiers fell into Liujia Pond together. Extremely large waves rose on the surface of the water, and the fishing boat kept rocking.

The fisherman saw that the water surface was calm and wavy, and with a smiling face, he steered the boat away from Liujia Pond.

The sky was starting to have strong winds, blowing up giant waves, washing over the roots of reeds, splashing white foamy water. Liujia Pond is always like this: after the wind stops, the water is still the water, and the roots of the reeds are still the roots of the reeds. But this time, a yellow thing floated up, half of it on the roots of the reeds, and the other half in the water.

Since that day, the shadow of a fishing boat in Liujia Pond has not been found. On the shore, the soldiers in yellow uniforms were not seen either.

### Street Corner Story

— Tieguang

I stood on the street corner looking at the newspapers on the newsstand, to see if there were any eye-catching headlines. A tabloid seemed to be deliberately exposing its attitude more vividly during this Lunar New Year's Day, in order to attract the attention of more pedestrians taking a break during the holiday. However, most of the pedestrians relaxing during the New Year are outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, or at least they can be said to be good people who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. Therefore, even though this tabloid used large characters to mark the following title—Domestic Peace Has Great Opportunities After the Japanese Occupation of Hainan Island; however, no one paid attention. This also only shows that shameless theorists and literary vagrants who advocate peace and compromise, and surrender, have not become extinct. So, I went and asked the news vendor, "Does this tabloid sell well?"

The news vendor sitting on the ground shook his head and said to me with some displeasure: "It doesn't sell even three copies a day. I didn't want to sell it, but they insist on delivering it."

Enough, this loyal news vendor has given us an accurate report. This is what I encountered at around three o'clock in the afternoon.

At seven o'clock in the evening, I reappeared on a street corner among more than a hundred lower-class people who were also celebrating the New Year, listening to a storyteller who was very spiritedly narrating a story.

I carefully listened to every sentence. What he was telling was no longer those stories from ancient books, those stories of conquering the East and conquering the West, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or Generals of the Yang Family. Instead, he clearly and explicitly combined the conspiracy of the Japanese invaders and the facts of Wang Jingwei's telegrams into a very engaging story. None of the more than a hundred listeners felt bored.

I am amazed by the storyteller's cleverness, and I admire his ideological consciousness even more, as he has cleared away the dross of the old content of his storytelling in this great battle for national liberation.

I felt a great sense of joy. My joy is not only because the storyteller can use old forms and new content to win the sympathy of the audience, but mainly because he can dare to satirize and expose the pathetic and shameful nature of the peace movement of the national traitors, which is also a good answer to the sensational headline of that tabloid that I saw during the day.

So, I felt that celebrating this Lunar New Year still had some flavor. Although I didn't get to eat chicken and pork, I still felt like I had eaten New Year's chicken and New Year's pork after hearing the storyteller's story.

### The Solidarity of the Chinese People

— Ai Wu

Random Thoughts on the National Crisis, No. 2

The solidarity of the Chinese people has always been somewhat lacking compared to that of Europeans and Americans. Foreigners compare us to a heap of loose sand. We don't need to argue too much, we should just use this saying to warn ourselves. Because the most obvious place is the structure of the social economy, which does not closely connect the lives of all Chinese people. Instead, each place can almost achieve self-sufficiency and does not need to rely on the supply of another place to exist. Like the War of Resistance, it has been going on for so long, and many areas far from the front lines, apart from the impact of conscription, are still the same as in peacetime. To unite and resist insults under such living conditions, a great deal of propaganda effort is necessary.

Thank you to the × people's airplanes! If they didn't drop bombs in the rear, threatening every Chinese person with death and burning, I believe that the spirit of the Chinese people's united resistance to insults and the anger of shared hatred against the enemy would not be so strong, so fierce! Because in the rear, any touching propaganda, any alarming slogans, are not as profound as a destroyed house, a bombed corpse! In short, the spirit of our Chinese people's united resistance against Japan is constantly increasing, and in some places, we cannot but give credit to the Japanese bombers.
