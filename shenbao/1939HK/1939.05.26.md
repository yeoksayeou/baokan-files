### Our Country's Minimum Demands

On the 22nd of this month, our country's representative, Gu Weijun, presented two demands to the League of Nations Administrative Council: first, to notify member states to expand their financial and material assistance to China and to cease supplying Japan with war materials and raw materials; and second, to organize a group to jointly promote various measures. These demands are, in fact, the minimum we can ask for today, after 22 months of arduous struggle to uphold world peace and justice. We are not only sacrificing ourselves for the sake of our nation's independence and survival, but we are also serving as the vanguard in defending the anti-aggression front, and at the same time, we are the guardians of the Far Eastern interests of the European and American democratic countries. As Representative Gu said: 'If China had already succumbed to Japanese threats or ceased resisting Japanese aggression, allowing Japan to monopolize the Far East, the impact on the interests of democratic countries in the Far East and on the current tense situation in Europe would be obvious even to those without wisdom.'

The first of Representative Gu's demands includes four detailed items: (1) Member states should expand their financial and material assistance to China to strengthen China's ability to resist aggression and to assist refugee relief efforts; (2) avoid all actions that could weaken China's resistance to aggression; (3) cease supplying Japan with war materials and raw materials, especially aircraft and gasoline, to prevent further fueling its aggressive flames; and (4) restrict the import of Japanese goods. The majority of the content of this demand can be implemented very conveniently and effectively by the member states. Financial and material assistance is an appropriate outlet in countries with excess capital and abundant production. With China's debt credit still solid today, all countries can boldly extend loans. Although no specific facts were cited regarding actions that weaken China's resistance, if we were to cite an example, it would be that the international publicity of China's heroic resistance and the exposure of _______________ are sometimes met with suppression or even oppression by some countries or local governments. These are facts that all countries should urgently avoid, and which are very easy to implement. Stopping the supply of war materials and raw materials to Japan, at a time when Japan's finances are on the verge of collapse, is an extremely dangerous matter. I recall that the United States government once warned manufacturers and traders not to casually extend credit to Japan. People from all countries should still remember this clearly! As for restricting the import of Japanese goods, this is a very beneficial measure for countries whose commodity markets are being seized by Japan, especially the eastern territories of Great Britain. It is easy for member states to implement these conditions, and the benefits are very great.

The implementation of the above-mentioned various demands requires appropriate subjects and methods. Therefore, Representative Gu also proposed the formation of a group, which is similar to the 52-nation committee that the League of Nations established when it sanctioned Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, with the aim of promoting cooperation and joint efforts. Individual actions often become lax, so this group is very important. The establishment of such a subcommittee is also necessary to implement Article 16 of the Covenant. Unfortunately, Britain and France only recognize the principle of joint action and, using the excuse that the European crisis has not been completely resolved, say that the basic elements for this joint action are not yet in place. The views of Britain and France are very mechanical. They believe that the resolution of the Far East issue must wait until the European crisis is completely resolved, but they do not realize that world issues are whole and indivisible, and that the China issue is even more closely related to the European issue. If China were to surrender to Japan early, Britain, the United States, and France would not only completely lose their interests in China, but their eastern territories would also be in danger, and Britain and France's position in Europe would be further threatened. Japan's accomplices, Germany and Italy, would intensify their encroachment on Britain and France. The League of Nations, under the control of Britain and France, cannot merely reiterate its previous recommendations regarding our country's demands. We hope to have more concrete joint measures to meet our minimum requirements.

In the evening, the battalion commander negotiated with the other party:

"That doesn't matter, as long as the brothers are willing to reorganize."

"That's right! ________ They can figure it out!"

"Sir, drink it, we have boiled water ready for you here."

The travelers were moved to tears, but the political commissar's eloquent mouth didn't know how to express himself at this time.

"Old folks. You are so good."

"Sir, you don't know, day and night, we are looking forward to you coming to fight."

Walking. Walking. ________ It was dawn in the east. At the time of parting, the old man pointed out the village road over and over again, and repeatedly warned, before he was willing to go back.

In the slightly white morning light, the cloth signs of the "Good Citizen Certificate" issued by the invaders were seen on the lapels of each of their clothes.

How can the crazy aggression of the Fascists know that the soul of the Chinese nation is forever buried in the hearts of the people of the Chinese nation!

Four, Children Catch Spies

After breakfast, the farmers walked out of the round cave-like village gate in ________, leading their cattle and carrying plows and rakes. The people in the guerrilla base area were still working as ________ as usual.

Few people were at home, only two children in their teens were ________ outside the village gate at the intersection, throwing stones ________ and scolding each other.

"Little kids, is there any "________ Route" inside?"

The two children became suspicious, their small faces froze, and their four small eyes stared blankly.

"Damn, follow ________ him," said the older one.

"Go"!

"The two soldiers walked into a restaurant, sat under the tea shed, smoked, and asked for boiled water. They looked a little embarrassed ________ and exhausted."

The two children circled around, four eyes, squeezing ________ to buy, conveying thoughts, and looked at the two soldiers all over, without any symbols of the ________ route army, and their tone of speech and "________ route" were not consistent.

The two children found gaps from the dry lips, yellow faces, and black teeth of the two soldiers.

The two children, from the two soldiers' dry lips, yellow faces, and black teeth ________, found the gap.

At this time, after a soldier and the restaurant owner were muttering something, carrying guns and bombs, the two of them went to the back room.

The soldiers unloaded their guns, bombs, and big knives ________ on the kang in the back room of the restaurant. The bright big opium lamp, the ________ copper-colored opium bubbles next to the lamp, the world of clouds and fog, forgot everything.

The two children smiled and turned back again, followed by red tassel spears, earthen cannons, and big knives at the street entrance.

Inside the restaurant was the hissing ________ of smoking, and outside was the chattering discussion. ________ The momentum became more and more tense.

"Damn, they're either deserters or traitors"! Deciding that these two soldiers were not good guys, they still asked the two children to strike first.

Five, Carrying Bombs into the City

Sun, Li, and Zhang, three warriors, dressed in civilian clothes, carrying bombs, went into the city to buy things.

The usual practice: the aggressor's soldiers could speak a little Chinese, so there was no way to interrogate the people. Therefore, people entering the city, walking to a place thirty steps away from the sentry post at the city gate, only needed to take off their hats and bow to show they were good citizens, and they could enter without ________.

On this day, the three warriors did as usual, but unexpectedly, they encountered an unfortunate difficulty. Two soldiers ________ stopped them. They looked them up and down and insisted on searching them.

"Insist on searching?" The three warriors were a little unwilling in their hearts.

"Damn, how can we ________ break through the search with a bomb in our arms? We might as well just move!" They made up their minds in their hearts ________.

With a "bang", a ________ bomb exploded in the middle of those two soldiers, like two doors opening, and two corpses fell facing each other.

Since the bomb had exploded, there was no way to run away from ________, so they might as well take the opportunity to rush into the city. So they climbed up the city tower and aimed at the aggressor's residence, bombarding it fiercely and killing a few more, and seizing several guns.

### Under the Threat of Cannon Fire From a × Warship, a French Mail Steamer Was Searched. Two Foreign Vessels Were Intercepted Within Half a Day. The French Authorities Have Decided to Lodge a Strong Protest.

[United Press Shanghai, 25th] It has been learned that the Commander of the French Asian Fleet, Mr. Bao Ke, intends to proceed to Shanghai on the French vessel "Ya Mei," to investigate the details of the search of the ship by a Japanese warship and then lodge a protest with the Japanese side, it is said.

[Reuters Shanghai, 25th] According to sources from the French side here, the French vessel "Aramis" was ordered to stop sailing by a Japanese destroyer yesterday while en route to Shanghai, about 100 miles outside Hong Kong. Japanese sailors boarded the vessel and searched it for an hour. Although the French ship protested, the Japanese Navy meticulously checked all documents. It is reported that the French authorities will lodge a strong protest regarding this matter and have telegraphed the detailed situation to the government in Paris. The "Aramis" is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow.

[Hong Kong News] The British mail steamer "Ranpura" was threatened by cannon fire from a × warship near Hung Hom at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, and forcibly ordered to stop sailing. Sailors were sent to board and search the vessel. Fortunately, a British warship rushed to the rescue, and it arrived safely in Hong Kong. Several hours after the incident, the "Aramis" was stopped from proceeding in the same manner by a × warship just outside the harbor while en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and officers and soldiers were sent to board and search the vessel, causing great disturbance. The × warship knew it was a British and French mail steamer, but still forcibly harassed it, disregarding international law, infringing upon the rights of neutral countries. Its outrageous behavior is becoming increasingly fierce.

Aramis Was Searched Again

It is reported that the French mail steamer "Aramis," with a capacity of 15,500 tons, which regularly travels between Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe, Japan, departed from Hong Kong yesterday (24th) at noon and set sail for Shanghai. About half an hour after departure, it encountered a × destroyer, which stopped its progress. Subsequently, three officers and two soldiers boarded the vessel via a motorboat. They forcibly demanded the ship's papers and logbook from the captain and inspected them before releasing the vessel. The "Aramis" has a square funnel painted in milky white, and the ship's surface and hull are painted with the prominent French national emblem. It is obvious that it is a French merchant ship. However, the × military officers who boarded the vessel were extremely absurd and asked a series of unreasonable questions, such as "Where did you come from?" "Where are you going?" "Passenger list," and "Cargo manifest," creating a long and pointless disturbance that lasted for an hour before they left. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Hong Kong at noon on the 24th and arrive in Shanghai around the 25th, but the voyage was delayed due to the harassment by the × warship.

France Will Lodge a Strong Protest

Regarding the harassment of the ship by the × warship, the news received in Hong Kong states that the ship departed at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, carrying 80 first-class passengers and 200 other passengers, a total of 280 people. Immediately after leaving the harbor, it encountered a × destroyer, which hoisted a warning flag and forced it to stop, firing a blank shot as a warning to the ship. The method of stopping it was the same as that used against the "Ranpura." After the incident, the ship's captain immediately telegraphed to Admiral Tillolles, the Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Fleet stationed in Xiamen. As the location of the incident was too far away, no French warship was sent to assist. In addition to telegraphing Commander Tillolles, the captain also telegraphed the British and French naval authorities in Xiamen to report everything, but did not request assistance. It is believed that as a result of this incident, the Commander of the French Far East Fleet will lodge a strong protest with Kondo, the × Chief stationed in Xiamen, nearby. At the same time, the French ambassador in Tokyo will also negotiate with the × government. Yesterday, the French Consul General in Hong Kong, Mr. Lidu, told reporters that as of yesterday morning, the information received indicated that the "Aramis" had been stopped and searched by a × warship outside Hong Kong. The information obtained was very brief. As for whether to report the matter to the French government for negotiation, it would depend on receiving a detailed report, he said.

### The British Ship Ranpura Incident: Nobel Protests to Japan, and Simultaneously Declares Strong Measures Will Be Taken to Prevent Similar Incidents From Happening Again.

[Reuters London, 25th] It has just been learned that regarding the British ship "Ranpura" being ordered to stop sailing by a Japanese warship, British Commander-in-Chief in China, Nobel, has lodged a protest with the Japanese side, demanding an explanation, and stated that strong measures will be taken to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

[Hong Kong News] According to official Hong Kong news yesterday morning, after the × warship unreasonably harassed the British ship "Ranpura," Admiral Nobel, the British Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, lodged a strong protest with the × authorities. According to unconfirmed news, after this incident occurred, the British authorities have prepared to dispatch British naval vessels to accompany merchant ships traveling to and from the Far East for protection. A naval spokesperson here declared that he had not yet heard of this matter. Also, yesterday morning, it was widely rumored in Shanghai that when × soldiers boarded the "Ranpura" yesterday morning, they had removed three official mailbags from the ship. It is recorded that the three mailbags were handed over to the Hong Kong military authorities, but the Hong Kong military authorities strongly denied this matter.

### British Ships Have Repeatedly Been Interfered With by ×, Britain Is Extremely Indignant, Chamberlain Expresses Great Dissatisfaction in the House of Commons, and Members of Parliament Demand Retaliatory Measures.

[Central News Agency London, 25th] Regarding the British ship "Shaggart" being detained by the Japanese near Shantou a few days ago, Conservative Member of Parliament Mr. Teitcher questioned the matter in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that in order to warn Japan, we should order several Japanese merchant ships to stop sailing in the Atlantic or Mediterranean, because our naval strength there is clearly in absolute advantage. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that he also found the matter extremely unsatisfactory and that there was still no news of the ship's release.

[Central News Agency London, 24th] When the House of Commons was in session this afternoon, Conservative Member of Parliament Mr. Milner inquired whether the British government had taken measures to prevent further interference with British shipping after 2,000 fresh pigs were seized by five Japanese armed motorboats in the New Harbor of China on April 2 while they were being transported by sampans to the British ships "Whangpoo" and "Cuxhaven." Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately provided a written response stating that Foreign Secretary Halifax was unaware of the incident mentioned by Mr. Milner, but that he had received reports on several occasions that British commercial shipping was being interfered with in the San-tiao-chou area of the Yangtze River, and that the situation was intensifying. Therefore, he had lodged representations with the Japanese government.

[Central News Agency London, 25th] The Conservative Party's House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee's China Group held a meeting here last night and resolved to express satisfaction with the actions taken by the government in the past and to express the hope that in the future, under adverse forces, more resolute action should be taken to deal with everything. It also held discussions on the general situation in China, and paid close attention to (1) the status of the British Concession in Tianjin, (2) the interference with navigation on the Yangtze River, and (3) the continuous threats made by the Japanese military landing on Gulangyu. The members of parliament were deeply aware of the seriousness of the situation and resolved to use their full strength to represent the British community in China who have vested interests, and to closely monitor the development of the situation.

### Shanghai Lun Chang Cloth Factory Dispute Resolved, Japanese Side Guarantees Safety, British Troops Have Been Withdrawn

[Reuters Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese Naval Commander in Shanghai recently lodged a protest with the British authorities, stating that a British naval team landed in Pudong, across the river from Shanghai, to protect a British-owned cotton mill, resulting in the injury of one Japanese officer and one translator. According to a Japanese report, the British Navy has now withdrawn from Pudong.

[Reuters Shanghai, 25th] The British Army stationed at the British-owned Lun Chang Company textile factory in Pudong was withdrawn today. This army unit had only been stationed at the factory yesterday, replacing the British Navy originally stationed there. After negotiations between the British and Japanese sides, the Japanese side had guaranteed the lives and property of the factory, so the British troops withdrew.

[Reuters Shanghai, 25th] The newly appointed British Naval Commander-in-Chief at Sea, Rear Admiral Simons, arrived here today on the HMS "Sussex" and landed at the new Customs pier, where he inspected a guard of honor.

### Dr. Hu Shih Meets With Reporters in the United States, Reports on the Situation of the War of Resistance

[United Press Washington, 25th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih, met with a United Press reporter today and predicted that China would win the final victory. He said that although China might have to undergo another two years before it can achieve victory, the current war situation has made important developments: (1) China is determined to continue the war of resistance and resist aggression, (2) China is now in a dominant position, launching attacks on the Japanese army on a front line 2,000 miles long, (3) Chinese guerrillas are extremely active, and the difficulties of the Japanese army are increasing, and will eventually lead to collapse.

### Japanese Newspaper Claims That the Three Countries Are Jointly Assisting China, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Are Negotiating a Military Alliance, and the Far East Is Also Included.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] According to the "Kokumin Shimbun," a newspaper published here, it has been reliably learned that among the conditions for the military alliance being negotiated by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, there is a secret clause to include the Far East in the alliance. The three countries will actively assist Chiang Kai-shek in terms of military supplies and send volunteer troops to China to participate in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war. Judging from the repeated attacks by Outer Mongolian troops on the border of Manchuria, the actions taken by Britain and France in Gulangyu and Shanghai, and the dispatch of French military advisors to Chongqing, it can be seen that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are indeed planning joint action.

### On the Ganbei Front

— Fan Shizhi

(Continued from yesterday) Battalion Commander Wu saw from the tree that the × army had bypassed the mound and was heading north. He pointed his hand to the south, and the two brothers began to guard to the south. Indeed, the × soldiers came in formation. When they entered the range of my rifle, the two soldiers divided to the left and right and continuously shot at the × soldiers. The × soldiers were caught off guard, and five or six of them immediately fell. Not knowing my true strength, they hurriedly formed a horizontal line, scattered, and fired at me. I suddenly ignored the × soldiers firing and after a few minutes, they detoured behind the mountain, attempting to flank my rear. Battalion Commander Wu saw clearly from the tree, so he pointed his hand to the north, and the two brothers immediately began to advance, guarding to the north. As expected, the × soldiers attacked from north to south. After I returned fire, the × soldiers failed again. After doing this two or three times, a certain company of mine heard the sound of gunfire and rushed to the scene, surrounding the × soldiers. The encirclement gradually narrowed, and as a result, the entire × soldiers were annihilated by me.

Battalion Commander Wu was not flustered, and jumped down from the tree, examining his clothes. A bullet had passed through his right abdomen, leaving a large hole in his coat, and another bullet had exited from between his legs, with two bullet holes in his crotch. Fortunately, he was not injured.

(4) Bloody Battle of Liancheng Bridge

On the night of April 24, the × soldiers launched a full-scale attack on Liancheng Bridge, two miles northeast of Gaoan, and the situation was precarious. A certain acting division commander ordered Zhu Shouying's troops to automatically cut off Liancheng Bridge and fight with their backs to the river, turning the overall situation from danger to safety. On the 25th, the acting division commander transferred the officers and soldiers of the battalion to the second line for reorganization and rest due to their outstanding meritorious service. On that day, the reporter happened to accompany the division commander to the front line for inspection. At Longwangchao, three miles northwest of Gaoan, he encountered the soldiers of the battalion, who had just been transferred from the front. They were covered in yellow mud and their faces were indistinguishable. Most of them had only twenty or so bullets left, and some had none. It was known that one part of the battalion had not eaten for two days because they had not been able to contact the rear. The acting commander asked them, "The officers were unable to send the food up because they could not contact you, are you feeling bitter? What are your thoughts?"

A squad leader replied, "Revolutionary soldiers are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, and not afraid of hunger. The × people are more bitter than us, they also have no food to eat."

Another private soldier continued, "Because we defended our position to the death, we have food to eat now. And the × people have not had anyone to relieve them, so they still have no food to eat." After saying that, everyone's faces showed a victorious smile. The acting division commander continued to ask, "Last night, more than 120 officers and soldiers below the battalion commander were poisoned, and the position was once shaken. Later, after you destroyed the bridge yourself, you swore to defend it to the death, fighting with your backs to the river. Were you afraid at that time? Did you want to run to the back?"

Their unanimous answer was, "No fear!" Another platoon leader said even more eloquently, "Not only were we not afraid, but we also gave the × people a very thorough assault last night. It was just because it was dark and rainy that our platoon could not contact the company and battalion headquarters that night, but we were not afraid in our hearts, because the Japanese were even less familiar with the terrain than we were, and we could not contact anyone at night. If we ran to the back, the troops behind would only think we were × people, and we would probably be shot to death by mistake at night. At the same time, the officers would not allow us to run to the back either. So we defended there to the death. Until 2:00 AM this morning, our platoon was able to sleep in a Guandi Temple on a hillside."

At this point, the acting division commander turned to the reporter and said, "With these good soldiers, China will never be destroyed! And no country can destroy it! If the war of resistance has reached today, and there are still some defeatists or pessimists among the people in the rear who are living in luxury, it is best to invite them to organize an observation group to inspect the front line, and I guarantee that they will automatically negate their past views."

(5) Father and Son Avenge

Company Commander Zhu, who is over fifty years old, is a veteran general. He is from Zhengyang, Henan, and started as a soldier. He accumulated merits and rose to company commander.

On April 25, he was ordered to attack the Baishi Ridge in Jiuhua, northeast of Gaoan. Here, the × soldiers had built three layers of barbed wire, with fortifications to the northeast and south, and fewer to the west. Company Commander Zhu led the entire company to attack from the west to the east. When the attack advanced to the first barbed wire fence, the entire company had sacrificed, leaving only more than 30 people. Because the infantry did not have tools to break through the barbed wire, the attack was stalled. At the same time, because it was close to the × soldiers, it was not possible to retreat midway. As a result, they used gun butts, mattocks, and other tools to break through part of the barbed wire with great difficulty. Climbing into the second barbed wire fence, the distance between the × soldiers and I was within the throwing range of hand grenades. Because the × soldiers had fewer firepower to the west and there was no cover, Company Commander Zhu threw a hand grenade with one hand. The grenade hit the target, killing more than ten × soldiers. The remaining × soldiers abandoned their guns and fled in panic. Company Commander Zhu then launched a full-scale attack, but was blocked by the third barbed wire fence of the × soldiers. Although I also killed twenty or thirty × soldiers, I could not withstand the fact that all the machine guns in the north and south strongholds of the × soldiers were activated, and the company was completely martyred, and the bodies could not be retrieved. Company Commander Zhu had a son who was a clerk in the regimental headquarters. When the news reached the regimental headquarters at 2:00 PM, and then to the ears of his son, it was like a bolt from the blue. He was so heartbroken that he decided to ask the regimental commander to allocate some soldiers to be under his command to retrieve his father's body. The regimental commander praised his filial piety and agreed to send soldiers to sneak in with him at night. If they went during the day, he was afraid that it would be in vain. The clerk Zhu agreed to this point and waited patiently.

When dusk fell and people were quiet, the regimental commander sent six scouts to accompany the clerk to search for his father's body. They did not return until the morning of the 26th, and no news about them was obtained. At 4:00 PM on the 26th, Baishi Ridge was occupied by the regimental headquarters. The report said that when our army cleared the battlefield, they found the screen of clerk Zhu next to his father's body, less than five steps away.

A certain division commander praised him for his loyalty and specially buried the remains of the father and son at the original location of the screen on Baishi Ridge, and erected a sign that said "Tomb of Two Loyalists."

(6) Wang, the Battalion Commander Who Performed His Duty Despite Illness

Since the 22nd, the city of Gaoan had been surrounded by us like a barrel. Because of the shortage of heavy weapons, the city could not be captured. Although the × soldiers in the city were panicking, they were still resisting and waiting for reinforcements. In order to reduce losses, I sent Wang Kechong, a company commander who was proficient in Japanese (at that time, Company Commander Wang was still ill), to write a letter of persuasion to surrender. According to the military etiquette, if one country sends a military envoy carrying a white flag to another country, it has the responsibility to protect it, and should not shoot him. As a result, the squad leader was shot dead by the × soldiers halfway. Upon hearing this, Company Commander Wang disregarded everything and volunteered to go despite his illness. At the time, he thought to himself that the letter was not thorough enough. If he went himself, he could talk to them face to face and persuade them, wouldn't that be better? How could he know that the "Imperial Army," which claimed to be a civilized country and "officially promoted Wang Hua" (cultural influence), would disregard international law and the regulations that soldiers should abide by, and shoot him? Company Commander Wang was gloriously injured again under such circumstances.

From then on, every brother in the troops experienced a bloody lesson, and had a deeper understanding of the × soldiers.

(7) Keep It as a Souvenir

On the way from Xiangfu Temple to Gaoan, we passed through Qianjin Village. Because the weather was too hot, even though it was only the sun of May, it was very uncomfortable to be exposed to the sun. So I bought a pot of tea in front of a tea house in Qianjin Village and sat down to quench my thirst.

Sitting at the table next to the reporter were two brothers, veteran soldiers who had recovered from their injuries and returned to the front. They were talking endlessly about their heroic battles.

There were many long benches arranged in the tea house, and five or six stretchers were placed on the benches. Lying on the stretchers were wounded soldiers, all newly sent down from the front line. One of the wounded soldiers was seriously injured and groaned particularly miserably. A comrade named Wang Tie, who was sitting next to the reporter, could not bear it any longer and could not help but stand up and shout loudly, "Comrade, how many bullets did you get hit by?"

"Ah... oh... I... I got hit by three bullets!" The comrade on the stretcher replied, enduring the pain.

With this answer, no one expected Comrade Wang to get angry, "You bastard, you're really a coward!" (The reporter notes that "coward" is a Yunnan dialect. It is used to scold someone who is useless.) "Look, I got hit by eleven bullets!" As he spoke, he rolled up his trousers and took off his shirt, revealing a burly and strong body with no less than twelve bullet wounds of various sizes on his legs, chest, and arms.

Comrade Wang counted his honorable bullet wounds as he spoke, as if he was giving a public lecture to the reporter and the wounded soldiers: "A person who doesn't cry out in pain when he gets injured is a true hero. The last time I was hit by twelve bullets, I still struggled to take down the gun, and I never cried out in pain, because the more you cry out in pain, the more it hurts, and it may affect the other comrades."

After Comrade Wang's persuasion, the wounded comrade on the stretcher really stopped moaning. At this time, Comrade Wang pressed down on his left thigh muscle with both hands, and a hard lump of a bullet immediately protruded in the middle. Comrade Wang pointed to it and said, "There is still a bullet that has not been taken out!" He smiled slightly as he said that.

At this time, the reporter could not stand by idly any longer, so he interrupted and asked him, "Why don't you take it out?"

Comrade Wang's answer was beyond our imagination. He smiled slightly and answered the reporter in a very relaxed tone: "The doctor said, 'It doesn't matter if this bullet is not taken out.' So I decided to keep it as a permanent souvenir, a permanent souvenir of my participation in this war of resistance." (Central News Agency)

### Wang Jingwei: Rumors That He Will Serve as a Puppet

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 25th] According to sources close to Wang Jingwei yesterday, Wang is now making every effort to achieve a "peaceful" resolution of the Sino-Japanese war. Wang and his subordinates are eager for Chairman Chiang to accept Konoe's "peace terms," but if Chairman Chiang decides to continue resisting aggression, Wang will abandon this passive attitude and take action. However, the specifics of this "active action" have not been announced. However, according to news from various sources, Wang seems to want to organize a new puppet government.

### Chamberlain Announces: British-Soviet Agreement to be Concluded; Main Points of Relationship Clarified; Details Under Discussion

[Reuters, London, 24th] Today, in the British House of Commons, Chamberlain, in response to questions from Labor Party opposition leader Attlee regarding Soviet relations, stated, "Members of the House should be aware that Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, met with the French Premier and Foreign Minister in Paris while en route to Geneva. After arriving in Geneva, he continued the talks with the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, which had been previously held in London. As a result of these talks, the main points of the relationship have been clarified. The British government will soon propose new suggestions, hoping to reach a full agreement on the major issues as soon as possible. Although some points still need clarification, I anticipate they will not cause any major difficulties." Subsequently, Attlee asked, "Before the House adjourns for the Whitsun recess, can the government provide a more complete and accurate report?" Chamberlain replied, "If possible, such a report will be made. I have already mentioned that some points still need clarification, so I believe we must wait a little longer. I hope that the next report will provide a full account of the agreement, and I am confident that the agreement can be completed then." This response aroused commotion among opposition members. Labor MP Dalton stated, "Given the urgent crisis in the international situation, we should not delay in organizing a peace front." Chamberlain did not respond to this.

[Reuters, London, 25th] Following Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the progress of British-Soviet negotiations, it has been learned from Reuters' diplomatic correspondent that Britain will soon send a reply to the Soviet Union, accepting the Soviet Union's basic proposal, namely, the conclusion of a mutual assistance alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Under the provisions of this alliance, if any allied nation provides assistance to a country that has been invaded, the other contracting nations must immediately come to its aid. The minor issues that Chamberlain mentioned as still needing resolution will likely be addressed by Halifax and Soviet Ambassador Maisky after Maisky returns to London from Geneva. However, it is believed that these minor issues will not hinder the conclusion of a British-Soviet agreement, and are merely matters of adjusting the wording of the agreement.

[Associated Press, London, 24th] The British Cabinet has announced its decision to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. A British government spokesperson stated that the Foreign Secretary hopes to instruct the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union to propose to the Soviet Foreign Minister within 24 hours the conclusion of a full mutual assistance agreement, expanding the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty of 1936 into a three-nation alliance. It is reported that the British Cabinet has agreed to stipulate that if any of the three nations is attacked, the other two nations should immediately provide assistance.

Britain to Present New Proposal to Soviet Union

[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently consulted with representatives from France and the Soviet Union in Paris and Geneva to conclude a three-nation agreement. Subsequently, a new British proposal was drafted, approved by the recent Cabinet meeting, and presented to the Soviet Union. Regarding whether the Soviet Union will accept it, official circles here have made many speculations. For example, according to a diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Herald," someone close to the Soviet delegation in Geneva has suggested that the Soviet Union will not accept the new British proposal.

In fact, it is difficult to be certain whether the two countries can fully agree on the principle of mutual assistance. Furthermore, it is believed here that there is a distinction between aggression against any of the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and aggression against any of Germany's neighbors. In the former case, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will immediately take military action. In the latter case, although the three countries have provisions for joint action, the scope and method of assistance still depend on prior consultation between the three countries. Moreover, the British-French-Soviet agreement must take into account the guarantees that Britain and France have provided to Poland, Romania, and Greece. The position of Turkey must not be forgotten either. It is reported that Britain and France have been engaged in extensive negotiations with Poland and Romania in the past few days, but the results are not yet known. The new British proposal is still being drafted. Before the proposal is communicated to Moscow, the British government will first discuss it with Soviet Ambassador Maisky. Maisky is expected to return to London around Friday or Saturday of this week. If the principles of the new proposal are accepted by Moscow, negotiations on all matters of principle will begin immediately. Furthermore, it is said that the phrase "aggression..." still needs to be resolved regarding how to interpret it. However, the British government is determined to reserve the right to interpret it, no matter what, and the establishment of an agreement in the future must be based on this reservation.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] London's morning newspapers published this Thursday feel that the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet agreement guarantees that Britain has a positive attitude of agreement toward the Soviet Union's counter-proposal. However, some political figures still believe that before the agreement is concluded, certain details still need to be resolved, and the content of these details is not comparable to ordinary matters. Therefore, the "Daily Express" predicts that the formal signing of the agreement will occur in no less than ten days.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] According to this morning's "Daily Telegraph," an editorial stated that the impact of concluding a British-Soviet agreement is still somewhat lacking. Currently, there are still some obstacles that have not been overcome, and their nature is not entirely political. Moscow and London have different "temperaments," and their perspectives are also vastly different. The author of the editorial also condemned the Soviet authorities, saying that they are to blame for any misunderstandings. The suspicions and misunderstandings in the negotiations are also due to the Soviet authorities' "policy of standing apart."

### Rumor: Italy to Abolish Anglo-Italian Agreement; Believes Anglo-Turkish Agreement Conflicts with It; Plans to Act Freely in Mediterranean

[Central News Agency, Rome, 24th] Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome this morning from Salzburg and reported to Prime Minister Mussolini on the talks with German authorities. Some in political circles here are now claiming that after Germany and Italy signed a political and military agreement, it is possible that Italy will abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement (established on April 16, 1938). There are two arguments: (1) The establishment of an agreement between Britain and Turkey has changed the Mediterranean situation, which conflicts with the clause in the Anglo-Italian Agreement stating that the Mediterranean should maintain its current status. (2) The German volunteers within Spain have decided to withdraw completely before the 30th of this month, which shows that Italy has indeed complied with the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Conversely, Britain has pursued a policy of containment against Germany and Italy. Therefore, Italy must remove the constraints of the Anglo-Italian Agreement and restore its freedom of action. In other words, it must strengthen defenses in the Dodecanese Islands in the Mediterranean and increase troop deployments to the North African colony of Libya, directly threatening Egypt. At the same time, it must resume anti-British propaganda in the Near East. After Italy signed an agreement with Britain, it had hoped that Britain would intervene with France to support Italy's demands, but unexpectedly, the British government did not mediate. This is a point of disappointment for Italy.

British Prime Minister Comments on German-Italian Alliance

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, touched on the German-Italian alliance treaty. He said, upon close examination of the published provisions, it does not appear that any of them conflict with Italy's obligations to Britain. The obligations between Britain and Italy were first stipulated in the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement of January 2, 1937, and then reaffirmed by the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16, 1938. Prime Minister Chamberlain's mention of the German-Italian matter in the House of Commons is his first time doing so.

### British Soldiers Ambushed by Arabs

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 24th] It is reported that British forces were ambushed today between Tulkarm and Nablus, resulting in the death of one British officer and seven Arabs, and injuries to one British officer and two soldiers.

### South Seas Regent Postpones Visit to England

[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] Yesterday, sources in communication circles here stated that Regent Paul of the Southern Kingdom will not visit England in the near future. This news contradicts previous reports. Furthermore, the King and Queen of England are touring America and will not be able to return to the country for at least three weeks, after which they will rest in Scotland for four weeks. Therefore, the Regent's visit to England will not be realized until the end of October. It is reported that Prince Paul may travel to England in August or September in a non-official capacity. Regarding the British government's export credit loan to the country, sources in communication circles say that, as far as is known, this is merely a proposal from the British government. During Prince Paul's previous visit to London, he suggested that Britain provide a loan to the country to expand its military, but Prince Paul politely declined at the time.

### Rumor: British Government Prepares to Mediate German-Polish Issue; Germany Again Announces Polish Anti-German Incident; Danzig Senate Protests to Poland

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 25th] According to an broadcast from the radio station, the British government is preparing to act as a mediator between Germany and Poland. Yesterday, the British Ambassador to Poland visited the Polish Foreign Ministry to seek the Polish government's opinion. Although the Polish side has not yet responded, people in London are very optimistic about this move.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 25th] Today, the "Polish Gazette" published an editorial advocating the establishment of a propaganda department whose main task is to invigorate Poles living abroad and pay attention to the interests of their homeland, especially at a time when European politics are tense. Those Poles living abroad who are concerned about Poland's measures should understand everything.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 25th] It is reported that an anti-German demonstration occurred in Konstantynów, a small town near Łódź in central Poland. The origins and details of the incident are difficult to ascertain because the leaders of the German organizations in the area have been detained by the authorities. One account says that about 20 people were injured in the incident, some seriously. In Łódź, Polish police stormed and searched the headquarters of the "German Citizens' Association," and the homes of several German citizens were robbed by rioters. The Citizens' Association is the largest German organization in central Poland.

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 25th] It was announced here yesterday afternoon that the President of the Danzig Senate has lodged a serious protest with the Polish government against incidents of crossing the border of the Free City. It is said that the contents of the protest include six items: (1) In the past few days, several innocent passers-by have been shot by Polish troops near the border within Danzig. (2) A committee of inquiry sent by the Danzig authorities was blocked by Polish troops from performing its duties within the Free City. (3) Polish troops have repeatedly crossed the Danzig border on various occasions. (4) Polish military aircraft often fly over Danzig airspace. (5) A good traveler in Gdynia was shot dead by the chauffeur of a Polish diplomat. (6) The murderer was shielded by a Polish diplomat and taken to Poland. The protest also stated that, fortunately, the officials and people of Danzig have always maintained good discipline, so they have been able to maintain order, but it demands that the Polish government take appropriate steps to restore order to the Danzig border and prevent officials from acting beyond their authority.

### Soviet-Polish Relations Restored

All Countries Pay Close Attention

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 25th] Soviet Ambassador to Poland Shulanov officially took office here today. Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations, which had been interrupted for a year, have now been fully restored. All countries are paying close attention to this.

### Dutch East Indies Fleet: Professor of Law Urges Increased Armaments to Counter Japanese Naval Expansion

[Reuters, The Hague, 21st] Professor Rommen, leader of the Dutch Christian Historical Party, today urged the government in the Senate to increase the number of ships in the Dutch East Indies fleet by three times in response to Japan's naval expansion. He said that strengthening defenses is extremely important to Australia. The average defense expenditure for British citizens is 14 pounds per person, while Dutch citizens only pay one-fifth of what British citizens pay for defense expenses. There are many reasons for the burden.

### United States: Soviet Union Will Take a Stronger Stance in the Far East, Some Diplomats Observe; Japan's Position Will Become More Difficult

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The diplomatic observation that the Soviet Union "invaded Manchuria" is drawing close attention here, and there is speculation that this move is a rapid response by the Soviet Union to important Japanese events. These important events include the progress of the Anglo-Soviet agreement and other peace-based alliance actions. After the Soviet Union is confident in the security of its four-way border, it will adopt a stronger stance in the Far East. The Manchurian border incident occurred after the Anglo-Soviet alliance was about to be completed and Britain took a strong stance, pressing the Japanese army to withdraw from Gulangyu, which is noteworthy. Some observers believe that Japan's diplomatic and economic position will become more difficult in the future. The decreasing possibility of a European war allows the Soviet Union and Western countries to exert more pressure in the Far East.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" claimed that according to reliable sources, the contents of the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance contain secret conditions, including providing aid to the East and providing Chiang Kai-shek with armaments and sending volunteer soldiers to join the guerrillas to resist Japan. It also said that the plan for the three countries to take unified action to attack Japan can be proven by recent events, such as the fact that the Outer Mongolian army is effectively under Soviet control and has repeatedly crossed the border to attack the Manchurian army. Furthermore, the actions of the British in Shanghai and Gulangyu and the dispatch of French military attachés to Chongqing can be seen as evidence.

### German Volunteers Gradually Withdraw from Spain; Italian Volunteers Return Home Next Month

[Haitong News Agency, Vigo, 25th] On Wednesday, a ship carrying 900 German volunteers arrived in Hamburg from the Spanish port of Vigo. Furthermore, all personnel of the German Air Force Corps will return home by ship on Thursday evening.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 25th] It was announced here on Thursday that 1,900 Italian volunteers will withdraw from Cadiz in early June. It was also stated that 3,100 Spanish soldiers who fought under the Italian "Arrow" division will return to Naples with the Italian volunteers to participate in a grand parade, at which the Italian King and the Italian Foreign Minister will review them.

### Universal Postal Congress Held in Argentina; German Representative Attends But Refuses to Sign Regulations

[Reuters, Buenos Aires, 25th] At the Universal Postal Congress currently being held here, Czechoslovakia also sent a representative to attend, so the German representative refused to sign the various postal event regulations that are set for the next five years. The Italian and Hungarian delegations also echoed the German representative and took unified action, which has shocked the representatives of all countries attending the meeting, because the representatives of the countries have reached full agreement in principle on the various postal regulations.

### Famous Latvian City: Major Fire in Bauska; City Center Completely Burned; 2,000 People Homeless

[Haitong News Agency, Guilin, 25th] Yesterday, a major fire broke out in Bauska, a famous city in southeastern Latvia. Because most of the buildings there are made of wood and the wind was very strong, the city center was completely on fire within an hour after the fire started. Fortunately, the local fire brigade, with the assistance of fire brigades from nearby cities, worked hard to put out the fire, which prevented it from spreading. Currently, the city hall, two banks, two hotels, and more than a hundred other buildings have been burned down. Two villages near the city have also been affected. As of 6:00 PM, it was still burning. A church near the city, built in the 15th century, is a famous historical site, and contains many famous artistic objects, but fortunately it was not affected.

[Haitong News Agency, Tallinn, 25th] According to the latest news from Bauska, the fire burned for four hours, resulting in the destruction of about 200 residential buildings and rendering about 2,000 refugees homeless. 20 people were burned to death and 8 were seriously injured. The South Latvian garrison and volunteer groups were mobilized to assist the fire brigade. Furthermore, the loss of materials is difficult to estimate. Nearby cities have been ordered to transport daily necessities to the area for disaster relief.

### American Submarine Accident: Rescue Still in Progress; Torpedo Room Flooded; 26 Crew Members Drowned

[Reuters, Portsmouth, 24th] The U.S. submarine "Squalus" encountered an accident and sank. The Navy dispatched divers to the sea to rescue. According to the latest report, there are a total of 59 crew members in the forward compartment of the submarine. It is feared that only 33 of them have survived. The temperature inside is still warm and there is sufficient food, but the power supply has been cut off. The torpedo room has been completely flooded, and it is believed that several crew members have drowned. Currently, eight people have been rescued to the surface. According to them, there are still 25 people alive inside the submarine.

[Associated Press, Portsmouth, 24th] Navy divers today rescued 32 crew members from the sunken submarine Squalus. Naval authorities announced that 26 crew members have died. The authorities still plan to send divers to the sea at night to search the submarine.

### League of Nations Suggests Member States Provide Effective Assistance to China; Report on Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminate Bombing Incidents at Any Time; Draft Resolution on China's Application

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 24th] The drafting committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council drafted a resolution on China's application this morning and decided to submit it to the Administrative Council's secret meeting for review and approval this afternoon. The contents of the resolution do not differ much from what has been reported. It first recounts the past situation and then reiterates the resolutions passed by the League of Nations in the past, but concrete measures are lacking. The resolution suggests that member states provide effective assistance to China to the extent possible in accordance with the resolutions passed by the League of Nations in the past. Regarding the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft, member states and non-member states should instruct their diplomatic representatives in China to submit reports to the League of Nations on this matter at any time. This resolution is scheduled to be announced tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 24th] The China Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council drafted a resolution on China's application on the 24th. It states that the Administrative Council invites all countries to individually increase their assistance to China to the extent possible. The Administrative Council also suggests that the representatives of member states in the UK report to the League of Nations on the bombing of Chinese civilians.

Brief Commentary

### Ominous Maritime Situation

The maritime situation these days is extremely ominous. Based solely on the news published in large font by various newspapers over the past two days, there are at least the following items worth serious attention from Chinese and foreign individuals:

First, the sudden attack and illegal search of the British merchant Jardine Matheson & Co. liner "Rampur" by the Japanese Navy on the 24th is a matter worth noting. One is that the incident occurred only one mile from Hong Kong. Second, the ship had on board the newly appointed Deputy Commander of the British China Fleet, Rear Admiral MacLear. Third, Britain and Japan are not at war, and British ships cannot tolerate such harassment.

Second, on the 24th, the French mail ship "Aramis" broke through an illegal search by the Japanese Navy for an hour. The incident also occurred only 17 nautical miles from Hong Kong!

Third, the situation in Gulangyu is becoming increasingly serious. The Japanese Consul General in Xiamen, Uchida, notified the foreign consular corps and settlement authorities there that the Japanese Navy will order a cessation of traffic between Gulangyu and the mainland starting at 6:00 PM on the 25th.

The main purpose of such illegal incidents by Japan is naturally to intimidate democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain and France, attempting to further occupy all concessions, seize the interests of European and American powers in China, and save the difficulties encountered in the current war of aggression against China. At the same time, we can see that the reason why the degree of the freedom of the world is not active and determined is precisely because a few stubborn leaders are attempting to prevent Japan from joining the German-Italian military alliance and revive the old dream of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and because the means adopted by Britain, the United States, and France to address the Gulangyu incident and the Shanghai concession incident are weak and powerless. Therefore, we can assert that if the democratic and peaceful countries do not take effective sanctions against Japan, then Japan's actions will not be limited to what it is doing at sea today.

Peace is indivisible! Any attempt to exclude the Far East from the anti-aggression front can only increase the chaos in the world and only increase the crisis in Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union will not accept this type of "anti-aggression" organization. The Chinese nation, which has been fighting for liberation and peace and whose war of resistance against Japan is nearing its second year, also has the right to speak up and warn the democratic and peaceful countries!

### King of England Arrives in Winnipeg and Delivers Radio Address; Feels that European and Asian Cultures Have Been Greatly Trampled

[Reuters, Winnipeg, 24th] The King and Queen of England arrived here at 10:30 AM today (local time). The royal car traveled west from Fort William yesterday. The King and Queen stayed overnight on the train last night. The King stated at a welcome meeting today that he had seen the vastness of Canada, its material construction, and its social life, all of which are very advanced. He then gave an "Empire Day" radio address, saying, "The cultures of Europe and Asia are now greatly trampled upon. The old world may need the guidance of the new world. When we speak of the new and old worlds, the connection and coordination between these two worlds is the greatest task of the British Empire. In long history, Europe has always been at the forefront of world progress, but the current situation is different from the past. European Christian culture is being trampled upon, and we are fighting to restore the original standards. Although this is a long and difficult task, we must still strive to do it. Asia is also suffering greatly, and people are in chaos. Is this not a time when the old world needs the guidance of the new world? Canada and the United States have jointly discussed the differences in their mutual interests and purposes over the past century, but they have never used force to resolve any differences. In the future, the people of the two countries will not harbor the heart of war. The greatness of the British Empire is not due to power, wealth, or self-governing territories. These things are merely tools, not the ultimate principles or purposes. The ultimate purpose is the freedom, justice, peace, and security enjoyed in common. The Empire must be able to increase the material happiness and spiritual dignity of the people before it can be said to serve its people and the world."

[Reuters, London, 24th] At 10:40 PM tonight, an official announcement regarding Queen Mary's injuries stated that the Queen's condition continues to improve well, but the wound is still painful. X-ray examinations show that the bones have not been damaged and the eye injury is also trending towards recovery.

[Reuters, London, 25th] Today, the royal physician reported that Queen Mary slept comfortably last night and her facial injury is showing even more improvement. The Queen has sent a letter to the truck driver involved in the car accident, expressing her gratitude. The Society presented flowers to the person. Queen Mary has also sent a letter of thanks to the owner of the residence at the scene of the accident.

### British Interests in Czechoslovakia Temporarily Handled by Vice Consul in Prague; Chamberlain Answers Questions About Czech Affairs; Opposition Believes Situation Unsatisfactory

[Reuters, London, 24th] Today in the House of Commons, a member inquired whether there was a diplomatic representative to safeguard British interests in Bohemia and Moravia, Czechoslovakia. Mr. Chamberlain replied that since the British Chargé d'Affaires left Prague on May 25th, British interests there were temporarily under the care of the consul. Regarding the British government sending a foreign representative to Prague and the relationship with Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, it is still under consideration, and he hoped to report on this matter soon. Subsequently, Mr. Chamberlain replied regarding Czech deposits in England, stating that informal talks are underway on this issue, but this is unrelated to the de facto recognition of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Then, Conservative members asked Mr. Chamberlain to guarantee that de facto recognition of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia would not be granted before the House of Commons agreed. Mr. Chamberlain replied that he would not make such a guarantee. Opposition members strongly protested and shouted "Another Munich!" Mr. Attlee then stated, "Can we assume that the government is only considering recognizing the current state of Czechoslovakia?" Mr. Chamberlain replied, "No, I did not say that. The reason I did not make that guarantee is because making that guarantee would be highly unusual." Mr. Attlee then declared that Mr. Chamberlain's answer was greatly unsatisfactory, so he would raise this matter again when the House adjourns on Sunday.

### Legislative Council Meeting Passes Tenants Protection Ordinance Extension for One Year; Special Committee Organized to Study Amendments; Councilor Pugh Criticizes Increasing Civil Servant Pensions

The Legislative Council convened a meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. The most notable item on the agenda was the final reading of the Ordinance to Prevent Rent Increases and Evictions. The ordinance was passed yesterday, but the authorities simultaneously appointed seven members to form a special committee to consider amendments to the ordinance, as the authorities wanted to achieve fairness for both tenants and landlords. Fortunately, Chinese representatives Chow Chun-nin and Lo Man-kam are among the seven members. It is believed that Chow and Lo will surely seek benefits for all compatriots in Hong Kong, and the future amendments to the ordinance will certainly provide tenants with maximum protection. Regarding this matter, Lo Man-kam already had a written opinion yesterday, which was quite persuasive, stating that the ordinance affects real estate transactions. Also, during yesterday's meeting, Councilor Pugh also criticized the vast amount of pension payments to civil servants, stating that the retirement age for civil servants should be raised from 55 to 60, according to the law. The details of yesterday's meeting are as follows:

Cases Passed at the Meeting

Those present at yesterday's meeting included Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote, Colonial Secretary Smith, Commander of British Troops in China Major-General Grasett, Financial Secretary Gimson, Attorney General Eales, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Davis, Director of Medical Services Sutu Wenzhao, Councilor Pugh, Acting Commissioner of Police Barton, Director of Public Works Edgar, Woods, Tolloway, and Pierce. The meeting was chaired by Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote. After the meeting began as usual, Attorney General Eales proposed a well-organized plan to improve the form of existing or future urban areas and buildings, to enhance social health, safety, convenience, and public interest. A law was passed, followed by Financial Secretary Gimson's request for retroactive approval of $3,426,243.48 in expenses for 1938, which passed the second and third readings. Attorney General Eales proposed (A) amendments to the 1935 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance, (B) amendments to the 1934 Trustee Ordinance, (C) amendments to the 1936 Hong Kong Regulations Ordinance, and (D) amendments to the 1938 Undesirable Eviction Ordinance, all of which passed the second and third readings. Eales, Davis, Pugh, Feng Xinglu, Chow Chun-nin, Lo Man-kam, and Shao Liao Yali Mada were appointed as a committee to review the amendments to the Undesirable Eviction Ordinance. The meeting then adjourned immediately, and the Financial Secretary chaired a meeting of the Finance Committee, which approved the retroactive appropriation of $318,523 in government expenses. It was noted that during yesterday's meeting, when Gimson requested the passage of a retroactive appropriation of over $3.4 million in government expenses for last year, Senior Unofficial Member Pugh expressed some reservations. Barrister Lo Man-kam also commented on the Undesirable Eviction Ordinance. The speeches of Pugh and Lo are recorded below.

Councilor Pugh Criticizes Pensions

Your Excellency the Governor, regarding the proposal by Mr. Gimson to retroactively approve more than $3 million in government expenses for last year, I would like to say a few words for everyone present. During last year's budget discussion, the Financial Secretary stated that, considering only those with salaries in gold pounds, the number of pensions had doubled compared to 1930. This gradual increase has not yet reached its limit. I have also obtained statistics from the Financial Secretary's Office showing that this year's pensions will reach approximately $2.97 million. This large sum of pensions cannot but make one consider whether there is a good way to stop or at least slow down this increasingly high pension expenditure. Civil servants' enjoyment of pensions is a privilege granted by law. If pension payments were stopped, it would be unfair to civil servants. In this environment, what I want to ask you to consider is the provision in Section 2 of the 1928 Ordinance, which stipulates that civil servants can only enjoy pensions upon reaching the age of 60, instead of the current practice of 55. Currently, some civil servants who are not yet 55, but with the Governor's approval, can enjoy pensions at the age of only 50. The unofficial members of this Council believe that there is no reason for civil servants to enjoy long vacations back to England and to be allowed to retire before the age of 60. If civil servants are only allowed to retire at the age of 60, then the accumulation of pensions in Hong Kong will naturally be reduced.

Lo Provides Opinions on the New Ordinance

Lo Man-kam said in his speech: "When this ordinance to prevent landlords from evicting tenants was submitted to this Council on June 1, 1938, the Acting Attorney General deliberately stated that this ordinance was purely a temporary measure. At the same time, Your Excellency the Governor also said, 'My colleague, the Attorney General, has pointed out that if this ordinance is passed, it will be a temporary measure to safely navigate the current emergency situation, but I sincerely hope that in the near future, I will be able to replace this ordinance to prevent rent increases and evict tenants with another ordinance, so that we can return to a normal state of affairs. However, a normal state of affairs is not easy to obtain, and only if the economic situation in Hong Kong is better than the current situation can it be achieved.' Unfortunately, the environment we are currently in has not reached a normal state and is trapped in an abnormal state. Therefore, I sympathize with the continued implementation of this ordinance. This emergency regulation will be extended for another year (unless it is changed in the future). I believe that our responsibility should be to ask the authorities to make some amendments to the original text of the ordinance. The points to be amended have been sufficiently proven necessary by the implementation of the ordinance in the past year. However, after asking my colleague, the Attorney General, for his opinion in this Council, I agree that after this ordinance is passed, a special committee should be formed to consider the proposed amendments. However, I would like to take this opportunity to contribute a word on the issue of rent increases, so as to avoid countless phone calls and letters inquiring about this matter in the future. According to the original text of this ordinance, it is very clear that if a landlord wants a tenant to move out or increase the rent, the tenant can ignore it. However, if the tenant believes that the rent increase demanded by the landlord is excessive, then he can notify the landlord that he is willing to submit the rent increase event to the court for the judge to approve a reasonable rent value. The court will definitely handle this case fairly, and neither the landlord nor the tenant will be harmed. This ordinance provides tenants with the greatest protection in a normal state of affairs, but it is not fair to the landlord, because in this environment, the landlord has lost his business rights and lost the sovereignty that the landlord should have. This move has greatly threatened real estate transactions. Therefore, I hope that in the near future, Hong Kong will be able to achieve a more normal economic situation, so that this regulation to evict tenants and prevent rent increases will no longer be needed and can be replaced."

### Tax Revenue Committee Recommends Ten Tax Increases; Income Tax Under Consideration

(1) Increase fees for government schools; (2) Increase fees for government hospitals; (3) Increase stamp duty on horse racing tickets; (4) Increase franchise tax for telephone companies; (5) Increase franchise tax for gas and electricity companies; (6) Increase franchise tax and license fees for taxis; (7) Increase tax on alcohol and motor oil. If the above seven taxes are still insufficient, then levy (1) income tax, (2) corporate profits tax, and (10) increase property tax.

In order to study appropriate methods for opening up tax sources, the Hong Kong government appointed a Tax Revenue Research Committee on December 8th of last year to study the tax regulations that should be added when Hong Kong needs to increase tax revenue. After several months of research, the committee has prepared a report and submitted it to the government. The report was released at yesterday's Legislative Council meeting. According to the recommendations in the report, if Hong Kong needs to increase tax revenue by one million dollars, income tax should be levied. If the required amount is less than one million dollars, then other methods should be adopted. The details are listed in the report, as follows:

Regarding the levy rate for income tax, the committee believes that setting a high rate of 5% is appropriate, but this rate can be increased to 10% in the future. It is said, "Even under this low tax system, and with reasonable exemptions for individuals, families, and others, and with sound implementation methods, the annual income from income tax in Hong Kong can still reach five million dollars. We believe that if the maximum income tax rate is 5%, then income tax can be easily implemented." The report recommends that if the government believes that smaller-scale tax regulations cannot meet the needs, then new tax regulations can be adopted. In addition to income tax, the committee also recommends two progressive tax regulations as follows: (1) Increase the current rates assessment from 17% to 2.5%. At the current rate, Hong Kong can obtain six million dollars in assessments each year. Calculated at the new rate, it can increase by three million dollars. (2) Levy a profit tax on Hong Kong companies and stores. According to the committee's estimate, the taxable profits of Hong Kong companies each year are approximately 50 million dollars, and the annual profit tax can obtain 2.5 million dollars. The committee advocates that income tax should be adopted first among the above three new taxes. Regarding the recommendation to increase the assessment rate, the report said that this increase is somewhat unfair or will cause social unrest. Therefore, although this recommendation is feasible and can be carried out without difficulty, and the income amount is larger, it should still be considered as the last item. Regarding the company profit tax, the report pointed out the difficulties in implementation, such as the difficulty in estimating and collecting, as well as incidents of opposition and evasion, etc. However, it said that although this method is still unfair, the scope of the shareholder class bearing this tax is still wider than the landlord class. The report recommends that before adopting income tax, profit tax, or increasing assessment rate methods, consideration should be given to promulgating smaller-scale tax regulations. According to the committee's estimate, these taxes can obtain at least 500,000 dollars or can reach 1 million dollars each year. The taxes recommended in the report are as follows: (A) Increase the tuition fee rate for English schools, but set up free classes to assist poor students. (B) Increase the medical expenses for patients in government hospitals. (C) Increase the betting tax rate. The current stamp duty on horse racing tickets is 5%, which can be increased by 1% or 2%, and the lottery tax is 2%, which can be increased by 1%. (D) Levy a special tax on telephone, electricity, and gas companies. (E) Approve the taxi franchise and collect franchise tax. (F) Increase the excess profit tax for the tram company. (G) Increase the tax on alcohol and gasoline. The committee has studied and opposed the increase in taxes and new taxes as follows: customs duties, import tax on luxury goods, salt tax, increase to four cents for local letters postage rate, ship inspection fees, vehicle tax, business license tax, interest tax on company stock holders not residing in Hong Kong, entertainment tax.

### Hong Kong Teachers' Association Expands Membership Recruitment; Renowned Educators Hired as Sponsors to Actively Promote Association Affairs

The establishment of the Hong Kong Teachers' Association is to enable teachers in Hong Kong to have close contact with each other and to promote the development of education in society. Recently, in order to enrich the organization and increase membership, the association plans to widely solicit members and hire renowned educators residing in Hong Kong as sponsors of the association. Invitation letters have now been issued in stages. The Director of Education of Hong Kong, Mr. Shrlow, and the former Acting Director of Education, Ma Dan, etc., have received the invitations and have replied to the association, agreeing to be sponsors. According to the chairman of the association, Han Disha, the main objectives of the association are listed in Article 11 of the constitution, which are recorded as follows: (A) The association promotes close contact between teachers in Hong Kong through meetings, discussions, and other beneficial methods. (B) Discuss educational issues and invite educators in Hong Kong to speak, in order to increase knowledge and benefit the association. (C) Cooperate with other groups. (D) Encourage research on educational issues and other local issues. (E) Encourage people in the community to pay attention to education.

### Education Sector Prepares to Commemorate Teachers' Day; Preparatory Meeting Scheduled for Next Monday; Patriotic Movement in Education Sector to be Promoted

The annual "June 6th" Teachers' Day is approaching again. The Chinese education sector in Hong Kong holds a celebration every year. Now that the War of Resistance is in full swing, teachers are the implementers of the War of Resistance education. Therefore, this year's Teachers' Day is of extraordinary significance. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Associations Federation has now scheduled a preparatory meeting for next Monday evening (originally scheduled for yesterday, but temporarily postponed) to discuss the methods for commemorating Teachers' Day this year. The funds used by the Education Associations Federation for holding the Teachers' Day celebration each year are donated by the Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company. This year, due to the impact of the war, the two bookstores have stopped donating the funds. Therefore, the Education Associations Federation needs to raise funds themselves. It is reported that some party has recently promised to donate funds, so the persons in charge of the Education Associations Federation have begun preparations. It is reported that the opinions of the members of the Education Associations Federation believe that under the principle that the War of Resistance is higher than everything else, this year's Teachers' Day should be changed to a solemn and meaningful commemoration, and there should also be action in the action aspect to encourage the students to work harder for the national salvation movement. The association now plans to invite the National Salvation Drama Troupe to perform national salvation dramas on Teachers' Day to replace all other recreational activities.

### General Xue Yue Sends Letter to Journalist Association Expressing Concern for Hometown

Yesterday, the Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association received a letter from Xue Yue, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government. The original letter stated, "Respectfully, the war is shaking China and the survival of the nation depends on this battle. Yue leads the three armies to fight in several provinces, and lives in the rain of bullets for almost two years. Although he has been repeatedly frustrated, he still hates that he has not recovered the lost territory. Looking at the rivers and mountains, his heart is cut. He was recently appointed to take charge of the military affairs of the XX war zone and concurrently the Hunan Province. He is a soldier who does not know how to govern and fears that he will not be able to win. He is confused by the appointment, not knowing what to do. Thinking of the difficulties and dangers, he is obliged to accept the order and rushes forward without hesitation. Moreover, this battle is a key point in military strategy and can protect the West. Hunan Province has suffered after the war and the administration must use both military and political means. He dares to reluctantly accept the task and do his best. Yue is a Cantonese and has been serving outside for several years, but he always remembers the kindness of the elders and brothers in his hometown and the hopes of compatriots at home and abroad. He hopes that your association will uphold the spirit of helping each other in times of difficulty and provide guidance so that he can follow it. This is what he hopes. He salutes the Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association. Xue Yue."

### Someone Jumps from Building at South China Morning Post

As a result, he fell and was seriously injured and was sent to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. The reason for his action is unknown.

### Cholera Danger; Health Authorities Intensify Prevention; Doctors to Broadcast Prevention Methods Once a Week; Broadcast Scripts to be Published in Newspapers for Widespread Dissemination

Everyone knows the danger of cholera. Last year, more than a thousand Hong Kong residents died from this disease, and even thinking about it now is terrifying. In order to avoid repeating last year's mistakes, the Hong Kong authorities are launching a large-scale cholera prevention campaign at the beginning of summer, in addition to guiding residents to implement cholera prevention injections, they are also prohibiting the sale of unclean ice cream, cool water, and moldy fruit, etc. Therefore, since the first case of cholera was discovered last year, although twelve more cases occurred last week, with ten deaths, it is not as serious as last year. It is believed that the preventive measures have been successful. According to news released by the health authorities, Dr. Situ Yongjue of the Health Medical Officer's opinion still fears that residents have not clearly understood the implementation of cholera prevention. Therefore, he has invited many formal Western doctors in Hong Kong to carry out weekly broadcasts and lectures on prevention methods. There are more than 8,000 residents in Hong Kong who have radios. There will surely be many listeners, and the effect will be considerable. However, Dr. Situ Yongjue believes that this kind of broadcast lecture may only be available to those who have radios in their homes. Other families and the general public will not be able to receive it widely. Therefore, he has formulated a method. For example, the broadcast lecture will be delivered this evening, and the original text of the lecture will be submitted to Chinese and Western newspapers for publication the next day. Thus, those residents who cannot listen to the speech on the radio can also obtain it from the newspapers the next morning. Then, only a small number of people will be left out.

### The Sensational Hong Kong "China Salvation" Troupe Presents Its First Show: 'Long Live the Nation' Premieres Last Night with a Tense Plot and Exquisite Artistry

— Qi Zhuo

Facts, facts imprint upon our eyes, and carve into our minds:

The performers exhaust their minds and bodies, forgetting sleep and meals; the audience braves hardship, trekking through heavy rain to attend. Backstage, one can see the "China Salvation" friends working tirelessly despite insufficient rest. Surveying the second and third floors, one sees the densely packed audience, eagerly savoring the gunpowder scent of their suffering motherland, and receiving the baptism of a new China. The only imperfection is that the "automobile class" in the front seats is not as enthusiastic as the audience on the thirteenth floor.

——This, this is a bird's-eye view of the "China Salvation" troupe's premiere at the Lee Theatre last night.

At precisely 8:00 PM, Mr. Lu Guomian of the Relief Federation and Mr. Li Jianfeng of the Journalists' Association delivered speeches. They lauded the "China Salvation" troupe's achievements over the past twenty months, traversing north and south battlefields and moving millions of soldiers and civilians. They expressed gratitude for the troupe's benefit performance for the Relief Federation, raising funds to慰勞 wounded soldiers and refugees. They particularly praised the troupe members for abandoning their comfortable lives and dedicating everything to the motherland.

Following the national anthem, the great patriotic drama, "Long Live the Nation," unfolded with refined artistry.

Raging wind and torrential rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning. And a lone sail struggling amidst the storm, all vividly depicted, transporting the audience into the midst of a real scene. Bai Lu, playing Bao Wenxin, whose wife has been violated by the × people, expresses his resentment and panic. The jeers and lack of help from those who lacked courage fill him with disappointment. Jin Shan, playing Wei Dapeng, is ultimately a hero, extending help and saving him as he crosses the river.

The second scene of the first act reveals the cruelty of the × people oppressing our compatriots, forcing them to build barracks in the Northeast. Jin Shan displays heroism; every movement reveals his excellence and experience. Wang Ying, playing the traitor's daughter, Wei Ming, delivers each line clearly and powerfully, striking the hearts of everyone.

The third scene quickly appears. When three village leaders drink blood as an oath, the poignant line, "We are all of one mind," elicits warm applause from the audience. These are the words you say, the words I say, the words everyone wants to say.

The first scene of the second act begins in the countryside of occupied land. Wei Ming—played by Wang Ying—delivers the following cautionary words to reject the traitor who courts her: "Love! Do you think I am also living in a drunken dream? Do you think you can live this life as a traitor forever?" These are words that many, many people should remember.

The second scene of the second act is also in the countryside. Sparkling stars vividly depict the beauty of the night. The villagers of three villages are meeting to resist the violent × people. They mention that they all fled from Shandong to the Northeast, unable to suppress sighs of sorrow! Although each person has their own expression, they repeatedly say "Yes! Yes! Yes!" to the "one heart" against the × people.

Landlords who survived the disaster rise up like commoners to lead the resistance—past personal grievances are resolved—this is truly thanks to the Japanese.

The first scene of the third act is in Wei Dapeng's home. Ke Gang, playing Wei's wife, resembles a simple, tender farmer. Fan Zheng, playing Wei's son, is innocent and lively. In between, the father also educates his son about independence, which is very interesting. The brave father and son go to fight the × people heroically.

The humiliation of being forced to kowtow to the × army in the second scene of the third act truly fills one with resentment. Dapeng's refusal to submit to coercion deserves the love of the masses. The crowd holds its breath as the × people force him to shoot the apple on his son's head as a test before executing him. Although he luckily hits the apple, everyone is relieved. However, Dapeng still cannot escape the clutches of the × people.

In the fourth act, Wang Ying, playing Wei Ming, says under the threat of the × people: (This section is missing dialogue in the original text) This once again elicits warm applause.

Dapeng also escapes from prison—he believes in the power of the masses—the final days are approaching—Dapeng's "Hahaha..." laughter, a bitter and cold laugh, is truly a great laugh—a laugh that stops the × people!

In the final, fifth act, the × military camp is burned down! The shouts of the crowd are earth-shattering! The torches of the crowd symbolize the light of the nation. This is truly a magnificent scene! Although greater oppression is coming, through unity in the united front, the final victory will be achieved!

—The curtain closes amidst extreme excitement.

This drama, acting, sets, lighting... the gains in all aspects are so wonderful that we can't stop praising it. "China Salvation" is indeed "China Salvation," it is truly a new and progressive theatrical troupe. Tonight's "Protecting the Motherland" includes four of the "China Salvation" troupe's most skilled and famous short plays. These are their artistic masterpieces, beloved anti-Japanese war stories by millions of people. For the sake of disaster relief, for the sake of educating ourselves, for the sake of appreciating the most advanced theatrical art, we must mobilize all patriotic overseas Chinese to be the audience of "China Salvation."

### Military Situation in Northern Guangdong Becomes Increasingly Tense; × Troops Move North to Reinforce the Outskirts of Guangzhou; Continuous Raids Attempt to Pin Down Our Troops from Moving South; Our Troops Attack Renhe and × Troops on Two Routes Collapse

(Northern Guangdong Express News) Our troops in Northern Guangdong have taken a surprise offensive posture and have been launching large-scale attacks towards Zengcheng, Conghua, and Huaxian for the past week. In the front-line battles, our troops have taken the initiative, steadily advancing, and the × troops are also desperately defending and attempting to resist to the death. The military situation in Northern Guangdong is gradually becoming tense, and the prelude to a major battle seems imminent. The war situation in recent days is as follows:

× Troops Attempt to Counterattack in Northern Guangdong

Military intelligence reports that, in response to our troops' continuous advances in Northern Guangdong, the × troops are not only building fortifications in the suburbs to prepare for in-line operations, but are also increasing troops to defend Xincun, Xinshi, Renhe, Taihe Town, and Zhongluotan, etc., as the outer lines of Guangzhou. On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, the Guangzhou-Hankou, Guangzhou-Huaxian, and Guangzhou-Conghua railway lines were extremely busy, as × infantry and cavalry moved north to reinforce the defense. The Guangzhou-Hankou line had the most reinforcements, with nearly a thousand troops arriving at Xinshi, Jiangcun, Gaotang, etc. in recent days. In addition to building fortifications, they are also actively preparing to advance and counterattack, attempting to pin down our troops from attacking. On the morning of the 22nd, the × troops in Xinshi also dispatched over a hundred cavalry, accompanied by two cannons, to scout Letong along the Guangzhou-Hankou railway. Our troops, a certain unit of Peng's division, calmly defended and counterattacked, repelling the × troops' repeated attacks and forcing them to retreat, abandoning over twenty corpses.

Attacking Renhe, × Troops Sneak South

On the Huaxian front, Zhao's division of our Twelfth Army Group has been sending troops deep into the × rear to attack in recent days. On the 21st, they launched another attack on Renhe Market along the Guangzhou-Huaxian line, engaging the × troops in fierce fighting in the area north of Renhe. Our troops attacked the × positions from several routes, charging bravely and repeatedly, but the × troops relied on their sharp artillery fire to cover their stubborn resistance. After several hours of stalemate, the × troops finally gave way, retreating back to Renhe to continue their stubborn resistance. Another group crossed the river and fled south. Our troops took advantage of the situation to pursue and kill them, forcing dozens of × troops to fall into the water. Only a dozen or so swam to escape, while the rest were drowned. Our troops are currently searching forward.

Our Guerrilla Teams Are Active Everywhere

Moreover, in the Shijing and Dalang areas of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, our guerrilla teams have been spotted operating and launching surprise attacks on the × troops in recent days. It was reported that on the night of the 21st, a dense sound of gunfire was suddenly heard near Dalang, intermittent for more than three hours before stopping. According to sources from a certain guerrilla team, on that night, over a hundred guerrillas from Li's unit attacked the Gaoseng near Dalang and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the × troops, using machine guns and hand grenades to attack each other. After several hours of stalemate, they killed over × troops, and our team sacrificed several men before retreating to their original position. Currently, our guerrilla teams are still operating along the railway line, specializing in destroying × communication lines, telephone and telegraph poles, and intercepting × military transport vehicles.

### Shaoguan Prepares for Combat, Evacuates Population and Resources; Mobilizes Students to Distribute Leaflets and Expand Propaganda; Clears Municipal Households to Strictly Prevent Spies from Infiltrating

(Shaoguan Express News) The Shaoguan garrison authorities, considering the inhumane actions of the × planes, which indiscriminately bombed our cities and towns, in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifices of the people and to preserve national strength, have decided to evacuate the population and resources of Shaoguan. They have been implementing this decision in recent days, and preparations are also being made actively. The situation is as follows:

Expanding Propaganda

The Shaoguan evacuation of population and resources was once discussed and decided upon by the garrison commander, Wu Naixian, who convened leaders of industry and commerce. In order to make the government's intentions clear to the people and to achieve significant results, it has been decided to expand propaganda. Students throughout the city will be mobilized to organize propaganda teams, which will go to various roads to expand official propaganda and explain the meaning of evacuation. At the same time, leaflets will be printed and distributed to every household. Most of the citizens who remained have followed the order to evacuate to the surrounding villages, so vehicles traveling to and from various places are crowded. In order to facilitate transportation, the garrison headquarters has instructed various transportation companies to increase the number of vehicles and prohibit arbitrary tolls.

Household Registration Inspection

Shaoguan has now become the center of party, government, and military affairs, a hub for issuing orders. All measures are being taken in accordance with wartime preparations. In order to prevent spies from infiltrating and disrupting public order, the garrison headquarters conducted a thorough inspection of household registrations throughout the city yesterday. It was stipulated that all relocations must be reported to the police station for verification. An order was issued for unemployed vagrants to leave the city, otherwise they would be taken in and assisted by the government. Patrol teams were dispatched to patrol the city, and anyone with suspicious behavior would be inspected or detained for questioning. The garrison headquarters also issued a notice stating that, regardless of who they are, except for fully armed military police, anyone carrying firearms must have a firearm license, otherwise they will be charged with disrupting public order. Yu Dang Chen Qizhen, Huang Yiru, Wen Wei, Gu Bimei, Li Baozhen, Jin Huanxian, Du Lanxi, Liu Zhen, He Zhuosheng, Le Xian, and Zhu Daizhi, Zhao Guizhen et al. are all brave and good fighters. Followed by Zhi's men and horses, of the Shi.

### Measures for Paying Respect to Troops Passing Through Territory; Authorities Issue Notice for People to Comply

(Shaoguan Express News) The Guangdong authorities have received a telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs, stipulating three measures for civilians to pay respect to anti-Japanese troops passing through their territory, and have instructed their subordinates to take note: (1) Vehicles and pedestrians (except for vehicles of the highest party and government officials) should stop immediately. (2) Those wearing hats should remove them and salute. (3) Those not wearing hats should bow their heads in salute. These measures are related to promoting the spirit of resistance and enhancing military-civilian relations, and the people of all regions must implement them conscientiously.

### Huicheng × Still Under Siege; × Planes Bomb Daze Viciously for Days; Security Regiments Join in Fighting Below, Assisting in the Attack of Huicheng

[West River Express] The fierce battle for Huicheng, Jiangmen, is becoming increasingly clear. Our troops are advancing on three routes, attacking along the Xinhe and Xinkai highways, while also cutting off the Jiangmen-Foshan road, so that Jiangmen and Huicheng cannot support each other. The × troops in Jiujiang cannot go to assist. At present, the × troops in Huicheng are trapped and unable to escape, while the × troops in Tingmen are stubbornly defending Fanluogang with artillery, but their situation is deteriorating day by day and they cannot hold out for long. Our army and brave teams from various regions, under the command of Commander Deng Longguang, have been able to fight bravely and give the × troops heavy blows everywhere. On the 20th of this month, Commander Deng also added the entire security 团 regiment to strengthen the actual strength of the attack on the lower part of Huicheng. They advanced along the Xinkai Highway towards Daze. The × troops sent planes to bomb Daze on the 22nd and 23rd for this reason. The regiment advanced to the front line with particularly rapid marching. Huicheng, surrounded on all sides by our army, has become a turtle in a jar. According to news received by the headquarters of the Zhongshan First District Guerrilla Detachment from the military headquarters, as of the 15th of this month, the ratio of casualties between our troops and the × troops in the Xinhui battle was one to two, that is, for every one of our soldiers who died or was wounded, two × soldiers died or were wounded, a new record in the national war of resistance. If the latest statistics are intercepted, the mortality rate of the × troops will be even higher.

### Our Troops in the West Actively Deploy for Counteroffensive; Elite Troops of the Guangxi Army Head to the Front; × Troops in Various Strongholds of Sanshui Number Only Over Two Thousand; Our Guerrillas Active, × Extremely Panicked

[West River Express] Our troops in the West River are unusually active in their military deployment for the counteroffensive. Several elite Guangxi army troops have also arrived at the front line in various counties along the West River and in the Siuhui and Sanshui areas. Among these elite Guangxi troops, there is also a female contingent, whose heroic appearance does not give way to men. It is reported that Siuhui, the left wing of the West River defense line, was originally the responsibility of Zhang Junsu's tax police regiment. In order to strengthen the strength in that area, Chief Commander Xia specially sent a strong troop to assist, which boosted morale even more. Now that they have completed close liaison with Li's division on the left wing of the northern line of Huaxian front, mutually echoing and supporting each other, our troops in the West River have entered a new stage. The large-scale counteroffensive is not far away. As for the situation of the × troops in Sanshui, the front line now reports that the commander of the × troops in the West River, Commander Zhongyuan of the Brigade, has been transferred elsewhere and replaced by Major General Matsumoto. The commander of the × troops stationed in Sanshui is Matsumotoo, and the headquarters is still located at the Shikou Customs. It is estimated that the Okane Makoguchi currently has around 500 troops from the Takata unit. The Kikuchi unit has a total of 700 troops stationed at Hekouzhen Nanxin Market, plus a unit of Matsumotoo of over two hundred people. There are also three to four hundred troops of the Matsumotoo unit in the Southwest. The total number of × troops in the various strongholds of Sanshui is around two or three thousand. They have been heavily guarded in recent days. After dark, all traffic is cut off, and traffic is only restored after 7 a.m., falsely claiming to protect public order. They restrict the people, regardless of gender, to receive so-called "good citizen certificates," otherwise they will be punished for violating the "imperial" order. The reason for this is to prevent our guerrillas from infiltrating and operating. All of the actions of the × troops show their tension.

### War Zone Headquarters Forbids Import of a Hong Kong Newspaper, Fabricating an Atmosphere of Peace

(Express News) The Commander of the War Zone Headquarters sent a telegram to its subordinates yesterday, which stated: "Received a telegram from Bai Chongxi, Director of the Guilin Provisional Headquarters, on behalf of telegram number 221, that Han Cao, Director of the Political Department of the Headquarters, reported that Huang Qijun, Secretary of the Headquarters, submitted for review the case of prohibiting the import of a certain Hong Kong tabloid. Attached is the original endorsement and a copy of the newspaper. Upon review, it was found that the newspaper inverted right and wrong and fabricated an atmosphere of peace, and all its statements are absurd. If it is not strictly prohibited, there is a fear that it will spread and shake people's hearts. It is proposed to instruct the commanders of each war zone and the pacification commissioner of Guangdong and the Guangxi government to secretly prohibit it and not allow it to enter, so as to avoid confusing public opinion. Therefore, it has been found that the content of the newspaper is extremely absurd and should be strictly prohibited from import in order to avoid confusing reports. In addition to separate telegrams, it is hereby urgently telegraphed for compliance and instruction to subordinates for unified compliance in order to stop the flow.

### Shaoguan Police Headquarters Balances Prices, Improves Air Defense

(Shaoguan Express News) The newly appointed Shaoguan Garrison Commander, Wu Naixian, is paying close attention to balancing prices and improving air defense in Shaoguan, and is actively implementing measures. Regarding price balancing, Commander Wu has submitted the price controls of the previous administration for research. It is thought that the daily necessities that were originally controlled, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, do not have significant price fluctuations, so it is not necessary to re-evaluate them. However, other miscellaneous items and sewing wages, etc., tend to be raised taking advantage of the situation, or collected in silver dollars under various pretexts. Therefore, a meeting was held during the day with the Second District Executive Inspection Commissioner's Office and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to evaluate and resolutely stop price increases, so as to protect the people's livelihood. As for improving air defense, six points for citizens to pay attention to during air raids were also decided yesterday: (1) When evacuating during air raids, do not wear white hats or red and white clothing. Red and white clothing drying on the roof should also be taken back in advance to avoid revealing targets. (2) Buildings in the city and shelters in the suburbs must be camouflaged and painted in gray-black, grass green, and other protective colors, so as to reduce the target for enemy planes. (3) When an alarm sounds, each household should first extinguish the remaining fire in the kitchen stove before going out. (4) There are restrictions on easily flammable items stored in various stores in the city. Each store is only allowed to store one can of electricity, one can of kerosene, 10,000 firecrackers, and one box of matches. Those who exceed the limit will be punished. (5) When the third emergency alarm sounds, whether the public in the city or suburbs, should enter the air-raid shelters, or evacuate to the suburbs to hide, and it is forbidden for many people to gather in one place, or watching idly, to avoid exposing the target and causing disaster. (6) When an alarm sounds, various cars in the city should be driven to the suburbs or ways to hide them to avoid indicating a target, Chen Xi.

### Shantou · In the Midst of a Frenzied Air Raid!

— Chen Xi

Just as the air raid alarm was lifted and I was preparing to go to the disaster area for inspection, the first alarm sounded again. After the × planes crazily bombed and reconnoitered the city center area again, they flew into the inner area, and people finally breathed a sigh of relief, sweating profusely, and clamoring to climb up from the shelter.

"Damn it, this Shantou is in trouble!" people said to each other.

Yes, Shantou, a small Chinese city in this southern country, has now become the best slaughterhouse for the × people, and I uncontrollably shed tears.

The rain was drizzling.

Suppressing my emotions, braving the rain, I made adjustments to places that suffered from the disaster today, after going through Shengping Road and the Xiaogong area in the urban area, I see the previous × bombing successes, broken tile, are all within sight.

There are many people on the streets, each with an adventurous heart, going to the bombed places to see, in order to have a deeper understanding of the brutal cruelty of the Japanese.

The places bombed in the morning were the municipal pavilion (market) on Shengping Road, the Guangdong Provincial Bank, and the Zhaoshang Street area, with a total of more than ten bombs dropped. Because the Guangdong Provincial Bank had air raid shelters, it did not collapse, but the magnificent building was covered with scars, and glass was scattered all over the street. Enemy planes had also bombed here last year, and old and new hatreds are entirely left for us to avenge! A small municipal pavilion was bombed to pieces, and rubble and ruins filled the road. The place where the bomb was dropped quietly opened its mouth, and water gushed out from below...

Zhaoshang Street, mostly residential houses, the × people's bombs have found a target -- one family of six were all slaughtered by the × people, a young woman who had only recently given birth was still pregnant, and the young sister and four-year-old younger brother... These defenseless people were all sacrificed in the mad bombing of the × people.

The rear of the Benshan Higher Court was also hit by several bombs.

I turned around to go back, but halfway there, the third × plane attack came, and after the alarm sounded horribly, people fled in panic, the dust rising into the air, mixed with drizzle, like a mist, like a wisp of smoke, and the earth was again in a hurry!

"The × planes are bombing indiscriminately without targeting, where on earth can we go to be safe?" I thought, and took shelter in a shop next to me. While writing, I always hear some businessmen cursing the cruelty and madness of the × people, yes, people have only deep hatred and great anger, and they will not fall into chaos and panic in their emotions for a while, but their will is becoming firmer!

The × planes seem to be more and more, although it is raining heavily, they are still hovering leisurely, and the huge plane keeps stirring the emotions of the people in the city. After the violent bombing passed, I, with a turbulent mind and stimulating thoughts, followed the lingering sound of the lifting of the alarm. I walked towards the disaster area with big strides.

This time, the areas that suffered were the slum areas of Wuqiao.

After passing through Tongji Road, the houses that had been bombed a few days ago were even more broken, and the muddy soil was mixed with rubble. The residents were very depressed, and the scene was exceptionally desolate and bleak!

The Tonghua Canning Company suffered the most damage, and the large-scale factory is now scarred!

After walking a while, I saw a shed of debris flying all over the sky, and the air was very dirty, with the smell of blood and gunpowder. One could have imagined that this seemed to be another world, but today it was hit by five bombs!

The affected area is very wide, and eighty or ninety Western-style houses have collapsed. Pieces of broken walls were blocking everywhere, and the rescue team was trying their best to search back and forth. One after another of the screens was lifted out, here there were dozens of old people, a few-month-old children, amputated limbs, and dry blood heads, there were also viscera that was separated from bones and flesh... I did not dare to look at the dead's family members who had not suffered much. They were weeping in hundreds of houses, and the distressed people who had not been harmed were standing in the heavy rain with pale faces (this is their only resting place)... in a daze…

We traversed these ruins, and in the rubble, I also saw a finger that had been severed by a bomb and some broken bones and flesh, and piles of bloodstains, and rainwater was mixing with them. By the side of the small road, there was a dead piglet and a puppy. They had suffered the same fate as their masters, with their intestines and organs hanging outside.

After inspecting for a week, my heart was about to break, and my emotions rose to the highest point, sadness, anger, and 共愾心!

When I got home, just as I was about to come forward to accuse humanity, the alarm outside, "Wee-wee-wee-wee-," sounded again.

Yes, the slaughter is going on, and the sacrificed compatriots are increasing, but one day we will pay back tooth for tooth and eye for eye, ××××××××××!

(Postscript recorded during the bombing on May 18)

### American Television Color Film Success: Can Watch Movies at Home This Summer Without Going Out; Expensive Price May Limit Popularity

Following sound films, another revolution in film history, undoubtedly, is television. According to our recent information, American television films are moving from theory to reality. Let us present the news from America below:

(1) The Beginning Year

1929 in America was the year television truly began, with special emphasis on the word "began." Radio broadcasting started in 1920, but commercial radios only began to be installed in 1922, and sound was only normal and good by 1924. By 1926, radio phonographs were being mass-produced and forming a radio network. Therefore, in fact, it was only at this time that radio could be said to have truly become popular. After several more improvements, television is starting this year, and the first step—regarding technical, planning, and economic issues—will also be determined this year. By summer, people can install electric film machines in their homes.

(2) General Structure

So, after this kind of television becomes popular, what will we see? How much will it cost to buy a television machine? Let's first talk about the situation of television films. In America, the National Broadcasting Company and Columbia Broadcasting System are indeed going to television this year. They are using the cathode ray system. Based on a tube called cathode ray, the sound emitted is very simple. The main purpose is for people to watch, but behind it, the electrical configuration is very complex. For example, in engineering, countless people have put in painstaking efforts to research and improve it to achieve today's progress. It is also of great interest to briefly describe this method here. In the vacuum tube, there is a kind of light that is completely non-directional, forming a starlight point. It is projected onto the end of the tube, and this light is constantly changing in light and shadow, shaking forward very quickly, while shaking up and down very slowly. After these two movements combine light and shadow, they can control the light points of the image. We saw that early researchers of television films all relied on mechanical aspects to determine large projectors that could play 440-line films, and the current number of lines is based on this number. Later, when the cathode ray was invented, moving at high speed could achieve further success compared to low-speed non-enlargement, non-increased sound, and no increase in machine costs.

(3) Progress of Research

After having a method, the interest of the general researchers of television films is concentrated on the research of cathode rays. The one currently used is this type. In addition, relative to this type of television film, a William Price force microphone has also been invented, using a camera, a kind of dry film (very similar to photographic dry film), installed on the cathode ray tube. This dry film is covered with countless photosensitive cells, and the image is focused on this dry film. A cathode ray electron crosses this film, sucking away the lines of the image one by one, and quickly transmitting the image. The actions of the camera and receiver are completely consistent. The same image is sent and received multiple times. On one hand, it is a straight-line swing, and on the other hand, it is a horizontal-line swing. Using this method, the film must have 441 lines to repeatedly television the image. During transmission, sound is also transmitted simultaneously in the channel. On the receiving end, various symbols must be dispersed and amplified.

(4) Expensive Price

Since the structure of the machine is so complex, whether it is the transmitting or receiving machine, the cost is certainly much higher than ordinary radio broadcasting or radio receivers. Under these circumstances, the size of the film must be very appropriate, and a good recording machine can project a film of at least 7.5 inches by 10 inches in size. This requires a huge type of ray tube, but the price is very expensive, about US$390 to US$500 per machine. If you must spend less money, then you can only buy a smaller 3-inch by 4-inch film, and the price is about US$150 to US$200 per machine. Currently, it is probably not possible to buy a cheaper receiver. Large cathode ray tubes require strong protective materials to limit the film. Using high current does not necessarily have accidental dangers, but automatic ignition and heat-generating machines can cause "snowflakes" on the screen. Finally, it is necessary to replace 441-line films with 200-line films. This has become an important issue in television films. However, general engineers are optimistic, believing that these small problems are easy to handle. It is said that after cathode ray films become popular, they can be resolved in a few years.

### Pygmalion (6) Pygmalion MGM Export Original by George Bernard Shaw Starring Leslie Howard, Wendy Hiller

Higgins was almost beside himself with anxiety. Hearing this, Mrs. Pearce said, "Professor Higgins? It's a rather cold morning, isn't it?"

Her words dispelled all his joy.

"Don't you adopt that tone with me," he said angrily. "Come home with me. Don't be a fool!"

"How can a girl refuse such an invitation?" she asked, shrugging her shoulders. "I should like to grow into a lady like him--not to be forced to be one."

Clare begged her to return. "Won't you forgive him? He doesn't realize how he speaks to you."

"That is his profession," she said, shaking her head. "My real education began the day you called me 'Miss Doolittle.' I shall always be a well-behaved child to you, because you always behave properly to me." Her lip curled. "But to him I shall always be a flower girl, because he always treats me as a flower girl."

Unbeknownst to Clare and Mrs. Pearce, Higgins had already left the room. Higgins and Eliza were soon engaged in a violent quarrel.

"You're a devil," cried Eliza. "I can't bear being treated like this. I want some kindness."

"If what you get doesn't satisfy you, you can go somewhere else for it."

"If I can't have kindness, I can live alone," she said proudly.

"Live alone?" he laughed.

"I can teach. I can teach people phonetics, the way you taught me." She laughed, too. "I could be an assistant to Professor Karpathy."

His face turned white. "Ah!" he cried.

She gazed at him as though she had never seen him before. "I know now how to manage you. I used to grovel under your feet. Now I stand level with you."

### Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament: Strength Review of the Top Four Teams; Zhixing and Zhonghua are the Strongest, Southwest and Huaxiong are also Fierce

... The long-rumored Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Tournament is scheduled to begin on the 29th of this month. It is now suspected to be on the eve of a great battle. Each team is participating for charity and is trying to strengthen its strength. Therefore, in recent days, each team has been preparing and sharpening its weapons, waiting for the god of war to descend.

... A total of four strong teams are participating in this battle, namely Zhonghua, Zhixing, Southwest, and Huaxiong. The strength of each team has its own merits. In the future competition, it is not yet known who will win. Therefore, before the war, it is worthwhile to review the strength of each team.

Zhixing Team: Zhixing is a strong team among the top four. A group of girls are capable of fighting, and many are good players in the National Games. For example, their former player, Chen Rong, has long been famous in the country and is a versatile girl. Chen Jinchai once represented Shanghai in the East Asian Games and is also a front-runner. Xiang Wangfang and Sun Yuming are famous players under the banner of middle school girls. They are experienced in combat. Therefore, the forward line is said to be unusual. The defense is exceptionally tight, and no matter how fierce the opponent is, it is not easy to break through their defense line. Lin Shao is a veteran of Meifang. Both offense and defense are official. The rest, such as Zhai Zhen, Huang Yiru, Lan Weili, Gu Junzheng, Li Maizhen, Jin Huanxian, Du Xishi, Liu Jiezhen, He Zhuosheng, Liang Baoxian, Du Daidi, Zhao Guiye, etc., are all brave and good at fighting. In short, this team is indeed a strong army.

Zhonghua Team

Zhonghua has many good players under its banner, and its combat strength is exceptionally strong. Like Liu Shouguang's overcoming obstacles and killing generals, she is exceptionally brave, and she is also a National Games representative. She has enough combat experience and superb skills. He Jingxiong and Xi Fen's defense is stable, and it is not easy to pass through their checkpoints. Rong Jiaozhen is a strong player among overseas Chinese and is quite famous in the basketball world. In addition, the Rong sisters are commanding and fighting, and Li Chunjing, He Shangying, Ye Muzi, etc., have unique abilities in attacking. Zhang Runlan, Cui Li, Yang Qiong, etc. are also fighters. Therefore, the entire army's combat strength is exceptionally strong and comparable to Zhixing. Therefore, this glorious silver cup is definitely for these two strong teams. But in the future, who will rule the world, it is still impossible to judge without a final battle.

Southwest Team

Although the overall strength of the Southwest army is not as strong as the Zhonghua and Zhixing teams, they have already shown their full combat spirit in previous competitions. They are very full of spirit. He Huanxiang, Qiu Meihe, Zhu, etc., work well together in offense and defense. Wu is also on the team. Xin, Li, Ye Peiye, Wu Suzhen, etc. are quick-witted and can make the opponent feel inexplicable pressure. In addition, Feng Zhenhua, Song Lan, Huo Qunying, and Zhang Huiying in the rear are also good in skills, although they are in the reserve. One day, they will confront Huaxiong, Zhonghua, Zhixing, etc., and there will be a big battle, and it will definitely not be easy to defeat them. There is no doubt.

Huaxiong Team

Huaxiong is a well-organized army, slightly inferior to the above three teams, but with Xia Shuyi, Lei Xiaogui, Wen Suxin, Chen Qixia, etc., it seems that their strength is also strong. There are also Zhong Ziqing, Zhou Duan, Wen Lingyu, Peng, and Wu Wenruo who all have considerable combat experience. Therefore, we are sure that this women's army has the ability to compete with each team. It will not be ashamed of itself. When they meet on the battlefield in the future, its strength will be revealed.

### Football Charity Match to Be Held Tomorrow; Hou Rongsheng Plays for South China

The South China Athletic Association, as its football team will be departing for a tour of the South this month, had scheduled a charity match between the South Tour team and the Hong Kong League team on the 20th of this month at the Jia Shan Stadium. The ticket proceeds were to be allocated to the sports community's service corps for handling relief for war-stricken refugees. However, due to inclement weather on the scheduled date, the heavy rain prevented the event from taking place. It was rescheduled for the next day, but it still could not be realized due to rain. It has now been determined that the South Tour team has postponed its departure to the 30th of this month, so the match against the Hong Kong League will be rescheduled for the 27th of this month (Saturday) at 5:00 PM at Jia Shan. This is the team's performance before departure. It is a matter of charity. We hope that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong will enthusiastically come to watch and not miss the opportunity.

### No School Volleyball Games Yesterday; Three Matches Today

The school volleyball games had three matches scheduled yesterday, including senior, junior, and children's levels. However, due to rain on that day, the courts were wet, hindering competition. Therefore, all matches were postponed. Today, if the weather is clear, there will still be three matches in senior, junior, and children's levels.

### Preliminary Gymnastics

—Zou Falu

Before describing the combined movements of multiple people, there are a few points to declare that readers must pay attention to, so that the direction and movements of each person will not be confused or unable to figure out.

1. The far end of the mat is called the front, the near end is called the back, and the two sides are called the sides.

2. For the lying or lying posture, the one with the head facing forward or backward is called straight, and the one with the head facing both sides is called horizontal.

3. The people doing the movements are replaced by the words "A", "B", "C", etc. according to the standing position during preparation. The one standing at the front is called A, and the one standing slightly behind is called B, and so on.

B. Two-Person Movements

(66) Face-to-Face Forward Roll—Preparation: A lies supine on the mat with head facing back, feet separated and raised, and both hands holding B's feet on the shoulders. B stands with feet separated in front of A's shoulders, raising both hands forward to hold A's feet. Action: B pushes A's feet to the mat, while rolling forward, A tightly grips B's feet, and rises with B's momentum. Then, use B's method to roll forward, so rising and lying together, continuously moving forward. Note: The roller must first push the feet of the person lying down to the mat, so that the head does not hit the mat. The person lying down must tightly grip the roller's feet, so that it is easy to stand up. Both people must be fully curled up, and the movements must be continuous.

(67) Face-to-Face Backward Roll—Preparation: Same as before, but the positions and directions of the two people are reversed. Action: A falls backward to roll, and reaches the supine position. B raises the feet at A's rear to assist, and rolls backward. When A rolls, take the opportunity to stand up, and then fall backward to roll, so continuously doing it. Note: The two people must always maintain a curled posture, and must hold the other person's feet close to their own shoulders.

(68) Face-to-Face Backward Fall—Preparation: B lies supine with the back facing forward, with the body forming a reverse "bow" shape, hugging A's waist. A stands in front of B with the back facing forward, and bends over to hug B's waist. Action: A hugs B and leans backward, forming the posture of B's preparation. After B lands both feet firmly, immediately hug A backward like A did, so continuously doing it. Note: The two people must hug each other's waists tightly, and their feet must be separated.

(69) Back-to-Back Forward Roll—Preparation: A lies prone on the mat with the head facing forward. B stands forward about one step behind A. Action: B bends forward, placing both hands on the mat next to A's hips, and uses the forward somersault method to flip over A's back, then lying prone. After B flips over, A immediately flips over B's back like B did, so continuously doing it. Note: The distance between the two people is such that the hips of the person lying down and the shoulders of the person flipping are just right. The person lying down must take the opportunity to raise their arms to assist when the person flipping is over their back. (4)

### The Chaos of Financial Affairs in Tianjin and Beijing Under Japanese Control: The Value of "United Reserve" Counterfeit Notes Plummets, Distrusted by Chinese and Foreign Merchants

A Beiping correspondent's report from the Zimo News on May 2nd states: The Zimo News recently published an article by its Tokyo correspondent, which stated that the Japanese authorities are currently drafting a grand plan to develop gold mining on the border of Rehe and Manchuria. Furthermore, the extracted gold will be used to strengthen the resources of the "United Reserve Bank" established in Beiping, and to help establish control over the financial affairs of North China and expand foreign trade in the region. If the bank's hope of strengthening its resources relies solely on this, then such assistance will be slow to materialize. Currently, due to the continued sharp decline in the value of "United Reserve" banknotes, North China is facing the risk of a severe monetary crisis. When the reporter was drafting this report, the "United Reserve" currency was being discounted by more than 35% against the legal currency. Day after day, the currency continues to plummet in value, and the monetary issue is the sole topic of discussion here in recent days, even surpassing the aftermath of the war. The residents of Beiping are now showing worried expressions, whispering among themselves, "Is the new currency going to become worthless?" They seem quite shocked, which reduces the credibility of those so-called financiers, because those who understood the nature of the "United Reserve" from the beginning stated that this kind of banknote, without any reserve fund, would not be able to gain value, no matter how the Japanese declared it or enforced it with bayonets. The public's panic has some basis, as we have already seen some warning signs of financial chaos, such as the rising cost of living, with stores raising the prices of various goods daily. Essential goods like flour and kerosene, as well as all imported goods, are increasing in price. A 40-pound bag of American flour, which could have been obtained for six yuan three weeks ago, now requires seven yuan and twenty cents. Railway fares have almost doubled, and return tickets cannot be purchased. Even local taxes in this city have been repeatedly increased. As for foreign shops, they have recently started pricing in pounds or gold dollars. The free exchange of "United Reserve" currency at par with the Japanese yen has been restricted, and today the restrictions are even tighter. Only specially permitted Japanese merchants are able to obtain a limited amount of Japanese yen at the Yokohama Specie Bank. There are various reasons given for the decline in the value of "United Reserve" currency. One explanation is that a large amount of foreign flour is imported into North China, and now importers have to pay for it in foreign exchange, which can be obtained with legal currency. However, the Japanese have issued regulations to implement searches and confiscations, forcing the legal currency out of formal circulation. Therefore, a large amount of legal currency cannot be obtained unless at a very high premium. This is one reason, but not the whole story. While it can explain the price increase of a few goods and the considerable premium on legal currency, it does not account for the sudden collapse of the value of "United Reserve" currency and the general distrust. It is widely rumored that Japanese expatriates in North China are willing to pay any price to get rid of the "United Reserve" currency, which is one example. Many believe that this is the cause of the continuous decline in the "United Reserve" currency, and there are rumors that the Japanese yen will also be devalued, which makes the general public even more uneasy. The fact that the "United Reserve" currency, currently valued at about six pence five, can be exchanged for the officially fixed price of one shilling and two pence for a Japanese yen, but with some restrictions, clearly illustrates the financial chaos here at present. Those who watch the financial oddities of other parts of the world with a cold eye now find that Chinese merchants who were still demanding payment in "United Reserve" currency a few months ago are now earnestly asking customers if they can pay with legal currency instead. Or, stores that previously stated firmly that they would only accept "United Reserve" currency are now reissuing notices stating that they will price their goods in some kind of gold coin in the future, which should not cause any surprise. There are many on the Japanese side who are talking about "taking decisive measures now," but even Japanese military and financial experts cannot explain what kind of bold measures can make a worthless currency gain value. There are also those who advocate stopping all goods from being imported into North China. This measure may temporarily prevent the "United Reserve" currency from falling further, but it is only temporary and will only increase financial chaos. The implementation of this measure will cut off the source of some essential goods that Japan cannot obtain, the cost of living will continue to rise, it will have an adverse effect on the Japanese yen, and widespread smuggling will occur, while the exchange rate of the "United Reserve" currency will still not be resolved. Products from some inland areas, such as cotton, peanuts, silk, eggs, etc., still have to be paid for in legal currency, and since the amount of legal currency is small, it gradually rises in premium. In the end, it is doubtful whether the public's trust in the "United Reserve" currency, which has no reserves, can be restored. The only sound strategy is to admit failure and gradually withdraw this new currency, just as when a large amount of Japanese yen flowed into China last year. But this is just a suggestion, and it is unlikely to be adopted by the Japanese. Considering that the Japanese currency experiment in North China has suffered a disastrous failure, and yet Japanese military and financial experts are still determined to use another "independent" new currency in Central China, it becomes even more apparent that they are unwilling to accept any advice.

### Everyday Health Issues

[Question] My body is very weak and I often get sick. What kind of food is both economical and has the most nutrients for maintaining my health?

[Answer] The common belief that expensive foods have the most nutrients is a misconception. According to reports from researchers, bird's nest and shark fin are not as nutritious as tofu. We need to provide our bodies with the appropriate needs. The foods our bodies need can be divided into five categories: (1) carbohydrates, (2) fats, (3) proteins, (4) minerals, and (5) vitamins (or vitamin). Due to space limitations, I cannot say much here. Now, I will only cite one or two kinds of daily food, which are very beneficial to the body and meet the economic conditions, as follows:

(1) Brown rice and black bread: They contain vitamin B and minerals. Eating them often can treat beriberi and promote growth and development. They can especially replenish blood, because brown rice and black bread contain large amounts of the minerals copper and iron, and are easily absorbed.

(2) Beans: There are many kinds of bean products, such as dim sum, vegetables, tofu, and soy milk, which are too numerous to mention. They are cheap and easy to buy. Beans are very nutritious, containing a large amount of plant-based protein, with a composition almost similar to that of beef, and with more iron than milk. Special blood-tonifying products sold on the market mostly contain iron as the main ingredient. Instead of spending more money on blood-tonifying medicines, it is better to eat more tofu products. For example, three taels of soybeans can make two pounds of soy milk, which only costs twenty-two cents. I hope that people who want to maintain their health will eat some bean products every day.

(3) Vegetables: Green vegetables also contain a large amount of minerals, and are also rich in various vitamins. Moreover, the fiber of vegetables is not digested by the intestines and stomach. It can cleanse our intestines and stomach, relieve constipation, and is beneficial to health. Therefore, everyone should eat more vegetables in every meal. This is an easy thing to do.

[Question]: After being sick, my body feels very weak. I want to do a very light exercise to recover my health as soon as possible. What kind of exercise is more appropriate?

[Answer]: To recover from an illness, it's not just about exercise. In addition to exercise, attention should be paid to diet, mental well-being, and other aspects. Only by combining these with exercise can it be effective. Regarding light exercise, you can take walks outdoors or in the countryside, preferably in the morning. Except for wind and rain, it is advisable to do it every day. In this warm and sunny spring, walking in the countryside can not only absorb fresh air and the warmth of the sun, but also add to the pleasure of the mood from the beauty of nature. Green seedlings and yellow flowers on mountain roads and in fields can stimulate personal interest and regulate physical fatigue everywhere. Several miles of walking every day can provide suitable conditioning for both the mind and body. I hope that people with very weak bodies will actually try it.

### Light Smoke

— Zhuang Ruiyuan

I sit down to write a "small package" to a distant place.

For the past two years, I have been saving every bit of time from sleeping, eating, and resting to write letters as heavy as small packages to that missed distant place. It has become a habit. Of course, chasing after the green bicycle and receiving the small packages sent quickly from the bulging bag has also become a habit.

The days seem like a lonely house. In this house, I settle down. The past autumn has passed, and the winter days are still not my own. When spring comes, I am simply afraid. This is Tangmuchi Nash's spring. There are no swallows, no old women chatting and laughing under the sun. So I sit down again, filling my blank minutes and seconds with words. How I cherish a bit of classical enthusiasm and a bit of modern rationality. This is why I have been writing heavy small packages for two years without the slightest fatigue.

The days flow by. Today is a continuation of yesterday, and tomorrow will have even fainter memories and lighter smoke. This is why I treasure a letter sent from a distant place without the slightest fatigue.

Everything is reopened from memory. I miss Shanghai. I was originally used to living on that free land. I should return to that land. Although Shanghai has been through air raids and burning, the fallen Shanghai is on a distant continent across the ocean, and the dark sea is stormy. I miss the lone island among the cracks. So, in troubled night dreams, I cross the smoky haze of April and fly back to Shanghai.

This is already a distant matter. I bit on the rubber band and walked briskly across Nanjing Road. In spring, I lay on the grassy ground of Wusong Beach, leisurely puffing on a peachwood pipe. This is even more distant. I, like a little snail, carried a bookbag on my back to school. Gradually, I learned how to stroll lonely on the campus. The black fence, the red roof, the leaves of the white-collar trees unfolded a dense dream. I would pant for the footsteps as broken as small white flowers and write delicate poems for the playful temples and beautiful waists.

And on this afternoon in the sky, the suburbs of Shanghai should be covered with weeds, and the swallows should be clearly chirping. In the room with a bit of sunlight, what I think of is something else.

In troubled night dreams, I cross the smoky haze of April and fly back to Shanghai. Morning white sunlight finally comes. The silhouette outside the paper window is colorful. I sleep sweetly and then wake up sweetly. The homecoming dream comes and disappears like light smoke. I go out to breathe the morning air in the morning sunlight. Isn't that a girl on the edge? People are young and without love.

The beginning of a day, the beginning of some other loneliness. I am still as lonely as a polar bear, sitting up and walking by myself, going to the train station for a walk. My shadow is also lonely. I see the locomotive spewing black coal smoke and then begin to dream black-horned dreams on the black coal smoke. I stare for a long time at the black and long whistle of the train under the blue sky.

The artillery fire of the year before last made me leave the Huangpu River. The wings of the Huangpu River and the half-goddess have been dimmed. The troops in Zhabei are on alert for the first bullet fired from the sky. In the days that followed, I only missed the day of returning to the Huangpu River and continued to turn my back on the beacon fire in the east, making a long journey to the distant southwest.

Now I am completely tired. I settle down in this quiet mountain town. Occasionally, I reach out to pat the dust off my clothes. I want to this is the dust brought from eight different provinces. I can name a hundred unknown towns and villages and say everything about the ancient roads I have passed through. Those are canyons, those are passes, dreamy and rushing rivers, wide and open sandy beaches, and dark harbors. Where is the ferry where travelers board the boat, and where are there not the homes where lodgers knock? I can remember every arduous journey.

I fully understand that in this dangerous and murderous era, countless blood flows for every inch of land. The wings of war have spread to every corner. Artillery fire is indifferent to the lives of all people. We have been turning our backs on the beacon fire in the east for too long and too far for some reason. We cannot rush to the artillery fire, but are chased on a long journey to the distant southwest.

Although I have gradually become unfamiliar with the past, the suburbs of Shanghai have been flooded and burned, or floating as lone islands, in the oceans away from the mainland. And tomorrow there will be memories even fainter than today, and lighter smoke. Although I let the memories become lighter, I no longer regret the past days of biting on the rubber candy and walking briskly across Jing'an Temple Road; in the spring, lying on the grassy ground of Wusong Beach, leisurely puffing on a peachwood pipe. Moreover, I am even indifferent to the memory of loyalty, and I no longer have such a passionate perfect teaching feeling for the beautiful and even more beautiful incarnations.

However, I linger at the train station for a long time. I see the locomotive spewing black smoke and then dream black dreams on the black coal smoke. This train is filled with so many crowded passengers every day. It stops here and then departs from here to a distant harbor.

So on this spring afternoon, when a bit of sunlight comes into my room, what I think of is something else: From that distant harbor, you can reach an even more distant harbor. Finally, I will discover the yellow and turbid sea water from a small, round accident. The Huangpu River is still so yellow and turbid, flowing, and what is more, it is now temporarily covered with shame, so yellow and turbidly ashamed, flowing out of the Wusongkou, merging with the Yangtze River.

Yes, I miss Shanghai. I am going back, going back and leaving again. So I sit down to write a small package to a distant place.

For two years, I have been so accustomed to filling my blank minutes and seconds with words, but now I no longer have this amazing patience. I am young, so I cannot help but have a youthful irritability. Still, in this war, I cannot rush to the artillery fire, but I want to visit some war zones, visit the hometown of flowers and blood that fell in May, and finally, I will see Shanghai on the Huangpu River, like a wounded beast, blankly and blankly curled up on the bank of the Huangpu River, biting its own tail, grieving, and wanting to avenge in grief. It has been almost two years,

Everything is reopened from memory. Let tomorrow have memories even fainter than today, and lighter smoke. I want to walk back to Shanghai step by step, re-freshing my memories, always so freshly and you stay.

### Passing Baisha

— Lin Ling

The continuous summer rain made the stream under the Jiqiao Bridge, which is dry all year round, overflow. After the rain, the sun appeared in the clouds, revealing itself after a fresh bath.

I had been bored by the rain in Taicheng for a few days. If the rain didn't stop today, I thought, twelve hours would become as long as twelve days. However, when I washed my face, the sun brought the good news of clearing skies.

For many days, I have been thinking of Baisha all the time: I miss this town, just as I miss a seriously ill close friend. Baisha is locked in layers of mountains. In the past, it only took three or two hours by train to reach it. But now it won't work. The railway has been dug into countless deep holes, and many locomotives have been torn into small pieces by × planes. To go there, I can only rely on walking on two legs.

The journey is more than thirty li, but the actual travel will exceed this distance: because countless small hills have been built densely on the road, I have to climb over those newly filled small hills one by one, and I don't know how much the curve has lengthened the journey!

Along the way, there is a small hill, a pond (a newly dug hole filled with rainwater), arranged in an orderly manner, close to the slippery path along the pond, and a careless step will fall into a new pool ten feet deep. It is also difficult to walk on that small hill, because the tall mud has been watered into a gelatinous substance. With each step, the boots sank for the most part, and it took a lot of effort to lift them.

Fortunately, after walking halfway, the second half was not destroyed. I looked at the flat second half of the journey, breathed a sigh of relief, walked into a small stall's hut, drank a glass of boiled water, and mustered up my energy to move forward.

After bypassing one mountain, another mountain with a different appearance came out to greet me. At dusk, I vaguely saw the rooftops of Baisha City appearing in the gaps between the mountains. At that time, I was both happy and anxious. The pace was heavy, as if I had a fever, probably because I hadn't walked a long distance for a long time.

When I entered Baisha City, I did not feel the joy of reunion after a long absence, but the mood of inquiring about the illness and injury of an old friend.

I first found an acquaintance there and asked him to take me around to explore the traces of the bombing. As it happened, this friend was a student at the Min University Affiliated Middle School. He had also experienced the atmosphere of danger during the bombing.

He told me: The blood-stained day was March 30.

He also told me: Eight planes came that day, five of which went to Chikan, and the remaining three circled and bombed here. In about an hour, when the Iron Birds proudly turned their tails and returned, more than one hundred and twenty buildings here had become ruins, more than one hundred and fifty people had become blood ghosts, and about two hundred townspeople had suffered painful injuries...

He took me, from this street to that street. Next to each bomb mark, I rested for a few minutes and took out my diary to record it in detail. When I wrote those recorded words, my heart felt as if thousands of ants were gnawing at it. You innocent and kind dead! How can I write out the heavy mood of grief that I felt for you at that time?

When I came to the open space by the seashore, my friend said to me in a low voice:

When this friend said this, his voice was also a little hoarse. He couldn't bear this great sadness in his memories.

However, what about me? At that time, I was more angry than grieving and couldn't help but say:

"The × Japanese are equal to wild beasts. Even if it is an old and weak woman, they do not hesitate to expend countless bullets! They are the same everywhere!"

For more than a month, this place has been washed by rain many times, but it still cannot wash away the bloodstains! This small river is hissing and flowing, but it can never wash away the bloody memory in people's hearts: "March 30th"!

### Love for the Old Country

— Jie Ru

On the island,

The new wind of May,

Blows in,

Youthful smiles.

Picking up heavy eyes,

Gazing at the distant sky,

Clear sea water,

Snow-white floating clouds;

—A strand of peaceful, clear song

Comforting that lonely feeling,

Comforting that in the heart,

Distant dream.

Is that side,

With pale mountains,

With verdant trees,

Blurred light mist,

Enveloping the edge of the sea,

That traveler's feeling of melancholy.

There is the old country,

Displaying familiar mountains and rivers,

Displaying vast open fields;

Underneath the clouds and mist,

There is—

A pair of mysterious eyes,

A smile containing tenderness,

A bunch of purple lilacs,

For six years,

For six years entrusted with

Endless fantasies

May the new wind of May,

Sweep across the streets and alleys of the south,

Blow the traveler's longing,

Into the dream embrace of the old country.

### Methods

— Geng Zhi

If ordinary people want to succeed in any undertaking, big or small, they inevitably need some ability. This ability, generally speaking, is what we call economic talent or competence. From cultivating oneself and managing one's family, to governing the state and bringing peace to the world, it is indispensable.

Within this ability, however, it can be further divided into two types: one follows the official road, sticking to the rules, walking in a square and proper manner, which can be said to be "following the Way"; the other only cares about the goal, disregards the means, and is willing to use any trick, which can be said to be "the way of the hegemon." Morality and the way of the king are praised and practiced by ancient sages and kings, and should indeed be implemented, allowing things to happen naturally. But unfortunately, in my opinion, this way of the king has never been truly implemented throughout history, or rather, it has never succeeded. If we look through history, we only see the way of the hegemon.

Which "founder" of each dynasty, who established the throne, did not fight their way up with swords and spears, or seize power through conspiracy and usurpation? What is this if not the way of the hegemon? Once they become the ruler, they may indeed implement benevolent governance and promote the way of the king. However, if we examine their psychology, as well as that of their descendants, how many of them truly love the people? Aren't they all trying to preserve their own private property and empire, and therefore have to borrow the grand image of ancient sages and kings to suppress their people, and use so-called sacred scriptures and virtuous teachings to promote the great principle that when the ruler commands the subject to die, the subject must die, leaving the people unable to move? Things like revering Confucianism and promoting literature, or promoting education, are nothing more than policies to fool the people, to make them properly support the rulers and not rebel, with the same effect as burning books and burying scholars. What kind of way of the king is this? Isn't it still the way of the hegemon! Gaining power on horseback is the way of the hegemon; even if you can't govern on horseback and try to govern after dismounting, it is still the way of the hegemon.

If the world and the state still only have the way of the hegemon, then it is no wonder that society and families only pursue the way of the hegemon. In other words, in these places, there is no need to pay attention to proper economic talent or competence, only to tactics, because tactics inherently have two aspects, which are the two sides of the way of the hegemon:

First, ruthlessness. Holding the power of life and death, for those who resist, no mercy. If there is land to be scraped, scrape off several inches severely; those who beg for my pity, banish them outside the gate; to those who plead with me, don't give a penny. It is best to make people suffer from you, unable to speak out, or make people afraid of even seeing your shadow, forced to avoid you from afar, allowing you to charge straight ahead, alone and unopposed—all of this is the ruthlessness of tactics, enough to help one succeed.

It is really no wonder that tactics cannot but be ruthless: think about it, even a noble "article" requires a "ruthless hand" to "write" it. And repaying great kindness with evil, killing to silence, has always been a common occurrence, let alone ordinary matters! How can it not be ruthless!

Second, deception. Since ancient times, war has been based on deception, and war is a major state affair. Therefore, the power of deception also permeates all "affairs" and "undertakings." If it were not for Zhuge Liang's seven captures and releases, using the advantages of deception, how could he have achieved "the southern people will never rebel again?" I often hear the elders advising their children, "Only tell three parts of what you know when you meet someone," which can be taken as the essence of deception.

Originally, in complex society, or perhaps in civilized society, honest people and those who are upright invariably have the reputation of being "fools", ending up in utter failure. On the other hand, those with strong tactics, who can use tricks to dazzle people, flourish like sunflowers in spring. Therefore, the best way to handle things is to set traps and let people willingly enter or fall into them. As for what you want from them, never tell them honestly. I only seek from him a certain goal, requesting his help.

A person skillful in ruthlessness can succeed, and one skillful in deception can especially succeed. If ruthlessness and deception work together, then they can go anywhere in the world and be invincible.

When I think about it myself, it is not a biased view: Confucius, who spoke of the way of the king, what was his life like? Even Mencius, who spoke of the way of the hegemon but leaned towards the way of the king, what was his life like? And people like Liu Bang, Zhao Kuangyin, and Zhu Yuanzhang, which one of them truly studied the books of Mencius? Furthermore, what was the outcome of Jesus, who preached the great Way? And which of Hitler and Mussolini's followers were truly devout Christians? Therefore, I say that the way of the king has never really existed; if people treat me with the way of the hegemon, I will treat them with the way of the hegemon. At least for now, that is the true and eternal principle!

"There is nothing inherently wrong in the world, it is the mediocre who trouble themselves." This is the relationship between the way of the hegemon and the use of ruthless and deceptive tactics. Helplessly, everyone in the world is mediocre, so using tactics is the only way to trouble themselves. To trouble oneself is, originally, the only way to live.
