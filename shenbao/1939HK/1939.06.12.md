### The Past, Present, and Future of the War of Resistance in North China

— Chu Xichun

(1) A Historical Review of the Twenty-Two Months of the War of Resistance in North China—Its Experiences and Lessons

The War of Resistance in North China, especially in the Second War Zone which is the center of gravity of resistance in North China, over the past twenty-two months can be described in three stages, and its experiences and lessons can be explored.

A. The First Stage—From the "July 7th Incident" to the Fall of Taiyuan

1. Failure of Military Defensive Positional Warfare

The "July 7th Incident" was the beginning of a planned attempt by the × people to destroy our nation. Therefore, after capturing Tianjin and Beijing, they immediately advanced along the Ping-Sui Railway towards Nankou, attempting to seize Jin-Sui, the northwest gateway and national fortress. However, the military leaders in Jin-Sui had already developed detailed plans for the War of Resistance against Japan and had made appropriate deployments based on national defense works. Due to the emergency at Nankou and the inability of the Chahar troops to deploy in time, the Central Government ordered Tang's army stationed in Sui-Xi, along with Gao and Li's divisions, to be equipped with a mountain artillery regiment under Commander Zhou, and to deploy at Nankou with swift force, creating the fierce battle of Nankou. To reinforce Nankou and counterattack Beijing, Chen's division was first placed under Tang's command. At the same time, a certain group army was transferred from Shaanxi to provide reinforcements. To further facilitate operations in that area, Zhao and other units, attached with a certain artillery regiment, were ordered to attack northern Chahar, successively capturing Shangdu, Jiabosi, Shangyi, and other places. The bitter fighting at Nankou lasted for weeks, with the × repeatedly sending reinforcements, flanking on the right wing, and attacking fiercely. Upon Central Government orders, a certain unit in the mountainous area northwest of Zhuozhou was sent north as reinforcement, and General Commander Fu was ordered to lead his troops to reinforce the front of Nankou. Army Commander Tang heroically commanded, inflicting heavy damage on the ×. However, the army divisions under his command suffered great sacrifices. Ultimately, due to the reinforcements from northern Shaanxi not arriving in time, the Chahar defense forces retreated, Zhangbei fell, and Zhangjiakou was in crisis. The rear of our army was cut off by the ×, and the various armies resisting at Nankou had to retreat southwestward, causing the plan to counterattack Beijing to fail. Our × divisions suffered heavy losses. The × took advantage of the situation to fiercely attack Tian Suo, advancing towards Datong. As the majority of the × forces were isolated in southern Chahar, it was necessary to add the forces equipped for national defense advocated by Army Commander Wang to the Battle of Datong. As a result, the national defense works in eastern Sui and northern Yan were rendered useless. When it was decided to engage in a decisive battle with the × at Datong, the defense forces of Chahar successively abandoned Yuxian and Yangyuan. The × Itagaki Division was able to drive straight in from the Huailai area, eyeing Lingguang and attacking Yanmen. Therefore, the plan for a decisive battle at Datong could not be realized.

Next were the various battles in northern Jin. The ×, with hundreds of thousands of elite troops from the Itagaki and Tojo units, advanced in multiple directions. Our army also launched an attack on the × advancing from Lingguang, attempting to first defeat one route in the mountainous area outside Pingxingguan and then transfer forces to gradually annihilate them. Sun and Gao's units were ordered to firmly defend the line at Pingxingguan, while Chen and Guo's units launched an attack from near Tuanchengkou. However, when the attacking troops arrived, the key point of Tuanchengkou had already been occupied by the ×, who were launching a large-scale invasion, leading to an unsuccessful attack that turned into a blocking action. After nine days of bloody fighting, the hills near Pingxingguan were lost and regained nine times, seven times by the Jin-Sui army and once each by Gao's army and a certain route army. The × repeatedly sent reinforcements, but were repelled, and many × were annihilated. In particular, a certain brigade of a certain route army ambushed the ×'s logistics base and marching column near Xiaosai Village outside Pingxingguan, capturing a great deal of supplies. Other units suffered significant losses against several times their superior numbers. At that time, our army, with ×× divisions and × artillery regiments, assumed responsibility for a front line of five hundred li. Although the × ultimately failed to break through the Yanmen Highway, they concentrated their forces to attack Ru Yuekou. Our Brigade Commander Liang Jiantang led his troops in a bitter fight, ultimately sacrificing himself. The × then occupied the Fen Shui Ling and Tie Jiao Ling north of Fanshi.

After the × invaded Fanshi from Tie Jiao Ling, they advanced south along the Tongpu Railway. Our side concentrated a large army and ordered Army Commander Wang, attached with artillery ×× regiments, to defend the county seat, and Brigade Commander Shan Yuzhen, attached with artillery × battalions, to defend Yuanping. Army Commander Wang fought bitterly for seven days, suffering great losses. Brigade Commander Shan personally led his troops, fighting bravely with a single brigade against tens of thousands of × in a bloody battle. After the city fell, they continued with street fighting. Finally, they held three courtyards for eleven days, with nearly all officers and soldiers sacrificing themselves. Brigade Commander Shan also achieved success and benevolence. The bloody battles of Yuanping and × County allowed our army to calmly deploy at Xinkou, creating an unprecedented "annihilation of the ×." Generals Wei ××, Yang ××, Chuan ××, Hao ××, Li ××, Gao ××, Liu ××, Wang ××, Guo ××, Sun ××, Chen ××, and others led various armies, divisions, and brigades, attached with seven artillery regiments under Zhou's command, under the unified command of former General Commander Wei ×. The Commander-in-Chief planned meticulously and supervised the battle strictly. General Commander Chuan led several divisions of the Jin-Sui army in a frontal attack, fighting fiercely and achieving repeated victories. The enemy's army was thwarted, shaking the × nation. They repeatedly sent reinforcements, attempting to succeed, fighting bloodily for twenty-three days. Finally, the field battle turned into a positional battle, with the use of tunnels to attack us, and we also used tunnels to defend. More than 30,000 × were killed. Army Commander Hao Mengling and Division Commander Liu Jiaqi, and Brigade Commander Qingting, in order to block the breach of Nanhuaikou, took the lead and all sacrificed themselves for the country. On the left wing, Li Ming's two units launched a flank attack on the ×, advancing and retreating more than twenty li. General Commander Zhu Peng and Vice Commander led troops to cut off the ×'s rear and block their transportation. At that time, all the × were likely to be completely surrounded and annihilated by us. Unexpectedly, the military on the Pinghan Line retreated south of Shijiazhuang, and the Eastern Route × Army advanced on Niangziguan, broke through Gukuan, and gradually invaded westward. Our army at Xinkou could not move south and used the inherent fortifications near Taiyuan for a battle near the city, beginning the Battle of Taiyuan. The planned deployment was to have a portion defend the city and place the main force on the high ground on both sides of the railway to quickly annihilate the ×. However, the Eastern Route × invaded Yuchi Taiyuan again from Pindingshouyang, and the various units originally scheduled to assist in the defense of Taiyuan did not have time to return due to their participation in the Battle of Xinkou. The × had already pressed fiercely under the city of Taiyuan, causing the predetermined plan for Taiyuan to fail. In order to prevent the Eastern Route × from invading south and cutting off our rear transportation, our army gradually withdrew from Taiyuan and transferred to the southwest area. Taiyuan fell on November 8.

2. Initiation and Development of Political and Popular Movement Work

At the start of the war, the commander of the war zone said: "This war against Japan is not a war between countries, nor a war between people and nations, but a people's revolutionary war between a weak country and a strong country. We must implement a total mobilization of the people to respond to the war." Therefore, after the start of the war, the × War Zone actively deployed troops to strongly resist the war and began the total mobilization of the people in political, economic, and popular movements.

(1) Reforming the Administrative Structure to Meet Needs: During the Battle of Xinkou, the entire province was divided into seven guerrilla administrative regions, each with a political director to guide and connect various counties to accelerate mobilization work and strengthen administrative efficiency. After the × penetrated deeply, the counties lost contact with the provincial government and were able to act on behalf of the provincial government, maintaining the government in the ×'s rear. At the same time, more than seventy county magistrates were replaced, and brave and responsible individuals were selected to fill the positions.

(2) Determining Wartime Financial Policy: Based on the principle of "those with money contribute money, and everyone contributes effort," the method of reasonable burdens on counties and villages during the War of Resistance was announced to improve people's lives and enrich the strength of the War of Resistance. To break the ×'s deceptive trick of exempting grain and taxes, the exemption of various local taxes was announced to reduce the people's burdens.

(3) Intensifying the Organization and Training of the People: At the start of the War of Resistance, total mobilization implementation committees were established at the provincial, county, and village levels to accelerate the mobilization of the people. After the fall of northern Yan, to adapt to the special circumstances of the battlefield, a general mobilization committee for the people's revolutionary war battlefield was established to implement battlefield mobilization. The work of the public moral corps and the Sacrifice League in various counties was also centered on mobilization. Therefore, various popular organizations such as farmers' rescue, youth rescue, workers' rescue, and women's rescue were established in various counties and villages.

(4) Expanding the Arming of the People: Before the war, there was already the establishment of a national soldiers' officers training corps, which selected more than 10,000 knowledgeable youths with patriotic consciousness from various villages for centralized training. The original plan was for two years to train the lower-level cadres of 300,000 armed people. Before the training was completed, the War of Resistance had already begun, and the students demanded to participate in the War of Resistance. They were gradually reorganized into the Youth Anti-Japanese Death Squad, and workers and peasants were absorbed to expand the organization and transform it into combat troops. More than a thousand workers from Taiyuan City volunteered to participate in the War of Resistance and formed a workers' armed self-defense force. At the same time, the organizational methods for the people's armed self-defense forces in various counties and the village self-defense forces that did not separate from production were announced, and local armed forces in various counties developed rapidly.

(5) Determining the Ten Major Programs of National Revolution: During this period, the war gradually deepened, and the work gradually developed. To determine the goals and take further steps, the Ten Major Programs of National Revolution were determined, which greatly helped the work of the War of Resistance. Schools for training young people for people's revolution and political and military schools attached to the army were established to absorb young people from various places and cultivate military and political cadres.

B. The Second Stage—From the Linfen Hot Springs Conference to the Jixian Senior Generals Conference.

1. Development of Military Mobile Guerrilla Warfare

After the fall of Taiyuan, the military center of gravity shifted to the Jinpu Line. At the same time, the troops of this war zone contained the × on both sides and in the rear, preventing the × from immediately advancing into southern Jin, forming a state of confrontation between the × and us on the Hanhouling Line, giving us an opportunity to rest, reorganize, and deploy.

During this period, the military and political leadership organs were concentrated in Linfen. To implement the purpose of the War of Resistance and adapt to the future situation, the strategic decision of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare was made in military terms, and its implementation was actively prepared. In political terms, the principles of unified understanding, unified guidance, and unified action were decided by the Hot Springs Conference.

As soon as the meeting was over, in military terms, to coordinate with the operations on the Jinpu Line, our army launched a counterattack on Taiyuan from the left and right wings. Guerrilla units in various places also assisted the regular army in combat by attacking the ×, destroying transportation, and detecting × intelligence. However, because the right wing moved slowly for seven or eight days, giving the × an opportunity to concentrate their forces and attack our material storage area in the Lüliang Mountains, taking advantage of our emptiness, a certain army and a certain division of the vanguard, led by General Commander Chuan, had already advanced in and out of Taiyuan and were in fierce battle with the ×, making it difficult to transfer them back in time. Therefore, the general reserve force of the Wang army had to be hurriedly deployed to block the ×'s advance, fighting bitterly for weeks, making great sacrifices, and Brigade Commander Zhao Xizhang sacrificed himself. Chen's army, which was stationed in the Linfen area, was urgently transferred to provide reinforcements overnight. At this time, the First War Zone abandoned Xinxiang, and the Eastern Route × Army drove straight in from Dongyangguan, Yuanqu, and other places, cutting off our rear communication lines in a few days, and the situation was extremely urgent. The key passes of Dui Jiugu and Da Maijiao on the western route were successively broken through by the ×, and the entire counterattack plan could not be realized. Therefore, the strategy was changed, and our armies were withdrawn to various places in the entire territory to launch a full-scale guerrilla war, dividing the entire war zone into four routes: east, west, south, and north, each with a commander-in-chief responsible for commanding, deeply into the rear of the × to lay the foundation for the guerrilla base areas.

In mid-March, the ×, with more than ten thousand troops, surrounded and attacked Jixian from eight directions. At the same time, three routes surrounded the northwest, and in April, nine routes jointly attacked Qin County, all of which were repelled by our army.

In mid-April, to coordinate with the operations in Chuzhou, the Southern Route Army attacked the ×, recovering the triangular area. The Western Route Army counterattacked Zhongyang, Lishi, and Pu counties. The Northern Route Army recovered Qingshuihe and advanced towards Suiyuan and Mongolia. The Eastern Route Army attacked Zhengtai County, attracting a large number of × troops to achieve the task of containing the ×.

Also, within one to three days, the various detachments of our Border Region Government and Nie Rongzhen's troops successively recovered nine counties, including Buping, Lingguang, Xingtang, and Quyang. On the 5th, they recovered Changping, and on the 6th, they occupied Yangyuan.

2. Development and Progress of Political and Popular Movement Work

Due to the decisions and promotion of the Hot Springs Conference, the development of political and popular movement work in this stage has the following progress:

(1) Soundness of Political Institutions: Before the retreat from Linfen, to protect the local area, each political district set up a security commander's office and established a security team. When Linfen retreated, the provincial government ordered that the people's armed self-defense forces and public security bureau police in various counties should be organized into guerrilla detachments, with the county magistrate serving as the detachment leader. This is the soundness of the security organization. The political districts were changed to administrative districts, and the political directors were changed to administrative inspector commissioners. In the center of Yangqu Xiangning, eight or nine districts were set up. This is the soundness of the administrative organization. The establishment of a civil revolution room to promote civil revolution education, strengthen supervision, and establish a civil revolution middle school and revolutionary primary schools in various counties. This is a sound administrative facility.

(2) Development of Popular Movement Work: The important work in the popular movement is to mobilize new soldiers to replenish the regular army, expand the new army, support the mobilization of the people, consolidate political power, carry out rescue work in the district, and crush the × puppet organization. Further strengthen popular organizations such as farmers' rescue, women's rescue, children's rescue, and youth rescue to protect the interests of the people and expand the strength of the war zone.

C. The Third Stage—From the Senior Generals Conference in × County to the Present

1. Strengthening the Quality of the Army and Giving Play to the Effectiveness of the Civil Revolutionary War

At the senior generals conference convened on July 1 in a certain village in × County, our commander-in-chief pointed out: To succeed in resisting ×, we must first seek the existence of the army itself. To exist, we must change from weak to strong; to succeed, we must overcome the strong with the weak. In order to achieve "changing from weak to strong," new replenishment methods, new rule, and new training methods were prescribed in order to integrate officers and soldiers, and integrate the military and the people. In order to achieve "overcoming the strong with the weak," new combat methods were prescribed in order to operate with flexibility, kill the ×, and protect the people under the principle of not losing opportunities and not suffering losses.

After the meeting, in order to thoroughly promote the "Four New Educations," incumbent military officers were batch-called for training, and the "Four New Educations" were promoted with full force in the army. Deadlines were set for each to be achieved on time. Since the implementation, each unit has made extraordinary progress, thus greatly increasing its effectiveness in combat:

In early September, × reinforced Lishi and invaded Dawu to the north, and attacked Liulin to the west. In October, five routes invaded the Wutai District. Then they jointly attacked Ningwu in northwestern Shanxi and jointly attacked Heshun and Liaoxian in eastern Shanxi. All were cleverly commanded by our frontal armies in heroic battles. The new tactic of "soft front and hard side" was used to lure the × deep and then annihilate them, and the political power of military, government, and people cooperation and empty room clearance was used to transmit intelligence and use it appropriately to give them heavy blows. In particular, in the battle of Liulin Dawu, more than 2,000 × were annihilated, and the × regiment leader Ishida was also killed in the battle. Dawu Liulin was immediately recovered.

In order to fully achieve the requirements of the new political strategy of the civil revolutionary war, Xu's brigade of a certain division advanced into the Fen-Nan Jihuang Mountains, threatening the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, and at the same time consolidating our Fen-Nan regime. The brigade used new guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, combined with clever fortifications, and defeated the ×'s three siege attacks on October 1. In particular, on November 5, the ×, in order to attack Xiangji and eliminate future troubles, launched a large-scale siege with about 4,000 infantry and more than 20 artillery pieces. After a fierce battle, it was broken, causing the × to suffer hundreds of casualties without gaining anything. A certain × artillery colonel also died in the battle. However, when our brigade commander Xu Jizhang personally directed the battle in Jixi Village, he was unfortunately killed by artillery shells. It is a pity, but our army's use of civil revolutionary tactics is undoubtedly enough to defeat the ×.

In late December, the × army, about 20,000, launched a nine-way siege of Jixian from the northeast, east, and southeast, approaching the Yellow River, attempting to cross to the west. In order to implement the ethnic revolutionary war method, the empty room clearance military and political cooperation operations were conducted, and the × was lured into the river bank, and then the rear was cut off, the food and grass were trapped, and the × were ambushed everywhere. In order to properly use the new tactics to annihilate the ×, a certain commander personally commanded the army in the heavy encirclement, relying on the assistance of the people and the dedication of the officers and soldiers, and broke the ×'s siege in less than ten days. The × who retreated eastward on the Lin-Da Highway (Linfen to Daning) were killed even more. However, because each unit had just finished training, the application was not very flexible, but more than half of the × were still annihilated. This shows that the ethnic revolutionary tactics can break the ×'s purpose of using force and kill the × effectively. In the battles of Wutai, Heshun, and Liaoxian, the × also broadcast that they were subject to our people's empty room clearance system, and it was difficult to even drink water. According to the central statistics, there were a total of 362 battles in the country in the second half of February, and the total number of × casualties was more than 20,000. The battles in Shanxi accounted for about four-sevenths, with 202 battles, and more than 10,000 × casualties, accounting for one-half of the country. Our × casualty ratio. I am one, × is thirteen weaker, and it is more iron evidence that the ethnic revolutionary tactics are enough to control the ×'s death.

D. Experience and Lessons of the War of Resistance

The above three stages of the history of the War of Resistance. In the military aspect, the first stage was a defensive positional war. Our army held a line, resisted section by section, to achieve the purpose of attrition warfare, but this gave the × the opportunity to exert their superior weapons, causing us great losses. In the second stage, the strategic use of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare made the war situation gradually favorable, and preliminary guerrilla base areas were established, forming a state of stalemate between the × and us, containing the ×'s offensive. The third stage was the strengthening of the quality of the army and the development of the ethnic revolutionary life-threatening tactics. The various battles to crush the ×'s offensive attempts all showed the great power of our military, government, and people. In the political and popular movement mobilization organs, all began to be established, laying the foundation for the people's revolutionary war. The second stage was the development period of the War of Resistance's political and popular movement work. The political organization gradually sound. The × district's regime gradually recovered, and the political effect became increasingly large. In terms of popular movement, the progress of the organization and training of the people enabled the people to show considerable achievements in helping the army fight, eliminating traitors, and assisting the mobilization of new soldiers. The third stage was the sound period of the War of Resistance's political and popular movement work. Politically, strong people politics and administrative service were implemented. In terms of popular movement, the organization's strength was gradually strengthened by the perfection of the organizational system. Therefore, we clearly see:

1. The ethnic revolutionary war has the inevitability of progress. A weak country resists the aggression of a strong country. The wonderful use of ethnic revolutionary law cannot win the final victory.

2. In positional offensive and defensive warfare, our army suffered four times as many casualties as the ×, and consumed more ammunition and lost more firearms. It should be avoided as a failed tactic of fighting the strong with the weak. In mobile guerrilla warfare, the ×'s casualties were three times to six times to even three times weaker than ours. We consume less ammunition, and not only do we not lose firearms, but we also capture some. It is a successful tactic of defeating the strong with the weak and should be worked hard!

3. The establishment of the anti-Japanese regime and the implementation of politics suitable for the War of Resistance destroyed the expansion of the puppet regime, shattered the ×'s dream of domination, and implemented the goal of fighting against the Japanese invaders, laying the foundation for victory and revival. Efforts should be made to sound and promote it.

4. Establish anti-Japanese guerrilla base areas and use the combined military, government, and people's force to fight against the ×. Although the × used superior forces, they ultimately failed. Without establishing an anti-Japanese war base area and fighting without contact between the military, government, and people, the ×, although inferior, and we, although superior, could not receive miraculous achievements, so establishing anti-Japanese guerrilla base areas and using the combined military, government, and people's force is the work that should be worked hard today.

5. The development of popular movement work can block the ×, shrink the × district, and complete the combined military, government, and people's force to attack the ×. However, organizing and training the people can use persuasive methods to gain the sympathy of the people, and the people can serve the anti-war work enthusiastically and disciplined. If a compulsory method is used, it is easy to provoke resentment. Therefore, popular movement work is a necessary means to win the war against ×, and the persuasive method is the highest principle of the popular movement work style and should be vigorously adopted.

6. The rise and fall of the people's anti-× sentiment is proportional to the number of times our army strikes the × and the amount of × damage. If we can constantly attack the × diligently, it will not only accumulate small victories into big victories and annihilate small × and weaken big ×, but also boost our people's anti-× sentiment, indirectly benefiting the people's mobilization work.

7. Our ethnic revolutionary tactics increase one point of function and reduce one point of the ×'s ambition to successfully invade China, and we must increase the ×'s anti-war and war-weary emotions by one point, so we must comprehensively and continuously occupy the active position, annihilate the inferior ×, attack the × in transit, harass the × while they are stopped, burn × supplies, and cut off × transportation, so that the × feel that the purpose of invading China cannot be achieved and the war of invading China cannot be quickly concluded. Their war-weariness and anti-war emotions continue to rise, and the invasion plan of their general staff will eventually turn into a bubble.

(2) The Current Situation of Stalemate Between × and Us in the War of Resistance in North China

Since the transfer of the battlefield from Linfen and the change of strategy, the implementation of mobile sports guerrilla warfare, the war situation of the First War Zone, which supports the center of gravity of the War of Resistance in North China, has shifted to a stalemate stage between × and us. This stalemate is not a buffer for the × to stop the offensive, but a continuous failure of the ×'s offensive. In terms of the number of troops, the total number of × troops in China is 32 divisions, and those frequently used in Shanxi are often more than 8 regiments. Recently, there has been a report of two more elite divisions being transferred and arriving in Taiyuan, which shows how actively the × are invading Shanxi. In terms of the number of battles and the number of × army deaths, according to central statistics, there were a total of 322 battles in the country in the second half of February, with a total number of more than 20,000 × casualties. In Shanxi, there were a total of 202 battles, with more than 10,000 × casualties. Since March, the battle statistics for only 13 days have again had 253 battles, which shows the intensity of the mountain battle and the decline of the ×'s offensive power.

Now the form of × me has indeed reached a stalemate stage. This confrontation is due to the decline in the operational capabilities of the × and the increase in our resistance forces. At the same time, the × are oppressing us, trying to expand the × puppet regime: we are also actively preparing to shrink the area and expel the dwarf thieves, 蒈 will explain the current situation of the confrontation between × and us from both military and political aspects:

A. Military Stalemate

The current situation of military stalemate between × and us can be divided into three aspects: troop deployment, combat power, and current combat situation:

1. In terms of troop deployment. The × troops currently in Shanxi have a total of ten and a half divisions, and most of their deployments are based on transportation lines and important cities. They are constantly transferred and defended to confuse our sight and hearing, and build bunkers on the railway lines to consolidate their strongholds and transportation and prevent us from destroying them. It is the arrangement of point-line occupation. The number of our troops is much superior to that of the ×. Their arrangement is that the regular army is distributed in the northeast, northwest, southeast, and west of the anti-war base according to 地 and forms an encirclement around the ×. The guerrillas and self-defense forces penetrate into the occupied area of × and enter and exit the heart of ×. It is the area occupied and the cone-shaped突入 arrangement.

2. In terms of combat power. The actual situation of the army of the invading country has the inevitability of退步 under the situation of lasting time, while the revolutionary army has the inevitability of progress, so the combat power of the × has indeed declined now, and our combat power has indeed increased. The expression of fact. One is that the proportion of casualties in combat is gradually increasing, and the other is that the number of combat failures is gradually increasing. The reasons are as follows: First, in the mountain guerrilla war, the firepower of × is difficult to exert. Second, in the long-term anti-war war, after repeated setbacks, the spirit of the × has been exhausted. Third, the war-weary and anti-war sentiments of the × have increased sharply, and the will to fight has gradually weakened. Fourth, the strength of the × is insufficient to replenish, and most of its troops are mixed with Chinese people. These people are forced to be soldiers, so they have no will to fight and ability.

The above are all for the ×, and the ones on our side are as follows:

一1· The response to the invasion has激增 the ×× psychology of our soldiers and soared their enthusiasm. Second, the effect of strengthening the army's training has unified the understanding and thinking of all officers and soldiers, and gradually moved towards the path of collective action under the premise that the war of resistance is higher than everything else. Third, the promotion of the Four New Educations, by the new replenishment method and the new rule method, gradually strengthens the army from weak to strong, and by the new combat method, the army is gradually able to overcome the strong with the weak. Fourth, the forging of the war of fire has激增 the courage and skills of the soldiers in combat. Fifth, the development of the people's movement and the preliminary establishment of the guerrilla base have gradually made the military and the people one, and gradually completed the power that the × cannot invade.

3. In terms of the current situation of combat, judging from the actual battles, the × are currently attacking in many ways and actively oppressing us, showing the enthusiasm of the offensive. At the same time, they are rushing to build roads at the invaded locations, such as the recent bypassing of the 　Le and Shenchi automobile roads, which seems to have the intention of稳扎稳打, and also shows the determination of the offensive. But in fact, attacks in many ways and failures in many ways show that the企圆 cannot be achieved. And every time they attack, their lower-level officers and soldiers only seek to reach the attack location, but do not seek to expand the results of the war and complete the mission of occupation, fully showing the敷衍 state of 士无斗志.

Our side is using mobile combat methods to continuously attack the × in order to seize the strategic initiative, and use the military, government, and people's combined forces to establish an anti-Japanese guerrilla base area that the × cannot invade, and realize　 room clearance to crush the ×'s offensive purpose, and gradually promote it to shrink the × area and achieve the purpose of annihilating the ×.

B. Political Stalemate

The most difficult point for the Japanese to invade China is the lack of political ruling power. Especially in the × war zone, the development of our political power in the past year has laid the foundation for the anti-Japanese regime in counties and villages and armed the people in counties and villages, making the political power of the × unable to reach the countryside, which further deepens the difficulties and不安 of the ×. Therefore, the × are trying to turn the tide of their ruling power and add a war to our改治 attack. We believe that the weakness of the × is where we aim to attack and can致 the death of the × and strengthen the speed of their collapse, so we actively strengthen the administrative function and develop the people's movement work to strengthen the political struggle. Therefore, the situation of confrontation between × and us in this war zone is more serious in political confrontation than in military affairs.

The current situation of political stalemate between × and us can be divided into two aspects:争取 the people and expanding the regime: First, in the aspect of 争取 the people, the × have about two means to 争取 our people: one is threat, and the other is怀来, the front section of the invasion. Killing, arson, rape, and looting are more threatening than怀柔. Now, because threats have aroused resentment, they are using the weakness of self-interest from our compatriots to deepen怀柔 by means of数骗利诱, and sometimes use threats to help怀柔. The × believe that our compatriots lack national consciousness. Giving them the hope of苟延 lives in a欺　 way will enable them to be slaughtered. There are those who do not accept怀柔. Even more so with the threat method, it can force endurance. How can you know that the怀柔 policy is originally contradictory to the act of invasion, so the expression of the facts,怀柔 is always a statement, always a hope. Not　 when using threats, exceeding the scope of threats. It becomes a kind of mutilation, and in the process of high　怀柔, the general facts of insult and trampling are still constantly occurring, because怀柔 is a kind of deception, and deception cannot last.

Our politics is standing on the position of democracy and freedom, standing on the position of protecting the safety and interests of the people, it is the politics of saving the country, the politics of strengthening the people and saving the people, organizing the people, is based on the requirements of the people's organization, and it is necessary to make the people understand the needs of the organization, our work has gradually embarked on the road of strengthening the people's politics and persuading administration, and has gradually awakened the people's觉怏, so that the people have the belief that the war of resistance will win, and each village has organized救亡 groups and self-defense forces, and the longer the time　长, the more progress will be made.

Second, in the aspect of expanding the regime. The 理势 of the × to expand the puppet regime is one for the expansion of the puppet organization and the other for strengthening the puppet administration. The former uses forced and trained means, and the number of traitors is gradually increasing, but the general traitors have no protection of rights and personality, not only are those who are forced into suffering, but they are all陷入悲观情　之中. The latter's performance is one for the strengthening of the east-bound politics, and its method is to strictly investigate household registration, restrict the freedom of our people, gradually compile自卫团 and皇协军, and implement the "policy of using China to制华." In order to implement the enslaved education, it is倒是非, deceptive　言论, 愚弈 our people, 眩　 international视听. One is to restrict the circulation of our laws to destroy our finances.

(3) The Future Trend of the War of Resistance in North China

The Japanese × invaded China, originally taking the gradualism of不战而胜, and since the July 7th Incident was strongly resisted by us, the threat policy. It cannot continue, and it is more loudly標榜 the intention of conquering China in three months in order to use the policy of a quick battle to make China yield. As soon as the war started, our country held on to the determination to resist to the end and continued to fight and resist strongly. With the continuation of time, the Japanese × felt the crisis that the national strength was insufficient to support the長作戰战, and the高　 sang the tune of conquering Wuhan, that is, it can end the war and subdue China, in order to stimulate its soldiers and　 the morale of its people. Who knows that since Wuhan has fallen, China can not only not yield, but its morale is stronger and its hearts are more enthusiastic. Therefore, the Japanese ×'s aggressive situation is deeply陷入膠着, unable to extricate itself.

### Continuing Fierce Battles in Western and Southern Shanxi; Stability in Hubei and Hunan, Intensified Warfare in Shandong and Henan; Guangxi Militia Elite Deploys Defensively on the Guangdong Border

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 11th] Military intelligence here indicates that the focus of the war remains in Shanxi. Fierce battles have continued in western Shanxi in recent days, and the situation in southern Shanxi is also becoming increasingly tense. However, the enemy's fierce attacks on all fronts are now being surrounded by our forces. We expect a decisive battle to occur within days. Our forces in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui continue to maintain their offensive advantage, and the overall situation is stable.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] According to news from the front lines in western Shanxi, although the Japanese army has captured several locations, their westward advance towards the Yellow River has not been successful. After the Japanese army fell into Lishi, Zhongyang, and Lilin, they advanced towards Junkou military crossing and Sanjiao along the Yellow River. The Japanese army attacked Junkou with a force of 7,000, but because their rear was threatened by the Chinese army, they could not redeploy their vanguard to assist the Japanese army in Liulin. Furthermore, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers attacked Pinglu. The Chinese army eliminated over two thousand enemy soldiers and withdrew from Pinglu after paying a significant price but are now counterattacking, approaching the city walls. According to a letter from Hubei province, the Japanese army in Qianjiang attempted to cross the Dongjing River but ultimately failed.

Bloody Battle on the Western Front

[Minge News Agency, Shilou, 11th] Since the large-scale westward invasion by the enemy in Zhongyang and Lishi, they have attempted to seize Nalin and Dabao, creating a threatening situation. Our units engaged in fierce battles along the Zheng'er-Shangxia Baishan-Shanjia line on the 1st and 3rd. On the 4th and 5th, fierce battles raged for two days and nights on the northern and southern mountains with more than 6,000 enemy soldiers who were surrounded. Although the enemy locked down each mountain pass with intense firepower and carried out continuous bombing raids with eleven aircraft, our troops became increasingly courageous. By dawn on the 6th, the enemy had suffered heavy casualties, with 600-700 killed. The enemy began to waver. We also suffered significant losses. Our officers above the regimental commander level repeatedly charged into the enemy lines, engaging in back-and-forth skirmishes. The enemy aircraft could no longer clearly identify targets and could not recklessly continue bombing, allowing us to defeat and repel them. Currently, we have shifted to an outer line of attack on their flanks and rear, establishing close communication with our right-wing units, and we are determined to inflict another serious blow on the enemy. In other news, fierce battles occurred near Liulin on the 5th, resulting in heavy enemy casualties.

[Also, Shilou, 11th] On the 4th, 50-60 enemy infantrymen, accompanied by two cannons, escorted more than ten large carts past Lijia Gou from Dawu when they were ambushed by our forces. It is estimated that the enemy artillery captain, Narita * and over forty others were killed, more than ten were injured, and several packhorses were lost. The remaining enemy soldiers fled in panic.

[Also, Xiangning, 11th] The enemy in the strongholds of Zhangdian, Anyi, Yuncheng, Wenxi, and Jiexian are once again showing signs of activity, attacking the mountain passes of Zhongtiao Mountain. Fierce battles have occurred in various locations in recent days. The enemy has suffered heavy casualties. On the 6th and 7th, intense artillery battles occurred at Ershili Ridge, destroying several enemy cannons.

Situation in Henan and Shandong

[Xiangning, 10th] The enemy in the Yongji area is largely concentrated in Fenglingdu, attempting to forcibly cross the Yellow River. Our troops are putting up a strong defense, resulting in bloody battles. It is reported that the enemy's Taniguchi division has been reduced by 2,500, and both the Inoue and Shibukawa regimental commanders have been killed in action. The enemy held a memorial service in Linfen on the 5th. Furthermore, the enemy near Linfen is busy with air defense and is digging large-scale air raid shelters in Yao Temple.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] According to reports, the enemy in Shandong has recently launched a large-scale offensive against us, advancing from the Jiaoji Railway to the south, from the Jinpu Railway to the east, and from Linyi to the north. Each force consists of 300, 500-600, and even up to 1,000 soldiers, attempting to attack our southeastern Shandong region. In recent days, our regular army units, in coordination with guerrillas, have intercepted the enemy on multiple routes, engaging in bloody battles with the enemy in northwestern Feixian Mengyin, and in southern and northern Linyi. The enemy has suffered extreme casualties, with bodies strewn all over the ground. The enemy's attempt has been crushed by us. As of the 10th, the fighting is continuing. At the same time, our guerrillas have attacked the Jinpu and Jiaoji railway lines, cutting off traffic at several points.

[Central News Agency, Zhumadian, 10th] A total of 2,000 enemy soldiers with over 20 large and small cannons from the outskirts of Taikang City. A portion of 300-400 soldiers attempted to raid Qingheyi on the 7th, but were routed by our forces. By the afternoon, the enemy retreated towards Taikang.

[Central News Agency, Xiangyang, 10th] Several hundred enemy soldiers with four cannons, having infiltrated from Xinyang, shelled the villages of Wujia Dian on the 4th. On the 5th, 400 additional infantry and cavalry, with four cannons, arrived from Xinyang and fiercely attacked Fengjia Dian. After being met with resistance, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Xinyang. The remainder are being encircled and annihilated by our forces.

Situation in Southern China

[Our Guilin Dispatch, 11th] A certain agency here recently received military news from Shaoguan: (1) A portion of the enemy's army in Jiujiang has been harassing villages near the Jiang-Fo Road in recent days. They were attacked by our guerrillas, resulting in the deaths of thousands of enemy soldiers and the capture of many firearms. (2) On the 7th, over 600 enemy soldiers traveled in over ten cars and searched the areas near Guan Jun and Sanjiang. Our guerrillas intercepted them on all sides, and the enemy could not cope. (3) The enemy troops at Zhongluotan have retreated to Shengang. Approximately one thousand enemy soldiers are currently stationed in Shengang. On the 9th, a small unit of enemy infantry from Shengang went to Baigang for a change of guard. (4) After being attacked by us on the night of the 9th, the enemy at Zengcheng Gehe completely withdrew. There is no longer any trace of them in Fuhe. (5) There is currently one enemy warship near Linghai, but there is no movement.

[Also, Shaoguan, 11th] The situation in southern Guangdong is uncertain. The movements of enemy warships are erratic and mysterious, suggesting a significant enemy plot. In order to be prepared for any eventuality, the authorities have implemented temporary martial law in Gaozhou and Leizhou. All military deployments are properly prepared. Xia Wei, the commander-in-chief of the Sixteenth Army Group, to strengthen the defense of southern Guangdong, has sent the elite Guangxi troops led by Li * and Huang * into Guangdong and mobilized the soldiers and civilians under the jurisdiction of the Gao-Lei Special Defense Zone to be ready for battle. Furthermore, elite militia units from certain districts have been ordered to proceed to the border between Guangdong and Guangxi to establish defensive positions. If there is an alarm, they will immediately block and attack the enemy. The defenses of southern Guangdong are becoming increasingly fortified.

[Central News Agency, Sihui, 10th] On the night of the 6th, a certain unit of our forces launched an attack east of *, completely destroying the newly repaired enemy highway. A portion of the enemy in Jiangmen rushed to attack, but our forces fought bravely and fiercely. The enemy abandoned 50-60 bodies and fled back to Jiangmen. Later, 700-800 enemy soldiers with three tanks launched a surprise attack on Jinzhu on the Jiang-Fo Road. However, after being fiercely attacked by us, a large number of enemy soldiers were killed and one enemy tank was destroyed. The remaining soldiers fled in different directions.

The Japanese side demanded greater political power in the Municipal Council. The authorities of the Public Concession have not only not accepted this request but also refused to consider the issue. The Japanese representative, the consul general in Xiamen, returned to his country by ship two days ago to report on the negotiations and request instructions.

### Nighttime Discussions on Military Strategy at Xiangfan City Wall

— Ye Juesun

Special Contribution to this Newspaper

The enemy's recent actions in the northern Hubei area were within our expectations. I remember that when I met Mr. Li Delin in ×× a month ago, we made a very detailed analysis of the reasons for the enemy's invasion of the Hanshui River basin in mid-March, the comparison of the enemy and our forces, and the possible development of the war on this front in the future. Mr. Li Delin's estimations at that time have become the actual development of the enemy's recent military actions. Seeing the thoroughness of our army's deployment, the abundance of strength, and the enemy's concentrated use of the elite of four divisions to launch a fierce attack, the intensity of the war and the heavy casualties on both sides were within our expectations. However, looking at the enemy's propaganda, claiming to have surrounded dozens of our divisions today and annihilated hundreds of thousands of our troops tomorrow, it is like the storyteller in Xiangguan, exaggerating. Phrases such as "taking the head of a general from a million-strong army is as easy as taking something out of a pocket," and "the broadsword flies, killing people like cutting vegetables" are not only unbelievable but also make people laugh and feel overly comical.

On April 29th, the reporter arrived at ×× to visit the guerrilla cadre training class. Coincidentally, that day was the grand rally of all the teachers and students of the school to send off Dean Tang Enbo to the front line in central Hubei. The event was presided over by the directors of the training class, Bai Chongxi and Chen Cixiu. Liang Hancao, Zhou Enlai, Zhu Yusheng and others were also present. There were songs, plays, and Beijing opera - the atmosphere was very lively and the emotions were extremely high. Especially General Tang Enbo's speech before his departure was very exciting and moving, making me feel that he is not only a loyal and brave general, but also a contemporary genius with a profound understanding and cultivation of political and military strategies. Therefore, it is not a fortuitous coincidence that the recent battles between Sui and Zao counties have achieved results comparable to those of the Battle of Taierzhuang, which was due to objective reasons. In addition, I feel that Zhang Zizhong and his Chief of Staff Mr. Liu Jialuan are both figures who have progressed in the War of Resistance and developed in the struggle, and are highly trusted and loved by the soldiers. The troops who held back the enemy, cut off the enemy's retreat and fought fiercely on the ×××× highways were mostly under the command of Zhang Zizhong. On April 5th, I met with them in Jingmen, an important military town in central Hubei. Although the enemy was constantly firing artillery at the Shayang area on the west bank of the Hanshui River from Duobaowan, Luohansi and other places, pretending to cross the Hanshui River along the Hanyi Highway and take Yichang, General Zhang's headquarters had already begun to move north, crossing the river separately to deploy defenses in advance in the fan-shaped area between ××, ××× to take preemptive action. Because the enemy's strength on the east bank of the Hanshui River at that time was very weak, only two regiments of the Third Division. Comparing the current facts with the estimations at that time shows that the generals' judgment on the enemy's situation was accurate. Only by knowing yourself and knowing your enemy can you win every battle.

Xiangyang and Fancheng face each other across the Hanshui River and were military strongholds for the State of Wei to dominate the Central Plains during the Three Kingdoms period. Taking Xiangfan and then Nanyang to threaten Guanzhong is also an important strategic attempt of the enemy today, but the lack of their own strength and the many difficulties in the objective environment ultimately make the empty promises of the Japanese warlords a distress that is difficult to satisfy. I remember one night a month ago, when the bright moon was in the sky, shining on the quietly flowing headwaters of the Hanshui River, we were talking with General Li Zongren about the war situation. He believed that the enemy had mobilized a total of about fourteen divisions to the battlefields in China, which can be said to have reached the enemy's highest mobilization saturation. However, these thirty-odd divisions were scattered at various points in the country, just like stones thrown into the sea, and their effect was extremely weak. Taking the north and south banks of the Yangtze River as an example, except for a few important strongholds along the highway or along the river, most of the rest have been recovered by our guerrillas. Since it is impossible to hold on to the positions, it is naturally even more difficult to attack. In the four or five months since the withdrawal from Wuhan, the enemy has not been able to take any action. In this way, on the one hand, it will arouse the international community's doubts about the enemy's strength, and on the other hand, it is also afraid that political changes will take place at home, so it is difficult to advance or retreat, and it is only like a tired ox dragging a heavy cart deeper and deeper into the mire. The result is that they gain here but lose there, and the deeper they go, the more difficult it becomes. Finally, General Li Zongren also said very firmly: "Japanese imperialists will inevitably bring destruction upon themselves by committing many unrighteous acts, and will eventually follow in the footsteps of Germany's disastrous defeat in the European War of 1914."

The reporter's personal view is that the war in northern Hubei is still a kind of offensive defense war. On the one hand, it can be said that it is advancing towards Xiangfan in two ways, attempting to achieve the goal of annihilating the main force with an outer encirclement. On the other hand, it is also a defensive war to protect Wuhan and consolidate strongholds, because it is easier for the enemy to use Wuhan as a transportation center for transportation and supply. After the enemy captured Zhongxiang, Jingshan and other places in March, they built strong fortifications and left a small number of troops to guard these newly built military strongholds, and then divided their forces to assist the troops on the southern line in attacking Nanchang. Therefore, while the enemy is trying to attack Xiangfan, we will never neglect that the enemy's shameless broadcasting machine in Changsha has been barking wildly there, saying that they will take Nanchang in March and Changsha in April. Now the facts tell us that this ridiculous exaggeration has been shattered by the great spirit of our heroic soldiers.

### British Demands to Enemy to Stop Anti-British Movement: British Consul-General in Shanghai Lodges Protest Regarding the Linchang Factory and Ding Keler Incident

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai News: British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Phillips, today lodged a written protest with the Enemy Consulate regarding the Linchang Factory and Mr. Ding Keler's death, demanding the Enemy side promptly stop the anti-British movement, and specifically stated the following:

(1) Anti-British thugs active near the Linchang Factory should be immediately driven away;

(2) The Enemy side should assign personnel to protect workers of all nationalities residing in the Linchang Factory;

(3) Anti-British thugs near the Linchang Factory's Pudong printing factory should be severely punished;

(4) The anti-British movement in the Pudong area should be stopped immediately;

(5) All anti-British demonstrations and parades in Pudong should be disbanded;

(6) Posting of anti-British slogans should be prohibited;

(7) The Great People's Association, the center of the anti-British movement, should be disbanded;

The British protest repeatedly explained the circumstances under which the Linchang Factory was forced to cease operations due to the impact of the anti-British movement, and that the Enemy-controlled Xin Shenbao published anti-British text on the 7th of this month, which led to the assault on British expatriates. Mr. Ding Keler was killed on that day. Finally, the British Consul-General stated that the British side will also ban anti-Enemy movements within the Public Concession.

### Enemy Aircraft Raids Chongqing Yesterday: Two Enemy Aircraft Shot Down by Our Forces

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] At around 7:00 PM on the 11th, 27 Enemy aircraft raided Chongqing. When the Enemy aircraft approached Chongqing airspace, they encountered our Air Force in a fierce battle. Immediately after penetrating the city airspace, our high-altitude units launched a fierce bombardment. The Enemy aircraft, not daring to linger, hastily dropped their bombs and fled. Our aircraft immediately followed in pursuit, safely returning to base only after reaching a certain location. According to eyewitnesses, two Enemy aircraft were shot down by our forces, but the wreckage is still being searched for.

### Jin Enemy Puppet Army Defected at Midnight: Jin Enemy Suspicious of Puppet Army Commanders, Most Have Been Beheaded and Shown to the Public

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 11th] Over 180 puppet troops stationed in Jincheng Fort, Linfen, led by their platoon leader, Yang, killed the troupe leader who willingly served the enemy on the night of the 5th, and then defected with all their equipment, surrendering to a certain unit of our forces. The local people were overjoyed at the news and sent wine, meat, paper, cigarettes, etc. to express their respect. Platoon Leader Yang then made a passionate speech in public, filled with emotion and tears. He has now been incorporated into a certain unit to await orders to kill the enemy.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 11th] After the defection of the puppet army in southern Linfen, the various towns of Yishi, Wanquan, and Ronghe are now under our army's control. The enemy can only be besieged in the dead cities, not daring to step outside. The enemy forces in the area of Hejin, learning from past mistakes, are highly suspicious of the local puppet army. Xia Qingan, the commander of the puppet army in Hejin, was lured to Dongquan by the enemy and killed. When the reporter was traveling from Hejin to Xikou, he found a human head on the electric pole when he was passing through Fangpo. There was a list for public display written in black on white cloth, listing the names of Pei Beihu and Ding Yinhai. These two were both puppet army commanders favored by the enemy in the past, but now they have both been beheaded. This serves as a warning to traitors.

### The Situation in the British Concession in Tianjin Deteriorates: The Enemy Actively Deploying a Blockade: The British Make Concessions but the Enemy Remains Dissatisfied

[Reuters, Tianjin, 11th] The local Chinese Association here discussed the local situation last night and decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting a serious consideration of the current situation in Tianjin. According to authoritative sources, the British authorities have not received a final ultimatum from the Japanese side, but if certain circumstances are not intervened in, the British Concession will likely be blockaded on the 14th and 15th. At present, most of the Japanese-owned companies in the British Concession have already withdrawn.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] News from Tianjin indicates that the Japanese side will implement a blockade of the British Concession on the 14th, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. As a result, the patrol force in the British Concession has also suddenly increased. Furthermore, Yokohama Specie Bank officially announced today that it will officially cease business operations starting next week.

British Have Handed Over Criminals: The Enemy Remains Dissatisfied

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tianjin News: The British Concession authorities have handed over two suspects, Wang Qi and * * *, involved in the so-called bomb plot to the Enemy side. However, the Enemy believes that the two are not related to the assassination of Cheng Xigeng and remains dissatisfied, saying that the British side is not sincere. According to reports, the two were arrested earlier this month, both aged 21, and the case is not serious. None of the assassinations that have occurred in the past in Peiping and Tianjin have involved the use of bombs. General observation indicates that the British side is taking this compromise measure because our attitude is strong.

Our Side Negotiating with the British Side to Prevent the Handover of Chinese Citizens

[Central News Agency, Dianqing, 10th] Recent reports that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin, at the request of the Japanese side, handed over Chinese citizens within the Concession to the Japanese Consulate has aroused considerable attention from various parties. The reporter inquired about the situation with the diplomatic authorities. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the sake of the safety of our people in the British Concession in Tianjin, has repeatedly and solemnly negotiated with the British side to ensure proper protection. However, according to previous reports, some of the Chinese citizens detained in the Concession were about to be handed over by the Concession authorities to the Japanese side or puppet organizations. We have repeatedly negotiated with the British Embassy and instructed Ambassador Guo to request the British government to seriously consider this and order a stop to it. Recently, it was reported that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin received a final ultimatum from the Japanese side, demanding the handover of four people whom the Japanese side considered to be related to the assassination of Cheng Xigeng within a specified time limit. The British government has decided to telegraph the Concession authorities to extradite the aforementioned two people. Our side has again repeatedly made serious representations to the British Embassy and telegraphed Ambassador E to the British government, explaining that our side attaches great importance to this matter and urging it to reject the Japanese side's demands.

### Foreign Correspondents Report on the Current Situation in the Guerrilla Areas of North China: Our Guerrilla Strongholds Are Scattered Everywhere: The Enemy Increases Troops Again and Again But Has No Way to Deal With It

Border Region Government

The largest independent region in China is located in the vast mountainous region west of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, comprising parts of the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Hebei, forming a tight alliance. It has a population of 14 million. The region once included the entire central Hebei area. In the early days of the Japanese invasion in 1937, most of the local governments were destroyed. In the period after the Japanese troops retreated or passed through, administration fell into complete chaos. In early 1938, representatives from various regions that had not been directly occupied by the Japanese troops held a meeting in Tang County, a small town near the border with Shanxi west of Baoding, and organized what they called a district government, taking over the administrative power of the areas that were still independent. This was a mobile government, acting according to the policy of responding to the frequent incursions of the Japanese troops. After about half a year of war, the government was able to consolidate its position and gradually restore order in the counties. Last November, a large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived in North China, and launched a large-scale offensive from east to west, that is, from the Peiping-Hankou Railway and the Dongpu Railway, in order to suppress central Hebei. After repeated battles lasting about five months, the Japanese troops finally captured the towns and cities on the south bank of the Yellow River that were about halfway through. However, after discovering the pattern of advancing and then retreating after their offensives, they did not achieve satisfactory results and decided to change their strategy and began to station troops in larger towns and cities in central Hebei. As a result, about 50,000 reinforcements continued to arrive in North China in March and April, flooding into an even larger area. However, due to the vastness of the land and the scarcity of troops, there were still not enough troops to allocate, so even with reinforcements, it cannot be said that central Hebei has been effectively occupied.

Guerrilla Warfare

The guerrillas still hold on to the countryside, hiding in the vast plains in hundreds of villages scattered like stars. Before leaving, the guerrillas had demolished the walls of most of the towns and cities, so the Japanese troops could only defend themselves behind barbed wire obstacles, and appeared unstable. In the surrounding areas, they had no power to speak of. Even if the Japanese troops had occupied a city, they had no control over the countryside. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find someone to carry out any kind of local administration. When the Japanese troops approach a city, the people are ordered to leave, and only the local ruffians remain, working under the direction of the Japanese troops. This is a dangerous and difficult job, as they are captured and executed by the guerrillas. The farmers in the surrounding areas no longer bring agricultural products into the now desolate cities, so the Japanese troops have to transport all their supplies from the nearest railway stations. The guerrillas dig ditches six feet deep across the roads, which greatly hinders truck transport. The supply of raw cotton, which was one of the purposes of the Japanese invasion of North China, has also become a pipe dream. The former guerrillas have been urging farmers not to grow cotton anymore, leading to a reduction of about 80% in the amount of cotton. According to the current policy, it is difficult to understand how the Japanese troops can hope to establish an effective administrative organ, to manage affairs in the entire North China region, and to restore peace and order in the interior. The actions previously taken by the Japanese troops, and still continuing to be taken in the invasion of other parts of the interior, to destroy villages and blame the guerrillas, can only increase the chaos, force more people to join the guerrillas, and greatly increase the difficulty of the Japanese troops' supply and transportation. The recent plan to station troops in all the occupied towns and cities in the interior, if properly implemented, may be more effective, but to do so with insufficient military strength is worse than useless. In any case, the Japanese troops have still failed to dominate the vast mountainous areas. Some experts believe that the Japanese troops must redeploy at least 500,000 more troops in order to suppress North China, but the Japanese troops do not seem willing to do so. Therefore, it is difficult to predict when and how the Japanese troops will be able to complete this task. (Sent on May 15th)

### 禮榆：The Reason for the Sharp Contraction of the Black Market Exchange Rate

Although the exchange rate quoted by HSBC Bank the day before yesterday still maintained its usual benchmark, it actually suspended supply, resulting in various rumors and a surge in buying interest. Within a single day, it contracted from eight and a quarter pence to around seven pence. As for the reasons for the sharp contraction, there were various rumors in the market. Some said that the 20 million pound foreign exchange fund established in March had already been used up. Others said that allied newspapers would no longer be willing to supply foreign exchange. Such malicious propaganda filled the market. This is indeed a deliberate attempt to undermine the legal tender, and the remarks of speculators who have ulterior motives are absolutely not to be believed.

Regarding the foreign exchange fund issue, according to the most malicious estimates from the Japanese side, approximately 1.5 million pounds must be supplied each month to maintain the level of eight and a quarter pence. Therefore, when the fund was established, the Japanese side expressed the opinion that although a 10 million pound fund could be maintained for seven or eight months, the foreign exchange fund has only been established for more than two months. Even according to the malicious estimates of the Japanese side, there is absolutely no reason for it to be used up. Therefore, such rumors are really not worth believing.

The close commercial relationship between the British, American, and other allied countries and China will definitely not allow the decline in the exchange rate of legal tender to affect their trade with China, especially Britain, which is even more concerned. Many facts in the past have been sufficient to prove Britain's enthusiasm for supporting the legal tender, and the establishment of the foreign exchange fund is even more sufficient to demonstrate its determination to safeguard Far Eastern interests. Since the commercial interests of the allied countries are completely consistent with China's interests, and China's War of Resistance has signs of turning defeat into victory, then the allied countries will definitely be willing to continue to maintain the legal tender. Therefore, such rumors are completely beyond the scope of common sense.

As for the real reason for the sharp contraction in the exchange rate, it is really the malicious propaganda and conspiracy policies to undermine the legal tender.

Recently, Japanese banknotes have flooded the Shanghai market, and prices have fallen. At the lowest point, 89 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 100 Japanese yen. This is clearly a manifestation of the weakness of Japan's economic power. Although Japan nominally claims to be a victorious country, it has already shown that it cannot compete with China economically. Japan knows that this is an exposure of its weaknesses, which is also a sign of China's long-term victory in the War of Resistance. Therefore, it must find a way to cover it up and try to make the credit of the Japanese yen higher than that of the legal tender. However, although they have used various means to curb the decline of the Japanese yen, they have ultimately failed to reverse the decline. Although the Japanese yen once recovered to 95 yuan (the price per 100 Japanese yen), it fell again to 91 yuan the day before yesterday. They know that the credit of the Japanese yen is not easy to restore, so they changed direction and attacked the legal tender, hoping to relatively restore the status of the Japanese yen after the price of the legal tender falls.

At the same time, although the "Huaxing Bank" officially started business on May 16, because of the consolidation of the credit of the legal tender, the so-called "Huaxing coupons" could not gain a foothold. From the date of commencement of business to the end of May, the total amount of Huaxing coupons issued was only 220,000 yuan, and all of them were used to requisition materials from the people in the occupied areas. Its shadow has never been seen in the concession. The Japanese side knew that this plan was not working, and because of the stability of the exchange rate of the legal tender, they planned to attack the legal tender again to indirectly support the "Huaxing coupons".

Because of the above two reasons, the Japanese side has recently used the legal tender it has collected (which was exchanged for "United Bank coupons" and military scrip) to heavily speculate on foreign exchange. From the Chinese side, since the establishment of the foreign exchange fund, there should have been more than enough to cope with it. However, during this wartime, the importance of foreign exchange is greater than in the past. If we allow the Japanese side to take it arbitrarily, it is tantamount to arming the enemy. In order to maintain China's vitality and prevent Japan's conspiracy, we have to limit the supply of foreign exchange. This is a means of defending the legal tender, which is not only harmless to the credit of the legal tender, but also can consolidate the foundation of the legal tender.

From the above situation, we can know that the credit of the legal tender is not a problem at all. The decline in the black market exchange rate is really a conspiracy of those who deliberately undermine the legal tender. If everyone recognizes that the legal tender is the foundation of their own interests, they should remain calm, observe the truth of the matter, and not be misled by rumors, so as not to disrupt the credit of the legal tender and destroy our own defenses.

Short Commentary

### On "Eliminating Depraved Customs"

Yesterday, the newspaper reported that "Overseas Chinese will jointly petition the authorities to eliminate depraved customs and ban tour guide agencies." It is said that the number of existing tour guide agencies is in the hundreds, and the number of female tour guides is in the thousands... Since then, the business of geishas and prostitutes has paled in comparison... It is of great importance to social morality." However, what is even more serious is: "In the past, prostitution was banned to improve social morality, but now a phenomenon of leading people into lewdness and depravity has been discovered in Hong Kong, and its harm is thousands of times greater than that of public and private prostitutes!"

This serious problem is naturally a socio-economic problem, and therefore all reformist methods may not be able to achieve a truly thorough solution. But what is particularly noteworthy is that this phenomenon has suddenly become serious since the Japanese launched a large-scale attack on our country. Therefore, we cannot but feel resentment towards those who run the business of leading people into depravity, and we cannot but feel regret towards those who forget the national crisis and family hatred and only know how to play and indulge. As for the women who are forced to work as "tour guides," we can only give them the sympathy and pity that compatriots deserve!

The petition of the overseas Chinese is not only for maintaining the reputation of Hong Kong, but also for upholding the reputation of the Chinese people, especially Chinese women. We hope that this movement will be successful. We also hope that this problem will be solved more thoroughly, not only to prevent these thousands of women from turning into disguised scapegoats who suffer and suffer, but also to enable them to have happy and independent work and become righteous, free, and independent people, working for the liberation of China, for themselves, and for the country!

### British Public Opinion Clearly States a Solemn Attitude Demanding the Maintenance of the Peace Front Eden's Speech Elaborates

[Reuters, London, 10th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech to Conservative Party demonstrators near Warwick today that since Britain has decided to organize a peace front, the government authorities must not hesitate. Eden went on to warn that all non-aggressive countries, regardless of their political system, should be included in the peace front, otherwise it would be the most unwise move. When discussing the Soviet Union, Eden said, "Although we do not like communism, the fact that the Soviet Union is a non-aggressive country and does not seek to expand its territory should not be denied."

[Reuters, London, 10th] Minister for Coordination of Defence, Chatfield, said in a speech in Cleeves, Scotland, today, "If we unfortunately have to fight again, the reason will be for glory and justice, which is what all our compatriots believe is right." Chatfield continued, "Although Britain is actively preparing for defense, no one should be under the illusion that war is inevitable. We now have some new responsibilities. Our attitude has changed from 'worrying about the weak' to 'helping the weak'. If Britain concludes an agreement with other countries, it will also be announced to make its purpose clear to the world."

[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] "The German government, encouraged by Ribbentrop, still firmly believes that Britain is unwilling to go to war. This fact and the speeches of Halifax and Chamberlain are the biggest crisis in the current serious European situation." The above words are a report from the "Daily Telegraph" Paris correspondent, which can also reflect the attitude of French people towards Zhang and Ha's public speeches when they once again put forward new suggestions to the Soviet Union. The newspaper also said that Chamberlain and others' expressions of emotion have been generally approved, but they fear that the German side will misunderstand that Britain's determination has been shaken. Even British officials have voiced criticism. The Labor Party demands an explanation as to whether Chamberlain wants to restore his policy of compromise, but people close to the Prime Minister say that the purpose of this speech is to reduce the stimulating effect on Berlin of Britain's new proposals to the Soviet Union, as Britain has now fully accommodated the Soviet Union's point of view.

(Haitong News Agency, London, 10th) This morning, the "Yorkshire Post" commented that the compromising tone used in the recent speeches of Chamberlain and Halifax was not only displeasing to the opposition, but also to some people who supported the government. The opposition is deeply afraid that Sterling's dispatch to the Soviet Union will cause adverse reactions. The Conservative Party criticized the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, saying that publishing these remarks at this time was, at the very least, inappropriate. The newspaper also said that Chamberlain and Halifax should not have made such remarks at this time, so as not to increase the difficulties of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The Labor Party will demand an explanation in the House of Commons as to whether the government's recent declaration indicates that it is abandoning the new anti-aggression policy and restoring the old "compromise policy".

[Reuters, London, 10th] Chamberlain said in a speech in his hometown of Birmingham that he firmly believed that the whole country could support his current policy. In order to seek the safety of the country, he had adopted two parallel and different policies: striving to eliminate the crisis of war and building national strength, so that when discussing conditions with any country in the future to resolve disputes, he would not be forced to accept conditions that were not honorable or detrimental to our survival interests. Regarding the first part of this dual policy, Chamberlain said that he had hoped to reach an understanding with some countries, but had repeatedly retreated due to disappointment. As for the second part of the policy, namely national defense work, there has been rapid progress, and any powerful country will find it difficult to match Britain. People all over the world also know that we will never use this power to provoke anyone, although there are those who hope to disturb public opinion with propaganda, but facts speak louder than words. What we resolutely resist is the ambition to dominate Europe, because we believe that once such an ambition succeeds, there will never be a day for peace in Europe. However, Britain will still not give up the first part of its policy advocacy, and Chamberlain continued to describe his attempts to resolve disputes peacefully and hope to witness its success.

### The British King and Queen are on a Tour in the United States and are Warmly Welcomed Wherever They Go Yesterday Was a Day of Rest on Sunday

[Reuters, New York, 10th] After visiting the British Pavilion today, the British King and Queen appeared on the lawn, where there were many invited guests. The King looked tired, while the Queen did not show any signs of fatigue. Many British, Canadian, West Indian and American veterans stood solemnly when the British King and Queen appeared. The King stepped forward to talk to one or two old, white-haired veterans, and then drove to Columbia University, where there were many welcomers, some of whom had been waiting all day for the King to pass by. Upon arrival at Columbia University, the President gave them a warm reception and delivered a welcoming speech. Afterwards, the King and Queen returned to President Roosevelt's residence in Hyde Park. They will not go out on Sunday to rest.

[Reuters, New York, 10th] The British King and Queen landed on Manhattan Island, New York, on the destroyer "Warrington" that day. The enthusiastic welcome from the people was "more grand than when Lindbergh returned victoriously." Governor Lehman introduced the members of the welcoming committee and New York Mayor LaGuardia to the King. The King warmly shook hands with everyone as a courtesy. The military band first played "God Save the King" and then played the American national anthem. More than 100,000 people welcomed them outside the port. The King rode in the first car, followed by a convoy of twelve cars, and 42 police motorcycles and bicycles led the way. New Yorkers scattered pieces of paper on the skyscrapers, which is a local tradition. The situation was very lively. From the port to the World's Fair, the roads were crowded with joyous crowds. It is estimated that 4 million people gathered on the street in the scorching heat of 90 degrees to see the King's appearance. In addition to plainclothes detectives, there were 15,000 police officers maintaining order. The enthusiasm of the people was unprecedented. The most prominent in the welcoming crowd was the appearance of millions of children, who waved British and American flags to attract the attention of the two Majesties. This enthusiasm was finally rewarded. The Queen smiled and nodded frequently, and the King also raised his hand to salute continuously. An hour before the two Majesties arrived in the city, the World's Fair was already packed. The enthusiastic situation was only seen since the opening of the meeting. Police were stationed at every passageway. After getting out of the car, the King and Queen took the elevator directly to the third floor to be received in the Perisphere Hall. The King and Queen met with the directors of various pavilions and the main officials of the New York City government in the hall. After having lunch in the Federal Building, the two Majesties toured the Irish and Canadian pavilions. When the two Majesties were approaching the British Pavilion, fireworks were set off, and thousands of British and American flags were hung on small parachutes. Boy Scouts and children scrambled to pick them up as souvenirs. According to the police chief, more than 3 million people witnessed the welcoming ceremony, which was the most enthusiastic since Lindbergh's return across the Atlantic in 1927.

[Reuters, London, 10th] A Glasgow newspaper today published a color photograph of the British King and Queen touring the United States, transmitted by radio, on its front page. This is the first time a photograph of the King's visit to the United States has been published in Britain. The picture shows US President Roosevelt welcoming the King and Queen in Washington, transmitted from 3,000 miles away.

[Reuters, Washington Port, 10th] Newsreels and photos of the British King and Queen's arrival in New York have been transported to London by a "Yankee Clipper." The plane left here at 7:33 pm tonight (standard time) on its fourth transatlantic flight. The plane carries 25,500 feet of newsreels and 1,900 photos of the British King and Queen's arrival in New York and visit to the World's Fair. The "Yankee Clipper" is expected to arrive in Marseille on Sunday afternoon. The newsreels can then be transported by plane to various European capitals, so that they can be shown in theaters that evening, and newspapers can also publish them on Monday morning.

Editorial
Relief for Unemployed Teachers in War Zones

How to overcome the new difficulties in the new stage of the War of Resistance to win the final victory? How to cultivate the power of national rebirth to lay the foundation for future national construction and national revival? This is the most serious question in the current Chinese liberation movement, and it is also the most urgent and important task for the entire Chinese nation. To perfectly solve these problems and thoroughly complete these tasks, the key lies in promoting and thoroughly realizing the total mobilization of the spiritual and material resources of the entire nation, and in universally and practically conserving and cultivating the future builders of our country and nation. Here, we urgently need ten thousand, hundred thousand propagandists, organizers, trainers, and leaders! The position and task of primary and secondary school teachers and vocational instructors are particularly important.

However, in the 23 months of the War of Resistance, not only have the majority of teacher training institutions been unable to continue to exist, resulting in a shortage of a large number of teachers who meet the new needs of the War of Resistance and national construction, but also due to the lack of overall preparation before the War of Resistance and the lack of an overall plan and unified steps after the War of Resistance, many of the original teachers have also abandoned their positions as the war zone expanded, becoming unemployed, wounded, killed, and displaced under the enemy's artillery fire. As for the teachers in the occupied areas, in addition to those who have directly joined the anti-Japanese and anti-traitor teams, the majority have been subjected to the lewd power of the enemy and traitors. Besides being utilized, imprisoned, and killed, many have also been displaced. The Third National Education Conference, in view of this, had a central resolution on relieving unemployed teachers in war zones, and recent reports have stated that some areas in the Northwest are carrying out all active relief work, and Jiangsu Province also promulgated measures to relieve unemployed teachers in war zones a few days ago, and the Guangdong Provincial authorities seem to have been carrying out registration work for relieving unemployed children and primary school teachers in Hong Kong for some time. In addition to pointing out that it is necessary to simultaneously pay attention to cultivating a large number of new cadres and new teachers who meet the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction, we should also regard relieving unemployed teachers in war zones, occupied areas, and overseas refugees as the most important cause at present.

However, we must also pay attention at the same time: Firstly, this work is a major task of the entire nation based on the new needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance and national construction. It is not just a passive relief, but should be an active organization and training. Therefore, in addition to conducting a larger-scale registration and investigation, we must also actively prepare for the establishment of these organizations and training institutions for teachers, and teach them the basic knowledge that meets the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction, such as national unity, long-term resistance, the Three Principles of the People for national construction, and wartime education programs, methods, and approaches that adapt to special circumstances, as well as wartime service methods, etc. Secondly, this work should be carried out universally and practically in war zones, occupied areas, the rear, and even overseas. On the one hand, it is necessary to adapt to the special conditions of different regions, and on the other hand, there must be a consistent spirit and unified leadership, that is, not to violate the revolutionary principles of the Three Principles of the People and the leadership of the united front. In addition, in terms of methods, we must follow the leadership of the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek and the relevant authorities, and at the same time call on leaders in the education and cultural circles and famous figures from Chinese and foreign society to jointly assist in carrying out the work.

### Britain and France Drafting New Plan Bringing to Moscow to Let the Soviet Side Choose

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Regarding the issue of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British government has drafted a new plan and is preparing to hand it over to Sterling, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to bring to Moscow. In order to inquire about the views of the French authorities beforehand, French Ambassador Corbin notified the French Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 10th that the French government, on the whole,

[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The opinions and criticisms put forward in the British Foreign Office's reply to the Soviet Union are being carefully studied. The French side will decide its attitude later and will notify the British government. In addition, the British Foreign Office representative Sterling, after arriving in Moscow, will propose several plans to the Soviet side in order to solve the Baltic Sea problem, and the Soviet side will choose one of them.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] Haitong News Agency has learned that the draft tripartite agreement will be returned to London today, together with the revised draft proposed by the French Foreign Office. The draft agreement includes the British proposal that the Soviet Union can declare its "important interests" to be the security of the Baltic countries. It is heard that the French side agrees with the British proposal, that is, to put forward multiple methods for the Soviet Union to choose from, to see which one is the most suitable way for its opinion of guaranteeing the Baltic countries. French Foreign Minister Bonnet also met with Soviet Ambassador Lyszy, informing him that the proposed amendments and the draft will be notified to Moscow at the weekend. According to today's "News Chronicle", several cabinet members advocate selecting a cabinet member to go to the Soviet Union instead of the Foreign Office expert Sterling, but Sterling will definitely go to Moscow. According to the latest plan, Mr. Sterling will fly to the Soviet capital via the Swedish capital on Monday and arrive in the evening.

### Beneš Sends Note to League of Nations Protesting German and Hungarian Occupation of Territory Demanding League of Nations Preside Over Justice

[Haitong News Agency, Geneva, 11th] Yesterday, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol received a declaration from Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and a note from former Czech President Beneš to the League of Nations and the Soviet Union. Mr. Xi's declaration stated that, due to legal prohibitions, he was unable to read Yuan Ness's note at the last League of Nations meeting. Today, on behalf of the Soviet government, he requested that the League of Nations notify all member states of this note. In the note, Mr. Yuan protested against Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and Hungary's armed invasion of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, saying that this not only violated the rights and interests of the Czech people, but also harmed the authority and responsibility of the League of Nations, and that such incidents were intolerable to him. Therefore, he requested the Chairman of the League of Nations to propose to the Executive Council to consider the steps to resolve this matter. Mr. Bei also said that although he had no right to make proposals to the League of Nations, he had represented Czechoslovakia in supporting the League of Nations and maintaining world peace for 17 years, so this action was not illegal.

### The European Situation — Special Correspondence from Our London Office — (Part 1)

— Uncle Di

——British-Soviet Negotiations——British-German Relations——British-French and German-Italian Relations——The Struggle for Spain——The Balkans——Hesitation——British-Turkish Agreement——Greece——Romania——Yugoslavia——

After Litvinov's resignation, the British-Soviet negotiations, which had been constantly overshadowed by uncertainty, loosened. Now, the Soviet representative originally scheduled to attend the Geneva conference, the current Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin, suddenly suspended his planned trip a few days ago. Thus, the cooperation talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, which had progressed to a considerable extent, were temporarily shelved. Judging from the current situation, it is unlikely that these negotiations will be genuinely emphasized again in the near future.

This shelving of British-Soviet negotiations is actually just a phenomenon, a result, and by no means a cause. What is the reason for it? There are two main and direct reasons: First, on the surface, it is due to the recent establishment of the British-Turkish agreement. From the British perspective, it has completely dismantled the foundation for a future British-Soviet alliance. Now, most of the countries surrounding the Soviet Union have mutual or unilateral assistance agreements with Britain. In Britain's view, this has already demonstrated complete sincerity in cooperating with the Soviet Union. As for further solidifying the alliance relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union through a treaty, that is just a matter of procedure. However, Britain does not feel it is necessary to go through this procedure at the moment, as it has not made the greatest determination to strike against the global aggressor states. From the Soviet perspective, because Potemkin recently made a trip to the Balkan Peninsula and Poland, he has confirmed the trust of various countries in the Soviet Union. Therefore, now that the surrounding countries have formed alliances with Britain, the Soviet Union does not need to rush into an alliance with Britain. Therefore, Britain has become complacent and the Soviet Union has become slack. Second, on the darker side, recently within Britain, because Mussolini delivered a relatively peaceful speech in Turin, the forces of appeasement towards Germany have regained momentum. They are still hoping that the current government will make another attempt to negotiate with Germany, using some possible concessions as conditions for Hitler to accept "peace," and asking him to specifically propose them. Therefore, the current British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, received orders to immediately present two points to the German authorities: (1) If Germany genuinely hopes for peace, then it should quickly propose it now that Britain is "willing to listen"; (2) Otherwise, in his "personal" view, Britain is now in a completely superior international military position against Germany. Therefore, when Britain, in essence, has become complacent, and on the surface, it is deliberately creating a vibrant atmosphere, constantly proclaiming negotiations for British-Soviet cooperation, while on the other hand, it is conducting behind-the-scenes negotiations with Germany to bargain for concessions, at this time, for the sake of diplomatic maneuvering, the Soviet Union adopted the tactic of Potemkin suddenly suspending his trip to Geneva.

As a result, British-Soviet negotiations have been temporarily shelved. Along with this, the entire European situation has also eased for a short period. However, everyone should immediately pay close attention: On the other hand, the British and Soviet authorities have therefore fallen into a tense trap: Is the possibility of a Soviet-German clash progressing again? Like a poisonous sore, this question is currently firmly gnawing at the hearts of those in Britain and France who advocate appeasement.

Therefore, in the past few days, British and French public opinion has been vigorously pressuring the government, and the government has had no choice but to quickly take steps to reassure the Soviet Union.

This is one of the most important items in the talks between Halifax and Bonnet in Paris.

These are the most important trends in Europe at the moment. But in this matter, we encounter a problem: Why? Since Britain and France only hope to maintain a detached and consistent stance with the Soviet Union, mainly to bargain with Germany and Italy, why do they become so anxious at the mere hint of German expansion?

The most urgent point in answering this question at present lies in the tension in the Mediterranean situation. Therefore, the eyes of all of Europe are focused on the evolving situation in the Mediterranean.

### Do You Agree with Japan's Treaty Under Duress?

Not long ago, the Shanghai-based "Millard's Review" published an open letter from a reader. In that letter, the reader—nationality unknown—for the sake of prudence regarding the future of the Sino-Japanese War, proposed a set of basic conditions for Sino-Japanese reconciliation, a total of thirty-three articles, a grand sight to behold. Although some of the content seems a bit wishful thinking, undoubtedly, most of it is sufficient to represent the general public opinion of the world.

Once, when the European situation was tense, the diplomatic representatives of six countries went to see Mussolini. They waited in the living room first. After a while, the door of the living room opened, and a "whoosh" sound slowly came. They silently looked towards the door.

"Good morning, everyone." By the time the six representatives turned around, Mussolini was already standing behind them like an Egyptian god. However, there was no trace of the door at all.

After finishing the conversation, old man Mo said, "Thank you, everyone, I will give you a reply at ten minutes to four in the afternoon."

At 3:50, the six diplomatic representatives walked into that living room again. After a while, the door opened again, and the "whoosh" sound came again. However, the six representatives were clear this time and stared at the wall opposite them.

"Good afternoon, everyone." The six representatives quickly turned around, but Mussolini was already smiling and standing at the door.

### A Small Problem

In the autumn of 1933, a British antiquarian named Peden took his female secretary Ruth to Rome for a trip. One afternoon, the two were strolling on the Piazza Venezia when Ruth accidentally fell. When she got up, she saw an ancient coin under a stone that she had kicked away. Peden took it back to the hotel and carefully studied it. He saw that one side had two blades of grass; the other side had the image of an emperor, and the inscription "46 B.C." was still faintly visible. This was incredible. Ancient coins from before the Common Era are rarely seen. Peden took it back to London, and later sold it to the New York Museum for $400,000, which Peden and Ruth split equally.

The above is a story, believe it or not. However, there may be some extremely obvious errors in it. Can you find them? If you can't find them, let us tell you tomorrow.

General Zhu Taro: Oh no, it's the guerrillas again? Quick, stop them!

### Weather Forecast

Since this is adorned with the guise of a "Weather Forecast," as the name suggests, we must talk about the weather. The Hong Kong Observatory predicts today's weather as: southwest wind, light and gentle, occasional gusts, dense mist, occasional showers. This means that today there will be both wind and rain. Anyway, in these days, the summer rain is continuous without a set date. If you want to go out, please learn from Mr. so-and-so's ingenuity and carry an umbrella; it won't hurt you. Also, it is best not to show off your white leather shoes.

Opening the calendar, I know that today is an auspicious day, and I think there should be many lovers getting married, "We are in love, and we will get married on the twelfth of last month." If a friend of yours is having a wedding, don't forget to reciprocate with a gift; don't forget to visit and offer your congratulations; and, even more so, don't forget to say, "I'll be back next year to eat wedding eggs."

### Yunlin West Claws

Pickpockets in Moscow are exceptionally skilled, especially against foreign tourists. Wallets and money in their pockets are often lost, and small items such as small cameras and suitcases in their hands can disappear in crowded places.

Once, a foreign tourist passed through Moscow. He had long heard of the name of the pickpocket Kui Keko. He specially put a note in his pocket that read: "The one who steals this note is a pig pickpocket." When he went out for a walk and returned to the hostel, he found that the note had not been stolen, but a line of annotations had been added on the back: "The one who wrote this note is a pig pickpocket."

### Rain Flower

Geography Teacher: How big is China?

Student secretly glances at the book: China is as big as a mulberry leaf.

Surgeon's Wife: You always advise people to exercise by riding a horse, saying it's good for their health; wouldn't that ruin your business?

Surgeon: What if they all fall and get injured!

Reader: Do you have any new works?

Writer: Almost finished. But I want to solicit readers' opinions: Do you prefer to read my essays or novels?

Reader: I'd rather you write a table of contents, all titles. Because I think your titles are the most moving.

The cross-eyed judge asks the first defendant: What is your name?

Second Defendant: My name is Zhang.

Judge: I didn't ask you.

Third Defendant: I haven't even opened my mouth yet!

University Student A: They say you often sleep with your coat on.

University Student B: Let me think: How could the professor allow me to take off my clothes!

A: Why are you so unhappy?

B: My chicken ran away.

A: That's okay; chickens know the way home.

B: That's the thing; all these chickens have gone home.

Announcement:

This is a comprehensive edition. From the conditions after the Sino-Japanese War to Moscow's pickpockets, we will talk about everything. We privately have a small aspiration: to make news literary, and literature newsworthy; to make knowledge like a story, and stories knowledgeable. In order to achieve this small aspiration, we await readers' and writers' contributions and critiques. We are all people who firmly believe in liberalism, and it seems unnecessary to list ten "submission guidelines" or anything like that; as long as the contributions conform to the style of this edition, and do not deviate too far from the three conditions of novelty, brevity, and simplicity, they will definitely meet the readers quickly.

Please Criticize, Welcome Submissions.

### Maritime Storm by Lawton — Translated by Yang Bi

One: The Ship Carrying Gold

The newspaper was printed in large letters, stating that the German-American liner "Cologne" was carrying six million in gold bars from the United States to Germany. On the day she set sail, a large crowd of people rushed to the pier to watch the excitement, and it was so crowded that water could not leak through.

This was just a steel-made ship, with a large amount of property inside, and it attracted these people. Although it is not easy to guess what they expected to see, it is just like some people will stare at a prison, where there are clearly some criminals held, they stare at the four gray walls in a daze, but they do not hope to be able to go in and enjoy it themselves. Therefore, on the pier of the "Cologne," this group also used their inquisitive eyes to freely peep at this treasure box containing a huge amount of gold.

In the crowd, two brown-skinned youths, picking up their luggage and suitcases in their hands, managed to squeeze out.

"It's really amazing, Jack!" one cried out. He was pushing aside two fat men and women with his elbows. The man stared at the side of the ship blankly, with no intention of giving way. The woman opened her mouth wide and her eyes protruded, as if she hoped to turn the black hull into gold.

"Yes, gold is a big magnet, even if it has been wrapped up and sent into the ship's vault." Jack Reed replied. "Compared to that, being on such a ship, we feel like millionaires ourselves."

"This is also one of the pleasures of the holiday." Bill Nanno laughed, "If the pirates of ancient times were still alive, this would be a good opportunity for them. Then, when we sailed on this "Cologne" ship, we could really watch a thrilling scene."

Jack was a radio operator on the Chuks Mail Ship Asia, and Bill was a mechanic. Because they had helped Mr. Chuks find his lost younger brother, Chuks specially granted them a holiday, and they decided to travel to Europe during this holiday.

In fact, at the time they boarded this gold-carrying ship, some weapons in Europe were already clanking and rattling. Moreover, several hours ago, this great war, which was almost universal to the globe, was already destined to break out. Naturally, they had no premonition about this matter at all. They were putting their belongings into the cabin. The ship's whistle roared, and a tremor passed through the huge hull. She left the pier, the steel band began to play, and the crowd on the deck and the crowd on the pier waved vigorously. At that time, it was simply impossible to distinguish these mixed sounds.

"Okay, it's finally sailing. Jack, Bill said, he took Jack's arm and leaned against the side of the ship, looking at the skyscrapers towering into the sky, saying goodbye again and again.

Jack stared blankly at the two tall masts rising into the sky, with the radio antennas swaying between the two masts.

"Thinking that someone else is sending the radio now, it feels a bit special." He said lazily, softly reciting the unceasing radio code, indicating "goodbye."

"Enough, I've never seen such a person!" Bill shouted. "Always forgetting your endless radio! But--" he suddenly shouted, "That's someone we know!" Coming towards them was a nimble, small man, with a neat mustache on his lip, dressed very neatly, seemingly a bit too stylish.

"What, that's the French pilot Louis Garros! We saved his property in the Florida Sea!" Jack shouted.

### Tung Oil Expert Talks About the Prospects of Sino-American Tung Oil Trade American Planting of Tung Progresses Gradually, but Production Is Still Limited In the Next Few Years, China Will Still Be Relied On for Supply

Tung oil is a major commodity in China's export trade, especially the trade volume between China and the United States is the largest. According to a certain expert familiar with Sino-American tung oil trade issues, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, tung oil produced in China has been more difficult to ship to the United States than usual due to transportation issues. There is no need to deny it. Therefore, when the war first broke out, American oil prices soared. Affected by this, the tung oil industry in the states along the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, namely Florida, Louisiana, etc., tried to step up production. According to the early part of this century, the above-mentioned states began to plant tung trees and try to operate an oil extraction industry. After decades of hard work, although this oil industry has made a lot of progress today, its output is still limited and not enough to meet the large domestic demand. Therefore, China is still relied on for supply year after year and is increasing year by year. It reached its peak in 1937. It is estimated that the tung oil imported from China to the United States in that year reached 175,000,000 pounds, while the domestic production in the United States was the highest last year (1938), but it was also not four, 000,000 pounds. The difference in supply is very far. Judging from this, it can be known that in the next few years, the tung oil market in the United States will still need to purchase large quantities from China, which is beyond doubt. As for the situation of Americans planting tung trees, in the initial period, they did not know what was suitable for soil quality, tung tree species, and climate dryness and humidity, so the losses were very large. In recent years, they have worked hard to research and have made great progress. The current price in the United States is completely dependent on the supply situation in China. In the past two years, due to the war, oil prices have fluctuated greatly. When the Japanese army occupied Shanghai in November 1937, the oil supply to the United States was interrupted for a time, and the US oil price soared to a huge 22 cents per pound. However, due to the large quantities of tung oil being exported through Hong Kong, the oil price fell accordingly. Until Guangzhou fell in October last year, it rose again to 15 cents per pound. Since then, oil prices have been hovering between 12 cents and 15 cents. Now China's tung oil is again being exported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. The government is actively encouraging planting and paying attention to refining in the rear provinces to improve quality. In short, American tung planting is improving day by day. If China wants to maintain its original position, it should pay attention to improving it at any time.

### China's Literature and Art in the War of Resistance

— Lao She

Introduction: Today's Chinese literary scene, we can say without hesitation, stands under the banner of the whole nation's war of resistance, exerting all efforts to sound the bugle call for national salvation and survival. The entire nation is struggling in blood, and it is difficult to find in literature any praise or appreciation for romantic love and natural beauty; if one happens to see dialogues about such things, their colors will surely be blood red. The entirety of literary and artistic works can simply be called a war song.

Poets, playwrights, novelists, and literary theorists have all joined hands to organize the National Literary and Art Circles Anti-Aggression Association. Factions and opinions, which separated literary comrades in ordinary times, even if they did not antagonize each other, were each governing their own way, not interacting with each other. The sound of cannons on July 7th stirred the hearts of the most sensitive writers; with the same scenery in front of everyone and only one common enemy in everyone's heart, naturally everyone turned their pens outward. The association has only one policy, which is sincere unity to strive for the victory of the nation. Members write and propagate in extremely difficult living conditions. Whoever comes to teach them to write, they are happy to follow, as long as what they write is related to war propaganda. They also go to the people, to the army, presenting poems, songs, and wall newspapers to the people and soldiers as spiritual food.

In terms of poetry, because of the war of resistance, it strives to be激昂and obvious, able to be recited, so that it can enter everyone's ears, arousing the passion to love the nation and resist tyranny. Moreover, almost every day one can see touching and admirable facts in the newspapers. Villagers and vendors often become national heroes. The responsibility of singing about these heroic deeds naturally belongs to the poets. The glory of poets has now become the glory of the nation.

Drama must be performed, and therefore it is even more suitable for propaganda. In cities and villages, for raising winter clothes, donating money, comforting wounded soldiers, and sending off departing troops, there are dramatic performances and actors' activities. This kind of activity evokes the tears of many soldiers and people. When performing for comforting wounded soldiers, wounded brothers often shout "Go to the front line again" and then, in fact, rush to the front.

Reportage is even more the favorite of heaven, it is true, simple, vivid and powerful. The people in the rear are concerned about their children on the front lines, and the brothers on the front lines are eagerly looking forward to news from their hometown. This true and powerful report not only reports victory, but also unites the hearts of the nation.

Long novels have not yet appeared. In order to achieve immediate and effective propaganda results, short stories, because they are short and convenient, are produced in large quantities to meet the needs. Among them are many excellent works, because what is written is the writers' true experience - serving in the army or in exile chased by enemy aircraft, or having searched through the burned-down cities, or having seen fellow citizens with severed limbs. All of these are writing materials, and they cannot be stored in the heart, but must be written out immediately. Who can bury these tragic facts? In general, poems, dramas, and novels all strive to be vigorous and clear for the sake of the war of resistance. However, the writers know that these things may not be easily understood by illiterate compatriots, even if someone reads them to listen. Therefore, writers have to combine them with the original folk art forms, following the folk tradition of performing dramas accompanied by stringed instruments and singing storytelling songs, and creating new things with lyrics recited by bamboo clappers, so that the literate can read and the illiterate can listen. This popular function is also being produced as much as possible in order to penetrate the people and carry out extensive propaganda.

In a few small towns, you may see a wall newspaper copied by middle school students. On this wall newspaper, you can see brief war news, small essays, illustrated stories, and one or two poems, or folk songs; new folk songs. Ah, then you will know. All kinds of literary and artistic styles are being applied on the streets, all serving the war of resistance; even the form of folk songs has not been abandoned. From this small wall newspaper, you can imagine today's Chinese literary scene.

### On the Weaknesses of Literary Criticism in the War of Resistance

— Huang Sheng

Theoreticians point out the weaknesses of literary and artistic works during the war of resistance in two sentences, saying: "Works lag behind reality, and criticism lags behind works." Especially the latter - criticism - is indeed the weakest link in the literary and artistic activities of the War of Resistance. Its intensification and strengthening has become a consistent request of most literary workers recently.

Naturally, it is not that we have no criticism, nor is it that our criticism has not achieved some results. Mao Dun's "Thoughts in August," Zhu Xiuxia's "On Realist Anti-Japanese War Literature," Ai Siqi's "Trends in Anti-Japanese War Literature," Xiang Linbing's "The Development and Defects of Popular Literature Movement Since the War of Resistance," etc., are all excellent criticisms: general literary publications often have book reviews, which are naturally criticisms; even many short literary commentaries published in newspapers and magazines are mostly critical in nature. We cannot say that these criticisms have not had an effect on writers and readers; it's just that it is far from enough and very weak. Therefore, if we now say that we want to expand criticism work and intensify criticism work, it is not enough to merely emphasize the importance of criticism; we must further examine the weaknesses of past criticisms in order to explore the concrete direction of future criticism.

First, general literary publications often have book reviews, and some progressive newspapers and publications also often have articles reviewing literary works. There are also excellent and solid criticisms, such as some book reviews published by Mao Dun in "Wen Zhen." Although they are mostly introductory in nature, they often contain precise arguments, seemingly written casually, but revealing the brilliance of theory. It is worth learning from.

However, many authors' reviews cannot satisfy us. They often contain only a description of the work's outline, plus abstract or even dispensable comments. When talking about the good aspects, it is that the theme is positive and the character creation is quite successful; when talking about the bad aspects, it is that the grasp of reality is not enough, and the atmosphere description is not very accurate, etc. They do not clearly point out the good and bad aspects of the work. In reality, the so-called criticism stops at the introduction of the work's outline. Recently, there has been a trend of mutual respect among writers, which is good and necessary; but mutual respect does not mean being polite to each other, and it cannot ignore the necessary mutual criticism. Many literary friends are suffering from this problem. This is also a factor in the backwardness of criticism work. Therefore, I feel that the practical and impolite style of Zhang Zhenya's "Review of Tian Jian's Recent Works" (Wen Zhan, Volume 1, Issue 2) really needs to be promoted.

The object of our criticism! A specific work and general works are both products of Chinese society during the war of resistance and have many things in common with general works. Therefore, when we conduct criticism, we should maintain the attitude of taking a specific work as an example and criticizing general works. When we criticize one point of a specific work, we should establish or concretely explain a theory, which can be used as a sharp weapon for dissecting general works. Under this requirement, those generalized criticisms are of course useless things. We must look at a specific work from general works, and our criticism can see the general from the particular. At the same time, when we look at a specific work from general works, we can explore the characteristics of the work and give it the evaluation it deserves—this is said incidentally.

Second, the War of Resistance literature is Chinese youth literature, a new development. In these twenty-plus months, it did not make great achievements, so anxious friends mentioned the issue of producing great works to the literary scene for the second time; however, it is indeed accelerating development. The number of literary publications and supplements is more than before the war, and unlike before, they are concentrated in a corner of Shanghai. With the demands of reality, the writers are scattered, and new people appear in various places one after another. The buds of literature sprout in different soils. Under this new situation, although great works have not yet been produced, new styles and works with new atmosphere are emerging one after another. The emergence of these works may be a prelude to the production of great works. Many poems, narrative poems, oratorical literature, and popular literature are special products of literature during the War of Resistance. How should critics "deal with" these special products?

Unfortunately. Most critics do not seem to pay much attention to works with new styles and new atmosphere, do not put them forward for special attention, do not develop their advantages, and do not criticize their shortcomings. When a new style of work appears, it does not attract the attention, discussion, and research of friends who love literature in various places, and it encounters the fate of self-generation and self-destruction. Even if it is excellent and has development prospects, no one will continue to create and carry it forward. This is a great loss to the literature of the War of Resistance. Critics should bear a great responsibility for causing this loss. In the future, we must earnestly remedy the weakest link in the work of criticism.

Third, many long and short essays have appeared in the literary world, and there is no longer a trend of belittling essays or merely selling some imported goods. This is a sign of progress. Some of those essays are critical in nature, and there have been excellent works; however, the general drawback is that they do not start with a concrete analysis of the work. They only say that the literature of the War of Resistance is not good in this way or that way, and should be done in this way or that way, but they do not point out which works have the problems you criticize, and what their pathological state is. Therefore, although they are reasonable, they sometimes leave people confused, and thus lose the function of criticism.

Recently, some people have advocated that we should hold a general review of literary and artistic works since the War of Resistance as soon as possible. If it is said that criticism work is necessary, this general review is the only way to go. Without starting from reviewing works, comprehensive critical essays will become shooting without a target and will be of little benefit to writers and readers.

The above are just a few very rough points. Please correct and supplement them, friends.

The contents of this publication are divided into (1) short literary essays, (2) criticism of works, (3) members' communications, (4) literary news, and (5) reports on association affairs. It is attached to the supplements of Ta Kung Pao, Pearl River, Shen Bao, and Xingdao newspapers on Mondays in rotation. Members are invited to contribute actively. Manuscripts should be sent to P.O. Box 171, Hong Kong.

### "The Rising Sun Will Not Rise Again"

— Wen Yu

—Reading "North China Front"—

It is not a news chronicle, not a novel, and certainly not a treatise. "North China Front," I think this book should be read and cherished as a great work of reportage.

"Although the Japanese invasion has horrifyingly brought disaster and suffering to China, this baptism of blood and fire has simultaneously created progressive forces in China's old society; if these forces can be unimpeded, they may transform this suffering country into a free and democratic polity like that of Sun Yat-sen.

"The entire armed nation is slowly having unified command. And any army in the world that encounters the full force of this revitalized China will be crushed and defeated." ("The Rising Sun Will Not Rise Again")

This is how敏銳an observation, a firm belief – Bertrand Russell's conclusion to this unprecedented war is clear and powerful. His 250,000-word masterpiece reveals this great conclusion through imagery – we must be grateful!

The author takes a glimpse at Japan before the war. Entering Beiping was when the sounds of war were already resounding. He said goodbye to a beautiful and indifferent ancient capital. He embarked on a journey to northern Shaanxi and spent the New Year of 1938 in the snow-covered mountains. When he saw that dark Beiping again, revisited the mad island nation, and then left resolutely, it was after the Battle of Taierzhuang, the "second spring" of the war.

The author recorded the opening battles of Pingjin, the battles of Pingxingguan, Xinkou, and Yangmingbao, but only with fine lines of imagery; he made a "close-up" of Mao Zedong, Zhu De, He Long, Xiao Ke, Liu Shaoqi, Wang Zhen, Zhao Chengzhou, etc., which was very lively, but only had the bare bones. As for sparsely writing about the cruelty of the Japanese invaders, the defeat of Taiyuan, and the rise of the new masses, they are all the same as many sides, many "trivialities." However, those are not accidental phenomena, but are used to reveal the inevitable. The author entered the fragmented Shanxi Bureau, and he was not surprised. He finally saw China's rebirth, the inevitability of victory! In the deep mountains and in the countryside, he discovered the masses and the masses' army. He warmly stayed with them, and therefore felt that the invaders would surely be crushed and defeated! He wrote down all the warmth in his heart, and at the same time, he unceremoniously revealed the crux of the "old China," so that we are strongly moved and encouraged, and are convinced and willing to expand the vitality that China has gained. He, the author, said this: Outsiders think that China is completely in the hands of the invaders, "but after seeing the surpassing vitality of these people, I have no doubts about their final victory. In the current storms and difficulties of the war, a new China will soon emerge - a 'completely different' new China." - The author is now using his heart and blood to announce this to the world.

With his talented brush, he lightly sketches a few strokes, and the large and small mass soldiers all become alive; they are all determined to fight – when this determination to resist is universal to everyone's heart, the Japanese invaders will encounter the full force of a revitalized China and be crushed!

…The headquarters of our destination had already moved that night – no one knew the exact location. Our future will encounter danger.

"So what do we do?"

The platoon leader shrugged his broad shoulders and moved forward. "If you meet your comrades, you can naturally find the brigade commander." He didn't seem to think that we might meet the Japanese army first.

Outside the office, I said goodbye to my bodyguard… "Don't you want to go to England with me?" I asked him, this is what we often talked about in our chats.

He smiled as usual and asked back, pulling up his hanging pants, "Do you like to take me?"

"Seriously!"

He scratched his ears, thought for a moment, and finally shook his head and said, "I can't go to England now."… "I'm not afraid, but now we have to protect North China, we are all very needed. Everyone should..."

This cannot but move the author, and also moves everyone. "Old China" has been replaced, and mass soldiers have grown!

The author shattered Japan's propaganda of accusing us of being communist. He showed the true face of the border areas and the united front. He also announced to the world in a personal way: "Every battle has 'cruel things,' and those sane Western countries may currently think that it is just propaganda from both sides, not the facts, but I don't believe that the Shanxi civilians in the collapsed rural houses can understand these 'tricks.' And the Japanese invaders' cruel 'stories' are, this honest and tragic tone."

The author's conversation with the Chinese coolies in the Shenyang carriage room (see The Second Spring) reveals the hearts of the Chinese in the lost territories. For "Beiping in the darkness," he saw "hope" and predicted that the time to gain "new confidence" would eventually come.

In Tokyo. He pointed out that the madness of love and fear in the cheers of "Long Live" for sending troops has long become the most miserable farewell, a song-like unending farewell, making the soldiers unbearable, "no band, no flags, no cheers..."

"Everything is deceiving," "The Rising Sun Will Not Rise Again," this is a very beautiful conclusion.

Kisch, the author of Secret China, a great master of reportage, said that the author of reportage must work closely with the oppressed, and Bertrand Russell and several other international friends have done this, and we should be grateful.

The oppressed will surely turn over!

### Literary and Art Intelligence

— Xi Sheng

George Bernard Shaw's recent play, "Geneva," is a political play that satirizes the characters on the modern international stage. It was performed at the Malvern St. Combs Theatre last summer and won excellent reviews. However, Shaw once said that he did not want to publish a single edition until the sister play of the play was written. However, Shaw has recently changed his mind, partly because the calligrapher Topolski has inserted many illustrations for the play, all of which are watercolors and sketches, which made Shaw unable to restrain his emotions. It is heard that it is being printed in the Constable bookstore, and the publishing company will publish the single edition this month after it has been revised, slightly different from the script when it was performed last summer. Furthermore, due to various reasons, the characters in the play were deliberately made up to avoid too direct allusions, but in the illustrations of Topolski in the single edition, all the characters satirized by Shaw have revealed their true faces.

Columbia Records recently hired the host of the Oxford University Poetry Recitation Society to design and record the recitation of British poems, named "The吟聲of Poetry" record set. The first collection will be recited by Ms. Edith Sitwell and Owen Evans, with a total of six 10-inch records, selecting 30 famous poems, from Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Keats and other famous poets to modern poets laureate, Masefield, and Laurence Binyon; de la Mare, and Alfred Noyes, etc., are all included. Each collection has a booklet with a preface by Binyon and annotations by Wallace Nichols.

American poet Waddington's new poetic drama "The Death of Garcia Lorca" was performed in New York on May 5.

This year's Pulitzer Prize has been decided to be awarded to R. E. Sherwood for his play "Lincoln in Illinois." Other award recipients are M. K. Rawlings for her work "Cross Creek," and Carl Van Doren's "Benjamin Franklin" also won the award.

This year's Heinemann Prize in the United Kingdom was decided to be awarded to Mrs. Camille M. Lang's novel "Black Woman," and the Stockton Literary Award was awarded to Robert Graves' novel "Count Belisarius."

Mr. Ma Er was hospitalized for two months due to appendectomy, but he was very diligent in writing and worked hard to select and translate famous Chinese anti-Japanese works into English and Esperanto, and to promote Chinese culture abroad. "New Works" has already been published by this association. Recently, the famous American "Fiction" has published Zhao Xuehen's translation of "Half a Catty of Wheat," and "International Literature," etc. have also published Mr. Ma Er's works recently.

### Association Affairs Report

This publication will no longer be mailed to each member in each issue, but will be mailed every four issues to save costs.

The association is scheduled to hold a literary and art evening party on the 18th of this month. Members who wish to participate in the program are requested to notify Mr. Li Chi of Ta Kung Pao before the 12th.

### China Scout Troop – Wartime Return to Country Service Corps

Will soon depart for frontline work; Hoping for donations of medicine and equipment from all sides.

Since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident) in 1931, the Chinese Boy Scouts have regarded serving the country as their duty. The Guangzhou Boy Scouts were also ordered to participate in wartime service work, performing arduous duties continuously. After retreating from Guangzhou, a portion of the Boy Scouts withdrew to Hong Kong. Huang Xin, a committee member of the 13th Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps, was responsible for accommodating and providing supplies, awaiting deployment to the front lines. Now, with the military situation on the front lines becoming tense, there is an urgent need to mobilize manpower. Therefore, the former Guangzhou Boy Scout Captain Mai Xingnan was instructed to gather his members, provide strict training, and reorganize them. Once ready, they will be dispatched to serve on the front lines. This unit is named the "Chinese Boy Scout Wartime Return to Country Service Corps" and is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. A flag-presentation and oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for the 14th of this month. In addition to reporting the departure date to the Central Government via telegram, the Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman is also requested to instruct military and political organs along the route to provide protection, ensuring a safe arrival in the war zone on schedule. Furthermore, the corps has received consecutive sponsorships from Lingdao, Meifang, Fanglin, Zhonghua, Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, Overseas Chinese, Guanghua, Xinxu, Lizhe, Yangzhong and other schools, as well as Macao's Yuehua and Jizhong schools, the Provincial Relief Association, the Student Relief Association, the Youth Relief Association, the Women's Comfort Association and other organizations, and Xinghua, Yaorong, Nanfa, Nanqiang, Riqing and other companies and businesses. Preparations are quite complete. Considering the lack of medicine and equipment on the front lines, donations from various organizations and companies are requested to be taken to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers.

### Flood XX Drama Troupe – Arrives in Hong Kong from Macau – Will Report on Past Work Through Performances

The Flood XX Drama Troupe is purely an automatically organized group of Guangzhou's enthusiastic youth. Not fearing hardship, they went deep into villages and towns along the West and South Rivers to focus on war resistance propaganda, organization, training, fundraising, rescue, and assisting local governments in implementing policies. They have won the sympathy of local authorities and the public. Yesterday morning, the troupe leaders Chen Wenyuan, Huang Ninglin, Chen Jinwei, Huang Yanjing and others led all 34 troupe members from Macau to Hong Kong on the Guangfu Xiang Steamer. They appealed to sympathizers for financial assistance and will report on past work through performances, inviting leaders from all walks of life to visit and provide guidance. Once replenished and the performances are completed, they will transfer to the East River area to continue their efforts in the war of resistance.

### Amateur Sun Yi Society – Chinese Clerks Association – Jointly Organize Group Sea Bathing

The Amateur Union and the Chinese Clerks Association, considering the arrival of the hot summer, plan to hold a group sea bathing event once a week to promote beneficial and recreational leisure activities. Outside participants are also welcome. The first sea bathing is scheduled to be held at Qingshui, with participants gathering at the Unified Pier at 1:50 PM on June 18th and returning to Hong Kong at 7:00 PM.

Registration locations: Amateur Union, 4th Floor, 29 Connaught Road Central; Chinese Clerks Association, 4th Floor, 29 Des Voeux Road Central. The number of participants is limited to 250 people. Many outsiders have already registered. Those who wish to participate should register before June 16th to avoid disappointment.

### French Currency Black Market Rises

The legal currency of our country has recently fluctuated. However, the financial foundation of our country is solid, and the market price has stabilized in recent days. Yesterday was Sunday, and although the banks did not officially post prices, there was still a black market. The opening price yesterday morning was 458, rising to 460 at midday and closing at 453. Therefore, the legal currency exchange rate is clearly gradually rising. Financial observers believe that the cause of the fluctuations in the French currency exchange market was the release of a large amount of French currency in Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange, as well as the seasonal import and export relationship. Some overly sensitive people mistakenly believed that the successive visits of the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to Chongqing to meet with our authorities were related to mediation for peace, causing some financial speculators to take the opportunity to manipulate and attempt to profit privately, disregarding the overall situation. However, because our country has a firm financial policy, it is not enough to shake the true value of the French currency. Moreover, before this unfounded speculation spread, our government announced the strict arrest of Wang Zhaoming, causing some people to believe that the speculation about the visit of the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to Chongqing being related to mediation for peace was fundamentally untenable. This also has some relationship with the rise in the French currency.

### Landlords' Greed is Insatiable – Residents of Shan Cun Road – Collectively Oppose Rent Increase – Ignoring Unreasonable Demands – Preparing to Meet in Court if Necessary

Recently, the trend of landlords raising rents has not diminished. Although the Legislative Council has passed the ordinance to prevent forced eviction for another year, with some revisions to the content, and the courts have ruled in favor of the tenants in several rental disputes, the Hong Kong government's efforts to protect ordinary residents can be said to be quite extensive. However, the landlords are still unwilling to give up, demanding from tenants in various ways to achieve the goal of raising rents. Moreover, the landlords jointly formed an association, acting in unison with great pressure. The tenants, on the other hand, are like scattered sand, allowing them to be defeated one by one, enduring in silence and allowing them to take whatever they want. The residents of Shan Cun Road are the first in Hong Kong to collectively confront the landlords. It is found that the tenants of numbers 2 to 26 of the road, due to the insatiable greed of the landlords, held a joint rooftop meeting last Friday night and decided to refuse the rent increase. The rent had already been increased by five dollars per month last month. Recently, the tenants received a notice from the landlord stating that the rent would be increased by twenty dollars per month starting from August. Only eleven days apart, the landlord made two requests for rent increases. Those who declared to the landlord that they could not afford the increase were told, "Please move out by the end of this month (June)." A standard form was also distributed to each household, stating that if they were willing to pay the increase, they must fill it out and sign it in person. Therefore, the residents of these numbers were extremely indignant and decided to take unified action to resist. It is heard that in addition to resolving to refuse this unreasonable rent increase, they will also ignore any forced eviction, and have reported the matter to the government. At the same time, they are raising funds to prepare for court if necessary.

### Case of Robbers Refusing Arrest in the Bustling City – Detective Yin Dies of Serious Injuries Yesterday – Destitute After Death, Leaving Behind a Young Wife and Young Children – Police Authorities Provide Generous Compensation to the Family

On the 5th of this month, brazen robbers committed a daylight armed robbery of pedestrians on Li Yuen Street East in Des Voeux Road Central, resulting in a fierce shootout with police detectives, causing one death and six injuries. It was found that the two detectives who initially discovered the robbery were Tan Song and Yin Wen, and it was also Tan and Yin who shot the robbers and engaged them in a fierce battle. During the fierce battle, Detective Yin was unfortunately shot in the abdomen by the robbers, sustaining serious injuries. Afterwards, he was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. After the hospital doctors' careful treatment, his condition had improved slightly in recent days, and there was hope of escaping the danger period. However, the detective's condition suddenly took a turn for the worse yesterday morning and he passed away in the hospital at 11 AM. Those who heard the news felt sorry for him. The police authorities deeply mourned Detective Yin's dedication to his duty, bravely fighting and dying. They decided to provide generous compensation to his family to comfort his loyal soul. It is found that Detective Yin left behind a wife and a son, with a loving mother still alive. The son is only three years old, and the family is very destitute.

### Guangzhou Mechanics Fleeing to Hong Kong – Some Go to Yunnan to Serve – Many Seek Employment in Hong Kong to Sustain Life

When Guangzhou fell, more than a hundred local mechanics, understanding the greater good, were unwilling to be used by the Japanese under their iron heel. They fled to Hong Kong together, without any means of support. They were received by the employees and workers of the Chinese Machinery Association of Hong Kong. However, this long-term idleness was not a long-term solution. Therefore, the Chinese Machinery Association submitted a request to the Guangdong Provincial Government to find a way to send them back to serve in the country. After the submission, the Guangdong Provincial Authorities immediately sent personnel to Hong Kong to investigate the names, ages, birthplaces, resumes, and work skills of the mechanics, and reported back to the authorities in Guangdong in detail. The Chinese Machinery Association also received a reply from the Provincial Government, stating that the matter had been handed over to the Refugee Relief Committee. However, the mechanics believed that since they were originally productive members of society, it would not be a good policy to be partially relieved by the Relief Committee due to unemployment. Therefore, some of the workers have started looking for jobs in Hong Kong to settle down temporarily and then figure out a solution. It is estimated that there are more than 110 mechanics who have come to Hong Kong. The employees and workers of the Chinese Machinery Association are introducing them to jobs. Some have found places to stay, while others who do not have jobs are still being hosted by various workers. They are now planning to further request the Central Government in Chongqing to provide accommodation. Recently, the Central Resources Committee in Hong Kong recruited machinery personnel to return to the country to serve. Personnel from the Committee's Hong Kong office have consulted with the persons in charge of the Chinese Machinery Association, planning to recruit the mechanics who fled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and send them back to serve in the country. After the Chinese Machinery Association consulted with the workers, due to salary issues and the different circumstances of each worker, each worker was free to apply. Now, some of the workers have passed the examination and will be selected by the Resources Committee and sent to Yunnan Province to serve in the coming days. Others who do not yet have jobs will wait for news from the authorities before making a decision.

### Chinese Registration – Excellent Results

Reaching over 500 People

The Chinese voluntary registration, held after the British registration, has been underway for half a month and the results are excellent. According to official sources, as of now, the Chinese voluntary registration has reached over 500 people. According to Chinese representative Sir Robert Ho Tung, the Chinese voluntary registration will be officially closed at the end of this month, and it is hoped that those compatriots in Hong Kong who have not registered will do so as soon as possible. In addition, the Chinese representatives have launched a fundraising campaign to donate to the families of the personnel who died in the British submarine "Thetis". A considerable amount of money has now been raised, and there are many donors. The detailed amount of donations will be announced next week.

### China Bus Adds New Route – Happy Valley – Shek Tong Tsui – Route Number 5A – Route Numbers 1 and 2 Slightly Changed

Due to the impact of the mainland war, the population of Hong Kong has suddenly increased, and all kinds of transportation vehicles are very crowded. China Bus Company, to facilitate the needs of passengers, has added a new route, called Route 5A. The company originally had Route 1, from Yaumati Pier to Happy Valley; Route 2, from Yaumati Pier to Taikoo Dockyard; Route 3, from Yaumati Pier to the University Hall; Route 3A, from Royal Pier to Mount Davis; Route 4, from Yaumati Pier to Queen Mary Hospital; Route 5, from Tai Hang to Kennedy Town; Route 6, from Yaumati Pier to Stanley; Route 6A, from Yaumati Pier to Repulse Bay; Route 7, from Yaumati Pier to Aberdeen; and Route 7A, from Aberdeen to Stanley. The newly added Route 5A is between Happy Valley and Shek Tong Tsui, starting from Kennedy Town, passing through Queen's Road West, Des Voeux Road Central, Des Voeux Road East, Leighton Hill Road, and Wong Nai Chung Road, turning over the Naval Memorial and returning to Queen's Road East, then back to Kennedy Town. This route has been approved by the government and will be implemented soon. The original Route 1, which runs between the Unified Pier and Happy Valley, will now bypass Johnston Road and go directly through Hennessy Road, Hunning Road, and Wan Chai Road to enter Happy Valley. Route 2, which runs between the Unified Pier and Taikoo Dockyard, will now bypass Lockhart Road and go directly through Hennessy Road. This will reduce the number of turns and road crossings, avoiding accidental dangers. After this new route is implemented, the regular monthly ticket of eight dollars will also be valid as usual.

Special Report of This Newspaper

### The Amateur Association of the Banking Industry – "Yinlian" is Developing

— Qi Zhuo

A Lively Social Gathering Was Held at the Confucius Hall the Other Night

The sounds and flames of the war of resistance changed everything. Look: Before August 13, 1937, there were a total of 1,300 Chinese bank employees in all of Hong Kong. After August 13, 1937, the number doubled in one fell swoop. The number of Chinese bank employees in all of Hong Kong is now over 2,600. This is because the financial centers of Shanghai and Hankou have moved to Hong Kong, and there are already more than 40 banks and silver firms. The central groups that have come from outside are, needless to say, the "Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications" and several other banks.

The "quantity" is increasing, and the "quality" is also changing. Who forced us to come to Hong Kong? No one will forget the blood-like lessons. Recalling how our beloved hometowns were ravaged by Japanese imperialism, looking at our motherland with smoke of war all over the sky, we are sheltered here. ??? Therefore, vigilant friends and outstanding members of the banking industry seriously organized themselves. The Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association – abbreviated as "Yinlian" – was born on January 22nd of this year.

The passive goal is, needless to say, to prevent us from becoming "accustomed to the smell and not noticing it" and living a drunken, dreamy life in this "safe haven." The active goal is to take "to contact and associate with emotion, exchange knowledge, improve amateur life, promote proper recreation, enhance service effectiveness, and promote banking business" as the purpose.

The organization of the association, under the General Meeting of Members, is equipped with a Council and a Board of Supervisors. Under the Standing Council, there are:

General Affairs, Membership, Academic, Service, Sports, Recreation, and Publication Departments, which are strictly divided and cooperated. There are many sections and groups under each department.

The scope of the association's activities is very wide, such as libraries, choir, drama troupe, lectures, banking accounting classes, English classes, travel, various sports training, and various patriotic movements. It abandons the habit of "living in comfort" and lives and learns in the collective, showing remarkable achievements.

The number of members of the association has increased to 900 now. Permanent members pay a one-time membership fee of more than HK$50, supporting members pay a monthly membership fee of more than one dollar and less than ten dollars, and ordinary members pay 30 cents per month. Therefore, the economic foundation of the association is quite solid. Banking giants such as Qian Xinzhi, Tang Shoumin, Ye Zhuotang, Yu Hongjun, Kong Lingkan, Liu Jisheng, Li Daonan, Huo Caibao, and Li Nangong either joined as permanent members of the association or fully expressed sympathy and provided assistance. The upper and lower levels are united, and the association has done very well in this regard. Many of the responsible cadres of the association are also originally responsible for important positions in the banking industry.

Facts tell us that many industry leaders are still narrow-minded and short-sighted, and are not satisfied with their subordinates participating in social or amateur activities. Therefore, many young professionals are concerned and hesitant. According to the person in charge of the association speaking to the reporter, "Yinlian" does not have this unfortunate fact. This is gratifying.

The association has recently established a magnificent clubhouse on the third floor of the Gold and Silver Exchange in Marsha Street, and held an opening ceremony on the 6th of this month, which was very grand. In order to connect feelings and enhance the unity of members, the association held its first General Meeting of Members the other night at the Confucius Hall. The entire building was full, with nearly a thousand people, mostly bank employees and their families. The atmosphere was very happy and lively. The cadres of the association, such as Wang Jiucheng, Feng Shumin, Jin Zhongtao, Chen Zhiluan, Wang Shucha, Chen Bin, and Fei Xingbo, were busy preparing for everything.

After 7 o'clock, the ceremony began. Chairman Feng Shumin delivered a speech, followed by recreational performances. The harmonica served as the prelude, and then the association's choir sang songs of national salvation.

"Cannot Return to Hometown," "The Flag is Flying," and "Eight Hundred Heroes" moved the audience. At the request of "One More Time," they sang it again, winning warm applause.

Then came the drama. The Yinlian Drama Troupe of the association performed two famous plays, "The Roar of the Ancient City" and "Mount Tai Feather," directed by Tang Huaiqiu, the head of the China Travel Troupe. Many friends from the China Travel Troupe helped with the set design, and the performance was quite remarkable. It lasted until midnight, and everyone left happily. The Yinlian Drama Troupe of the association also plans to hold a charity performance at the Entertainment Theatre in early next month, which will surely be a lively affair. The spirit of the association in actively seeking development under the possibilities of the environment is admirable.

At the end of the article, the reporter hopes that the employees of the industry will seize the opportunity and environment of this time and place and work hard. The motherland is in rebirth, and everything about us must also follow the rebirth!

### China Relief Committee Donates 200,000 – Builds New Camp to Accommodate Isolated Army – Address Already Selected Near Kowloon Hospital – Isolated Army in Ma Tau Chung Will Move in After Completion

The isolated army residing in the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp numbers thousands, and live together with the refugees in the camp. The authorities plan to find a local location to accommodate them, but due to limited funding and the lack of a suitable location, it has been unresolved for a long time. Our country's authorities, to provide the soldiers in the camp with more comfortable accommodation, have allocated 200,000 national currency from the Central Relief Committee for the construction of a new camp. The location of the camp has been selected at the intersection of Argyle Street and Livin Road, near Kowloon Hospital. The plans have been drawn up, and construction can begin once approved by the competent authorities. The construction method of the new camp will be the same as the current government refugee camp. Several wooden houses will be built in the camp, the ground will be paved with cement, and the camp will be surrounded by iron fences. The camp will accommodate approximately 1,000 to 1,200 people. In the future, after the construction is completed, the isolated army in the Ma Tau Chung camp will all move in, and the remaining empty houses will be used to accommodate approximately 1,000 homeless refugees. The wooden houses in the new camp can be used for ten to fifteen years. Once the war is over and the soldiers in the camp return to the country, the camp can be converted into residential housing, which can also solve some of the housing problems for the poor people in Hong Kong at that time.

### Dump Truck – Injures Mud Worker

Near the Asia Petroleum Depot in Tsuen Wan, the Hong Kong Public Works Department is employing workers to level mountains and reclaim land, and has built a railway line for transporting mud to the seaside. At 10:30 yesterday morning, during a heavy rain, several mud workers were transporting mud and stones. At that time, one worker's hand slipped, causing the mud truck to break free and rush forward. Several mud workers could not escape in time and were hit by the truck. One person was seriously injured, and several others sustained minor injuries. The foreman, seeing this situation, immediately went to the Tsuen Wan Police Station to report the case. The police station then telephoned the Kowloon Fire Brigade to send a Red Cross team to transport the injured to Kowloon Hospital for treatment.

### Civil Defense Training – Participants Are Very Enthusiastic

In order to implement the civil defense training program for the public, the Hong Kong Civil Defense Authorities are actively training civil defense personnel by holding Chinese and English civil defense classes in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon. According to Civil Defense Controller Stewart Percival Smith, since the opening of the civil defense classes, the public has been very enthusiastic in participating. The minimum number of Chinese and Western residents who have received civil defense training is over 25,000, with approximately 15,000 women and approximately 10,000 men. Regarding the selection and appointment of Chinese civil defense instructors, the candidates have not yet been decided. There are quite a few applicants, and the authorities will decide within this week. Smith mentioned the volunteer firefighters, saying that the recruitment results for the volunteer fire brigade are not good, probably because there has been too little publicity. It will be necessary to engage in expanded publicity in the short term. The number of volunteer firefighters planned to be recruited is 200, but currently only 23 people have applied. It will be necessary to find a way to recruit 100 people in the future. Regarding the number of police officers who have received civil defense training, Smith said that all police officers have already received civil defense training.

### Medical Director Talks – Cholera Prevention is Imminent – 72 Cases Occurred up to Last Friday

Planning to Implement Free Microbe Testing – And Discussing Methods with the Medical Community

Cholera is the most severe epidemic in summer. Last year, it was prevalent in Hong Kong, and countless residents died from this disease. In view of the tragic cholera epidemic last year, the Hong Kong Health Authorities have been actively implementing various preventive methods since the arrival of this summer, such as holding free epidemic prevention injections and broadcasting lectures and propaganda. The authorities are not slackening their efforts. According to Medical Director S.Y. Sik yesterday, as of last Friday evening, a total of 72 cases of cholera have occurred in Hong Kong this year. For the purpose of further epidemic prevention, the medical authorities are now planning to implement free testing of microbes. If a government doctor hears of a patient who has suspected microbe material but the patient is unable to pay the testing fee, it can be processed for free. Regarding the broadcasting of propaganda on prevention methods, English broadcasts will be held again. For the Cantonese broadcasts, it has been scheduled for Mr. Ho Kam Tong to broadcast at 8:00 PM next Wednesday, explaining methods to prevent cholera. In order to promote widespread publicity, the authorities are now planning to create wall posters in public places, instructing the source of cholera transmission and its prevention methods. This mural is needed for residents of Hong Kong who cannot read. Sik continued that the authorities have recently vigorously promoted epidemic prevention injections and have received assistance from all sectors of society. With the help of various charitable organizations, the Medical Department is implementing epidemic prevention injections, and the number of people will reach over 100,000. The Medical Department held an important meeting with the Hong Kong Medical Association and the Chinese Medical Association last week to discuss the cholera epidemic in detail and proposed that the two associations plan other methods to prevent cholera.

### A Child Drowning While Playing in Water; Another Woman Reports a Loss

Hong Kong Police Station, up on the mountain, at Sam Yau Shan Hang, continuous days of rain have resulted in pooled water.  It is said the depth is over ten feet.  Around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, four children, including Cheng Niu (12 years old), were playing near the dike.  Unexpectedly, Cheng, in his excitement, lost his footing and disappeared into the water.  The other young and ignorant children did not know how to help and fled in all directions.  Cheng tragically drowned.  After some time, Cheng's family noticed he hadn't returned home for a long time and began searching everywhere.  They then questioned the children who had been playing with Cheng and learned that he had drowned in the water.  They rushed to the ditch to rescue him, and after searching, they found him, but he had already been dead for a long time. The boy's parents were heartbroken by his tragic death and wept bitterly. They reported it to the police station, which sent a hearse to take the body to the morgue.  Unexpectedly, while this matter was still causing an uproar, another woman said her son was also missing, and he had also been playing with Cheng at the same location.  The police suspected that the child had suffered the same fate as Cheng and drowned in the water.  They continued to search the water for a long time but found nothing. The assistant superintendent of the station filed the case for further investigation.

Important News from South China

### East River Guerrilla Brigade: Watchfulness and Mutual Assistance; Establishment of Joint Defense Zone; Strengthening the Power to Kill the Japanese and Defend the Rear Area; Formulation of Regulations Prohibiting Aid to the Japanese and Implementation of Strict Measures

(Shenzhen Quick News) Our East River army is taking a two-pronged approach, military and political, to attack the Japanese. Besides using guerrilla tactics to harass the Japanese army, they are also blockading the occupied areas to cut off supplies to the Japanese army. All these measures are yielding considerable results. The recent measures are recorded below:

Establishment of Joint Defense Zones in the Third and Fourth Districts

Luo Fengxiang, commander of the Third District Guerrilla Column, and Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla Column, recognizing that their territories are connected and closely related, have decided to establish a joint defense zone to enhance their power to kill the Japanese and consolidate the security of the rear area. The aim is to facilitate communication and mutual assistance to form a united front. Wang Ruozhou discussed the joint defense measures with Luo Fengxiang during a trip to the city, and preparations are expected to be completed soon for the official establishment.  From then on, the effectiveness of the East River guerrillas will become more apparent.

Formulation of Prohibited Goods to Prevent Aiding the Japanese

The Third and Fourth Districts have further defined the categories of prohibited goods to prevent criminals from smuggling goods to aid the Japanese. The districts have instructed their subordinates to comply with these regulations. The prohibited goods are as follows: Electrical materials and accessories (all kinds of metal ores, sands and their manufactured products, and old waste manufactured products), kerosene, gasoline, coal, charcoal, lubricating oil, lime, bricks, tiles, cement, clay, durable clay, magnesite, dolomite, nitrate bricks, acid fluoride stone, alum, gypsum, mineral products, arsenic ore and its products, all kinds of poultry, hides, animal fur, fresh and frozen meats (pork, beef, casings), salted eggs, rice, wheat, grains, beans, flour, bran, miscellaneous grains (including buckwheat, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro, etc.), tung oil, raw lacquer, tea, silk and its products, hemp and its products, bamboo and wood materials, seaweed, rosin, dried chili, cotton and its products, taro slices, variegated taro, alcohol dyes, paper, scallions, cinnamon. All the above items are strictly prohibited from being used to aid the Japanese, and violators will be severely punished.

### Luo Xianxiang Appointed Mayor of Shantou; Incumbent Mayor Wu Qi Transferred to Chao'an County

(Shantou Quick News) Because of Shantou's geographically important coastal location, there is a possibility of attacks. The Guangdong authorities are paying close attention to the defense of Shantou.  The mayor of Shantou, Wu Qi, recently submitted a request to the provincial government to resign, which was approved by the provincial government council.  Given the recent gathering of Japanese warships in the Lingdong area and the particularly tense situation, and although Commander Hua Zhenzhong is responsible for the security of Chaozhou and Shantou, it is still necessary to select a military expert to be stationed in Shantou to ensure complete security. Therefore, it was decided to appoint Luo Xianxiang as the mayor of Shantou. Luo was formerly the director of the Military Affairs Department of the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office and the chief of staff of the military district. He is familiar with military affairs and well-acquainted with the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou.  In order to avoid the vacancy in the mayor's office being prolonged, Li Zhongxi has ordered Luo to proceed to Shantou to take office quickly. The incumbent mayor of Shantou, Wu Qi, is also a capable political figure, and to make the best use of his talents, he has been specially transferred to be the magistrate of Chao'an County. Liang Hanzhao, the former magistrate of Chao'an County, has been transferred to an important position in the Fourth War Zone.

### China Youth Relief Association Held General Meeting Yesterday; Pan Zhu Reports on the Service Team's Return to China

The China Youth Relief Association held its eighth general meeting at its new location on Caine Road at 3 PM yesterday to discuss amendments to the constitution and important resolutions. Dozens of members attended. After the formalities, Chairman Huang Zonghao gave an opening speech, followed by discussion of various proposals. Members suggested that since the association had moved to its new location, all aspects of its organization and planning should be greatly refreshed. They noted that the association's membership fees and funds had not been actively collected.  To facilitate the progress of the work, they specifically appointed Lu Baolian, the director of finance, and Huang Xiuming, the deputy director, to sign and seal letters to all members, requesting them to pay their monthly membership fees and funds to strengthen the association's foundation. After the resolution was passed, Pan Zhu, who had just returned from Dongjiang, reported on the arrival of the association's first service team at its destination in Dongjiang. He stated that the team departed on May 14 and passed through Pingshan, Danshui, Huiyang, and other places.  Due to transportation difficulties, it took them seven days of hardship to reach Boluo, their destination, and 25 days to complete the deployment.  They have now begun to promote various projects.  The terrain of Dongjiang is mostly mountainous, making it suitable for guerrilla warfare. It is also rich in resources, and the people are self-sufficient. The people have strong military strength, and many possess hidden firearms. If they can be organized, a vast people's self-defense army can be formed. Since the outbreak of the South China War, the local people have suffered greatly under Japanese oppression, and their desire for revenge is even stronger. Many Dongjiang people reside abroad, and overseas Chinese are fervently patriotic. Since the outbreak of the war, many overseas Chinese from Huizhou have returned to serve their country.  Boluo has a population of about 200,000. During the war, it suffered the most severe damage under Japanese oppression. The county seat was almost completely destroyed, and many other villages were also damaged.  Now, order is gradually being restored. The cultural level in Dongjiang is extremely low, and mass movements are not yet on track.  Currently, local military, political, party, and service groups are paying attention to this and making extensive efforts to promote progress, and considerable achievements have been made. Currently, the groups leading the mass movement work in the various counties of Dongjiang include the Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Compatriots Service Corps, which has established a total of seven corps headquarters. The first corps in Huizhou has over a hundred people working, the second corps is in Haijifeng, the third corps is in Boluo, the fourth corps is in Zijin, the fifth corps is in Heyuan, the sixth corps is in Biaochuan, and the seventh corps is in Heping. The other two teams and the recently returned all-female Vincent Team are operating behind Japanese lines in Zengcheng and Bao'an.  Next are the Vanguard Team and the Dongjiang District Team, whose members are scattered throughout the counties and villages of Dongjiang, carrying out mobile work. In addition, there is the wartime work corps organized by the Boluo County government, which has achieved exceptionally good results.

### Banditry in Yangjiang Suppressed; Bandits Surrender and are Reorganized into Self-Defense Corps

(Yangjiang Quick News) Banditry was rampant in the second, third, eighth, and ninth districts of Yangjiang, causing harm to the local area. Since County Magistrate Chen took office, he has led his troops to suppress them vigorously. The bandits dispersed and were unable to maintain their livelihoods. Recently, they sent representatives to surrender to the county government. County Magistrate Chen, with righteous persuasion, reorganized them into a self-defense corps to defend the country and resist the Japanese. Yesterday, officials were sent to inspect and organize them into a company to assist in consolidating local security.

### Reorganization of Self-Defense Corps in Various Counties; Reorganization Measures Promulgated

(Shaoguan Quick News) Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun has decided to reorganize the self-defense corps in all counties of the province to strengthen the province's anti-Japanese self-defense capabilities and adapt to actual needs. He has formulated measures for reorganizing and training self-defense corps and has incorporated them into this year's policy plan, to be implemented step by step. The provincial government has recently issued these reorganization and training measures to all administrative districts and county and city governments for compliance.

### Guangxi Province Intensifies Wartime Production; Officials Sent to Inspect Land Reclamation in Liuzhou District

(Wuzhou Quick News) Guangxi Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu is making great efforts to develop wartime production. Since the establishment of the Guangxi Provincial Local Construction Cadre School, he has been planning to open up a land reclamation zone for production in Liuzhou to provide relief to refugees and increase production. In addition to the preferential investment and land reclamation regulations promulgated by the provincial government to encourage people to invest in industries, he is also engaged in expanding the production area in Liuzhou to increase wartime food supplies. Huang Ronghua, director of the Guangxi Provincial Food Administration Bureau, has been dispatched to inspect and intensify the progress in various counties of the Liuzhou district.

### Sanctioned Populations in Various Towns of Xinhui

(Zhongshan Quick News) Japanese troops are coveting the southern part of Xinhui County and have repeatedly attempted to invade Muzhou. Now, residents in the tenth, eighth, and ninth districts of the county, due to the intensified harassment of the waterways by the Japanese puppets, have been separately evacuating people and property in recent days. Women and children in Gujing, Meige, Sanjiang, and Yaxi have also been evacuating to avoid Japanese oppression.

### Rectification of Tax Collection Agencies in Various Counties; Merger and Reorganization into Tax Collection Offices; and Formulation of Wartime Tax Exemption Measures in War Zones

(Qujiang Quick News) The recent important work of the Department of Finance includes: (1) Taking over the documents and public property transferred from the Guangdong Finance Commissioner's Office. Since the Guangdong Finance Commissioner's Office was ordered to close, all managed public property, documents, and cases of advance pension funds have been listed and transferred. The Department of Finance took over the handling of the pension cases and continued to process them. The remaining documents and public property have been checked against the list and stored separately. (2) Adjusting the county tax collection agencies. The temporary land tax collection offices, collection offices, and county tax collection offices were established separately, resulting in inconsistent authority, high costs, and inconvenient supervision. To centralize authority, coordinate expenses, and improve the tax collection system and efficiency, the original temporary land tax collection offices, collection offices, and county tax collection offices will be merged and reorganized into tax collection offices, scheduled to be implemented on July 1 of this year and submitted to the provincial government for review. (3) Preparing for the publication of a Tax Affairs Bulletin. The Department of Finance is actively promoting wartime policies. To improve the efficiency of tax administration and facilitate communication among tax agencies to achieve the goal of rectifying tax affairs, a Tax Affairs Bulletin is being prepared for publication on a regular basis. (4) Drafting essential regulations for the duties of tax bureau chiefs. Rectifying tax administration requires prioritizing the revitalization of the service spirit. It has been found that some tax bureau chiefs occasionally leave their posts without authorization, and newly appointed chiefs often fail to take office promptly, resulting in a lack of responsible personnel for tax work and affecting tax revenue. Strict rectification is urgently needed to emphasize duty. Regulations on the duties of tax bureau chiefs are being drafted for evaluation. (5) Announcing measures for tax exemption in disaster-stricken counties in war zones. The Department of Finance, in accordance with the order of the provincial government and the consultation of the Ministry of Finance, has formulated the second phase of the wartime administrative plan, implementing specific solutions and adjusting local wartime finance measures. Regarding the first measure, the Department of Finance has drafted measures for tax exemption in disaster-stricken areas and counties, which have been submitted to the provincial government for amendment and approval and ordered to be followed by all subordinate units.

### Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match; Both Associations Plan to Continue the Event; Multiple Football Rules Need to be Amended; Both Sides Jointly Propose Discussions

The Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended for two sessions due to the current situation. However, both the Hong Kong and Shanghai Football Associations hope that the next session (1939-1940) can be resumed.

At the same time, both associations are busy amending the regulations for interport football to increase public interest. The most important discussion for both sides is whether players who are employed in Guangzhou or Macau but whose families reside in Hong Kong can still represent Hong Kong, and whether it is reasonable for naval players who participate in Hong Kong league matches but cannot be selected for interport matches. Both sides are currently considering these issues and hope to reach a satisfactory resolution.

Recently, the Hong Kong Football Association presented a set of draft football regulations to the Shanghai Football Association for discussion. However, it did not mention the proposal to temporarily suspend the interport matches due to the current situation. The Shanghai Football Association, wanting to resume the interport matches as soon as possible, has accepted most of Hong Kong's proposals. The important rules that need to be amended by both sides are as follows:

(1) The annual "Interport Cup" should be held in Hong Kong and Shanghai in rotation. This cup is limited to competition between the Hong Kong and Shanghai teams. (Previously, Tianjin also participated).

(2) Players recognized or registered by the Hong Kong and Shanghai associations can be selected as interport players, regardless of their residency status.

(3) Each port can only select three military personnel, including naval players employed on ships at sea.

Other rules that need to be amended include a proposal on how to resolve ties in interport matches.

The Shanghai side has proposed adding 30 minutes of extra time. It is not yet certain whether the Hong Kong side will agree, but most committee members support adding 20 minutes of extra time.

The above amendments have not yet been finalized and will likely be decided before the start of the next football season.

### Shenbao Cup Charity Basketball Games; Two Games at YMCA Tonight

Two games in the Shenbao Cup Women's Charity Basketball Tournament are scheduled for tonight. The first game is at 7 PM, with Zhonghua vs. Southwest. The second game is at 8 PM, with Zhixing vs. Huaxiong. The strengths of the two teams in the first game are fairly balanced. The former is a newly formed team with strong players such as Liu Shouguang, Yu Shangying, and Rao Huizhen. Southwest is also strong, with players such as Zhu Zhixian and Wu Ruixin, who are among the best in the army. This match is expected to be fierce. Zhixing in the last game is a strong team in Hong Kong and is comparable to this year's champion, Meifang. Although Huaxiong is a new team, its fighting spirit is very good and should not be underestimated. This battle is also expected to be very interesting. The player rosters for the four teams are as follows:

(Zhonghua) Li Chunyu, Zhang Runlan, Yu Shangying, Rao Huizhen, Rao Huifen, Liu Shouguang, Yang Yuqiong, Mu Zhen, Cui Li, He Jingxiong, Rong Xianhong, Rong Meikui,

(Zhixing) Chen Rongtang, Chen Qizhen, Deng Yanhao, Lin Shaoping, Huang Yiru, Wen Weiqiong, Li Shizhen, Sun Yuming, He Defen, Lu Qing, Kuang Xiuzhen, Gu Bimei, Jin Huanxian, Chen Jinchai, Xi Huizhuang, Du Lanxi, Liu Jiezhen, He Zhuosheng, Liang Baoxian, Du Zhi, Zhao Guizhen,

(Huaxiong) Lei Yuegui, Chen Qixia, Zhong Ziqing, Zhou Shuqi, Zhou Duan, Luo Wensu, Lu Gonglu, Wen Cuiyu, Peng Yanxiu, Wu Wenfeng,

(Southwest) He Huanxiang, Qiu Meili, Tang Xingliang, Feng Zhenhua, Zhu Lan, Zeng Qunying, Zhu Zhixian, Wu Ruixin, Wu Suzhen, Li Chanqing, Zhang Huiying,

### From Ancient Greece to the Olympic Games

— Ding Ying

— A Precious History of Sports —

Athens

Education in Athens was also focused on martial arts, but not to the extreme like Sparta. Because Sparta was located in a mountainous area, its nature was stubborn and unyielding. Athens, occupying the eastern gateway of Greece, with convenient transportation and thriving commerce, naturally had literary cultivation, musical interests, and social enjoyment. In the sixth century BC, Athens also produced a great man named Salon, who, seeing the different residents in various mountains, plains, and coasts, often had many disputes. Therefore, he specially stipulated a constitution.

(1) Education of Children: Children were entrusted to wet nurses for care after birth and were also subject to national inspection. The right to abandon them was transferred to the parents. Before the age of six, they spent their lives on their mothers' laps. The methods of playing were already practiced with many variations. We can still discover the relics passed down from them. Reading, arithmetic, music, and gymnastics were equally emphasized because the aim of the Athenian educational method was the completion and harmony of the individual. School education was only a private obligation. How far national education should reach was determined by the family's wealth and the father's will. However, the person responsible for direct education was also a tutor with the status of a slave. These tutors were often failed refugees, and their character was not questioned, and their pay was not fixed. According to the constitution, at the age of seven, children entered wrestling schools to practice gymnastics, music, and dance in preparation for the sacrifices at the shrine. After the age of eighteen, musical practice ceased, but gymnastics continued. Although the focus of gymnastics was on national defense, it also paid attention to balanced development. Salon's legislation emphasized that music was for promoting the spirit and gymnastics for developing the body. Therefore, later generations referred to Sparta as a martial arts education and Athens as a literary education. In fact, Athens was not without martial arts; it was just not as extreme as Sparta.

(2) Educational Institutions: The educational institutions in Greece were gymnasiums. Therefore, we can also say that Greek education was physical education. In the beginning, there were no complete gymnasiums, but rather simple and rustic markets and coasts. Later, they paid attention to the construction of physical education. The place for young wrestlers and boxers was called Palaestra, and the place for adults was called Gymnosia. Now, I will explain Platon's description of the construction of Gymnosia. Gymnasia were gymnastics fields for young people, with steam baths that were open to the public. There were dressing rooms called Apoduterion, oil application at the beginning of exercise called Claiothe, a place for rubbing with sand called Konisterion, a ball game field called Sphairlsterion, and a wrestling field called Xusioi. In short, the Greek Gymnasia were social gathering places for young people and adults over the age of eighteen. Famous places include Luksion Geum Kunassnges AeademeRlolenaoion, all of which have Gymnasia buildings. Because there were lecture halls, conversation rooms, and nursing rooms, they were actually clubs for Athenians. The etymology of schools in modern Europe mostly comes from this. The German high school is called Gymnasimn, and the French middle school is called Lycee as an example.

(3) Teachers: The teachers in the Athenian Gymnatsla had the following distinctions:

(A) Gymnastai were responsible for the general development and training of the body, equivalent to modern gymnastics teachers. (B) Pritolribai only taught sports methods, equivalent to modern competitive teachers. (C) Sophroncolai taught moral character, equivalent to modern ethics teachers. (D) Gyionnasiarchos was in charge of the whole, equivalent to modern principals.

(4) Teaching Materials: In addition to physical education, there was a course in moral education. The physical education textbooks included running, high jump, wrestling, discus throwing, javelin throwing, and the technique of combining boxing and wrestling called Pankration. There was also swimming, bathing, and ball games. Some people think they have already invented the sport of rowing.

(5) Equipment: Although sports were flourishing, the equipment was very simple, just spears, irons, and frames for high jumping, and gloves for boxing. (Three)

### Baseball Field Conversations Among Baseball People

Arguments can serve as explanations of baseball rules; humor provides after-meal amusement.

During the plum rain season, rainfall is abundant, and it so happens that every time the public baseball league is about to begin, the rain pours down, reducing the enthusiasm of players and spectators to zero.

Yesterday, two good games were just about to start when the rain forced a stop; however, although the games didn't happen, the people sheltering from the rain inside the field were packed tightly. "Old White Beard" Smith, wearing an American wide-brimmed cowboy hat, along with Hong Kong Club players Walker and Modun, Little Smith (also the baseball reporter for the South China Morning Post and the Hong Kong Club's second baseman), football star Li An'na, Western Club pitcher Palazi, South China Club's Wu Zhenbang, and others, gathered in a corner, talking and laughing.

During the conversation, Li An'na steered the topic towards baseball rules, questioning Little Smith, saying he had incorrectly recorded an "error" against him last Saturday. Little Smith replied, "You had two errors that day. One was when your opponent hit a fly ball, and you rushed forward to catch it, but your handwork wasn't smooth, and the ball slipped out of your glove and onto the ground. That's an error." Li An'na then retorted, "At that time, I was more than ten yards away from the ball's landing point, and I ran over at full speed. Before I could even steady myself, I reached out to catch the ball. The ball touched my fingertips and then slipped to the ground. That shouldn't be counted as an error." Little Smith said, "That ball clearly fell from your palm. How can that not be an error?"

Standing in front of Little Smith, Modun poked Smith's chest and interjected, "Your records are often unfair. I've suffered from your inaccuracies too." Little Smith, with a grin, asked, "How have you suffered?" Modun said sternly, "Last time, I caught a ball, and you still recorded an error. You need to know the definition of an error. It refers to delays, missed catches, and wild throws. Logically, if a player does their best within their ability, it shouldn't be counted as an error. For example, if a batter hits a ball that goes through the gap between the third baseman and the shortstop, and the runner gets a chance to reach first base, is that an error?" Little Smith quickly replied, "Of course not an error; it's a hit." Modun's anger subsided slightly, while Old White Beard remained silent on the sidelines, not taking sides.

Wu Zhenbang then told the reporter: Arguing about baseball is the most interesting and complex part of the game. Players must not only have agile bodies but also clear minds, quick hands and eyes, and courage and strategy to become successful players. Although the rules of the game are complex and difficult to understand, once you read them thoroughly and know how to apply them, you will feel the strictness and fun within them. For example, if there are runners on first and second base, or first, second, and third base, before two outs, and the batter hits an easily catchable fly ball to the infield, once the umpire announces "infield fly," whether the ball is caught or not, the batter is out. This rule protects the attacking side, preventing the game from becoming monotonous. If the umpire deems it not an "infield fly," then the fielders can pass the ball to each other to execute a "double play" or "triple play." Old Wu also said, "Our team's pitcher, Li Zhongzhen, is an engineer. He recently received an invitation from Chongqing and has already taken the route through Haiphong to take up his position. As a result, the South China team has lost another good player. Fortunately, the fierce general Zheng Biao is determined to join the military and will make an appearance this weekend."

The rain stopped slightly, and everyone went home. Hong Kong Club catcher Walker, in a humorous tone, pretending to be a baseball field recorder, shouted the slogan "No Run, No Hit, No Error," and then went down the hill. Only Walker with "No Run, No Hit, No Error," implying no ball game, made everyone laugh.
