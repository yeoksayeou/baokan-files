### Congratulations on the Opening of the National Education Conference

The National Education Conference is scheduled to open today in Chongqing. Many leading figures from the Hong Kong and Macau education sectors have also traveled to participate. At this crucial time when the War of Resistance is transitioning from its first to its second stage, we must express our sincere expectations and best wishes for this conference, which is of great importance to educating the people and cultivating thousands of capable individuals to complete the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. We respectfully offer our humble suggestions for consideration by the attendees and the national education community.

Since the beginning of the all-out War of Resistance, our country's education system has begun a dramatic transformation, especially in the education within the northwestern war zones, which has started to progress at an accelerated pace. However, generally speaking, there is still no comprehensive systemic improvement that meets the needs of the War of Resistance. This is a regrettable matter for advancing the all-out War of Resistance and building a republic based on the Three Principles of the People. We should focus our efforts on this today. Not long ago, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party passed a resolution to "implement an educational policy for the War of Resistance, making education serve the long-term war." Education experts such as Mr. Tao Xingzhi have also loudly advocated for "implementing comprehensive education to support comprehensive resistance." Subsequently, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the recent Third National Political Council have made crucial resolutions regarding the improvement of education. We hope that this National Education Conference can, based on these calls and resolutions, and in light of the development of the War of Resistance and the needs of the country's future, determine the overall improvement of education. At the same time, we hope that the national education community will follow the fundamental principles of the above calls and resolutions, and proactively implement them according to the needs of the War of Resistance and the actual conditions of various regions. This is one point.

Among the resolutions regarding the improvement of national education passed by the recently concluded Third National Political Council are: the proposal by Liu Hengjing and 22 others that "Central government funding for compulsory education should be doubled year by year according to the original plan, in order to promote compulsory education in war zones and rear provinces"; "increasing the budget for general education and culture in the next fiscal year to actively promote national education among youth"; the proposal by Hu Shiqing and 27 others that "the government should allocate special funds to organize and expand specialized education in order to enhance educational effectiveness and increase the strength of the War of Resistance"; the proposal by Chen Shi and 21 others to urgently rescue the youth in the occupied territories from being exploited; the proposal by Luo Heng and 23 others to "cultivate talent for border affairs to strengthen national defense"; the proposal by Ma Liang and 20 others to "promote emotional understanding among various ethnic groups, build special education for Mongolians, Hui people, and Tibetans, and train a large number of people in the interior who are proficient in the languages and scripts of various ethnic groups"; the proposal by Zou Taofen and 43 others to "mobilize intellectuals across the country to eliminate illiteracy and popularize public awareness to benefit the War of Resistance and national reconstruction," and so on. All of these are important resolutions that meet the current needs of the War of Resistance. The National Education Conference must refer to these resolutions and stipulate specific implementation measures. At the same time, we hope that all overseas Chinese education communities will enthusiastically support them, striving for their realization in the shortest possible time. This is the second point.

Regarding the implementation of the overall educational policy for the War of Resistance, in our view, the most important aspects are: (1) the revision of the education system; (2) the strengthening and expansion of organizations; and (3) the promotion of specialized education. First, concerning the revision of the education system, the main point should be to abolish unnecessary and non-urgent courses from the past, reform unreasonable school management systems, so as to teach new courses needed during the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and at the same time pay attention to fostering students' initiative in learning. Second, regarding the strengthening and expansion of organizations, the main focus is on strengthening and expanding educational organizations in the occupied territories and rear provinces. At the same time, it is especially important to accelerate the establishment and expansion of a national anti-Japanese national united front within the education community, and the overseas Chinese education community should become one of the fundamental units of this united front. Finally, regarding the promotion of specialized education, the main points should be the following three: First, it is necessary to establish, expand, and strengthen various cadre schools to quickly train a large number of young cadres for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Second, it is necessary to widely develop mass education, organize various supplementary schools, promote the national literacy movement, drama movement, singing movement, and sports movement, and at the same time, quickly establish more popular local newspapers from before and after the war to improve the national culture and national awareness of the general public. Third, it is necessary to widely and actively promote compulsory primary education, promote the spirit of the Chinese nation, and cultivate a new generation to build a new China with a democratic republic, in order to realize the ideal of a thorough Three Principles of the People state! We hope that the National Education Conference and the domestic and international education communities will pay special attention to these three points. This is the third point.

The above three points are the basic principles and main measures for improving national education based on the new needs of the current new stage of the War of Resistance. We believe that the National Education Conference will have more satisfactory resolutions. We respectfully extend our regards to all attendees, and especially hope that the national education community will actively rise up and prepare to strive to complete the new tasks.

### Tian Han Speaks Freely About Drama and Other Matters

—Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya

Perhaps this is the good fortune of travel: In just one or two days in Changsha, I was fortunate enough to appreciate the art blooming from the scorched earth—the revolutionary playwright Mr. Tian Han's improvised performance of a reformed Hunan opera on a commemorative day!

The time was from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and the location was the Yin Gong Movie Theater. This theater can be considered the only surviving art palace after the Changsha fire: a new-style building, grand in scale, with the audience quickly filling every seat and even standing. It could probably hold two or three thousand people. I heard about it and went, but it was already packed, and a "Full" sign was hung high at the entrance because it was a free public performance for the masses.

There were four plays on the program, and I only saw the final act of Mr. Tian's reformed "Bie Mi Cong Jun" (Farewell, Secretly Join the Army) and the complete play of Hunan opera "Cai Wenji Joins the Army in Place of Her Husband." Most of the actors were fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls, and their costumes, performances, and play lyrics each had their own special touching qualities.

Mr. Tian and the famous film director Mr. Hong Shen were both sitting among the audience. At that time, thanks to a very enthusiastic female attendant, who shot me through the audience like an arrow, I was able to find them: Mr. Tian was wearing a grass-green military cap and a short, fur-collared leather coat, sitting upright and looking up, resembling a short, energetic commanding officer; Mr. Hong was sitting in the row behind him, also fully armed, with a robust physique and a dignified demeanor, completely different from his pre-war film director posture.

I personally have this concept: China has elevated its international status through the War of Resistance, and each individual also seems to have become great by participating in the War of Resistance. Perhaps because national character and personal character can both hold their heads high! At the same time, "When trimming flowers by the water, one must be intentional, always treat one branch as two," I think the two gentlemen, Tian and Hong, were not simply watching the play for the sake of watching the play; they were obviously putting a lot of thought into it, so they watched with extraordinary concentration.

Afraid of disturbing others, I only exchanged a glance with them when we first met, and then squeezed into a seat near Mr. Tian. At that time, the play was at its climax, and the audience was listening intently to the lyrics on stage. Mr. Tian softly asked me, "Have you ever seen Hunan Gaoqiang opera?" I said, "No." He smiled and glanced at the stage: "This is Hunan Gaoqiang opera!" Which made me a little embarrassed.

In my opinion—as a layman—local operas from other provinces, like Sichuan opera, often involve Gaoqiang singing. About six or seven out of ten plays involve Gaoqiang singing. Guizhou opera also includes some, but their tones are more sonorous and unrestrained, slightly different from the sharp and delicate Hunan opera. Mr. Tian's evaluation of Hunan opera's Gaoqiang singing is that it has a very high level and is a precious treasure of Chinese opera. Of course, he has his own unique insights.

Mr. Tian also talked a little about the comparison between Hunan opera and Peking opera. He said: The strengths of Hunan opera mostly lie in emotional dramas. It is genuine, passionate, delicate, simple, and graceful. In short, its spirit and overall appearance are like orchids in a secluded valley, with a uniquely charming style. The strength of Peking opera is its specialization in beauty, with a high degree of beautification, especially the superb skills and tense scenes of martial arts plays, which Hunan opera cannot match. The Chinese opera most famous abroad is not literary drama but martial arts drama. Hunan opera should learn from Peking opera to remedy its shortcomings in martial arts plays. In short, if actors from both Peking and Hunan operas can learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, they will definitely open up a new situation in the opera world.

No matter how high the level of any science, culture, or art, it is impossible to determine that it has reached the highest and most supreme peak. Mr. Tian hopes that the opera world will not have sectarian views and be stuck in its own ways. I think this view is very correct. Fortunately, dozens of actors from the Peking and Hunan opera troupes, under his leadership, are learning from each other, and it is expected that satisfactory results will be achieved soon, making the achievements of the two operas even more refined.

After the last play ended that night, Mr. Hong, having just returned from the Nanchang front lines, wanted to go back to the hotel to rest, but I went to Mr. Tian's residence—the Department of Finance—with him, and we continued our discussion in loud voices for more than an hour. From the time he left Shanghai, we talked about the drama promotion work he is currently promoting, and finally, he personally discussed his outlook on life, with insightful observations on the meaning of life.

Mr. Tian left Shanghai and came to the mainland on the day Shanghai fell in November two years ago. He said: When he passed through Nanjing, people were moving in a chaotic mess; civil servants were especially shaken. Among the many people he saw, only Ye Jianying maintained an optimistic attitude. Now that the War of Resistance has entered its second stage, people who are pessimistic are as numerous as stars in the sky, adding brilliance to each other, which is an unexpectedly good phenomenon.

After leaving Nanjing and returning to Hunan (he is from Xiangtan), he passed through Nanchang, and unfortunately the car overturned into the water, and almost everyone in the car was drowned. After arriving in Changsha, he borrowed 150 yuan from a friend and founded the "Anti-Japanese War Daily" on the anniversary of the January 28th Incident last year. On April 1st, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission was established in Wuhan, and Mr. Guo Moruo invited him to serve as the director of the Sixth Division of the Third Department, responsible for drama promotion. Mr. Hong Shen was appointed as the section chief in the same division, assisting in all aspects.

He said: The most interesting thing when working in Wuhan was holding the "Water Torch Parade"; from the Yellow Crane Tower on the river surface to the downstream of Hankou, one could see thousands of torches illuminating the river water into a bright and dazzling golden belt. In addition, there were hundreds of anti-Japanese war art propaganda paintings, which were illuminated by electric lights, revealing a beautiful and meaningful scene. He wrote a poem at the time to commemorate the unprecedented spectacle:

Before the sea of people and the magnificent pavilion,
Songs and electric torches rise from the楼船boats,
The old man by the river asks in a low voice,
How does this grand scene compare to the Northern Expedition years?

At the time when the anti-Japanese sentiment was at its highest, a group of artists collectively created a great anti-Japanese painting on the Yellow Crane Tower, extremely huge, as long as fifteen zhang, even painting the entire city wall into a picture, with 30,000 characters in it, all with vivid and profound expressions. If this painting is not destroyed by the invaders, it can be passed down to future generations after the lost land is recovered and embellishments are added.

After he went to work in the Third Department, he compiled ten anti-Japanese performing arts teams and two children's theater groups, each team (group) with about thirty or forty people; and he opened a "Wartime Training Class for Opera Actors Remaining in Wuhan," including Peking opera, Han opera, various operas, acrobatics, variety performances, etc., with more than 700 students. The training lasted for more than a month, and the cost of books, diplomas, and other expenses was only 200 yuan.

However, once, when he solicited donations from the students for winter clothes for the front lines, he immediately received more than 1,400 yuan. One person—not even a famous actor—generously donated 120 yuan alone, which made the principal (Tian concurrently) very embarrassed and had no choice but to donate a sum equal to the amount. Many actresses took off their gold-filled teeth, and especially took off their woolen sweaters, piling them into a small mountain. They are so enthusiastic—whoever sees them will be happy! At the same time, the school also invited Mr. Chen Cheng, Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Chen Lifu, Lu Diheng, and other gentlemen to give lectures, so that they could hear some advanced theories and see the demeanor of celebrities, and they also expressed their warm welcome!

Mr. Tian couldn't help but become excited when he talked about this. The scene of him and the elite students of the pear garden gathering together in a relaxed and elegant atmosphere is not difficult for us to imagine in this remaining afterglow.

About 6,000 outstanding students of the pear garden and new drama performance experts from various teams (groups) have emerged from under the hand of this master of salvation opera, and all are under the control of the Political Department. However, due to the nature of their profession, as long as the plot of the dramas performed by old opera actors does not violate the outline of anti-Japanese propaganda, then all performance activities can develop freely. As for new opera actors, that is, various anti-Japanese performing arts teams and children's theater groups, they are all directly commanded by the Political Department and are currently working separately in Nanchang, Pingjiang, Shashi, Guilin, Hengyang, Guiyang, and other places, but they are not fixed in one place but have mobility. The expenses of the teams are paid by the department, with each team member receiving a subsidy of about 25 yuan per month. In addition, the entire team receives a certain amount of office expenses. The young men and women who are generally engaged in work have a very difficult life; but their purpose is to save the country, and their spirit is extremely high and comforting.

After the Changsha fire, a group of Peking opera actors who had retreated here from Hankou, their gongs and drums silent, had no choice but to find their grand master—Mr. Tian—to ask to follow him and seek further progress. Mr. Tian, with a sense of duty, invited them all, including their families, to live in the Department of Finance, where they did not have to pay rent; however, they had to abide by three rules: First, break the boundaries between Peking opera and local opera (that is, Hunan opera), and study and learn from each other with the original local opera actors, each absorbing the advantages of the other, in order to realize the new situation in the opera world that he wants to create in his ideal. Second, break the class system of actors, so that the status of famous actors and ordinary actors is equally equal. Third, break the old custom of one person singing opera and the whole family eating, and all old opera actors who are willing to join the new era opera team, their family members, regardless of women and children, must each take up a performing position. As a result, they all fully accepted and implemented it, so the results are remarkable and considerable. I think that among these three measures, the second and third have revolutionary significance and are especially worthy of universal promotion.

He was originally a celebrity who advocated and wrote new dramas, but he objectively said: Old opera gave him an inspiration, and its effectiveness is even greater than new drama. Most people over middle age are accustomed to traditional opera; and the number of old opera actors in each center is also very considerable. If there are full preparations in advance, coupled with strict organization and training, and new blood is instilled in the required scripts and materials, won't they become excellent and readily available propaganda tools? It is a pity that the slogan of reforming old operas has been loudly chanted for more than ten years, but in reality, very few playwrights can truly work in this direction, and the production of scripts using the "old bottle filled with new wine" method is even as rare as a phoenix feather or unicorn horn! Mr. Tian, when talking about the problem of "script shortage," also expressed his deep apologies, regretting that he could not immediately "hang up his military hat" and return to his writing career.

Naturally, although he is now bearing the "rank of general," he has not completely broken away from his writing career in practice. The Anti-Japanese War Daily, which he had previously founded by borrowing money from a friend, has been relocated to Yuanling and republished, with more than 500,000 fonts cast, which is a cultural foundation that he is currently supporting. Here, after the fire, another small "New Changsha News" was started, but because there are other large newspapers and paper is in short supply, it was recently planned to stop publication. But thinking about the 60 or 70 small newspaper vendors who were dedicated to the war, and whose lives could not be solved, I had no choice but to make things difficult for them. Still struggling to publish. These small newspaper vendors were all homeless children on the streets of 11 or 12 years old who were recruited and trained by the newspaper. In their spare time, they were also taught to sing and perform, and their talents were no less than those of children's theater groups.

Regarding this, I don't admire Mr. Tian's benevolent heart and his actions as a philanthropist, but I admire his spirit of "teaching without discrimination" and his practical verification that these pitiful children abandoned by society also have certain talents. If they received the same education as the privileged children of wealthy families, with the spirit of hard work and striving for progress that they have cultivated in their special environment, the so-called "unintentional planting of willows yields shade," their achievements would probably be much greater than those of other fortunate children. Therefore, I sincerely hope that those who are engaged in wartime children's relief work should not only focus on the rescue of children in the war zone with registered families, but should also shift their eyes to the street children in various places in front of them, so that they can be bathed in the social grace and avoid the regret of leaving out gems.

After that, Mr. Tian's explosive speech style lightly blew from the colorful opera world to the quiet and beautiful field of music. He himself has a high interest in music, and he especially praises the works of famous composers Nie Er, Zhang Shu, and Xian Xinghai. After a while, he bowed his head and slowed down his tone, saying: He cried once when he first heard the news of Nie Er's death in Nanjing prison; recently, Zhang Shu was unfortunately bombed to death by the enemy in Guilin, which made him feel uncomfortable for several days. Because Zhang Shu often worked with him when he was nineteen years old, and he also benefited from him and suffered losses from him, and they had been in prison together in Nanjing. Although Zhang Shu was poor, he could work hard; although he was straightforward, he could be knowledgeable and remember well, especially with a talent for composing. The anti-Japanese war songs he painstakingly created were numerous and widely sung for a time. Now, unfortunately, he died in a flying disaster with his beloved daughter, which is not only a great loss to the art world! The tone of his speech had become so gentle that it could no longer be more gentle. I instinctively glanced at his face, and it turned out that he was already in tears—at that time, the candlelight was flickering, and the scene felt even more desolate; our conversation also stopped invisibly. At that time, I secretly thought: Mr. Tian's character is known to be not only a tough revolutionary playwright, but also a good and emotional gentleman! But in an instant, there was a kind of light whisper that seemed to be blowing from an empty valley, calling me back from the humorous and solemn realm to listen again. .

"I feel that a person's life is very limited, especially during this war," Mr. Tian said coldly; but the atmosphere was still quite serious: "We should try to seize the time as much as possible, so that we can quickly do some beneficial and meaningful things for the country, the people, and the community! I personally find it difficult to deal with the social obligations involved in most work, especially being an official. People like us are really not up to it. I was already bored after less than a year in the Political Department. What suits me is still holding a pen, so I have already sent a telegram to resign." Judging from this, Mr. Tian really wants to retire from his official post.

"I have never been pessimistic about doing things, and I often accomplish what I want to do." He continued, picking up his spirits: "At the same time, life force cannot be wasted. Being a small official may not benefit the country, but it will greatly harm myself. I will resign and go to the Yuanling Anti-Japanese War Daily to hold a pen and write more pamphlets that contribute more to the country and society than being an official!" His conversation ended here.

But we must remember: A person's life is limited, and we should take the opportunity to do beneficial things for the country and society, especially in this great era when the nation and the people are fighting to the death with violence, we should contribute our strengths to the country as much as possible, so as to avoid wasting personal time and causing harm to the nation!

### Fierce Battles Along the Xiang River Bank; Enemy Attempts to Breach the Xiangsha Connection; Enemy Morale in Yuekou Area Dwindling

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, February 28th] Although the enemy is now claiming they will invade the Southwest and Northwest, according to military assessments, a major war is unlikely to break out in the short term. The enemy is currently focusing on clearing out our guerrilla units north of the Yellow River. They have two divisions in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, two divisions between the western section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Tongpu Railway, and two divisions in Shandong, along with one garrison brigade. We have increased our troop strength in each of these areas sufficiently to crush their ambitions. In Chahar and Suiyuan, there are still two divisions in total, with no recent increases. The enemy's 21st Division has recently moved to the Kaifeng area, attempting to attack our guerrilla forces nearby. The situation in western Shanxi and southern China is quiet. The enemy is increasing its forces towards Jiujiang, seemingly with new intentions. This is because our security forces on Hainan Island continue to resist. The enemy does indeed have a total of one division on Hainan Island, consisting of one regiment from the 5th Division (most of the division is in Shandong), the Taiwan Army's Hotta Regiment, and three battalions of naval infantry. The enemy has not increased their forces much in Hubei. Recent incursions into the west are still limited to local engagements.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, February 28th] According to Chinese sources, the enemy recently launched an aggressive westward offensive from Wuhan, with the apparent goal of capturing Jingmen, south of Anlu. It is reported that Japanese troops occupied Jingmen last night. Jingmen is located between Shashi and Xiangyang. This move by the Japanese aims to cut off the connection between Shashi and Xiangyang and sever the transportation routes between Henan and Changsha. The Japanese are also attempting to advance westward and seize the key Yangtze River points of Yichang and Shashi. Because the Japanese have occupied Yichang, it can be used as an air base to bomb Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming. The evacuation of families is limited to ten days and the city is actively preparing for all fire prevention and rescue equipment in case of Japanese air raids.

[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, February 28th] The war situation in central Hubei was relatively quiet today. The enemy forces that invaded Yuekou attempted to cross the Xiang River three times but were repelled by our troops. They are now rushing to build fortifications and defend their position. Our forces on the Hanyi Road are attacking and advancing towards the enemy in Wamiaoji. The enemy occupying Sanyangdian suffered over a thousand casualties. After a fierce counterattack by our powerful forces, they are showing signs of collapse. There are over a thousand enemy troops north of the Xi River, operating in the Xujiaan and Yujiaan areas.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, February 27th] The morale of the enemy on all fronts in central Hubei has been dwindling after being met with separate attacks by our forces in recent days. On the Jingzhong Road, our forces are facing off against the enemy near Shilipu. The enemy in Yuekou is rushing to build fortifications and defend their position, with no further ability to advance. In the Sanyangdian area, after several days of bloody fighting, the enemy has made no progress. The enemy is focusing its efforts on fiercely attacking our forces on the front of the highway. Our officers and soldiers are resisting heroically, fighting to the death. A fierce battle is currently underway at Yanmen Pass.

[Special Dispatch from Our Chang'an City Office, February 28th] On the 20th, the enemy at Muluan Township advanced northeast but was ambushed by our forces, resulting in over twenty enemy deaths. The enemy then fled back.

[Minkuo News Agency, February 28th] There are two enemy field guns stationed inside Yongji City, and two hundred enemy troops in Nanyang Village. They have been harassing the area daily, looting over a thousand head of livestock and household items such as reed mats and dishes from the people. Wherever they go, they force the people to hang the Japanese flag, or else the entire village will be punished. On the 18th and 19th, over 1,400 enemy troops from Linfen moved to Hongdong Zhaoyu, stationed near the city. On the 21st, a unit of over 300 enemy troops from Zhaocheng operated in the Yuanchuan (southeast of the city) area, severely harassing the people along the way. Enemy military transport is very busy between Fencheng and Shicun. Our forces are constantly attacking them, with considerable gains, it is said.

[Reuters, Beijing, February 28th] A traveler returning from Baoding said that Chinese guerrillas had destroyed the depot a few miles north of Baoding and had also destroyed part of a freight train. The guerrillas then attacked the freight train again, destroying 200 yards of the railway track, greatly hindering transportation, it is said.

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, February 27th] The enemy forces invading Huaihai have now increased to three regiments, namely the Horikawa 32nd Regiment, the Rikuno 33rd Regiment, and the Yanagita 95th Regiment, equipped with five aircraft and over 20 tanks. They are attacking Shiyang along one route, invading Huaiyin along another, and advancing towards the East Sea along a third. Large-scale and fierce battles have been unfolding daily between the Zheng-Hai Highway's Riji-Hanji area and the Yanghe-Yangjing-Daxing area. The 26th and 27th were particularly intense. Our heroic soldiers on all fronts are resisting step by step, fighting bitterly for three days and nights, yet remain extremely excited. Clear sounds of artillery fire can be heard in Huaiyin these days. At noon on the 27th, five enemy aircraft bombed Heyang County. Enemy forces in southern Shandong also invaded Ganyu on the 26th, dividing into three routes, one from Huandun, one from Tuowang, and one from Heilin. County Magistrate Zhu Aizhou led troops to block them, and the fighting was also fierce.

[Central News Agency, Wuzhou, February 27th] The enemy invasion of Hainan Island has encountered strong resistance from our local forces, resulting in extremely heavy casualties. They are now redeploying troops from Taiwan to reinforce them. The enemy troops besieging Weizhou Island are forcing the island's people to obtain "obedient citizen certificates."

### Tianjin Enemy Controls Foreign Exchange; American Merchants Indignant; Letter to U.S. Government Authorities Requesting Protest

[Associated Press, Tianjin, February 28th] The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to implement control over export exchange rates starting March 10th. The American Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull and the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Pitman, yesterday, requesting that the U.S. government send a note to Japan protesting this matter, saying that after this is implemented, the export of goods from North China to the United States will be greatly reduced, it is said.

### Ruan Muhuan and Others Have Escaped Danger; Puppet Troops Could Not Bear to Harm Them; Two Attendants Killed

[Central News Agency, Xingji, February 27th] Seven people, including Ruan Muhuan, a famous professor from Peiping and the political director of the Suiyuan local army, and Zheng Lian, the army's secretary, were rumored to have been killed last December during the reorganization of puppet troops. Reliable sources now confirm that Ruan and Zheng have turned danger into safety and have safely arrived in central Hebei. Previously, the puppet troops in Gengzhuang, Dongshan, Fengzhen, and other places indicated to Ruan and others their intention to defect. Ruan, knowing that these puppet troops were from the forces of ××× and others, initially did not suspect anything. He and Zheng Lian, along with five attendants, lightly equipped, went to the puppet troops' station to give a speech on the reorganization. Unexpectedly, the puppet troops detained all of them and forcibly confiscated the firearms of a certain detachment under Ruan's command. This matter was discovered by the enemy side, who immediately demanded Ruan and Zheng. The puppet troops could not bear to harm them, so they killed two attendants in their place. Thereupon, Ruan and Zheng were released, disguised themselves, arrived in Tianjin, and detoured back to central Hebei. They recently sent a telegram to a friend in the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi border region, reporting the details of their escape.

### Jiangnan Guerrilla Forces Launched 95 Attacks in the Past Month

### British Government Considering Sending Warships to Hainan Island; House of Commons Discusses Hainan Issue; Members of Parliament Raise Questions One After Another

[Central News Agency, London, February 28th] Sir Milner, a Conservative Member of Parliament, raised a question in the House of Commons yesterday, asking whether the government intends to send cruisers to protect British interests on the island during the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island.

Undersecretary of State Butler replied that the government would consider this matter, but that it had not yet made any representations to Tokyo.

### President Kong Reports on Recent Administrative Adjustments at the National Political Council (Continued from Yesterday)

——Part Three of the March Political Report——

At the local level, the main focus is on strengthening political institutions below the provincial level. Our country's politics, at the central and local levels, were originally a unified institution. Whether it was a county, prefecture, district, or province, they were all areas divided for administrative convenience. The provincial government is an agency connecting the top and bottom. In reality, the provincial chairman is an official who executes central decrees, promotes central virtues, soothes the people within the province, and represents the central government in supervising local politics. As for the war zones, because transportation is mostly cut off by the enemy, the administrative inspectorates must be re-divided based on national defense, transportation, and economic conditions. It must be determined that the commissioners do not concurrently serve as county magistrates, and the organization of the commissioners' offices must be strengthened to ensure that the commissioners fulfill their responsibility to direct local administrative agencies. The county magistrate is an official close to the people. In the second phase of the war of resistance, we must select, examine, train, and appoint qualified and capable personnel to serve as county magistrates, guaranteeing their tenure so that they can go ahead and do it. Because the power exerted by a good county magistrate is greater than that of a division of troops. Counties with a population of over 500,000 should be changed to special-grade counties, and the county magistrates should be treated as appointed officials. This is a key point of the second phase of the wartime domestic policy plan. Regarding military affairs, I only need to say one sentence now, which is that our current combat strength, whether in spirit or in material terms, is far superior to what it was before the July 7th Incident. Now I should briefly explain the administrative situation in the war provinces.

Administration in Guerrilla Areas

We usually like to use the term "occupied area," but in fact, this term is extremely inappropriate and can easily cause misunderstandings both domestically and internationally. The places where the enemy troops arrive are all war zones, whether it is positional warfare or mobile warfare. We are now trying to examine the administrative conditions of eleven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi. These eleven provinces have a total of 941 counties, of which 583 counties have their county boundaries intact, and the county magistrates are still stationed in the county seat and are working as usual. This type of county accounts for 62% of the total. Secondly, in 35 counties, the county magistrates are still working in the county seat, but part of the county has been temporarily occupied by the enemy. There are also 245 counties where the county seat has been occupied by the enemy, but the county magistrate can still exercise his powers in the countryside. This type accounts for 26% of the total. There are also 23 county magistrates who have moved to neighboring counties, but they have not lost the ability to exercise their powers, and their orders can still reach their county. Finally, there are 55 counties that have been completely occupied by the enemy, and the county magistrates' powers cannot be exercised for the time being. This type accounts for only 6% of the total, and of these 55 counties, 42 are in Hebei Province, and of these 42 counties, 22 are within the "Jidong Special Zone" organized by the traitor Yin Rugeng before the July 7th Incident. After a year and a half of bloody battles, the new places occupied by the enemy, apart from cities such as Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, are only 33 counties. In these cities and counties, our guerrillas still frequently give the enemy all kinds of unexpected threats and attacks. You can see how insignificant the enemy's political gains are.

Establishment of the War Zone Party-Government Committee

The administrative adjustment in this vast war zone is a very complex issue, and its importance is no less than that of reorganizing the army. The government's adjustment plan is to divide the war zone into two parts, one part that we can call the front-line area, and another part that we can call the secondary front-line area. In order for the central government to closely link the party, government, and military agencies in the front-line area, enhance efficiency, strengthen institutions, and employ talented people to adapt to the wartime system, a War Zone Party-Government Committee has been established to unify orders and coordinate steps. We believe that in the future, we will be able to give the enemy even greater blows from their rear. Within the secondary front-line area, we also have various measures that are tailored to the time and place. In some places, we increase the powers of the county magistrate or commissioner, allowing them to act on their own and resist independently. In other places, if several administrative inspectorates are too far away from the provincial government seat and transportation is often disrupted by the enemy, the Executive Yuan should approve the establishment of an administrative office (or office) at the request of the provincial government. These measures are all to adapt to special circumstances. In addition to the above, there are several noteworthy matters in domestic policy work.

Implementation of the Military Service Law

The implementation of the military service law was originally a pioneering effort in our country, and it has encountered considerable difficulties in the past, as you all know well. The basic conditions for implementing military service must be to raise the anti-war sentiment of the people across the country and to strengthen the administrative institutions at the grassroots level so that joining the army becomes a social trend, which can then proceed smoothly and without hindrance. These two necessary conditions have taken decades of effort to achieve in other countries. The government's improvements to the implementation of the military service law include increasing the treatment of draftees, sincerely treating the families of soldiers on expedition, intensifying military service propaganda, and improving the baojia system. If one-twentieth of our country's 450 million people were to serve in the military, we could mobilize 22.5 million people. Compared to the 3 million people mobilized by the enemy country, seven Chinese soldiers can fight one Japanese soldier. How can there be any concern that we cannot drive the enemy out of the country?

Improving the Baojia System

In recent years, although a few people have criticized our country's current baojia system from a theoretical point of view, regardless of the right and wrong in this, we will not discuss it for the time being. If we did not have the baojia system, military service would simply be impossible to carry out. The shortcomings of the baojia system should, of course, be improved. The government has decided to start by raising the treatment of baojia chiefs and carefully selecting baojia talents. Concrete plans have been announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is currently planning a training program for baojia chiefs to strengthen the baojia system. We hope that all provinces will follow suit as soon as possible. (End of part, to be continued)

### Peace Conference: British Prime Minister Has No Intention of Convening

[Central News Agency, London, 28th] Prime Minister Chamberlain formally announced in the House of Commons that the British government had recognized the Franco government. When a certain member of parliament asked whether the government would convene a world peace conference, Chamberlain replied that the government believed that the first step toward lasting peace should be to limit armaments and remove restrictions on international trade. Preliminary preparations should be made before convening a world peace conference. Now is not the time to convene such a conference; even if it were convened, it would be ineffective. When the time comes to convene a peace conference that can be effective, his party will come forward to convene it.

### ×The Implementation of a Poisoning Policy in Western Shanghai×Special Service Department Supplies Narcotics in Large Quantities in an Attempt to Collect Funds to Cover Military Expenses

[Shanghai Correspondence] According to the North-China Daily News, crimes and assassinations are rampant in the western district of Shanghai, and the most insidious threat among them is opium. There is a risk that all the people in the area will be corrupted. With the permission and assistance of the Japanese authorities, opium is transported to earth shops openly operating in the area. Although the Public Works Department has protested and foreign residents outside the West District Concession roads have also voiced complaints, the authorities outside the concession have ignored this and have been able to rapidly implement their plan. Today, the situation in that area can only be described as "horrifying." The drug trade far outweighs other serious threats. Opium and other drugs can be legally sold in all areas ruled by the Japanese, and the steps toward corruption have already begun in Shanghai. The authorities collect money from the earth shops and reap huge profits. According to investigations, as early as January of last year, there was an attempt to establish earth shops in the western district, but these plans were not realized until the end of November. Eleven earth shops were established. The reason for the delay in the formal opening of the earth shops was that the Japanese wanted the owners of the earth shops to first pay a "deposit" of 3,000 yuan per year. Although the owners of the earth shops were unable to pay, to this day, as many as thirty-four earth shops are known to exist in the western district, all of which are highly profitable. It is expected that there will be more establishments established in the future, because in this trade, both the earth shop owners and the Japanese can greatly benefit. The earth shop owners must pay 1,000 yuan per month to the local ruler, but because the amount was too large, it was reduced to 500 yuan before they could operate. This opium is transported in large quantities from Hongkou by the Japanese Army Special Service Department and supplied to the earth shops. In mid-February of last year, the Earth Shop Association was established on Brenan Road, and the earth shop owners all joined the association as members. The association then moved to Jessfield Road. The authorities obtained huge amounts of revenue from the members of the association and used it to pay for military expenses. Therefore, they refused to transfer the earth shops in the area to the control of the "Reformed Government." In addition to the earth shops and gambling dens, a heroin smuggling center, under the fictitious name of Taichang (transliteration) Tobacco Exemption Store, was set up last month at No. 477 Robison Road, at the corner of Lou Lan Road. The operators seemed to be three Koreans, with some gangsters from the western district as the drug dealers. In January of this year, the Japanese authorities established the "Opium Smuggling Prevention Group" in the Jessfield Road area, presided over by Mr. Qi, the Japanese advisor to the "Shanghai Municipal Government," with an office at No. 21, Lane 61, Cayanna Road. The group is divided into two departments, one handling smuggling cases involving Japanese and Koreans, and the other handling cases involving Chinese. The funds for the group are obtained from the money collected from the earth shops. The fields and gardens are beyond question. At the end of last year, the "General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium" was established, with an office on the sixth floor of the Broadway Mansion, aiming to implement an opium monopoly plan in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The details of this group's actions are not yet known, but its establishment is undoubtedly intended to collect funds to pay for military expenses. In early August of last year, it was decided to establish an "Opium Monopoly Bureau" in western Shanghai, so it was planned to lease three houses at Nos. 6, 7, and 70, Lane 538, Connaught Road, as warehouses for storing large quantities of opium, but as far as is known, this proposed "bureau" has not yet started operations.

### Zhejiang in the Midst of Rebuilding and Education - A Record of Inquiries with Zhejiang Official Huang Shaoxiong - "Continued from Yesterday"

— Zhang Changren

× The Japanese are currently increasing their troops on the Nanxun Line, attempting to capture Nanchang and cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, blocking Zhejiang Province's rear lines. On the other hand, they are using × battleships to harass the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province,妄想to encircle the greater Zhejiang region. But Zhejiang is already prepared. Wen Zhong once said to Goujian: "There are nine strategies for avenging grievances and destroying enemies." His eighth strategy is "enriching the country and preparing sharp weapons," and the ninth strategy is "using armor to承其弊." He also said: "Judging things means we can fight; judging things means discerning right from wrong. If right and wrong are clearly understood, no one can deceive us." Fan Li also said: "If prepared, we can fight: if we are careful and守慎, we can wait for the unexpected; if we are prepared and守固, we can surely respond to difficulties." Greater Zhejiang is indeed only waiting for the opportunity. Before King Yue attacked Wu, he assembled his troops and列士, gave a great exhortation to the people, and vowed: "I have heard that the wise rulers of ancient times did not worry that their numbers were insufficient, but worried that their people had too little shame. Now Fuchai has 130,000 men dressed in rhino-hide armor, not worrying that their aspirations and actions have too little shame, but worrying that their numbers are insufficient..." This Fuchai is a portrayal of our current ×Japanese fascist military閥. We don't need to spend ten years gathering and ten years educating like Goujian before we can destroy the enemy. We only need to step up our rebuilding and education, constantly rebuilding and educating. In three years at the shortest, and five years at the longest, the people of the whole country will surely be like the people of Yue, with "fathers encouraging their sons and brothers urging their younger brothers, saying: 'Wu can be伐也!'" At that time, the 25 million people of greater Zhejiang will surely be a strong pioneer for the 450 million people to挞伐. (2.18)

### Britain Recognizes Franco, Heated Debate in the House of Commons, Labor Party Proposes Censure of the Current Government, French Foreign Ministry Also Announces Recognition

[Reuters, London, 27th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British government recognized the Spanish Franco government, stating that the government had given extremely慎 consideration to the situation in Spain. Since the fall of Barcelona and Catalonia, Franco now controls most of Spain's land, industrial centers, and production areas, much of which is in his grasp. Even if the government forces in the south can continue to resist, the outcome is now obvious. Prolonging the resistance will only increase the suffering and loss of life of the people. It seems that we can no longer recognize the涣散 original government as a government exercising sovereignty. Franco has publicly stated that he personally and his government are determined to maintain Spain's inherent independence and that only criminals should be tried according to伕. The government expresses its satisfaction with this. Chamberlain also said that the British government's recognition was unconditional. The government has also announced today its decision to recognize the Franco government. The House of Commons will hold a debate on this issue when it meets tomorrow. After Chamberlain announced the recognition, the opposition party responded with cries of "shameless," while the government faction cheered. The Labor Party decided to propose a motion to censure the government.

[Reuters, London, 27th] In the British House of Commons today, Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement that Britain recognized the Franco government caused an uproar. Attlee, the leader of the Labor Party's anti-government faction, said that the Prime Minister had stated last Thursday that there could be no further remarks on the issue of recognizing the 西叛 government. Why is he now announcing recognition? Chamberlain replied that the government had decided to entrust the final decision on this recognition issue to the Foreign Secretary and himself, and said that this move was decided last weekend. Attlee further asked when the decision was made. Chamberlain replied, "Without prior notice, I cannot say at what time it was decided." At this time, a Labor MP stood up and said, "You should be impeached for treason." Attlee said that Mr. Chamberlain had蒙蔽 the House of Commons last Thursday. Chamberlain replied that this was not the case, and said that the statements made at that time were factual. After an intense debate, Attlee said, "In the future, if I have any diplomatic questions, I will raise them in the appropriate place in order to obtain an appropriate response."

[Reuters, London, 27th] The British government recognizes the Spanish Franco government. The Labor Party has put forward a proposal to censure the government, expressing its opinion that "the strength of the Spanish叛军 is based on foreign interference, and the government has rashly given unconditional recognition. This is not something that a friendly country's legitimate government should do, and it is greatly contrary to international customs. The development of this policy will only cause democratic countries to lose confidence in Britain's sincerity."

[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] The cabinet held a state council meeting at 4 p.m. today, which unanimously resolved to recognize the Franco government as the legitimate government and instructed the Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the Franco government that all assets held by Spain in France should be returned in full. Prime Minister Daladier then submitted a report on the negotiations between Right-wing MP Villard and Franco government Foreign Minister Jordana, as well as the contents of the agreement reached between the two sides. The State Council, recognizing that Villard's mission had been completed, decided to commend and reward him. After Foreign Minister Bonnet reported on the general diplomatic situation, he announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was scheduled to meet on March 2 to decide on the first ambassador to the Franco government.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué today, announcing that France recognized the Spanish Franco government, stating that the French government was prepared to establish伕 and that property belonging to Spain would be returned to the Franco government, and that France and Spain had stated that they had a common意颐, that the two countries should maintain a friendly and harmonious relationship.

U.S. Attitude: Under Consideration

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The State Department announced that the U.S. Embassy in Spain, temporarily located in Panbinan, has now closed. Charge d'affaires桑斯顿 will go to Saint Jean de Luz. Ambassador Bowers has been there since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Diplomatic circles believe that if the United States also recognizes the Franco regime like Britain and France, then Bowers and桑斯顿 will both be dispatched to Madrid to establish the U.S. Embassy. Well-informed sources here believe that the United States needs to consider the recognition of the Franco government for a considerable period of time. There are two reasons for this: (1) Washington needs to pay attention to Franco's policies toward the countries in the north and south that have cultural ties with Spain, such as if he attempts to promote fascist propaganda in South America, it will arouse the aversion of the United States. (2) The U.S. government is closely watching how Franco treats the people he has conquered. If Franco takes drastic retaliatory measures against the leaders of the Republican government and their sympathizers, the United States will not recognize the Franco government.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] Spanish Republican government Foreign Minister臺爾伐育 returned to Madrid from Paris on Monday night. It is understood that臺爾伐育 was still in Paris on Sunday, so it must have been搭坐 a French飛 to return to Madrid. According to reports received indirectly here,台商伐育与奈格林 Prime Minister谈, the content is朱悉. It is said that台爾伐育 informed奈格林 about President阿省纳's 職事 (not yet officially confirmed) and the French government's willingness to结栆 the Spanish war.

[Reuters, Madrid, 28th] The leaders of the Spanish government recently held a商會 in Madrid and Valencia to consider actions. Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister臺爾伐靑 were recently in Valencia and will soon come here. It is believed that they will issue a statement clarifying the government's attitude.

German Government Expresses Welcome

[Haitong News Agency, London, 28th] This morning, British newspapers have written lengthy commentaries on the British and French governments' recognition of the Franco government as the legitimate government of Spain. The "Daily Telegraph" still insists on the point of view that refusing to recognize the Franco regime will无延长 the Spanish Civil War. The "Daily Mail" claims that everything must be practical and realistic, and that Britain's failure to judge the situation correctly when Italy occupied Abyssinia should not be repeated today. The newspaper also carries a special article on the front page stating that央国 has decided to send warships to the 马德里 area of Spain to evacuate 10,000 troops from the 西 government army, and that France and the United States have also adopted this measure. In addition, the left wing and the Labour Party in London's political circles指 during the debate in the House of Commons that Britain's recognition of the佛朋哥 government was an act of rebellion against public opinion. At the same time, the Labour Party's newspaper, the "Daily Herald," claimed that the 西 Republican government still exists and that Chamberlain's proposal to recognize General Franco as having the rights of a belligerent group was a卑污 act.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 28th] A German spokesperson said regarding Britain's recognition of the Franco government that although Britain's recognition was somewhat late, it was better than not recognizing it. Therefore, the government expressed its extreme welcome for Britain's actions. Spain is a part of Europe, so anyone concerned about peace in Europe welcomes any沙骤 to resolve the Spanish issue.

[Haitong News Agency, Canberra, 28th] The Australian government has resolved to follow Britain's example and recognize the佛朋哥 government as the legitimate government of Spain.

Italian-Polish Talks Conclude

[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] According to a dispatch from Warsaw by Geda, the editor of the Italian newspaper, Ciano's trip to Warsaw can be considered to have come to an end. It is said that the two sides only explained each other's positions and did not involve signing an agreement. Therefore, various speculations are wrong. However, the most noteworthy thing is that the Polish government showed a friendly attitude towards the Axis countries. This attitude itself is an important factor. This means that while the Polish government is loyal to the Polish-French alliance, it is still a tool for a policy that does not hinder the legitimate rights of Germany and Italy. According to the Italian press, the Polish government's intention to hold a leading position in the Danube River basin without the support of Germany and Italy does not seem to be in line with the position of Polish political circles. The newspaper believes that if 波欲 wishes to implement its policy in the Danube region, it can only cooperate with the Axis countries and other countries along the Danube River. The newspaper concludes that the result of Ciano's trip is not only to obtain a guarantee of friendship, but also to exchange opinions and clarify the general situation, and its true value can be见诺 in the future.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 28th] According to a message from 波京 by Geda, the editor of the "Italian Daily", Ciano's visit to 波, from a political point of view, has ended.盖 said that because变方 had no intention of concluding an agreement, it was only to clarify each other's positions. All speculations are baseless. 盖达叹叹各方 to pay attention to the Polish government's attitude, because if the Polish government continues to maintain an alliance with France, it will inevitably refuse to adhere to the policies of Germany and Italy. According to 艺达, the Polish government now wishes to preserve absolute independence and not be involved in any一方. 蓝达 concludes that Ciano's 之波尚 has further developments.

### U.S. Senate Debates Defense Bill; Sheppard Calls for Rapid Expansion to Defend Land and Sea Borders

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, Senator Sheppard, mentioned "the hostile attitude of certain dictatorial imperialist countries" when debating the government's $358,000,000 army and air force armament bill in the Senate today. His personal view, based on President Roosevelt's recent message to Congress, is that the U.S. Army must be expanded immediately so that it can reach the standard of 6,000 aircraft in 1941. He said, "Where are the land and sea boundaries of our country?菩人 cannot剧明, and what we need to defend is this boundary. The Panama Canal, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska are all important lines of defense for us. Once these military strongholds fall into the hands of the enemy, our country's security will be destroyed. If the Panama Canal cannot be controlled, our existing navy will no longer be able to protect both oceans, and our defense plan will collapse. We certainly hope that we do not have to resort to war to maintain the義门 Monroe Doctrine and the freedom of this 牟球, but if we cannot not fight, we must take immediate action." Republican Senator Vandenberg requested that before the bill is passed, the government must accurately explain the United States' foreign policy to Congress. He said that the United States will participate in the arms race, the pernicious effects of which will lead to the collapse of civilization, and the path will either be out of armed conflict or out of military bankruptcy.

Senate Democratic leader Barkley said that the Senate can hold a vote before this weekend, but some parties said that the passage of the defense bill may be delayed due to attacks from isolationist elements. However, it has become a foregone conclusion that the Senate will be able to formulate a bill based on this as soon as possible. The isolationist elements unanimously expressed their support for the internal affairs part of the defense bill, but they strongly opposed the President's recent remarks on foreign policy. They all believed that the United States should avoid accepting any restrictions outside the Western Hemisphere. Senators琼森,奈氏, and莱诺 all held this view.

Brief Commentary

### Please Learn from President Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife

President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to set an example and promote thrift and donations, made a private donation of $10,630 on the 27th. Moreover, President Chiang Kai-shek's usual banquets already adhere to a standard of no more than one dollar per person. In recent days, he has repeatedly used the buffet banquet promoted by the New Life Movement, which costs only 40 or 50 cents per person. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, also presented the $5,650 in royalties she recently earned from writing for newspapers and magazines. Because of this, overseas Chinese people were also moved to donate thousands of dollars.

This kind of behavior by the leading couple is, on the one hand, a demonstration for the whole country, enough to make the greedy honest and the cowardly stand up. On the other hand, it demonstrates to the world the greatness of the Chinese national spirit and the infinite hope for the future, enough to increase international sympathy and assistance.

Our war of resistance and nation-building is an extremely arduous undertaking, and we must concentrate and unify all living and non-living forces in the country. The premise for concentrating and unifying these forces is that every Chinese child who does not want to be a slave to a subjugated country can endure extraordinary poverty and hardship. The senior leaders leading the war of resistance are mostly able to endure hardship, such as Mao Zedong and others, who have long been praised by foreigners for only receiving a national currency salary of two yuan per month. Now, President Chiang Kai-shek is doing his best to reduce his private living expenses and donate them to the country and the nation, which is even more worthy of national love and learning. In particular, given President Chiang Kai-shek's position and status, he still stipulates that the cost of a meal should not exceed one dollar (equivalent to only five dimes in Hong Kong dollars!). How should we reflect on and correct our daily lives even more! Secondly, Madame Chiang Kai-shek's enthusiastic donations should especially be a model for every well-fed woman. If every woman can correct current malpractices, earnestly save money, and encourage her lover, husband, and children, the benefit to the country and the nation will be beyond what ordinary figures can express.

We hope that in addition to admiring President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, everyone will quickly resolve to learn from their perseverance and struggle, do their best to reduce material enjoyment, and do their best to dedicate all their intelligence, resources, and wealth. If we endure temporary hardships today, we can enjoy eternal freedom and happiness in the future. This matter should be given special attention by our overseas Chinese.

### Hitler's Mouthpiece: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels

— Translated by Shi Chang, originally published in the February issue of Parade magazine

Last October, from the sand dunes of the North Sea to the hills of the Sudetenland, 76 million Germans enthusiastically celebrated the birthday of one person. However, most of them did not like this person, and even more people hated and feared this person. This person is the well-known German Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Every radio station in Germany broadcast his biography, every newspaper published articles congratulating him, and came up with various reasons to praise his greatness. This was the grand occasion when all sectors of Germany celebrated his 41st birthday. Why was he so loved and welcomed? The reason is very simple: because if you don't celebrate his birthday, he can easily make you uneasy!

The smog-filled industrial area of ​​the Ruhr, known as the center of the German steel industry, has a city full of factories called Rheydt. This is where Goebbels was born. On October 29, 1897, Goebbels, who had weak legs, was born into a working-class family. His father was a foreman in a factory, and his mother was a blacksmith's daughter. This baby gradually grew up, and because of the disability in his feet, he became a limping child with a staggering gait. His large head and thin shoulders seemed out of proportion. He couldn't run as fast as other children, so he could only study. In his peculiar mind, he cultivated great ambitions and aspirations for the future.

In 1914, the unprecedented World War broke out in Europe. German youths rushed to the front lines to participate in the war. However, the 17-year-old Goebbels, because of the disability in his feet, could not serve in the military. He replaced military service with studying, running from one university to another, and diligently seeking knowledge. Finally, in 1921, he graduated from the University of Heidelberg with a doctorate in philosophy with excellent grades. At the same time, he also studied Marx and socialism.

At that time, the German revolution was brewing. If the French army had not occupied the Ruhr, Goebbels, who came from a working-class family, might have become a communist. The German people regarded the fall of the Ruhr as a great shame. At the same time, many workers overthrew the united "workers of the world" belief. Goebbels believed that this kind of national wound would one day form the rise of new nationalism. He also foresaw that this movement was an important tool for developing his ambitions. In 1922, he heard about the Munich National Socialist Party organization and its leader Hitler; at this point, he found the tool he had in mind.

Goebbels used his outstanding talent to organize the National Socialist Party's sound propaganda machine. He ran a newspaper with very little capital, named it "People's Freedom Newspaper," and gradually developed his ideas. No colleague believed him. Everyone called him "the devil in the party," but they all admired his talent. At first, he both hated and loved Hitler, envying Hitler for being the leader of the party. At the same time, he praised Hitler and knew very well that promoting Hitler's position was the only way to reveal his own wishes.

Goebbels received a high level of education and was knowledgeable. He was often praised as "Hitler's Brain Trust." He and Hitler's favorite Göring worked together to lead the National Socialist Party to success. Of course, the main figure behind the scenes was still Hitler. Hitler shouted: The sabotage of Jews and socialists turned Germany's glorious victory in the European War into a shameful failure. Goebbels heard the news and went everywhere to promote it, making every effort to use his "attack newspaper" to bring this baseless slander to the people of the country. This is the origin of the anti-Jewish movement. Undoubtedly, Goebbels was the main actor in initiating this tragedy.

Goebbels became famous in the political arena after 1926. In 1928, he was elected a member of parliament. In 1919, he took the important position of Director of Propaganda of the National Socialist Party. In 1933, after Hitler seized power, he appointed him as Minister of Propaganda. At that time, Goebbels was only 36 years old and became the youngest minister in German history. After he took office as Minister of Propaganda, he immediately controlled all newspapers, cinemas, theaters, radio stations and other propaganda-related businesses throughout the country.

Only a small part of the German people welcomed Goebbels. That small part was the workers in the Ruhr industrial area. Goebbels knew how to please the working class. Since 1920, he had shouted many times to the workers in Berlin: "Arise—young workers! You are the masters of the new Germany!" How touching! Hitler got the support of the labor community. Goebbels's achievements came first, but since the National Socialist Party came to power, it has not brought much benefit to the German workers. They are very pitiful. Except for a small part of the workers, Goebbels did not get the slightest affection from the people. They murmured to themselves, complaining, "This guy is a born devil. No sincere German is as cunning as him!"

People secretly complain. But they still enthusiastically celebrate Goebbels's birthday: Because this Propaganda Minister holds the highest authority, if you don't celebrate his birthday, he can easily make you uneasy!

### Before Negotiations on Compensation for the Bombing of Lo Wu, the Colonial Secretary Personally Investigates the Losses; The Investigation Is Complete and Negotiations Can Begin Next Week; British-Japanese Agreement to Designate Shenzhen as a Refugee Area

Regarding the British-Japanese negotiations on compensation for the bombing in Hong Kong, the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, told reporters yesterday that he personally went to the scene of the incident to investigate the damage caused by the Japanese aircraft bombing in Hong Kong. All the necessary investigation items have been completely completed today (28th). The investigation items include life, property, and land. This is a one-sided investigation, and no Japanese representatives participated. The negotiation date will probably begin next week. According to private investigations, the aircraft dropped six bombs on the British territory of Lo Wu that day, causing the following damage to Hong Kong's lives and property: (A) Eight people died; (B) The rear of the 11th military post was flattened; (C) The windows and doors of the 74th and 80th third-class carriages parked at Lo Wu Station were shattered, and the carriages were strafed by machine guns. The glass in the station garage was broken; (D) One telephone line from Lo Wu to Sheung Shui was destroyed; (E) A hole was blasted in the Kwang-Kow Railway roadbed between Lo Wu and Sheung Shui; (F) The air vent and fire box of the 3rd locomotive were destroyed; (G) The 47th bridge sign was destroyed. The official loss report has not yet been released. The above situations have been photographed and used as evidence by officials.

British-Japanese Agreement to Designate Refugee Area

Since the aircraft madly bombed Shenzhen on the 21st of last month, the Shenzhen refugee camp was also affected. At that time, more than × people were unfortunately killed or injured. For the sake of the safety of the people, the person in charge of relief affairs specially set up north and south refugee camps in Man Kam To, San Uk Ling, and the carriages in Fanling. The Hong Kong authorities believed that it was inconvenient to manage and provide relief to refugees in various places in Shenzhen. Therefore, they repeatedly consulted with the Japanese authorities, intending to designate the original Japanese refugee camp in Shenzhen as a reception center. However, the Japanese side requested that the responsibility for its management be entrusted to the Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Relief Association, just like the Baizhedong and Fangcun areas in Guangzhou that have already fallen.

Joint Work Ordered to End

The Hong Kong authorities accepted the proposal. Therefore, on the 26th of last month, they ordered the administrators of the north and south refugee camps in Fanling to end relief affairs by a certain date. From now on, the responsibility will be borne by the Chinese Emergency Refugee Relief Association. Other relief agencies and charitable organizations can be relieved of their responsibilities. After receiving the order, the Relief Group of the Relief Federation had to temporarily move food, miscellaneous items, and important staff to the Fanling Tea House to await the resolution of the Relief Federation Congress and Tung Wah Hospital. For this reason, Lin Jinsheng, director of the Relief Group, yesterday reported on the situation of relief affairs and its work. The report was tens of thousands of words long, so that people in the community could clearly understand the process. It briefly stated that since the end of last month, no less than 100,000 refugees have fled to Hong Kong and the border area.

The Entire Plan Was Blasted to Pieces

Chinese and Western people in Hong Kong set up shelters in various places in the New Territories. Later, for the sake of unified relief, the Relief Federation officials divided the districts into eight stations. Later, the government authorities ordered the Relief Federation to move all the refugees in each station to the former Japanese-owned Yiusang Company site in Shenzhen and build public camps there, in order to strictly analyze the local people mixed in with the refugees. After receiving the order, the Relief Federation began to relocate the stations one after another in December of last year, and all of them were completed by January of this year. It is estimated that apart from those who voluntarily asked to return to their place of origin and those who were unwilling to be accommodated, there were about 3,000 refugees. Just as the Relief Group of the Relief Federation was about to engage in educational facilities and industrial and handicraft undertakings, and was gradually getting on the right track, the strike of the aircraft on the 21st of last month shattered the entire relief plan. Although the general refugees have jointly appealed to the Relief Group to continue to handle it, it may be difficult to be effective due to the order of the authorities.

### Paying Warm Tribute to Young Friends! Our Newspaper's Essay Contest for Middle School Students; Award Ceremony to be Held This Afternoon at the Swiss Hotel

— Chi Cheuk

First, pay tribute!

Youth is the vanguard of the war of resistance, and youth is also the backbone of national construction. Our newspaper loves young people and hopes that young people will strive to love themselves. Therefore, the Hong Kong Middle School Student War of Resistance Essay Contest was held in the hope of encouraging middle school students' interest in writing and enthusiastically and correctly carrying out the sacred task of national salvation.

Fortunately, since the news was released, students from various schools have enthusiastically participated and submitted their essays one after another. This is indeed a gratifying and encouraging phenomenon. Up to the deadline, a total of 143 essays were received, and they have been judged and 25 names have been selected. They have been published in our newspaper in recent days. Detailed statistics can be found on the second page of today's newspaper.

I remember someone saying this: The three things foreigners do when they open the door are: milk, bread, and newspapers. However, it seems that many of our young friends have learned to drink milk and eat bread, but not many have learned to read newspapers. Seeing and being concerned about the news of our newspaper's essay contest, and being able to muster the courage to respond, these 143 young friends are indeed alert young people, lovely young people, and aspiring young people. We should first pay warm tribute to the 143 young friends who participated in our newspaper's War of Resistance Essay Contest.

Although we are limited by the number of places, we only selected 25 names; however, the other 118 have their own strengths in thinking and writing, and we have no discrimination in our spiritual encouragement and respect. Everyone has had one more learning opportunity, gained one more experience, and can be considered to have gained something. With this attitude, continue to work hard, and the hope for the future is limitless.

The Most Touching Appeal

In the 143 essays in this contest, it goes without saying that each has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, one student from a certain English college targeted the Hong Kong environment and issued a moving appeal, which really resonated with us deeply and applauded enthusiastically. His original text is:

"...We know that Hong Kong students, especially those who study English in English colleges, are the least organized and lack national consciousness. Because Hong Kong society needs English, there are a very large number of English colleges set up for Chinese people in Hong Kong. Although their tuition fees are very expensive, the number of students is always full, because most parents hope that their children can easily find a job in major foreign firms and government offices after graduating from English colleges. Because Chinese subjects are rarely used in such an environment, a very strong atmosphere of valuing English and despising Chinese has been formed in the Hong Kong English student community."

Then, this alert young friend also said something that many people want to say but haven't said: "The proof of this fact is that we often see and hear large groups of young men and women chattering and laughing in foreign languages, almost forgetting that they are Chinese!"

——Almost forgetting that they are Chinese, every word is a tear, how touching it is!

"If we want to spread the seeds of national salvation in such an environment, we must first eliminate the ××××× ideology, and always remember the generosity of the motherland and care about everything about the motherland."

"Hong Kong English students, in view of the seriousness of the national crisis, also have passionate shouts: "I want to join the ranks of national salvation! I want to join the ranks of national salvation" You see, Hong Kong University has been actively engaged in various national salvation activities recently, and there are also students from the American Academy on the list of serving the country."

How inspiring is the fact that Hong Kong students are making progress! The motherland is eagerly looking forward to such awakened children continuing to rise up!

A Gratifying Phenomenon

In the 143 essays in this contest, most of them are indeed making us pleasantly surprised at the awesomeness of the younger generation in terms of thinking and writing. The motherland is in rebirth, and the grandchildren of the Chinese nation are also advancing bravely.

The champion, Zhang Dalian, said: "...If we don't lay a good theoretical foundation, how can we organize and train the masses... So first, we must strengthen self-education... Use a research-style and critical attitude to read extracurricular books, and use reading seminars and self-criticism as reading methods... Secondly, external national salvation work must move from adapting to the environment to changing the environment, focusing on the practicality of work and not on the form of work... For the sake of true peace and for our eternal survival, we must make the greatest efforts and enthusiasm, not caring about all difficulties and setbacks, not wasting a minute of time, and advancing towards the future of the war of resistance."

The runner-up, Huang Baozhen, said:

"Even if there is a very rich and complete work plan, it is just a good-looking article, and it is difficult to address the current situation. We must use the winter vacation as an opportunity for reflection and improvement..."

In addition, there are many specific national salvation works, which are also pertinent and wonderful. Due to space limitations, it is inconvenient to describe them in detail.

Today's Award Ceremony

To commemorate this essay contest, our newspaper has specially set today at 2:00 p.m. to hold the award ceremony on the second floor of the Swiss Hotel, and to provide refreshments as a token of respect. Dear young friends: Come on, let's shake hands warmly!

### Giant Rock Crushes People: A Tragedy Occurs at the Lin Ma Hang Mine Yesterday; Nine Miners Meet a Tragic End; Three Instantly Killed with Brains and Flesh Exploded; Six Seriously Injured and Sent to the Hospital for Treatment

The Lin Ma Hang mine in Ta Ku Ling, New Territories, is contracted to a certain mining company by the government for exploitation, employing a large workforce of up to a thousand miners, working day and night non-stop. The mine shafts penetrate deep into the inner layers of the earth. Unexpectedly, at four o'clock yesterday morning, a tragic incident occurred, resulting in the death or injury of nine miners. Before the accident, nine workers were ordered by the foreman to descend into the mine to excavate minerals, using lights to illuminate their work. The mine shaft extended several tens of feet deep into the earth's inner layers. Unexpectedly, while they were excavating, a massive rock weighing approximately four [unit of weight] became dislodged due to the loosening of the soil, causing it to fall. The nine workers were unable to escape in time and were crushed. Upon hearing that the nine workers had been injured by the rock fall, people from the mine immediately descended into the mine to devise a method to lift the rock for rescue. Among these nine workers, three were standing in a location directly beneath the falling rock, resulting in their heads being crushed and brains exploded, limbs broken, and severe internal injuries, causing instant death. In one case, the internal organs of the deceased were also crushed out, a truly gruesome sight. The remaining six workers were fortunate enough not to be killed, but they also sustained serious injuries, with some having broken limbs and others suffering injuries to their bodies. All of them fainted due to the severity of their injuries. After rescuing the six injured, the miners immediately reported the incident to the Sheung Shui Police Station. Upon receiving the report, the duty officer dispatched police detectives to the scene to investigate the cause of the tragic event and telegraphed for ambulances to transport the six injured to the Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The bodies of the three deceased were taken to the Kowloon mortuary in a hearse for autopsy. It is reported that all nine of the miners who perished were young men in their twenties and thirties.

Before the event, the public largely expected "Wakey Wakey", "Silly Ton" or "Leah Who Leah" to win, and the Governor's wife's "Dee and Knee Yarn" also had a lot of supporters. Unexpectedly, the Chow brothers' "Lin La Cum Fin Dee" emerged as a dark horse, leading from the start and ultimately winning the top spot. Winning tickets paid out over four hundred dollars each. The competition between "Silly Ton" and "Wakey Wakey" was extremely intense, with the former finishing second and the latter third. "Leah Who Leah" started to fall back after passing the big rock drum, suffering a complete defeat. It is rumored that there was a problem with its foot! In addition, most of the hot horses of the day were successful, and those who liked outsiders were disappointed. Yan Ga Na Sang became uncharacteristically poor, not winning a single time all day. Others who had successful days included Wong Ching Lim, Tao Bo Lin, Bo Heng, Ma Kei, and Pross, each winning twice, while Littau and Zhao Lianbi each won once. Fortunately, there were no further accidents involving horses falling. The linked彩s in both races were won by hot horses, so each ticket was only worth twelve dollars and fifty cents. Today's Chinese horse championship final will see Yu Dongxuan fielding two fierce generals, "Nosey Like" and "Dee Sa Zhi Fu," to challenge "Shirley's Gift." Most opinions believe that "Shirley's Gift" is currently in good form, and with the skilled jockey Bo Heng riding, it will be able to maintain its victory. However, some say that "Nosey Like" has great strength and has repeatedly set new records, and Dee Sa Zhi Fu should not be underestimated, as it could potentially defeat the previous champion. In any case, if the weather and conditions remain unchanged, the battle will be very exciting. If it rains, Shirley's Gift will have the upper hand!

### The New British Ship "Glen Line" Arrives in Hong Kong on its Maiden Voyage; A Reception was Held Yesterday for Guests to Visit

The British Glen Line Shipping Company, in order to promote its Far East shipping business, specifically allocated funds to build six of the newest types of cargo ships, also equipped with passenger cabins. Previously one had already passed by Hong Kong. The "Glen Line" cargo ship arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday on her maiden voyage. This is the first ship of the shipping company to call in Hong Kong. After arriving in Hong Kong, the ship docked at Holt's Wharf, and a reception was held on board yesterday at 6:30 PM to invite guests to visit.

### The Shantytowns in the Kwun Chung and Tai Kok Tsui Areas are Ordered to be Demolished; 800 Shantytowns in Both Areas will be Completely Demolished; Over 4,000 Poor Residents Must Relocate Today

Since the poor have flocked to Yau Ma Tei, Canton Road, and the Tai Kok Tsui area to build shanties, these areas have become villages and poor people's districts. The government authorities previously felt that the sanitation of these shantytowns was lacking, and that many of the shanties were flammable materials and thus prone to fire. The poor residents were ordered to find other places to relocate. The poor had previously jointly requested the authorities to allow them to postpone the execution, but recently, in order to maintain stability, the authorities reiterated the previous order and ordered the residents to relocate as soon as possible. It has been found that there are 300 shanties in the Kwun Chung shantytown on Canton Road, housing over a thousand working-class people. The order was issued at the end of October. Some of them have complied with the order and moved to the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp, while others have moved to vacant land in Kowloon City for temporary accommodation. The original shantytowns have been ordered by the authorities to be completely demolished by sanitation workers. As for the Tai Kok Tsui area, there are 500 such shantytowns, housing approximately 3,000 working-class people. They have also been ordered to relocate to other places from yesterday to today. The original shantytowns will be completely demolished today. Those who have nowhere to live will be sent by the health authorities to the Kowloon Ma Tau Chung refugee camp. Therefore, the shantytowns in both areas can be said to have come to an end today.

### Three Robbers Force Their Way into a House in Ta Ku Ling, New Territories; The Cheung Tin Family is Robbed of Over a Hundred Dollars

At 1:20 AM yesterday, a house without a number in Song Wai Ha Village, Ta Ku Ling, New Territories, was broken into and robbed by three robbers. Two of the three robbers were armed with handguns, and one was carrying an electric flashlight. One of the two robbers with guns was also wearing a white mask. They entered the second floor from the water trough and stealthily descended to the first floor. The occupants of the house only woke up after the robbers entered. Seeing that the robbers were holding guns and threatening them, they dared not make a sound and allowed the robbers to search the house. The robbers searched the house for about thirty minutes before fleeing. Afterwards, the resident Cheung Tin (47 years old) went to the Sheung Shui Police Station to report the incident. He said that all the robbers spoke with a Hakka accent. He suspected that the masked robber was someone he knew. After the robbers left, they checked their belongings and found that they had lost eighty-five dollars and two dimes in Hong Kong currency, ninety-five dollars in Kwangtung Provincial Bank legal tender, thirty-five dollars in Central Bank notes, two silver chain necklaces, one silver lock, one silver wallet, one pair of plain silver anklets, and four opium pipes, with a total value of approximately one hundred and sixty-three dollars and two dimes in local currency.

### The "Flying Hotel" Will Arrive in Hong Kong the Day After Tomorrow

The Pan American Airlines giant Boeing aircraft, originally scheduled to fly from San Francisco to Hong Kong today, has been repeatedly postponed due to the bad weather in the Pacific Ocean in recent days. According to news received in Hong Kong, the aircraft arrived in Midway Island yesterday afternoon. If there are no special weather changes, it will arrive in Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month. Fearing that there will be too many visitors at that time, the China National Aviation Corporation has only issued 250 visitor tickets to invite Hong Kong officials, gentry, and celebrities from all walks of life to visit.

### The Jockey Club's First Prize is Rumored to be Won by Four Children

The Hong Kong Jockey Club's one-dollar grand彩 draw took place at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. After the first-place ticket number was announced as 404324, by 4:00 PM yesterday, twenty-one hours later, it was still unknown who had won the huge sum. The owners of the second- and third-place prizes were also unknown. However, according to what reporters know, the 404324 ticket was sold on New Year's Day. The ticket holders were four children. These four children received a lot of red envelopes on New Year's Day, and pooled some of it together to buy tickets. They really struck it rich with one hit. Each of the four lucky children won over 60,000 yuan in彩 money, immediately becoming small well-to-do families. It is rumored that the ticket for the second prize was bought by a White Russian who watches horses at the Jockey Club. However, there are currently many rumors, and the truth will not be known until after the 彩 is distributed.

### The Charity Bazaar Closed Successfully Yesterday; Over Ten Thousand Dollars in Donations were Raised in Two Days

The charity bazaar organized by the British Relief Fund's Fundraising Committee closed successfully yesterday. It has been found that over 10,600 yuan in donations were collected over the two days of the 26th and 27th, which can be said to be an excellent result. Yesterday was the last day of the charity bazaar, and there were even more visitors than in the past two days. The organizers, in order to thoroughly sell off the remaining goods, greatly reduced prices to encourage sales. The entertainment stalls, refreshment stalls, and singing performances all had many visitors. All the staff were mobilized and were overwhelmed with customers. The atmosphere was more lively than ever before. The result for the day should not be less than the previous two days.

### Unifying the Hong Kong Monetary System; The Authorities are Actively Recalling Old Nickel Coins; All will be Recalled and Declared Obsolete by the End of this Month

The Hong Kong authorities officially announced on June 15, 1936, the abolition of silver dimes and the implementation of the legal tender system, and issued one-dollar legal tender and ten-cent and five-cent nickel coins to replace silver dollars in circulation. However, when the coins were first issued, there were many counterfeiters, which caused significant losses to the commercial sector. Therefore, the authorities raised funds in England to produce new pure nickel coins to be shipped to Hong Kong.

Recalling old coins and dispatching staff to supervise

Regarding the old nickel coins currently circulating on the market, the authorities originally intended to recall them all last month and declare them obsolete. Later, because this period coincided with the Lunar New Year, the announcement was postponed again and again. The reporter visited the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Pollock, yesterday to inquire about everything. According to him, now that the Lunar New Year has passed, the authorities intend to implement the recall of old coins during this period, so that the monetary policy can be unified. However, there are still some matters to be considered regarding the recall procedures, so they are actively discussing methods in order to start the actual implementation in early March. Regarding this matter, the Hong Kong government authorities, after consulting with the Financial Secretary and this department, are expected to announce the abolition of old coins by the end of March or early April.

Silver dimes and subsidiary coins are rarely circulating

Currently, in order to realize the unified monetary system as soon as possible, the Treasury Department is not only increasing staff to redeem old coins at a discount, but also dispatching many people to major banks in Hong Kong and China to supervise the recall of old coins and not allow them to be issued again. After the old coins are recalled, they will be melted into nickel ingots in Hong Kong, shipped back to England and England in batches, and new coins will be prepared and sent to Hong Kong later. Pollock went on to mention the issue of silver dimes and subsidiary coins, saying that since the authorities announced the use of silver dimes, they have started to recall them gradually, but as of now, the number is still small. Most of these subsidiary coins are flowing out of Hong Kong, and many Hong Kong merchants are melting silver dimes to make silverware. Therefore, the number of silver coins currently in existence, compared to the total number issued in previous years, can be said to be more than eighty percent. The authorities are currently investigating the amount of silver in existence in preparation for recalling a considerable amount in the future, and the old and new coins will be announced as obsolete at the same time.

### Hong Kong News in Brief

### The Entire West River Line's × Military Strength is Empty; Our Army is Actively Preparing for a Counter-Offensive; Between Jiu Jiang and Liang Long × Retreat Along the River Road; Our Army is Encouraging the People to Promote Wartime Tasks

[West River Express News] The West River front line's × force, since most of it was transferred to invade Hainan Island, has been weak in recent days and is lurking in a corner, not daring to make any changes, so the situation is unusually quiet. There are no significant increases or decreases in the entire line's × force, but there are troop movements and changes of defense between the various points. The West River guerrilla teams are also frequently attacking the × force at various points, launching guerrilla warfare to shake the entire line's × force. Now, our military authorities, since the tense period in the West River has passed, are stepping up efforts to mobilize the people to assist the regular army in strengthening their defensive strength and preparing for a full-scale counter-offensive against the × force. The situation is reported as follows:

Recent × Force Situation on the Entire West River Line

The West River × force, in recent days, because most of its forces have been transferred and are insufficient to allocate, is trying to cover up its weakness by making frequent troop movements and occasionally firing artillery at our positions to boost its morale. It has been found that the × force at Ganggen Makou has been firing artillery at our Jinli Qingqi area for days, without any target. Our side has ignored it. On the Mup Mian Lam Kong side, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry arrived on the 23rd, and several mountain guns were transported and erected on nearby hills, with sentries assigned to guard and watch. However, part of it had already retreated to Sanshui Southwest on the 25th. On the He Kou side, 200 to 300 × soldiers were transferred from Guangzhou on the 24th to reinforce, and a batch of grain, ammunition, and weapons were transported to the southwest for storage. As for the × forces between He Qing and Jiu Jiang Liang Long, since the 23rd of this month, part of them have retreated along the river road to concentrate in Foshan, attempting to water ming. The × force currently stationed in Jiu Jiang is the Zhi Song guard force, with about 200 soldiers, stationed in the city and in various places such as the Xuexian Temple Shakou. Also, since the × force launched the Haikou landing, the Guangdong × Air Force squadrons have been mostly transferred to Hainan to assist in the battle, and have been wreaking havoc on Qiong Island and various counties in southern Guangdong for days. Therefore, the West River × opportunities have slightly decreased. However, in the past day or two, they have become active again, frequently flying over various counties to scout, but rarely dropping bombs.

Liang Long Team Annihilates × Again

Our guerrilla teams lurking in various points and lines in the West River, seeing that the × army is weak, in order to cut off the × army's communication and response, have launched frequent surprise guerrilla warfare, attacking the × army entrenched in various points. Along the Guangsan Road, our guerrilla teams have been intercepting × transport vehicles, destroying roads and railway tracks in Shishan Zoumaying Xiaotang and other places, and attacking the × camp in Sanshui Southwest. At around 9:00 PM on the 25th night of the month, our Liang Long guerrilla teams gathered dozens of teams, armed with quick-firing Mauser pistols and portable machine guns, and secretly arrived at the × camp when the × soldiers were deep inside. When the × sentries discovered them, our teams had already rushed in and swept the × soldiers with machine guns. The × soldiers, hearing the gunfire, immediately came out to fight, but in the darkness, they did not know how many teams we had, and they were extremely panicked and embarrassed. Finally, they killed more than a dozen × soldiers and injured more than ten. All the team members, having achieved their purpose, safely returned to their original defenses. The × force, after this battle, was extremely panicked and sent more sentries to guard the vicinity of the barracks every night, prohibiting people from coming and going. Even during the day, they were very strict in inspecting our villagers who came and went.

Military-Civilian Cooperation Creates Strong Strength

Since the × force on the Sanshui front line retreated and reduced its strength, it has been unable to invade the west. However, our military authorities, in order to be cautious, believing that the × army is accustomed to adopting the strategy of a feint to the east and attack to the west, have instructed the Gu County government and various teams to step up efforts to mobilize the people to participate in the war of resistance and assist the government in promoting various wartime tasks in order to consolidate social order and strengthen the forces for defending against × and guarding the territory. Now, the spirit of military-civilian cooperation in various places is even more intense. The × army has repeatedly invaded Qingqi Old Sanshui, and our military and civilians have been able to jointly resist ×. Glorious deeds have been successively demonstrated. It has also been found that the teams in various counties in the West River, after receiving the orders of the Commander of the Fourth War Zone, have been transferred to various defense forces and tax police regiments, and are now joining the front line, stationed in Luobao, Mafang, Hantang, Liantang, Dasha, Beishui, and the Gulou Sanshou area, waiting for orders and waiting for opportunities to counter-attack. Now our West River defense force is extremely strong and can be guaranteed to be safe.

### Our Army Counter-Attacks Qiongshan; The War on Qiong Island is Gradually Stabilizing; × Occupies Yulin Port and Forbids Foreign Ships to Dock

[Northern × Express News] Recently, a telegram from a certain place on Qiong Island reported that our army has been counter-attacking Qiongshan for days and has repeatedly won victories. The × army entrenched in the county town, and the × army stationed in the suburbs, have all retreated into the city. There are no traces of them in the vicinity of the suburbs. On the 18th of this month, our army launched a large-scale counter-attack towards Ding'an. The local people rose up in response. × was caught off guard and suffered more than 2,000 casualties. At this moment, the war on Qiong Island is gradually stabilizing. The anti-× self-defense groups in various places are now rising up one after another, preparing to kill ×. The morale is high, which has never happened before. It is also reported that more than 30 × ships have arrived overseas, seemingly intending to invade the south. Yulin Port has also been blockaded by × ships, prohibiting foreign ships from sailing.

### Guangdong Province will Punish the Officers and Soldiers who Failed to Fight Effectively after Investigation by Military Law

Since the war of resistance in Guangdong Province was launched, Guangzhou fell in less than a month, and the public was in an uproar. General Yu immediately reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to severely punish the officers and soldiers who failed to fight effectively. Now, the 12th Army Corps, following the instructions of Chairman Chiang, in addition to the 451st Brigade Commander He Lianfang and the concurrently 151st Division Commander Mo Xiyi, who are being tried by the General Supervisor of Military Law Execution, will punish the remaining derelict officers and soldiers separately. Ye Zhinan, the regiment commander of the 1096th Regiment of the 186th Division, was ordered to flank the × people near Fuliu, but failed to make an effort. Li Rufeng, the regiment commander of the Independent First Regiment, also failed to make an effort in the battle at Yonghanxu. They were both dismissed from their posts for investigation. Li Zhenqiu, the division commander of the 186th Division, was assigned to fight on the front line in Zengcheng but failed to make an effort to accomplish the task. Liang Shiji, the division commander of the 154th Division, failed to provide timely assistance in Conghua in accordance with the order. Each of them was given a major demerit. Chen Wei Wu, the commander of the Independent Twentieth Division, and Wu Luxun, the commander of the 922nd Regiment of the 154th Division, were both dismissed from their posts but allowed to remain in their positions to atone for their sins. Li Jiang, the commander of the Guangdong Gendarmerie and acting commander of the Guangzhou Garrison, retreated without authorization and will be severely punished. Guo Siyan, the commander of the Humen Fortress, was dismissed from his post and arrested. They will be handled separately by the Department of Military Law Execution and the Personnel Department of the General Supervision Department. The rumor that Chen Wei Wu has been transferred to the Chief of Staff of the Military Region Command is inaccurate.

### The Funeral of a National Hero

— By Bai Wei

— A Quick Sketch of the Public Funeral for Soldiers Who Died in the East River Anti-Japanese War —

This is a glorious and tragic funeral. It contains a glorious and tragic history.

On October 12th of last year, the × people landed from Daya Bay, occupied Danbu, and then our defending troops in Danshui retreated to Longgang and Yonghu. However, the entire company of 110 soldiers of the Second Transport Company of the First Battalion of the Nine Hundred and Second Regiment of the 451st Brigade and another unit of friendly forces advanced along the Hui-Danshui Highway, braving the bombing of the × people's planes in groups, without any fear or disorder. They arrived safely at Xiaoguabang near the outskirts of Huizhou on the 13th evening. Xiaoguabang Mountain is located at the midpoint of the communication from Danjiao, and it is an important area below Fozu Temple, and also the first shield around Huizhou. The mountains rise and fall, and the short temples are luxuriant. We have built several fortifications here. Therefore, after the Second Company arrived, although they felt that the strength of the company was weak, and the soldiers had gone through the bloody battle in Danshui, their spirits were extremely exhausted, but in order to save the nation and defend this lone fort of Huizhou, they did not hesitate to gather more than 80 brothers with tired bodies but high morale, and firmly guarded the fortifications of the mountain, preparing to leave the last drop of blood for the nation.

On the 13th night, the × people tracked and chased to Mazhuang at the foot of Xiaoguabang Mountain. The attack began early on the 14th. The unit responsible for the attack was the Xiaowei unit. They first used mountain artillery to bombard, followed by infantry charges. From morning to noon, although a small part of our fortifications were destroyed by the × people's shells, our soldiers were still calmly sweeping. About a dozen × people were killed or injured, but they could not gain a step on the hilltop. Then batches of × planes appeared in the sky, and bombs were thrown and exploded on the mountain. The loud explosions did not shake the hearts of our soldiers at all. The second charge was repelled, with another seven or eight × people killed. Only on the third attempt did they gather five or six hundred people to bypass the back of our Xiaoguabang Mountain and surround us on all sides. The special Hui city had fallen into a state of chaos. Although the soldiers of our company knew the treacherous conspiracy of the × people, they had exhausted all their strength and had no reinforcements. They could only make a great sacrifice, dyeing several fortifications with their blood, fulfilling the soldier's duty to defend the territory.

Since the liberation of Huizhou, the prominent gentleman Mr. Zhang Youren went to collect the remains of these loyal soldiers. Although two months had passed, most of them had not rotted. Each of them was still leaning against the trench, and although there was no gun in their hands, they still tightly clenched their iron fists. Some of them had their eyes open. From the original state of these loyal remains, it can be known how heroic our soldiers were when they died. At the same time, the bodies of the soldiers were all marked with marks of countless bullets, probably because the × people went to rob guns after the soldiers died heroically. The soldiers' bright red blood will illuminate the Chinese nation like Nankou and Baoshan.

Therefore, after Mr. Zhang finished collecting the remains of the entire Second Company, the people from all walks of life in Huizhou held the "Public Funeral Ceremony for Soldiers Who Died in the East River Anti-Japanese War" on the mountain of Shuilian Cave, entrusting the souls of our unnamed national heroes. When we looked up at the loyal remains of the soldiers lying in the coffins, we felt an unspeakable emotion in our hearts, feeling that their blood had been flowing for a long time to fight for the freedom of the nation, and their lives had been sacrificed to continue the life of the nation. Then, how can we who are not dead continue the unfinished aspirations of the martyrs? This is our good example. Why shed tears of blood?

Although the ceremony was simple, it was solemn and dignified. Every participant had a sad and leaping heart. The blood flowers of the martyrs appeared in their eyes, and their feet would move forward with these blood flowers.

Finally, take the couplet drafted by Zherena, the Deputy Commander of the East River Detachment, as the concluding remarks of the recommendation:

The road of merit and benevolence is one, and the road to the famous city is the same. The fortifications are built with liver and courage.

Tears and tears are not my wish. Let's drink half a cup of wine and offer it to ××× tomorrow.

### National Military District Conference: Li Hanhun Proposes Two Important Cases; Evaluating Conscription Performance of Counties and Cities; Strictly Preventing Malpractice in Exemption Regulations

[Shaoguan Quick News] The National Military District Commander Conference, convened by the central military and political authorities in Chongqing, could not be attended by Li Hanhun, Commander of the Guangdong Military District, due to the heavy provincial administration. He specially dispatched a chief of staff as a representative to Chongqing. The representative left Shaoguan yesterday, carrying several proposals submitted by Chairman Li to the conference. It is heard that two important cases are included: one is to strictly establish conscription performance of counties and cities as the standard for evaluating the diligence of responsible officials; the other is to improve the management of exemption from service and strictly prevent local bullies from engaging in malpractice. Instructions have been issued to each division military district and encirclement district to vigorously promote these measures, so as to eliminate the previous malpractices of evading military service. Chairman Li also telegraphed Zhen Daihun, former director of the Political Training Department of the 155th Division, yesterday to urgently come to Shaoguan to fill an important position in the Guangdong Military District Command.

### Jiujiang × Military Strength Weak; Heavily Fortified Against Our Advance; Residents Within the Town Limited to Obtain Good Citizen Certificates; People Flee, Finding It Hard to Live Under the Iron Heel

[Jiangmen Quick News] The troops entrenched in various parts of Xijiang have mostly been transferred to Hainan for the invasion war, so their strength has suddenly become weak. In addition to making every effort to shorten the defense line, selecting strongholds, digging deep trenches and building high fortifications, and firmly guarding key points to prevent attacks by our main forces and guerrilla teams, they have also dispatched aircraft to Heshan, Xinhui, Gaoming, and Sihui to conduct reconnaissance in recent days. They are also conducting stricter inspections of the residents in the occupied areas to prevent our plainclothes teams from infiltrating. Moreover, it is found that the Jiujiang × army feels its strength is weak and is deeply afraid of our teams taking the opportunity to attack, so it has recently added defensive works at traffic intersections in the town, dispatched troops to erect small steel cannons and machine guns, and guarded them day and night. On one hand, they are forcing people in the city, regardless of men, women, old or young, to completely obtain good citizen certificates within ten days before they are allowed to reside. If they are found to have not obtained a certificate after the deadline, they will be immediately identified as plainclothes teams or as elements engaged in various anti-enemy activities and executed. However, the Chinese traitors who handle the issuance of certificates are also extorting certificate fees, deliberately delaying the issuance. The people are afraid of being brutally killed by the ×, and they are fleeing one after another, feeling that it is difficult to live under the iron heel.

### Chen Jitang Invests in Setting Up a Textile Factory: Not Confirmed; Luo Tingyu Not Involved Either

The previous rumor that Chen Jitang invested tens of millions of yuan to establish a large-scale textile factory in Guangzhou Bay, and that Luo Tingyu was responsible for the preparations, was addressed by our reporter who met Luo yesterday at a certain place. According to him, he had never prepared a textile factory for Chen Jitang, and the matter of Chen investing in setting up a textile factory was also untrue.

### Strengthening Three-Dimensional Warfare Capabilities: First Phase of Training for Our New Air Force About to Complete; Second Phase to Expand Enrollment; Regulations for Each Department Drafted

[Lian County Correspondence] Since the launch of the second phase of the War of Resistance, our authorities have felt the importance of three-dimensional warfare, so they have recently greatly developed the new air force. In addition to purchasing a large number of the latest fighter jets from abroad and building a large number of airfields, they also felt the lack of talent for the new air force. The Aviation Committee specially established an air force training institute ahead of schedule, recruiting a large number of air force personnel for training. Now the first phase of training is completed, and the second phase should continue, and will expand enrollment by department. The regulations have also been drafted, and a brief excerpt is as follows: "Regulations for Flight Sergeants": 1. Must be 18 to 20 years old, unmarried, graduated from junior high school, or have equivalent academic qualifications; 2. Must pass a physical examination that meets air force standards; "Mechanical Department": 1. Must be graduates of domestic universities in aviation engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, or aircraft engineering departments, male of Chinese nationality; 2. Must be under 30 years old, 160 cm or more in height, 50 kg or more in weight, without addictions and chronic diseases such as tuberculosis and venereal disease, and vision not excessively nearsighted or farsighted; 3. Registration procedures: bring four recent 4-inch half-length unhatted front-facing photos, and graduation certificates (if the graduation certificate is lost), a certificate must be issued by the original school principal or director, and if the certificate cannot be obtained, a guarantee must be provided by an air force lieutenant or higher officer, and register in person at the registration location; 4. Test subjects: Party principles, Chinese, English, mathematics (calculus and differential equations), mechanics (applied mechanics and strength of materials), thermodynamics (thermodynamics and heat engines), electricity (electrical engineering, as determined by the mechanical engineering departments of various universities), outline of aeronautical engineering; 5. Test takers must bring a slide rule; 6. Treatment: After admission, travel expenses will be provided, and a monthly allowance of 40 yuan will be given during the study period. After completion, they will be employed as first-class technicians.

### Shiqi Proceeding with Power Restoration; Temporarily Borrowing Machinery from Rice Mill for Power Generation; First Restoring Street and Government Office Lights

[Zhongshan Correspondence] Shiqi, Zhongshan, has suffered repeated bombings by × aircraft, resulting in heavy losses. The city's power plant has also been bombed and partially destroyed, resulting in power outages. Every evening, the entire city becomes a dark world. Moreover, in order to avoid daytime air raids, stores in the city are limited to operating at night, using kerosene lamps and gas lamps as a temporary solution, but it is very inconvenient. The county government is even more concerned that petty thieves and thugs will take the opportunity to act rashly, endangering the city's order and affecting the rear area's security. Recently, it was decided to restore the city's power. The plan is to temporarily borrow machinery from a large rice mill in the city for power generation, and first restore street lights and electricity to various agencies stationed in the city to facilitate commerce and official business. The revenue from collecting street light electricity fees will be entirely given to the rice mill that provides electricity. It is understood that this plan is currently being drafted, and once it is drafted and properly negotiated with the rice mill merchants, it can be implemented.

### The Fate of Hollywood Silver Stars in 1939 — Predictions by Astrologer Norvell —

— 和

Norvell is a famous silver star fortune teller who has lived in Hollywood for a long time. This year, he once again used the twelve-house astrology method to predict the fortunes of major movie stars this year. Although we cannot believe that these predictions are necessarily accurate, since he has lived there for a long time, he naturally has a panoramic view of the situation. His speculations may even have some small truths. Let's just talk about it casually and listen to it casually, and let the facts be the greatest witness.

Hedy Lamarr... born in December, belongs to the Scorpio zodiac sign (this twelve zodiac signs are equivalent to our country's twelve zodiac animals, the difference is that it takes one month as a unit, and those born in a certain month (belong to a certain zodiac sign)). Her astrology indicates that she will ascend to the highest seat of the silver screen, and will have at least three years of good luck. Looking further ahead, love and marriage will come. She will marry a producer or a big director, in short, a film tycoon. Unfortunately, this marriage will not last long and will eventually end due to incompatible personalities. The third time will be her true and happy love destination.

Van Johnson... This young male star who has shaken the hearts of young girls all over the United States has a bright and brilliant 1939 waiting for him. He will continue to be supported by them and continue to shine brightly. But he must not marry this year, otherwise there will be unfortunate consequences—a divorce is certain within nine years. After that, for example, if he marries in 1940, the marriage will be happy and there is hope of becoming the father of two children.

Born on February 17, he is right in the Aquarius zodiac sign, which is the most suitable for actors. Such as John Barrymore, Adolph Menjou, Clark Gable and Ronald Colman, these famous superstars are all figures in this zodiac sign.

Antoinette Lees... Born on August 18, the day is very auspicious. Her life palace belongs to the Leo zodiac sign. Other people in the same zodiac sign include Myrna Loy, Robert Taylor, Norma Shearer, and William Powell. Judging from her acting skills in "Letter of Introduction," this year should be, and is, the time for her to be proud. Her wedding date should be in this year or 1940. Her married life will be happy and will not hinder her screen life.

Errol Flynn... born on June 20, belongs to the Gemini zodiac sign. 1939 is slightly unfavorable to him. This year he is in danger of affecting his health due to overwork, but his screen work can continue to be successful. Astrology indicates that he has some bad luck with airplanes or vehicles, but this just needs to be careful. He will divorce Lili Damita and form another good relationship.

Tyrone Power... At present, Tyrone Power's popularity is indeed unparalleled among the young actors. His birthday is May 5, which belongs to the Taurus zodiac sign. This zodiac sign symbolizes "wealth," so no wonder he can be so popular. His year will be smooth, but be careful of a decline in reputation at the end of the year. According to astrology, he must not marry within three years, otherwise it will be detrimental to his current status. After this period, there will be even greater wealth. At that time, as long as he is willing, he can give up this life at any time and enjoy his old age in peace.

Deanna Durbin... born on May 1, she will have money and status like Tyrone Power. She will have two marriages, so be careful.

Alice Faye... Coincidentally, her birthday is the same day as Tyrone Power, also May 5th. Her fate in the next few years is very good, and she will become more and more popular every day. Because, from the perspective of astrology, there is no sign of setbacks in her career in the next few years. Like Tyrone Power, whether she stays or leaves her screen life will only be decided by herself. The fans will definitely not be unappreciative of her.

Recently, rumors have been spreading in Hollywood that she and her husband Tony Martin are about to divorce. Although she denies it, she cannot hide it from astrology. Although we hope she can avoid this incident, (unfortunately, it is rumored that they have already divorced).

Jean Arthur... This is a relatively senior actress. In 1939, she will still be assigned to play several very important leading roles, and her brilliance will not diminish slightly within five years. She will have two marriages, like Deanna Durbin.

Deanna Bobbing... This lovely name will maintain a long-term relationship with us. In the near future, she will perform in opera on the screen and be very popular. And she will have her presence on stage and in radio broadcasting and film circles. Those are the fields waiting for her to conquer.

Mickey Rooney... Movie fans are often worried that Mickey Rooney is growing up. Will he still be able to continue his screen life, or will he seek another way out in the commercial field? Let's see what his astrology says. The zodiac sign is Libra, born on September 20... There is no sign here that he must leave the film industry. Mickey will definitely still be an actor when he grows up, and he will still be popular. His fresh personality and childish acting skills will remain constant. It is too early to get married, it will be around the age of 23.

Olivia de Havilland... She has three to five years of good luck. During this period, she will become more and more popular every day. Her marriage should be in this year or the first half of next year. Her life palace belongs to the Cancer zodiac sign. Other people in this zodiac sign include James Cagney, Merle Oberon, Doris Nolan, and Barbara Stanwyck.

To put it simply, those who can succeed this year also include Ray Milland, Priscilla Lane, Paulette Goddard, Mary Livingston, Nan Grey, and Nan Sanker.

In terms of real stars, Shirley Temple currently occupies the leading position in the "chick" group. But will she be able to permanently occupy this throne? Her life palace, like Mary Pickford, also belongs to the Aries zodiac sign, and it is destined that she will engage in film life for life like this veteran film queen. Only between the ages of 14 and 17 will there be a period of temporary retirement. When she returns to the film industry for the second time, she can still maintain the status of a first-class star.

Shirley's biggest rival, the Dionne quintuplets, will end their artistic lives due to marriage after a long period of service in the film industry.

"Wildcat" Kim Hye-soo will turn to broadcasting and the stage. "Little Lord" Freddie Bartholomew will leave the film industry next year and return to Hollywood after completing his higher education. And next year or the year after, we will no longer see Jackie Cooper's films. The grown-up Jackie Cooper will abandon film and engage in business.

Ronald Colman, from this year on, will comfortably shoot only one or two films a year, and his marriage will also be extremely happy. Gary Cooper will not divorce, and his film life will continue for several years. Only John Barrymore may have some marital troubles.

Joan Crawford will remarry, and Greta Garbo, the mysterious girl of the past, will have fewer new films produced after 1939.

Predictions are ultimately predictions. "Man can conquer nature" and "It depends on human effort." There is hope of reversing the will of heaven. Thinking this way, the two sentences "Let's just talk about it casually and listen to it casually" become even more necessary.

### The General Association Should Deal with the Governor's Cup; An Ideal Lineup Was Drafted Yesterday; Seeking Opinions from Related Associations

[Special Report] The second battle of the Governor's Cup between the Chinese Sports Association's Chinese team and the Football Association's Western team is scheduled to be held on the 5th of this month (Sunday) at Caroline Hill. Remembering the first game, the Chinese team got off to a good start and won the first victory. If they win or draw this time, they will regain the championship. If the Chinese team fails this time, they will have to fight the Western team for the third time. From this point of view, this battle can be described as a matter of life and death for both sides. The General Association feels deeply ashamed of the previous failure and is trying to select capable players in the hope of breaking the Chinese team's dream of winning the championship. However, since Logan and Watson returned to England, they have felt the sigh of difficulty in finding talent. The left wing position is even more difficult to find. It is heard that the General Association will seek opinions from related associations on the following ideal lineup. If all agree, it will be used as the official lineup. According to reporter investigations, Yan Shishiro is still at sea with the fleet and it is unknown whether he can return to Hong Kong in time to respond to this battle. Therefore, only Feibeng is listed for the right wing position, pending public decision. The ideal lineup is recorded as follows:

McAlister Navy Team

Shi Han Miduxie Newby Navy Team

Pak Chia Police Association Dickson Navy Team Hannerville Navy Team

Liao Yachen Kowloon Association Soo Miduxie Gosanno Saint Joseph Zuo Zhi Kowloon Association Armstrong Navy Team

### Looking Back and Ahead

— Lai Duanfu

This article is fixed to be published every Wednesday and Sunday, come rain or shine. However, the previous issue was delayed due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Therefore, this issue must discuss the past two weeks of football matters together.

The Hong Kong-Philippines Intercity Match has become a thing of the past, and it has been talked about a bit too much. I originally did not want to add a detailed review, but I have to express my opinion briefly. Remembering that the performance of the Hong Kong team in the two trial matches was unsatisfactory. However, when competing with the Philippine team, they actually won easily with a score of four to one. Also, in view of the Philippine team's three defeats in three battles and their defeat of one to two in their expedition to Australia, those who know the goods all said that the Philippine team's football technical level can only be compared with that of the Hong Kong Second Division. Some people even think that Bowserly, Yao Jidi, and Weilandnuwa are very good. Assuming that the Philippine team participates in the First Division competition in Hong Kong, there is also hope for five players to be included. Considering this kind of criticism, Zhu Mian exposed his childish appearance of evaluating football, and the writing style is also unlike that of a scholar. Bowserly is indeed the best player in the Philippine team, which is appreciated by everyone. Yao Jidi is also a promising talent. As for referring to Weilandnuwa, this is a big mistake based on the "official words" of Western newspapers. We said that the Philippine team only has the level of the Hong Kong Second Division, which refers to the entire team. It is impossible to insist that the entire team is good just because there are two or three capable players in the entire team. Today, the five battalion artillery troops, South China and Miduxie of the Hong Kong Second Division, do they not have the qualifications for the First Division and have they not been selected as good villages for important competitions? However, if the entire team is transferred to the First Division, I don't know if they can reach five players. Isn't this example obvious? Do those new scholars who want to boast about their superior insights in football commentary also understand this?

The recent victory of the Eastern team over South China is due to the insufficient manpower of the "Chufeng" team, resulting in a performance far inferior to that of the Eastern team. However, the performance of the Eastern team has indeed been improving day by day, especially the performance on that day was one of the best highlights of this season. The two goals conceded were due to the goalkeeper's occasional abnormality, resulting in this mistake. The author naturally has the duty to correct uncivilized behavior, but to point out that someone is uncivilized in Hong Kong, where the judiciary is strict, I really admire the author's "courage."

The Eastern team has made a lot of progress. What is most gratifying is that the defense has also made significant progress. From now on, I hope they will sweep straight down and rise step by step, at least reaching the runner-up position, reserving a foundation for being selected for the World Games in the future.

South China South once defeated the Hong Kong Club with a score of 6 to 0, and was able to promote Li Enliang and use people properly. The future is bright. I am very optimistic about South China for this reason. Moreover, the newly acquired fearless Zhang Rongcai guards the goal, just like a fierce tiger with wings, Hai Dianchui is brave, and there seems to be no need to fear. As the saying goes, "Born of desperation," I believe that if South China can work hard to defeat the stubborn Ninth Brigade team in the Kowloon venue, there is a high probability that they will also defeat the Navy and eventually win the championship. Brother Sang Yu was originally very insightful when he saw the Navy's strong generals returning and worried about South China in advance, but he forgot that there was a joint Far East Fleet large-scale exercise in Singapore in March. According to my estimation, if the date of South China's game against the Navy is not held during the exercise, it will definitely be postponed to the final scene of the league. Genuine fans can eat a "reassuring pill."

The three First Division matches in this Saturday's football league are all worth noting. The Southern South team attaches importance to the championship issue, even the slightest point cannot be lost. At that time, there will naturally be no more careless performances. Although Guanghua is brave, it is mostly made up of former South China players, whose routines are well known to the experienced South China players. There is no reason for the Southern South team not to win. The Eastern team will become stronger and stronger as the game progresses, and is still very hopeful for the runner-up position. Moreover, breaking Kowloon Club's unbeaten record at that stadium is also the ambition of any team. At that time, there is absolutely no reason to relax in the slightest, and there will definitely be a good performance. Although South China no longer has hope of winning the championship, they must not be too far behind. Moreover, they have the responsibility to indirectly benefit their brothers by defeating the Navy. I am convinced that after the acupuncture, they will work hard to deal with Saint Joseph, who is at the bottom of the table, and winning will be more than enough. Midu's game against the 9th Battalion Artillery in the Second Division is of great importance to the Second Division championship. If South China wants to win the championship, in addition to hoping that the Midu team will defeat the artillery team, they must continue to work hard and not lose anything else in order to succeed.

Because there is the second Governor's Cup game this Sunday between the Chinese Sports Association's Chinese team and the Hong Kong Football Association's Western team, there will be no league matches. In last year's first competition, the Chinese team defeated the Western team with a score of 4 to 1. The competition method is that the team with more wins in the two games wins the championship. Therefore, if the Chinese team wins or draws again this Sunday, they will regain the championship. Judging from the current situation, the Chinese team is much stronger than the Western team, and the victory is assured. However, it is rumored that the Football Association intends to ask Gosano to lead the charge. If so, our team should also ask Li Huitang to help us in order to seek a more stable victory.

I also have a point of view on the selection of the Chinese team. If the Association can get Huitang to help, it would be great. Otherwise, it is advisable to select the following lineup. As for the right inner guard, Hou Rongniu and Mai Shaohan are listed in parallel, because the elderly Mai injured his foot the other day and it is unknown whether he can recover in time. Otherwise, the elderly Hou should be selected. However, Guanghua is not an affiliated association of the Association, and it is unknown whether it is problematic for the elderly Hou to be selected.

The football season is coming to an end. The open grass court tennis tournament will follow without waiting for the football affairs to be completed, and it has been scheduled to open on Monday next week. What is even more surprising about this tennis tournament is that "Mr. Cane" Defu will not participate in the singles competition. In this case, Xu Weipei may still have no opponents in this competition. As for the arrangement order, the Grass Court Tennis Association has the same opinion as the organizers of last year's Hard Court Open, and seems to intend to make the two Xus one of the final finalists. Some say that the organizer lacks consideration, but I say that he is extremely clever and has a pair of bright and forward-looking "business eyes." I hope that Xu's younger brother and older brother can live up to expectations and open the first shot of an all-Chinese final on grass courts.

### Men's Open Basketball Tournament: Eight Teams Participate in Group A, Twenty-One Teams Participate in Group B

The Men's Group A and B Open Basketball Tournament, organized by the Hong Kong Basketball Association, has seen enthusiastic participation from various teams since registration began. As of 8 PM last night, there were eight teams registered for Group A and twenty-one for Group B, an unprecedented number. Group A includes Star Island, Pui Ying, Wah Nam College, Eastern, University of Guangzhou, South China, Chung Sing, and University of Hong Kong. Group B includes Fei Zhe, Li Hang, Da Chung, Yung Yuen, Hoi Kwong, Ling Ying, Pui Ying, Indian Police, Kwan Lui, YMCA, Youth Workers, Wah Nam, Wah Kiu Middle School, International, South China, Chung Sing, Chun Fung, Wah Hung, Guangzhou University Affiliated Middle School, and Red Star, totaling twenty-one teams. In Group A, the strongest contenders are considered to be Eastern, Pui Ying, and Star Island, each boasting numerous strong players. The strength of Chung Sing, Guangzhou, Wah Nam, South China, and University of Hong Kong should not be underestimated. In Group B, Reporter, Li Hang, and Kwan Lui are the strongest teams. The strengths of the other teams are also relatively equal, making the outcome unpredictable.

"Raw iron placed in a furnace will either become steel or slag. Time is the great furnace; humanity is like raw iron being forged. The strong and healthy become steel, while the weak are eliminated as slag. Darwin's principle of 'survival of the fittest' is indeed an immutable law of nature."

If this is true for individuals, it is even more true for nations. Especially now, when [omitted text] is exerting all its power to oppress and subjugate our country. To preserve our territorial integrity and fight for national survival, what other path is there but to strengthen the physical well-being of our citizens and use iron and blood to protect China? Therefore, popularizing national sports is a crucial undertaking that cannot be ignored today.

As a sage once said, "Great undertakings reside in a healthy body." If we can find a real place for entertainment in our spare time to recover from fatigue, what greater joy could there be? Therefore, sports not only benefit the body and mind but also contribute significantly to the development of social undertakings. Furthermore, they foster friendships, promote unity, and lay the foundation for national revival.

Embracing this belief, our association has worked diligently for twelve years. Now, at a time when the nation faces its gravest crisis, coinciding with the launch of our association's twelfth membership drive, the importance of our mission is self-evident. We hope that people from all walks of life will share this vision, uphold the spirit of unity and resistance, concentrate on cohesive organizational groups, train together, plan together, and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia." This is not only the hope of our association members but also crucial to the future of our nation's revival and the most meaningful and effective action we can take now. People from all walks of life, come join us!

Our Slogans:

1.  Popularize sports, use iron and blood to protect China.

2.  Strengthen our bodies to build a strong nation.

3.  Cultivate our genuine forms of entertainment.

4.  Be dedicated to our work and enjoy group life, laying the foundation for national revival.

5.  Everyone join the Eastern Sports Association!" (Po Chun)

### Eastern Association Launches Membership Drive, Issues Stimulating Declaration, Hope Compatriots Jointly Participate in the Survival of the Fittest

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Among the Chinese sports organizations in Hong Kong, the Eastern [Association] can be considered to have a considerable history. It has done a lot of work in the sports circles. In recent years, enthusiastic members have worked together to promote the association's affairs, resulting in a trend of steady improvement. Its football team has strived for five months in this year's Group A League and has achieved remarkable results. It can be said that the team has taken the place of the former Chinese [team].

The people in the association are determined to carry out the mission of "saving the country through sports". They will do more work beneficial to the Chinese people from the sports perspective. Therefore, the association has issued a declaration, hoping that compatriots who like sports will join together. Everyone should concentrate on cohesive organizational groups with the spirit of unity and resistance, plan and train, turn weakness into strength, and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia."

The declaration is quite stimulating and moving. I will transcribe it for everyone to read:

### The Warrior's Pen

— Wang Yang

In this great era facing struggles of blood and fire, "pure talk" and "trivial" literature are no longer permissible. Literature in this era should take on the combat missions assigned by the nation-state. The warrior's pen should be like a double-edged sword, a pistol, directly attacking those inhuman and monstrous creatures, destroying the [omitted text] and striving for the arrival of light in the blood battle. In fact, Zhou Zuoren's "secluded" and "relaxed" approach has sufficiently proven how the train of this era of resistance has abandoned such retreating people. But this is not enough as a lesson from the past. Now, there are still people singing that literature is too "anti-war and stereotyped", "too bloody", that "we should write things unrelated to resistance" and "diluted" things. These literati (or literary literati) want to cover up the current reality of struggle and bloodshed with one hand, completely ignoring the resistance of our compatriots under the [omitted text] massacre. Although their subjective hope is only for entertainment, for "after-tea and after-meal" leisure, objectively, these people are also the kind who wag their tails at the [omitted text].

Comparing the pen to knives and guns is not entirely appropriate. Barbusse's "Fire", Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front", and works like "The Iron Flood" and "The Rout" can be used as millions of sharp weapons to stab the [omitted text]. As far as our war of resistance is concerned, both on the battlefield and in the rear, many combat literatures that match the reality of combat have grown up. Although they do not have the greatness of the above-mentioned works, they are undoubtedly weapons that are fighting hard against the [omitted text] and traitors.

Lu Xun said, "I join the united front, of course, what I use is still a pen, and what I do is still writing articles and translating books, but when this pen is useless, I can believe that I will use other weapons." (Answer to Xu Maoyong about the united front) It can be seen that people who write are not always unable to change to other weapons. As long as they can kill the [omitted text] effectively and help the revolution, pens and knives and guns are the same weapons held by warriors. The ugly creatures in Shanghai and Peiping. The writing warriors will use knives, axes, guns and bullets to sweep them away. The literary literati who are drunk on "peace" cannot see this reality. In their imagination, literature can only provide recreation. No wonder they feel bloody and want to vomit as soon as they smell the atmosphere of literature.

Fascist countries are afraid of literature. However, in China, which is launching a national revolution and war, thousands of warriors are needed to create fighting literature with their powerful and flexible hands and thoughts to relieve the nation's long-standing pain and resist the overwhelming violence. Praise this just struggle reality, young writers - patriots!

Use the pen of survival and resistance to sweep away the [omitted text] and also sweep away the absurd and shameless dregs of the nation, destroy corrupt phenomena, and strive to create new life!

### Li Guang, Known as the Flying General

— Zou Xiao

—— National Novel Talk——

In the "Yu Chuang Qi Zhen Ji" discovered by the late Ma Lian a few years ago, there is an article "Li Guang, Known as the Flying General", which is almost entirely based on Volume 109 of the Historical Records, "The Biography of General Li", and Volume 54 of the Former Han Book, "The Biography of Li Guang Su Jian". This is indeed a very good tragic story. Li Guang defended against the Huns, but was often unlucky and unsuccessful. Even if he did have merit, it could only be used to offset his crimes. He followed Zhou Yafu to put down the Wu-Chu rebellion, but because he didn't pay enough, he couldn't get the general's seal. He was defeated by the Huns at Shaxi, but because the observing eunuch was shot dead by the Huns, it was considered his crime, and could only be offset against his merits. He attacked the Huns at Yanmen, but was captured by the Huns. Although he escaped, he was demoted to commoner status by the court. All of the above are in the Han history books.

In order to emphasize its tragic nature, the novel added two twists to Li Guang. Li Guang suffered humiliation from the Ba Ling Wei. The Han book said that he reported after execution, and the Han emperor praised him and recorded the original text of the edict. However, the novel said that Li Guang was defeated by the Huns, and the emperor wanted to add an official position. The family of Ba Ling Wei came to the palace to report that Guang had relied on [omitted text] to report, and had nothing but to kill Wei. The emperor was angry, and used the merits to offset the crimes, and became an idle person again." This is one of them. The Han book only says that "Guang's army should have received a reward, but there was no reward." The meaning is that Li Guang "was captured by the enemy, but was able to defeat the enemy, and his merits and demerits were equal." However, the novel says that he "rode the chariot of the Zuo Xian Wang, intending to be unbenevolent, and was questioned by the court." As a result, Zhang Qian interceded, and it was again "merits offsetting the crimes." This is the second.

Finally, there is the story in the historical records that Li Guang followed Wei Qing and Huo Qubing to attack the Huns, got lost and missed the deadline, and committed suicide.

The official history records four instances of "bad luck," while the novel increases it to six. This reminds me of the Romance of Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition, where Xue Rengui's achievements were seized by Zhang Shigui, and he was reduced to a cook, which was also tragic, making readers angry and indignant, and increasing their sympathy. I am also reminded of Yu Dayou, who repeatedly defeated the Japanese pirates, but Gong Wenhuai stole his credit and wanted to question him for his crimes. The most famous is Yue Fei, who was killed by Qin Hui at Fengbo Pavilion.

However, such tragic stories are not needed today, because today is an era of clear politics and strict discipline, with clear rewards and punishments. Just look at the execution of Han Fuqu and Wang Gaonan, the expulsion of Wang Jingwei from the party, and the commemoration of Yan Haiwen and Yao Ziqing, etc., and you can see that the whole country is united to resist foreign aggression. The injustices suffered by Li Guang, Yue Fei, and Yu Dayou will not be seen again in this world. Therefore, when we use historical themes to write chapter novels or Peking operas, we should adopt positive themes, such as "Jiang Tou Bi Xue". Tian Han also expressed the same idea in "The War of Resistance and Drama", and had the same expression at the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Symposium.

### Comparison

Anger surging up! The rocks on the shore are wailing, who is their sympathizer! Only the floating clouds hovering in the sky. Everything here is a fragile net of pens. On the other side, there are large lines of lines, fire is burning, wind is howling, shells cut across the sky, and even more, there is the victorious smile of our soldiers.

### The Development of Satirical Art in Japan

— Bai Ying

From the perspective of human cultural history, the expression of human nature in literature and art undoubtedly first manifests itself in music and painting. Before the appearance of modeling art in the Stone Age and Bronze Age, there were already the most basic music and outlined paintings among the barbarians. This is an unchangeable fact that is evidenced by common human history or archaeological history.

According to the materialistic economic history view, the reason why humans are different from other animals is that humans can manufacture and use production tools. This is an entirely correct view. But phenomenally, the most significant difference between humans and other animals is that humans possess something called "culture". This is the comprehensive crystallization of material and spirit between people.

All animals have emotions, but other than humans, the expression of other animals' emotions can never deviate from the physiological conditions to which they belong: the intertwining of horses' necks and the mutual licking of dogs can all be said to be expressions of their emotions. However, in addition to this physiological emotional expression, humans can also use the objects of third parties to express emotions that cannot be directly explained by physiology. We believe that the origin of all art lies in this.

The art of this object and spiritual crystallization is like the fire that the symbol Prometheus stole to mankind. Once this fire reaches mankind, it will never go out. Even if the barbaric age and the dark age appear alternately in human history, art has always been developing in a curved shape. The generation of satirical art is in the isolated stage of this curved development.

For example, taking the current situation in Japan, under the brutal power of the military, all cultural movements in Japan can be said to have come to a standstill. Cultural movements are originally branches flowing to justice, and justice is as incompatible as fire and water under today's Japanese "national policy". All those engaged in legitimate cultural activities are either abused or thrown into prison. Therefore, recently there has even been a strange phenomenon of a shortage of university professors. What they call "gunmen of literature" are, to put it nicely, hangers-on; to be honest, they are just a group of lackeys who follow the warlords. This is not a malicious scolding, their "articles" are the best proof.

But precisely because Prometheus's spark has been transferred to mankind, the fire can never be extinguished even if the fire is killed for a while. Therefore, although the fascist emperors and warlords exerted great pressure on the activities of various fields of culture, in Japanese literature, there have also appeared works such as Tatsuzo Ishikawa's "Soldiers Are Still Alive". Although Tatsuzo Ishikawa has now expressed "repentance" (as shown in the "Wuhan Battle" published in the January issue of "Central Review"), the activities of folk satirical art are extremely active. In particular, various cartoon paintings targeting the so-called "national mobilization movement" can escape the attention of inspectors and be published in the most popular Japanese newspapers and magazines. Among them, there are several cartoons, and we only need to look at the titles to feel how full of irony they are. For example, on "thrift" (which has a different meaning from the thrift promoted in China), there are "Lighting Alliance", "Smoking Group", and "Garbage National Army", etc., on substitutes, there are "Substitute Team", "Fingernail Pen", and on the people's economic mobilization, there are "Wardrobe Reorganization", "Three Memorial Days", "Implement Family Examples", "Time Consumption Tax", etc. (For the original images, see the reproduced versions of "Magazine" Volume 3, Issues 5, 6, and 16).

Although the territory of Japan is planted with the forest of guns of military fascism, this kind of satirical art is a vine growing in the forest of guns. Although their initial strength is extremely weak, once they spread and grow, they will surround the forest of guns and finally trip it over, clearing a road for the growth and development of the cultural movement of justice.

According to reports, Goebbels in Germany has noticed that satirical art will endanger the existence of fascism, so he decided to put it out, but we firmly believe that Mephistopheles's magic power will ultimately be unable to eliminate Prometheus's torch. The result must be that moths rush to the fire and speed up their own death.

### The Night of Anpu

— Du Xihui

——A Plague-Ridden Town on the Jinan Road——

After eating dinner at the inn, I wearily lay on the bed to rest for a while. In my mind, it seemed that those terrifying rats were jumping before my eyes, and black, dead corpses were lying horizontally in front of me. What a truly dreadful shadow—I was being tormented and bewildered by this depressing reptile, preventing me from lying down in peace. I ran to the window to gaze at the lovely twilight of the evening outside. Such a beautiful twilight; could I really spend it in such loneliness?

Unconsciously, I locked the door and ran out of the inn, standing on that Zhebai Street. Turning left from the street corner, I saw the large red characters 'Anpu Zhongshan Park'. At the gate, there was a stone bridge leading into the park, beneath which flowed a shallow stream. The stream water made gurgling sounds as it flowed through the ancient mountain rocks. At the end of the stone bridge was a circular pond, in the center of which was a steep artificial mountain covered with verdant greenery. Several evergreen plants were planted on the mountain, and large snails were crawling on the edge of the rocks. I walked along the paved path on the right, on both sides of which were pots full of tulips, hyacinths, marigolds, and beautiful butterfly flowers. A wave of rich jasmine and fragrant rose scents wafted into my nostrils. Walking to the end of a small path flanked by flower beds, I discovered an ancient tomb from hundreds of years ago, with a weathered epitaph tablet next to it. In the verdant pine forest over there, there was also a tennis court covered with fallen leaves and a large pavilion. The park was as desolate and eerie as a tomb, without a single person or the chirping of a bird. Only the sound of lizards underground serenaded this melancholic park, this spring twilight, with a nostalgic serenade.

I quietly walked in the park, repeatedly treading the soft dirt paths, passing through the fragrant flower beds, gazing at the verdant pines and cypresses and the golden hues of the twilight sky, looking at the dilapidated tomb, listening to the monotonous gurgling of the flowing water; my heart was filled with a heroic and melancholic mood. Slowly, I walked out of the park into the darkness.

Walking on the street, it felt as dark as being in a graveyard at midnight. The gray shadows of the houses on both sides were as terrifying as pale tombstones. There were no lights, no human voices, and no barking dogs; only the occasional mournful cry of an owl flying across the starry sky. Terror and all thoughts of death gnawed at my heart, preventing me from lingering on this street. I hurriedly walked back to the inn.

I lit the oil lamp in the room, closed the door again, and sat silently on the bed, my heart still pounding and trembling. I could not say whether it was because of fear or excitement. The weariness of the journey finally overcame my heart, which was immersed in the depths of melancholy. Just as I was staring absentmindedly at the flickering lamplight, I fell asleep in a daze.

Late at night, several dense gunshots suddenly floated over from the street. I woke up from my dream, hearing a burst of chasing and fighting sounds outside. Following that, I heard:

"It's terrible! That person is shooting!..."

"Brothers—chase after him! Catch that traitor!..."! Another round of gunshots followed. With a "miserable cry," the fleeing person was clearly hit and fell to the ground.

"Hit him—hit him—hit the traitor!..."

"Ah, ah, ah—Help!… I…I'm not a traitor!… I…I'm just smuggling!…"

"Damn you! Still saying you're not a traitor!…" Another burst of beatings and "painful..." cries followed.

"Drag him back to the camp." A chaotic jumble of cursing and footsteps mixed together. The sound grew fainter and fainter. The surroundings returned to deathly silence.

Before dawn, the group of people knocked on my door and woke me up. I hurriedly got up, washed my face, put on my clothes, and settled the bill. The porter also helped me carry my luggage to the East Station. The streets were still pitch black, as if shrouded in a plague-ridden haze. The East Station was crowded with a group of travelers hurrying on their way. The porter squeezed in for me to buy a ticket and then helped me put my luggage in the luggage compartment of the train. I rewarded him with two coins. He said "Thank you," and then ran off like a wisp of smoke.

As the first glimmer of dawn appeared, our train pulled out of Anpu Station, heading forward along the long southern route. I looked back at the town, which was still shrouded in a layer of azure morning mist. "Goodbye—plague-ridden town!" I silently prayed with a feeling of escaping.

Today's Anpu is where the × people are attempting to land. I hope that the town's plague can grant the greedy imperial army a landing treat!

(The End)
