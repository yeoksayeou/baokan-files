### New British Loan to China Established

The new British loan to China has been officially established. This matter is not only of utmost importance to the relationship between China and Britain, but also will have a significant impact on the future of China's war of resistance, on the situation in the Far East and the world. This is something we cannot ignore.

Since the full-scale war of resistance began, our government has made great efforts to maintain national credit, stabilize the value of legal tender, protect the interests of friendly nations in China, and strengthen the power to resist the war and build the nation. For twenty months, we have struggled arduously, and finally won international praise and sympathy. Recently, in order to further stabilize legal tender, our Ministry of Finance raised a loan of 10 million pounds. Half of it was undertaken by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, and the other half was borrowed from Britain. The British government, recognizing that stabilizing the value of Chinese currency is of utmost importance for the maintenance of commercial and other rights and interests in China, and coupled with the unanimous sympathy and calls from the people at home and those involved in Sino-British industrial and commercial affairs, finally made it happen. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the House of Commons the other day (the 8th) that the plan to stabilize China's currency system had been successfully completed. The British side's loan of 5 million pounds was jointly lent by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China. The British Treasury will guarantee the two banks. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also announced that this fund will be managed by a joint Sino-British management committee, with a total of five members. In addition to two representatives from each of China and Britain, the fifth member will be appointed by the British government with the consent of the Chinese government.

The success of this loan from Britain to China is, of course, very important in terms of finance and economy. First, it proves that in the twenty months since the start of China's heroic resistance, the financial and economic situation has not only not been in a precarious state, as Japan has claimed, but that the foundation has become increasingly solid and the future is becoming more optimistic. This situation has been unanimously recognized and supported by Britain. Second, it is sufficient to further consolidate the foundation of China's legal tender. At the same time, Chinese and foreign businesses will benefit from it. As Mr. T.V. Soong said yesterday, "Our country's current international balance of payments situation is actually free from worries about the outflow of foreign exchange reserves. Now, the important banks of China and Britain are jointly forming an equalization fund to cope with all future market actions, and the resources allocated are several times the amount used by the Bank of China in the past. Both Chinese and foreign businesses are extremely fortunate. This is of great importance to the stability of legal tender." Third, and especially worthy of attention, is that it is sufficient to strike a blow against Japan's recent conspiracy regarding the currency of the occupied areas. The puppet governments in North and Central China had previously announced that starting today (March 10), the use of China's legal tender would be prohibited. The Sino-British announcement of the success of the new Sino-British loan and the establishment of a foreign exchange equalization fund on the previous day is, of course, a major blow to Japan's conspiracy. Fourth, there are also great benefits for Britain, because as a result of the development of Japan's military invasion of China, British interests in China have been greatly damaged. Recently, British businesses in Tianjin in North China, Shanghai in Central China, and Hong Kong in South China have been particularly severely hit by the Japanese. In order to break this bad situation and protect its legitimate rights and interests, Britain has no choice but to actively strike against Japan. Today's move by the British government can be said to be the first step in active action.

Secondly, in the political aspect, it is actually even more worthy of attention. First, it proves that Britain has realized the strength of China's resistance since the start of the war, and that only by actively assisting China can it maintain its interests in the Far East. As our Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Quo Tai-chi, said yesterday (the 9th), "This move by the British government is sufficient to prove that the Chinese government has strong and firm financial and administrative power. Britain's cooperation with China at this time demonstrates that the Western countries have understood that the best way to maintain their own and Far Eastern interests is to do their best to provide legitimate assistance to China." Second, it proves that our insistence on united resistance will inevitably gain increasing international trust and assistance, a situation that is exactly the opposite of Japan's, which becomes increasingly dangerous in its international position as it fights more and more. Therefore, the diplomatic community believes that "the success of the new Sino-British loan will make the Chinese people feel extremely gratified, because not only has China received material assistance, but it is also deeply aware that this move is sufficient to protect the rights and interests of both China and Britain and promote the friendship between China and Britain." Third, the establishment of the new Sino-British loan can become a great driving force for the movement of democratic and peaceful countries to aid China and contain Japan. It goes without saying that the Soviet Union will thereby gain further convenience in assisting our country, and there will also be important developments in the material aid movement of the United States and France. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 9th stated that "Political circles believe that this move by Britain is related to the recent US loan of 25 million to China, and said that the United States and Britain are prepared to take the same steps to provide financial assistance to China." A dispatch from Paris on the same day also stated: "Although the French government does not want to announce a loan to China, it will sell automobiles to China in the form of credit loans. It is also reported that many French industrialists have set off from France to inspect China regarding the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and the French are in contact with Britain to jointly invest in construction." This is fresh proof.

We express our infinite joy and expectation regarding the establishment of the new Sino-British loan, the future of friendship between China and Britain, the future of the international movement to aid China and contain Japan, and the future of our country's war of resistance! We can also use this new fact to shatter all pessimistic and despairing views on the war of resistance, and the defeatist arguments of those who despise the power of the peace front and advocate a ceasefire and surrender! However, we still cannot but call the attention of all parties to the following points: namely, first, the establishment of the new Sino-British loan is only the first step in Britain's adoption of active actions to aid China and contain Japan. We must not only continue to work hard to promote this active action by Britain and other democratic and peaceful countries, but we must also strive to clear away the compromising and mediating conspiracies that hinder this action. Second, the decisive manifestation of this active step by Britain is driven by two main forces: one is the hope for the future of China's insistence on united resistance, and the other is the unanimous opposition of the British people to concessions, calling for aid to China and containment of Japan, and defending rights and interests in the Far East. Therefore, on the one hand, we must intensify internal unity and persist in resistance to the end, so as not to disappoint international friends, and on the other hand, we must further strive to unite and develop the international anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement. Third, our war of resistance and national construction must be under the principle of "self-reliance" to strive for the most foreign aid, but it is definitely not what pro-Japanese traitors and defeatists call for relying on foreign aid. At this time when the international situation is rapidly turning in our favor, we must intensify domestic unity and political progress, and intensify the concentration of all the living forces of the country on the front of the war of resistance and national construction, because only the general mobilization of the living forces of the country can guarantee the final success of the war of resistance and national construction, and can guarantee the more extensive and lasting international assistance.

### Worthless Puppet Currency in North China, Trade Declines in Tianjin, Beijing and Qingdao

[Correspondent's Report] Foreign newspapers here report that American businessmen traveling to Beijing, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other northern ports said in Shanghai yesterday (28th) that because of exchange rate restrictions, trade in North China has shrunk to a barter basis, and even this trade is minimal. The new regulations strictly enforced by the Japanese authorities, which require all remittances to be handled through Yokohama Specie Bank and force people to use puppet currency, have brought exports to a standstill. If imports are banned for a long time, exports will suffer equally. Import and export businesses in Tianjin and Yantai are trying to use barter, that is, extending credit for exports in exchange for import drafts. Of course, this method cannot completely offset the loss from exchange rates, but it can minimize the loss. Merchants in North China believe that even this barter system will be allowed by the Japanese authorities to continue for a long time. Dalian's exports are dominated by farmers' agricultural products, but since the Japanese army occupied the area, agricultural activity has been drastically reduced. According to a person who has lived in North China for many years, farmers have indeed abandoned their fields in recent months and moved to the interior or cities. There are many abandoned fields in the countryside of North China. Judging from the state of the mountains and fields, farmers are clearly not preparing for spring plowing. This has two effects. First, the Japanese army destroys villages and seizes property for military purposes or in retaliation against guerrilla teams, so farmers are no longer concerned about the land. The second, which is also quite important, is that a large number of farmers, adopting a scorched earth policy, leave their homes and move elsewhere, leaving behind abandoned fields as a reward for the invaders. The Japanese military authorities have banned the export of many goods that could be used for military purposes, making commerce almost completely stagnant for Chinese merchants. The implementation of commercial restrictions has instead caused them to focus on land, because most Chinese merchants feel uneasy about holding cash and are eager to convert cash into property as soon as possible. They have absolutely no trust in the "Federal Reserve Bank" and its puppet currency, and although they occasionally use it, it is only because they are forced to do so under certain circumstances. Most of the Chinese merchants I have contacted are willing to exchange the puppet currency for legal tender at a 60% discount, and I believe they are willing to exchange it for foreign currency at a 40% discount. On this point, I can speak from my own experience. No matter what ratio the Japanese authorities set for exchanging puppet currency for foreign currency, they will never succeed. I have tried to exchange puppet currency for foreign currency, and even the "Federal Reserve Bank" itself is unwilling to accept its puppet currency. After considering all these factors, it is easy to be optimistic about the future of foreign trade in North China. When asked if he had seen signs of guerrilla activity during his trip to North China, the American businessman replied that the Japanese officers in Tianjin were very fearful and uneasy. Two weeks ago, the Japanese army sent out a patrol of 25 soldiers to investigate the location of the guerrillas, but they never returned. Two days later, another 50 soldiers were sent out, but they also did not return to camp. Therefore, the Japanese army did not dare to leave Tianjin a single step. Although there are Japanese troops guarding the villages and towns near Tianjin and Yantai during the day, they all return to the headquarters at night and do not dare to go out until dawn. Along the Tianjin-Beijing railway, I saw a bridge that was being repaired. Others told me that the bridge had been destroyed by guerrillas a week ago. Although I traveled around the north and did not personally witness any fighting, one night while staying in a hotel in Beijing, I was shaken by the sound of heavy artillery fire, which did not stop all night. The next day, the Japanese authorities claimed that the artillery fire was a shooting exercise, but according to foreigners in Beijing, there had been fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies nearby. As for Dalian, a once prosperous city, it is now completely in decline. Seeing its condition is disappointing. I was quite surprised by the state of Dalian. When I left the United States for China, I still saw a book sent by the Manchurian "authorities" with photos of the prosperity of Dalian. The North China correspondent reported in the North-China Daily News Tianjin that, that here the monetary situation has not changed, but the conditions in Beijing and Tianjin are very different. In Beijing, because there are no concessions, the Japanese can forcibly enforce the punishment regulations for using legal tender. As a result, the banknotes of the puppet government are seeing premiums. In Tianjin, puppet currency must be discounted before it can be used, and the discount is about equal to the premium in Beijing. Last November and December, there was a severe shortage of ten-yuan and five-yuan legal tender notes in Tianjin, but this is no longer a problem. Puppet currency is rarely seen in the concessions. The Japanese authorities had previously complained that British and American banks did not recognize puppet currency as legal tender. What is strange is that the German and Italian banks in Tianjin, which have very friendly relations with Japan through the Anti-Comintern Pact, also follow the example of British and American banks and refuse to use puppet currency. This shows that this puppet currency is not trusted by people. How can Japan's national education create such rigid minds in its people, but the tragic life of war will eventually make their minds clear. No matter how high the deceptive techniques of the Japanese ×-clique are, our preferential treatment of prisoners of war and the long-term nature of the war will eventually be completely exposed. The following translation and photograph of an anti-war declaration are the true evidence of Japanese soldiers' anti-war sentiments, and there will be no more doubts in the future.

To All Soldiers:

Why are you fighting? Why are you dying because of the war? These are all deceptive tricks of some tyrannical departments.

The wives and children of the war dead often feel life is difficult and have become beggars!

The financial cliques do not give a penny of condolence money, and Konoe has not even written a single condolence letter.

A dou of rice has risen in price to five and a half yuan, a preserved plum has risen in price to three cents, and a salted fish has risen in price to thirty cents. Our families have fallen into this kind of hardship. This is the military's so-called reform of the Japanese spirit and politics!

The coal in Shandong has been monopolized by the Okura Company, textiles by the Mitsui Company, and salt, alkali powder, and cement by the Mitsubishi Company. Manchuria is the world of Ayukawa alone. The Mitsui Company monopolizes the kerosene and commerce in Shanghai, and the Mitsubishi Company monopolizes the warehouse and transportation industries.

Look, on the battlefield where the blood has not yet dried, the military and the financial cliques are combined to divide the profits. Is this the military's proclamation of national prestige?

The Chinese people must persevere in their resistance with a determination to die!

If we retreat, then the ambitions of the × Pass and the financial cliques will have no way to be realized!

If we stop the war, the lives of the whole country can improve!

### Ironclad Proof of × Soldiers' Anti-War Sentiments - Special Correspondent Geng Jianbai

[Dispatch from Xi'an] The signs of the collapse of the Japanese × clique have already appeared! After these twenty months of long-term war, the Japanese domestic economic stagnation, resource exhaustion, continued trade deficits, financial constraints, troop losses, deterioration of international relations, and the war's lack of an end, the occupied areas cannot be controlled, and our forces of resistance are growing stronger and stronger. As a result, there has been a widespread sense of unease throughout the country, such as worker strikes, peasant riots, and anti-war movements among the people and soldiers. These are all obvious facts of the so-called "omens" mentioned above, especially this kind of anti-war narrative, which will be a key factor directly contributing to the total collapse of the Japanese × clique.

The bloody Hiranuma cabinet, which is attracting worldwide attention, has all kinds of effective remedies. However, it must first intensify the war of aggression against China to save the end of the × clique. Rather, it must first strengthen the exploitation of its own people to save its hopeless war of aggression against China. Although we cannot yet say that a revolution will break out in Japan because of this, there is no doubt that the anti-war movement of the Japanese people and soldiers will expand further and gradually approach revolution.

In terms of the structure of the Japanese national economy, the anti-war movement will inevitably become more widespread. Japan's industrial development is deformed, that is, capital is concentrated while production is scattered. Small and medium-sized enterprises account for a very important part of urban industry. Only the large capitalist class that operates military-related industries can enjoy the benefits of war. These small and medium-sized entrepreneurs are easily bankrupted by national control and the shadow of war. The unemployment of a large group of workers is inevitable. Small and medium-sized merchants are bound to suffer losses due to the decline in domestic purchasing power. In the rural economy, feudal landlords hold large amounts of land, and production is not capitalist. Therefore, small farmers and tenant farmers still occupy a very important position in rural production. After suffering all kinds of blows from the war, the life of toil that they have led all their lives will be further reduced. May I ask, will the Japanese peasant masses forever maintain a laissez-faire attitude toward the war and allow themselves to starve to death in vain? Their anti-war trend can be said to be inevitable.

The Japanese soldiers who participated in the war of aggression mostly come from the countryside, and some come from the children of workers and small and medium-sized merchants in the cities. They and their families are the first to suffer the scourge of war, and they suffer the most. Their parents, brothers, wives, and children struggle on the line of hunger every day. They themselves are wounded, disabled, killed in action, and captured, and the war has no purpose or end. Under these circumstances, what will they feel? They are all human beings. They must not be able to persist in the war, and naturally they will tend to oppose the war.

Among the Japanese people and soldiers, there are naturally progressive elements with foresight, who led the anti-war movement at the beginning of the war. A year ago, we found anti-war leaflets from Japanese soldiers in the war zone. However, at that time, the general Japanese people and soldiers, under the deception of the Japanese × clique, had not yet deeply tasted the evil consequences of the war and had not generally awakened. The activities of anti-war elements had not been able to penetrate the masses. At the same time, the Japanese × clique's surveillance was extremely strict, and their activities were not easy to spread. After more than a year of this tragic war, their activities have gradually gained favorable conditions, so the anti-war movement has become increasingly widespread and in-depth. Recently, on the Shanxi battlefield, we have often found anti-war leaflets. Recently, eleven leaflets that had not yet been distributed were found on a prisoner in Jixian County, western Shanxi. The leaflets were printed by lithography, the paper was extremely thin, the handwriting was neat, and the printing was clear, which shows that their technology is quite advanced and their plans are quite comprehensive.

Some people often express doubts about the records of × soldiers' anti-war sentiments in newspapers. They believe that Japanese soldiers have learned a long-term national education containing toxins, and will not easily waver in their war of aggression against China. Moreover, under the strict surveillance and deception of their × clique, anti-war activities are not easy to carry out. However, precisely because of this, the occurrence of this kind of anti-war movement is even more meaningful. No

### Anhui in Rapid Progress

— Bai Hua

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After the Nanjing and Xuzhou campaigns, Anhui has emerged from extreme tension into sudden tranquility. Although Anhui is not the central area of the war, it naturally retains important value in the overall War of Resistance. Historically, at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, the Ming Emperor Taizu, started as a commoner without a single soldier, raising the banner of condemning foreign tribes in the area between Jiang, Huai, Xu, and Si. Within a few years, he overthrew the Yuan Dynasty, which had the most powerful military force in Chinese history. He did so partly for personal gain and partly for the freedom of the people. However, reflecting on this part of history, we can understand that the people of Anhui have a traditional spirit of resistance against foreign oppression. In the occupied areas, they will never willingly submit; in the non-occupied areas, they will surely make heroic contributions. A few days ago, a friend who was a staff officer in General Zhan Zhongyuan's division returned from Anhui, bringing the reporter much exciting and comforting news. He told us that today's Anhui has quietly completed much anti-Japanese work and secured many conditions for victory. Resisting the enemy while building the nation, Anhui is silently striving in this way.

Of the 62 counties in Anhui Province, those along the Jinpu Railway in northern Anhui are occupied by the enemy, but most of southern Anhui is still in our hands. The Anhui Provincial Government is still able to govern more than three-fifths of the province. At the same time, Anhui is a hilly area, with high and steep terrain in the west and low terrain trending towards the northeast. Our controlled areas have a commanding advantage over the enemy-occupied areas. The enemy's failure to disturb Huaining after capturing Nanjing, and the failure to clear Huaixi after capturing Xuzhou, are related to military strength and strategic value, but are also limited by the terrain to some extent. Today, we are taking advantage of this favorable terrain to inflict serious blows and threats on the enemy.

Undoubtedly, since Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Jiujiang fell, Anhui has been surrounded by the enemy on three sides. However, due to the enemy's stretched forces, they have long been unable to advance further, allowing us to establish strong bases for counter-offensive in the enemy's rear. Therefore, today's Anhui is like a sharp sword inserted into the enemy's abdomen, with Hefei as the tip and Lanxi as the hilt. Our hand holding the sword extends from Yunnan and Guizhou along Changsha and Nanchang in a straight line. The stronger our hand becomes, the more powerful this sword will be. Now, we are striving to push this sword deeper and deeper into the enemy's abdomen, and soon we will see "the white blade goes in, the red blade comes out."

It is said that in the past three or four months since last December, Anhui has been very quiet, and even enemy planes have rarely been seen. Our troops are holding the line in the Guichi area. The enemy, after the Battle of Wuhan, is still catching their breath and has no extra strength to invade Anhui. Our implementation of the strategy of protracted war also does not involve large-scale offensives, so many elite troops of Qiu Zhaochen, Zhan Zhongyuan, and others, who fought on the Nanchang-Xunyang and Longhai lines, have been stationed there without showing their full potential, inevitably feeling a sense of "fat thighs." In order to establish a base for counter-offensive, the military authorities have taken advantage of the quiet period to train and organize reserve forces in Anhui as much as possible, increasing the strength for future offensives. Near Huizhou, there are many strong soldiers from Sichuan and Guizhou who shout slogans and learn the movements of the drill manuals every day in the training grounds. The soldiers from Sichuan and Guizhou are known for their fortitude and perseverance. Combined with modern military knowledge, they can form an elite force to establish great achievements in the next phase of the War of Resistance. Anhui is also doing a good job in conscription. There are very few cases of draft evasion or desertion. Each conscription district can generally recruit more than 80% or 90% of the required number, and they are all volunteering. Therefore, from these two points, we can see that there is absolutely no problem with our troop replenishment. Even if this group of soldiers makes heroic sacrifices for the nation, a second group of even more heroic soldiers will advance on their un-dried bloodstains.

The success of conscription is largely based on the soundness of Anhui's baojia system. Anhui's baojia system is worthy of praise. Whether in poor and remote villages, thorough investigations and organization have been strictly implemented. Therefore, even the counties in northern Anhui close to the front line are orderly. In particular, the work of military transportation and supply, which is a difficult problem in other provinces, has a correct blueprint in Anhui's baojia system. The distribution is relatively even, and the people are happy to serve. As a result, the military has received a lot of help on the march. Regardless of long or short distances, every village they arrive at sincerely treats and assists them. The people cherish the army, and the army naturally cannot bear to harass the people, and will carefully protect them. It is a ladder of mutual assistance and cooperation. The military and civilians of Anhui have warmly joined hands.

Even under the enemy's encirclement, transportation between Anhui and the interior is still convenient. For example, departing from Huizhou, after a few hours by highway bus to Lanxi, one can transfer to a train through Nanchang to various provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou. Although the Jinpu and Jingwu Railways in the province have long been lost, many kilometers of the province's six thousand kilometers of highways are still open to traffic, communicating information, troops, economy, and culture. However, those adjacent to the occupied areas have been thoroughly destroyed.

Huizhou, the capital of Anhui Province, has grown up painfully in the flames of war. After repeated bombings by enemy planes last year, part of the population was evacuated, but now it is gradually becoming lively again. It is worth mentioning that Anhui had a bumper harvest last year, agricultural products are extremely cheap, and prices are twice as low as in Qujiang. The people's livelihood and military supplies are absolutely guaranteed, and the spirit of resistance will be even stronger.

The Xuzhou-Pukou section of the Jinpu Railway in the enemy-occupied area is still a "dead" road, not open to traffic. We often send regular troops leading armed peasants to distribute themselves on both sides of the railway or open up attacks near Jingbeng, causing the enemy even more panic. Each time there are gains. There are not many civilian firearms in Anhui, so there is no establishment of self-defense corps like in Guangdong, but the people's attitudes are brave and strong.

Anhui is like a sharp sword, about to steadily thrust into the enemy's heart. The enemy's tyranny and cruelty far surpass the descendants of Genghis Khan. The enemy's military power is far inferior to the Mongolians. Heroes and talents in the Jiang, Huai, Xu, and Si area, do not forget the great achievements of the Ming Emperor Taizu, rise up and desperately fight against the foreign aggressors.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Announces Establishment of New Sino-British Loan in the House of Commons; Totaling £5 Million for Exchange Equalization; Sino-British Banks to Jointly Manage the Fund

British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon

[Reuters, London, 8th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the Chinese government is preparing to raise £10 million as a foreign exchange equalization fund to strengthen its currency system. Two British banks are willing to jointly raise £5 million on behalf of the Chinese government, with the remaining funds to be borne by two Chinese government banks. The two British banks are willing to raise the funds, but require a guarantee from the British Treasury, which has been granted. A proposal has been drafted and submitted to the legislature for approval. It is reported that the interest rate on this loan is particularly low.

[Hong Kong News] The two British banks responsible for raising £5 million are HSBC, responsible for £3 million, and Mercantile Bank, responsible for £2 million. On the Chinese side, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are responsible for raising funds. This £10 million foreign exchange stabilization fund will be managed by a management committee, with the headquarters reportedly planned to be located in Hong Kong. The committee will include representatives from the two British banks and the two Chinese banks, with another member jointly appointed by the Chinese and British governments, subject to the approval of HSBC and Mercantile Bank. The purpose of establishing this fund is to stabilize the price of Chinese currency, prevent abnormal fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the British pound, and adjust foreign exchange transactions. After the establishment of this foreign exchange stabilization fund loan, the Chinese government's economic and financial policies will adopt the value of stabilizing the Chinese yuan against the British pound, and future purchases of foreign exchange must be transacted with one of the banks on the management committee.

Statement by Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, Announcing the Process of Establishing the Chinese Loan, Confidently Believing that Chinese and Foreign Businesses Will Benefit

[Hong Kong News] Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, made the following statement regarding the foreign currency stabilization fund announced in London:

Our Chinese yuan has maintained stability since June of last year. This time, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, together with the British HSBC and Mercantile Bank, have jointly established an equalization fund, which should further consolidate the foundation of the Chinese yuan. On March 12th of last year, due to special circumstances, the government ordered government banks to stop selling foreign exchange without limit at the official price and announced new rules for applying for foreign exchange approval. After implementation, the Shanghai market's exchange rate against the British pound continued to fall, reaching around eight pence in June. At that time, the Bank of China believed that the external value of the Chinese yuan had been excessively devalued. Given the deep faith of the Chinese people in the Chinese yuan, if there were temporary unfavorable news in the military and political situation that caused market agitation, the bank would be determined to maintain stability and it would not be difficult. This maintenance policy was approved by the government and enthusiastically assisted by Chinese and foreign colleagues, and the bank began to work on stabilizing foreign exchange.

Based on past experience, the bank's predictions were not excessive. During the fall of Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Hankou, although we felt the threat of speculators, the foreign exchange market was still able to maintain its balance. Not only that, but whenever the turmoil subsided, the bank was still able to recover all the foreign exchange sold to maintain the Chinese yuan.

According to China's current international balance of payments, there is no need to worry about the outflow of foreign exchange reserves. Now, the major banks of China and Britain have jointly established an equalization fund to cope with all future market shocks, and the resources allocated are several times the amount used by the Bank of China in the past. Both Chinese and foreign businesses are extremely fortunate, as this is of great importance to the stability of the Chinese yuan.

British Officials Declare Continued Support for China; British Government Values Its Interests in China; This Loan Serves as a Warning to Japan

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] After Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced to the House of Commons that two British banks would assist the Chinese government in establishing an exchange equalization fund, officials responsible here recently declared that this fund, located in London, would be operated in the same way as the British exchange equalization fund. The main goal of British support for Chinese legal tender is to safeguard British business in China, not to protect the interests of the gold pound. This move is in no way unfriendly to Japan. If the Japanese government raises objections, it will be explained to them. Previously, the Japanese government repeatedly stated that it must maintain Chinese currency in a manner it deems appropriate. The British government is also eager to maintain Chinese currency prices in a manner it deems appropriate. British businesses are suffering from currency price fluctuations. In short, this move by Britain is within the scope of pursuing a friendly and neutral policy towards China and is not discriminatory against Japan. In the future, it may use other methods to assist China.

[Reuters, London, 8th] Those responsible pointed out that the interest payments on loans secured by Chinese customs revenue have never been delayed. As for other loans, China has also paid interest on time. Although China is in difficult circumstances, and some areas with strong tax revenues have fallen into the hands of others, it is still trying its best to maintain its credit. Compared to some countries that deliberately deny it on the pretext of hardship, it is very different. Although this loan to maintain the Chinese currency system plan does not directly affect the management of foreign exchange in North China, it is actually a warning to Japan: the British government will never sit idly by and watch British interests in China be devastated without providing practical assistance. It is also learned that there are many other active measures being considered. Some parties have been constantly demanding that the government take retaliatory measures against Japan to remove restrictions on British interests in China. Those who previously advocated a policy of appeasement now also believe that only retaliatory measures can achieve satisfactory results.

### Financial Circles in Shanghai and Hong Kong Pleased with the Rise in the Chinese Yuan Exchange Rate; Domestic and Foreign Bonds Soared Yesterday; Enemy Control of Foreign Exchange in North China is Insignificant

[Hong Kong News] After the news of the loan was revealed yesterday morning, the foreign exchange value of the Chinese yuan in Hong Kong and Shanghai increased. In Shanghai, the value of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar rose from 15875 to 16062 yuan, and against the British pound from 8 pence and 1/8 to 8 pence and 9/32. The market is firm. The enemy in North China will implement foreign exchange controls today. Under normal circumstances, our foreign exchange would be affected by it, especially the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the US dollar and British pound. However, not only is there no adverse impact, but it has turned for the better, indicating that the enemy's efforts are futile. In Hong Kong, the exchange rate of the Chinese yuan against the Hong Kong dollar rose from 548 to 556 yesterday. The yuan also followed the Chinese yuan and rose in price, and there is still potential for further increases. The exchange rate also followed the Chinese currency in its appreciation, and has room to increase further.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 9th] After the announcement of the British loan of £10 million (correction: should be £5 million) to China, economic circles here expressed their satisfaction. The market atmosphere has been refreshed, which has not been seen recently. Simon's announcement has caused all domestic public bonds to rise, with enthusiastic buyers. General confidence in the government has also increased. The exchange rate of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar and the British pound has also rebounded. A trading broker told reporters that the success of this loan is extremely beneficial to Shanghai's financial circles.

[Hong Kong News] The Shanghai financial market suddenly became active yesterday. The price of national bonds soared, and the market situation was very stable. The exchange rate of the silver dollar against the British pound and the US dollar also improved. The foreign exchange outlook is very optimistic. As for Hong Kong, the trading of silver dollars has been unusually cold for the past month, but it also changed its usual state yesterday. Speculators are extremely active, but sellers mostly regard this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and are unwilling to release their stored silver dollars immediately for small profits, so there are very few transactions.

### Guo Taiqi Speaks: British Aid to Us is Actually Helping Themselves

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] After Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced to the House of Commons that the Chinese government had established an exchange equalization fund, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi issued a statement to the press, saying that this move is sufficient to demonstrate China's strength and that it is capable of coping with financial, commercial, territorial, and administrative matters. British cooperation with China is also sufficient to prove that the Western countries are giving China full and legitimate assistance, which is a measure to safeguard the business and interests of those countries in the Far East. This move by Britain directly helps China, and also proves that the common interests of China and Britain must be safeguarded, which our country warmly welcomes and is willing to do its best to achieve.

### The US and France Highly Value the New British Loan to China; The US Believes it is Sufficient to Counteract Japanese Attempts; France Still Adopts Credit Export Methods to Assist China

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Official opinion here believes that Sir Simon's announcement of a loan to China to stabilize the Chinese government's currency is sufficient to counteract Japanese attempts to undermine the value of the Chinese yuan in North China.

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Officials remain silent and have not yet commented on Sir Simon's announcement of a loan to stabilize Chinese currency. However, government officials believe that this move by Britain is related to the recent US loan of $25 million to China. It is said that the US and Britain are prepared to take similar steps to provide financial assistance to China. It is also believed that most of the loan will be at the disposal of the Chinese government, otherwise the effect will be minimal.

### Shanghai Puppet Organizations Vie for Power

[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the puppet mayor Chuan Xiaonan took office last year, in order to expand his territory, he planned to include the nine counties near Shanghai, including Shanghai, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Chongming, Taicang, Jiading, and Qingpu, under his jurisdiction. Together with the five districts in the urban area, namely the Southeast District, Pudong North District, Pushe, West Shanghai, and Zhabei, he divided them into fourteen districts, each with a puppet "District Public Office" and dispatched henchmen as puppet "District Chiefs". This caused a fierce dispute with the puppet Jiangsu "Provincial Office", so Chuan's plan could not proceed smoothly. As a result, only the four suburban eight township puppet "Political Affairs Offices" of the former puppet Superintendent's Office were reorganized into puppet "District Public Offices". The eight puppet "District Chiefs" were still succeeded by the former puppet "Political Affairs Chiefs", including Zhu Yuzhen, the puppet "District Chief" of the Southeast District of Pudong, Zhu Rui (a pseudonym for Zhu Yun), Shen Shijing of Nanshi, Li Zidong of West Shanghai, Zhang Pinquan of Zhabei, Yan Gangru of Baoshan, Lu Tieying of Chuansha, and Mei Liyang of Nanhui. Each person was given a puppet "salary" of 360 yuan per month. There were also puppet "Section Chiefs" in each puppet "Office" who received 130 yuan per month, and puppet "Staff Members" who received 100 yuan per month. Together with the expenses of each puppet "Office", the puppet "Municipal Government" had to bear 25,000 yuan per month. Like a bolt from the blue, on the 1st of this month, Chuan Xiaonan suddenly issued a puppet "order" to retain "positions" and suspend "salaries" on the pretext that the puppet treasury was empty. The eight small puppets were extremely shocked and went to Jiangwan together to demand that Chuan Xiaonan withdraw the puppet "order", but to no avail. Because their income was cut off, they were all extremely embarrassed. Now each puppet "Office" has completely stopped handling puppet "affairs" and will undergo reorganization within a week.

### British Newspapers Comment on the Exchange Equalization Fund, Saying it is Sufficient to Consolidate Our Currency System and Hoping for Greater Assistance

[Reuters, London, 9th] The financial correspondent of the "Times" declared today, "After the government lent China £10 million as a Chinese exchange equalization fund, the financial community here expressed a warm welcome, especially those concerned about Chinese trade. The Chinese government has received a lot of assistance from the US Treasury's purchase of silver, but recently the shipment of silver to the US has decreased. Although China still has adequate funds to subsidize foreign exchange, it is not as wealthy as expected. Under these circumstances, the equalization fund, although not essential, will ultimately be welcomed. What is even more important is that Chinese banks are still able to share such a large amount, which is truly gratifying. This fund is large enough to meet all exchange requirements. The fund committee will be located in Shanghai and will be responsible for managing the fund to equalize foreign exchange and control exchange rates. At the same time, we should also pay close attention to Japan's attempt to force the circulation of counterfeit 'Reserve Bank' currency in North China, because although it will not damage the Chinese yuan, it is enough to disrupt North China's normal foreign trade. However, the establishment of this equalization fund has nothing to do with Japan's attempts in North China and is not politically motivated. From a purely commercial point of view, Britain's support for the Chinese yuan is a necessary and constructive policy. This foreign exchange credit loan is related to China's repayment of debts and makes it easier for the Chinese government to manage its position. Therefore, we now hope that the Chinese government can make further progress in repaying debts."

[Reuters, London, 9th] The "News Chronicle" said today, "The stability of the Chinese currency system is extremely necessary for British financial and commercial interests. This is a good reason to help China, but not the best reason. All parties demand that Japan should not carry out large-scale killings of its neighbors. Financial assistance is one way for Britain to help China strengthen its heroic resistance, but there should be even more assistance than this."

### Commemorating March 8th (Continued)

— Song Meiling

……Original Text of Speech at the Chongqing Commemoration Meeting……

Anything that benefits the war effort and national reconstruction, we women should not hesitate to take on tasks that men can handle. Especially those important tasks that most women can do. I believe nothing surpasses comforting the families of soldiers at the front and assisting them. We should frequently comfort the soldiers at the front and the families of fallen soldiers, providing them with spiritual comfort. We should help them become self-sufficient, such as by organizing small handicrafts and cooperatives, to prevent economic and living difficulties. We should also assist them in resolving their children's educational issues. In this way, soldiers at the front will have no worries about their families, and our fellow citizens can enthusiastically enlist and go to the front. If we have a smooth way to implement the conscription, victory in the war is certain, and the country will be secure.

I believe that with our women's spirit, we can certainly contribute greatly to the war effort. Just look at the achievements of the women's donation on Sunday, and we can have real confidence. Why can women's donations achieve such results? It is entirely because we have organization, unity, and a spirit of hard work and endurance. We women can mobilize unanimously, regardless of each other, and bring out our forces, whether large or small. With such achievements, I believe we have much more work to do, and not every task needs to have obvious superficial results. Our work is only driven by our patriotic duty and responsibility. We should not hope for praise, or encouragement, but bury our heads in more practical work. The more work that goes unnoticed, the greater the power. We should be unsung heroes in arduous and lonely work, not seeking personal glory, but seeking the glory of the country and nation through collective efforts. In this way, we will certainly be able to raise the status of our women and achieve our more lofty goals through practical work.

Fellow citizens, this war of resistance is a war of justice against violence, a critical moment for national survival, and the prelude to national rejuvenation. We should now ignore everything else, concentrate on winning the war. We must know that justice and righteousness belong to us, and the sympathy of all mankind in the world belongs to us. Let me give you a few examples to prove it.

First, I would like to present to you a precious gift. This is an item that an Indian woman took off her body. She said, "She has deep hatred for the cruelty of the Japanese ×× and infinite sympathy for our Chinese resistance, and is greatly moved by the efforts of our Chinese women in the anti-aggression work. Not having anything to offer, she took off her only property, the ornament she always wore, and donated it to China." I ask you to look at this necklace, how much deep affection is entrusted to it.

Second, I received a letter from an American girl studying abroad, and also attached a gold coin. In her letter, she said that she was an unfortunate woman, but she heard that China was being ravaged by × people so cruelly, and the suffering of Chinese men, women, and children was so deep. She understands the cruel actions of × people towards China, and is not blind. She feels that she should no longer complain about her misfortune. She expressed shame and also expressed her infinite excitement at the courage of Chinese women engaged in anti-aggression. This letter and a gold coin from thousands of miles away are truly moving.

Third, I received a letter from another foreign woman. She said that her fiancé and friends had died on a trip, and she herself was suffering from paralysis, but driven by the idea of justice and morality, she was very concerned about the Sino-Japanese War and prayed for China's victory every day. Her doctor was afraid that she would be too stimulated and even forbade her to read the newspaper. She could not write the letter herself, so she asked her friend to write a letter on her behalf, hoping that our Chinese compatriots could persevere and strive for final victory. You should know that I have been receiving several letters from abroad every day recently.

The above are just a few examples. We see that foreign friends thousands of miles away are like this, how should we, as daughters of the Chinese nation, encourage and urge ourselves to save our country and seek the liberation of our nation, and the true liberation of tens of millions of female compatriots? I am fully confident that it is certain we can achieve our goals with our own sacrifices and struggles, seeking national liberation and the true liberation of tens of millions of female compatriots. I hope that the female compatriots present today will make up their minds, move forward and fight, and write the most glorious contribution in the history of the world's women's movement. (End)

### British War Secretary Reports Good Military Reorganization, Submits Army Budget to the Lower House, Increases Air Defense and Overseas Strength

— Belisha

[Central News Agency London Eighth] War Secretary Belisha submitted the budget for the next year (1939-40) to the House of Commons, totaling £161,133,000, and explained that Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on February 6, stating that Britain and France have a joint relationship, and if France is attacked without provocation, Britain will support it with all its forces. Therefore, the British Army must prepare everything to be able to go to the European continent to participate in the war if necessary. The goal of the talks between the British and French staff is limited to formulating a joint defense plan and has no aggressive meaning. But as the overall situation is like this, we must reorganize the military so that all kinds of troops can get full supplies, and we must pay attention to the defense of this headquarters to protect the safety of the people.

[Reuters London Eighth] British War Secretary Belisha continued to speak in the House of Commons today on the reorganization of the army. He said: The main issue in the House of Commons is what preparations the British Army should have to deal with once a war breaks out on the European continent. He mentioned Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration of British and French unity, saying that "This makes us have to consider and prepare to use the army in order to deal with certain events. If we are involved in the war, our contribution and the method of application will not be subject to any limited liability principle. The negotiations between our country and France only discuss the plan of self-defense, not for aggressors. On our country’s side, we have a detailed plan. We are willing to exert the greatest power in the war. Therefore, in peacetime, we should adjust production, accumulate reserve goods, and create new production industries in order to supply the army’s equipment and maintain it. As the final period of war danger approaches, the army must be trained and supplied with the necessary equipment. What I am doing is in accordance with this principle." After announcing various reorganizations and increases in personnel, Belisha continued, "Domestic defense is our greatest responsibility and receives our greatest attention. Its development can resist aggressors and keep our people safe. This has been decided and must be completed."

[Reuters London Eighth] British War Secretary Belisha said when submitting the army budget to the House of Commons today that the reorganization of the British Army and the defense of Britain and the Empire have made amazing progress. He first reported on the situation this year, saying that the original two divisions of anti-aircraft artillery teams have been expanded into five divisions, and a headquarters has been set up to command them. The various administrative conveniences of these anti-aircraft artillery teams have also been greatly increased. Many concrete and steel-bone gun beds have been added and are continuing to be added. The artillery has also been increased, and the transportation system and the method of recruiting personnel have been improved. Next year, two more divisions of anti-aircraft artillery teams will be added, totaling seven divisions. The existing fortresses will also be increased by 50% to 100%. Each medium and heavy anti-aircraft artillery fortress is equipped with heavy artillery and searchlights. A factory for manufacturing 3.7-caliber guns has been opened and will be produced this autumn. Swiss-style 40 cm light anti-aircraft artillery can also be manufactured by this autumn. At the same time, it is being purchased from foreign countries. Belisha then discussed overseas defense, saying that our goal is to maintain the garrison troops in each territory so that they can cope with the outbreak of war without affecting the standing army. Local people can be recruited into the army if necessary. The Army Department has decided to add 700 Mudith artillerymen. A location has been found for training Cidis and English artillerymen. The government has sent officers to Cyprus to find out the extent to which the people there are willing to participate in the defense of the Empire. About 1,000 Malay and Indian soldiers will be added in Singapore. The same number will be added to the Chinese and Indian soldiers in Hong Kong. For the first time, the government has added Ceylon soldiers to the coastal defense team and the anti-aircraft artillery team. Troops in other parts of the Empire are also increasing local personnel. In order to seek free action of warships and reduce their original protection duties, the defense of overseas ports has been strengthened. Reserve teams in the Middle East, India, and the Empire are being organized. The current reserve team in the Middle East includes two divisions, stationed in Palestine, with two brigades per division and four battalions per brigade. This reserve team is an independent army and does not need to consume domestic resources. It is hoped that the results of the Charterfield Committee's recommendations will produce a suitable Indian reserve team. Four battalions of British infantry in India have been transferred and are now in the Mediterranean region. The Middle East reserve team, like the domestic national defense forces and the strengthening of overseas garrisons, will not affect the strength of the Empire reserve team. The Empire reserve team can draw on combat troops, train them, and equip them to cope with the war in Europe. The troops include 13 infantry divisions, 2 mechanized teams, 3 armored vehicle teams, 2 cavalry brigades, and other troops. Belisha continued, "Our country’s production situation is very good. We can predict that all regular troops can be fully equipped to cope with the war next year. However, the new armored vehicle division has not yet been established. Only a large number of excellent light tanks are being received. The performance of the women who handle the autonomous territories' troops and affiliated businesses is also good. There are 6,500 national defense groups, and more will be added in the future. Regarding recruitment matters, soldiers of all levels have reached 531,353 people (excluding the central army of India and Myanmar), indicating that 83,000 people have been added in December." Regarding the mobilization plan, Belisha said, "Within four days of mobilization, 200 central locations can supply the combat troops' needs. After mobilization, the recruited troops can join the autonomous territories' troops to support the war."

[Central News Agency Paris, Day Telegram] French officials are very welcome to War Secretary Belisha's speech because it confirms that if a war breaks out in Europe, British troops will go to the continent to fight. France has recently believed that if a war breaks out, France will bear the brunt. Now the British authorities' statement is enough to dispel their concerns.

[Haitong Guo London Ninth Telegram] According to today's Daily Express, War Secretary Belisha announced in the House of Commons yesterday that in the near future, British and French military officers will hold a meeting. The telegram also said that the topic to be discussed in the future is expected to be the number of expeditionary forces dispatched by Britain in the event of war.

### Japanese Soldiers ×××× Secretly Expand the Military

[Tokyo Communication] According to the Associated Press, visiting reporter Mr. Lee Clay in Tokyo stated that the Japanese soldiers, in view of the two years of war in China, are trapped in deep mud, with huge losses and a worrying future, are actively rebuilding the army, navy, and air force in secret. The military buildup plan is absolutely kept secret from the people, for fear that the people will rise up against it due to the increased burden. However, the army and navy are quite active. The battle was promoted in the recent parliament, and 1,550,000,000 yuan has been proposed as the military expenditure for the next year. The purpose is three points: 1. To prepare for war with the Soviet Union, this is the last wish of the Japanese army. 2. To fundamentally control the western Pacific with naval and air force strength and prevent the British and American interference in Japan's continental aggression policy. This is the task of the Japanese navy. In short, Japan's new military expansion plan is to attempt to realize its inherent dream of climbing to the status of a world power. The Japanese army is confident that only by conquering with force can Japan enter the extreme of world politics and economy. Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty, which will expire in mid-March, the Japanese side is strenuously propagating that the Soviet Union will refuse to renew it, so the rumors that Japan intends to go to war with the Soviet Union are quite noisy. The parliament even passed a bill requiring the government to "strive for fishing rights with all its strength." As for the United States, Japan would regard it as its only enemy in the Pacific, but it does not dare to provoke it at present, because the Japanese navy personnel admit that the Japanese fleet is only enough to resist the US attack, but has no strength to counterattack the United States. However, they still brazenly said that if the United States wants to enter the West Pacific and interfere with Japan's maritime blockade operations, a Japanese-American war may still break out. Once this fact occurs, it will be the Japanese navy to launch its dream of a southward policy. The central purpose of this policy is in the rich Dutch East Indies. They said that they do not intend to explore the southward policy until all routes have been blocked. What is worth noting is that Japan's naval expansion plan is now being promoted particularly actively. This year's naval general budget is 113,000,000 yuan, and there is a supplementary budget, but it refuses to publish it. Its entire plan can be completed in about three years. According to the Naval Minister Yonei's report to the members of parliament, the Japanese navy's plan pays special attention to the increase in aircraft. However, Yonei did not agree to talk about the matter of adding four 35,000-ton large cruisers, only said that there are indeed warships under construction.

[Associated Press Tokyo Ninth Telegram] Yesterday afternoon, the House of Representatives held a budget debate. Aoki, the president of the Planning Bureau, replied to a question about the four-year plan to develop industrial production, saying, "After the completion of the four-year plan, China and Japan can be self-sufficient in steel, iron, coal, light metals, zinc, automobiles, ships, and railway equipment. If 1938 is the base year, then the iron in 1941 will increase by 250%. The percentage of other increased production is as follows: steel, 60%; special steel, 200%; coal, 30%; copper, 80%; lead, 90%; zinc, 70%; gold, 20%; automobiles, 50%; locomotives, 30%; passenger cars, 70%; freight cars, 50%."

### Britain is Making Efforts to Solve the Palestine Problem, the Final Proposal will be Submitted Next Week, and it is Not Believed that the Future is Hopeless

[Reuters London Eighth] According to responsible sources, the British government is now considering the true proposal on the Palestine issue and will submit it to the Arab and Jewish delegations in the middle of next week. It is reported that the British government submitted some proposals to the Arab and Jewish sides ten days ago, and now their attitudes have been clarified. Although there are still some details to be discussed, it is believed that the government is now working hard to seek a possible solution. In the next few days of this week, we will specifically discuss the so-called "British government's final proposal on the Palestine issue" and learn that the British government is particularly willing to discuss it jointly with the Arab and Jewish sides. The government does not believe that the future is hopeless, and the meeting will continue to be held to see whether the British government's proposal can promote a solution. If the proposal is still not accepted by the Arab and Jewish sides, it is heard that the British government will unilaterally solve it. [Reuters London Eighth] British Colonial Minister MacDonald replied to a question on the Palestine Conference in the House of Commons today, saying that he could not make any statement other than what he reported on the 27th of last month. Liberal Party member Mr. Pidd asked whether Mr. MacDonald could guarantee that the Palestine Conference would still be based on the League of Nations mandate. MacDonald replied that the government is still bound by the treaty, but it is not convenient to make any further statement at present.

### The Soviet Union is Preparing to Assist Poland and the Baltic States

Published in a British Newspaper

[Central News Agency Moscow Eighth] A British newspaper yesterday said that the Soviet government has notified Poland and Romania that if the western borders of these countries are violated, the Soviet Union will provide them with all its resources.

### French General Election to be Held on April 5

[Associated Press Paris Ninth Telegram] The French Senate and House of Representatives will hold a joint meeting at the Palace of Versailles on April 5 to elect the President of the French Republic.

### Japanese Invasion of China Results in Increased Issuance of Banknotes, a New Law to Manage the Issuance of Banknotes is Submitted to Parliament for Discussion

[Associated Press Tokyo Ninth Telegram] The Japanese government today submitted a new law to manage the issuance of banknotes by the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Taiwan to Parliament for discussion. The purpose of the new law is to increase the issuance of banknotes by the Bank of Japan (1.7 billion yen) to 2.2 billion yen, the issuance of banknotes by the Bank of Korea (100 million yen) to 160 million yen, and the issuance of banknotes by the Bank of Taiwan (50 million yen) to 80 million yen. The law has an addendum stating that the regulations will be repealed within one year after the end of the "China Incident."

### Britain is Closely Monitoring the Development of the Situation in Spain, Italy Intends to Increase its Troops in Libya by 30,000, the British-Italian Agreement has been Broken

[Reuters London Eighth] Undersecretary Butler said in the House of Commons today in response to inquiries that the British government had not submitted a document to the Spanish side for a peaceful resolution of the Spanish civil war. He said that the British government is closely monitoring the developing situation but believes that it is not appropriate to be responsible for proposing a solution at this time. Butler also replied to another question, saying that according to the information obtained by Foreign Secretary Halifax, the Italian government increased its troops in Libya by 30,000. After the increase is completed, the number of Italian troops in the area will be equal to the number before the British-Italian Agreement was established.

[Central News Agency Burgos Ninth Telegram] The Spanish National Army Naval Headquarters announced that all Mediterranean ports controlled by the Spanish government have been completely blockaded. No ship may enter the three-mile point on the Spanish coast without the permission of the National Army Navy Department. Otherwise, they will be detained.

[Haitong News Agency Paris Ninth Telegram] Although telephone calls between Paris and Madrid have been restored yesterday, the news reported by various parties is very contradictory. It is generally expected that the National Defense Council has not been able to control the situation.

### United States to Repeal Neutrality Act, National Defense Bill Submitted to the House for Discussion, Gaeta Writes Article Attacking Stimson

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] Senator Hale stated that he supports any government steps to repeal the Neutrality Act. However, he questioned why Roosevelt previously advocated for the enactment of the Neutrality Act but now advocates for its repeal, and the reasons for this should be explained. Senator Lewis has submitted a bill to the Senate to repeal the Neutrality Act.

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] After the Senate passed the National Defense Bill today, it was submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion. The main amendments to the bill by the Senate include increasing the number of army aircraft to 6,000 and limiting the maximum expenditure on aircraft and other equipment for the army to $300 million. Administration officials expressed opposition to the limitation on aircraft expenditures. In addition to stipulating an increase in the number of aircraft, the National Defense Bill also allocated $23,750,000 to maintain the fortifications of the Panama Canal and $34,500,000 to order a large quantity of war materials.

[Associated Press, Rome, 9th] Gaeta wrote an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia" today, stating that the activities of pro-war elements in the United States have caused Roosevelt to develop the idea of using force against totalitarian states, with Stimson being the most prominent. If the United States wishes, it is free to expand its military, but we believe that the current arms race is a responsibility that the United States cannot shirk. Therefore, the United States should not criticize Germany, Italy, and Japan for their military expansion.

### British Under-Secretary Replies to Questions on Interests in China, Demands Japan Withdraw from British Cotton Mills, Working to Restore Hong Kong-Guangdong Transportation

[Reuters, London, 8th] In the House of Commons today, Member of Parliament Whit asked Under-Secretary Butler to explain the purpose and intention of the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to establish a special agency headed by Japanese officials. The Under-Secretary stated that he had not received any information regarding the purpose of this special agency, but he knew that the proceedings did not infringe upon the powers of the Municipal Council. When asked why the Japanese refused to withdraw from British cotton mills in Shanghai, Butler said that despite repeated explanations from the British Consul-General in Shanghai, the Japanese side still doubted whether three of the cotton mills were British-owned. As for the fourth cotton mill located on Chongming Island, it had been occupied by the Japanese army and used as a transportation hub. The British government had recently protested to Tokyo about this matter. In short, the government will ensure that the Japanese quickly withdraw from British cotton mills. When asked when the warship transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou could be restored, Butler reiterated his previous response and added that it was not yet possible to predict when the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway would reopen. This matter is currently being discussed by the British Consul-General in Guangzhou and the Japanese Consul.

[Reuters, London, 8th] In the British House of Commons today, someone questioned the Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson, asking what steps the Minister would take to promote the success of the Chinese government negotiating a large quantity of key textiles with Lancashire merchants. Hudson replied that this issue had recently begun to be studied on a trial basis, but as usual, it was not convenient to provide detailed information at this time. Poland will submit a proposal.

It is said that Colonel Gova-Czerczeski's visit to Paris, London and The Hague is to discuss the investment issues of the project with France, Britain and the Netherlands. The future canal will pass through Poland and Romania from Danzig to Ismail.

Short Commentary

### New Japanese Law

An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th reports that the Japanese government has submitted a new law to the Diet to manage the issuance of banknotes by the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Taiwan. It is preparing to implement controls over the issuance of banknotes by these three national banks to issue banknotes according to military needs and states that this law may be repealed one year after the end of the "Sino-Japanese Incident."

It is to be expected that such laws will inevitably lead to more dangerous "malignant inflation," making Japan's financial and economic difficulties more serious. What we should pay particular attention to here is that this new law of the Japanese government shows that the Japanese aggressors are intensifying their plunder of money from within Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, preparing to continue their war of "conquering China." Therefore, while we feel great pity for the future lives of the people of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, we should also more clearly understand the determination of the Japanese aggressors to destroy our country. There are still a few compatriots who mistakenly believe that the Japanese aggressors are prepared to repent and cease hostilities. We are reluctant to say that these people are intentionally being used by traitors, but in reality, such erroneous observations and arguments are sufficient to confuse the public, eliminate hatred, and allow the Japanese to advance smoothly. Therefore, we should not only be vigilant against this "peace" discourse and advocacy but also expose and attack it.

### Germany's Great Highway Plan

— Translated by Dong Ping

— Another Exposure of Hitler's Eastern Advance Policy —

Original by Roger Shaw. Published in "Modern Historical Materials," February issue.

One night in mid-December last year, the largest public theater in Berlin held a "Comrades' Entertainment Party." Three thousand road construction workers attended, and Hitler himself attended; the Führer's police band also came to the event to play music. The situation was no less enthusiastic than Americans celebrating Christmas.

These three thousand road construction workers represent a very important German national organization. Its task is to build motorways. The purpose of that night's entertainment party was to celebrate the completion and unveiling of Germany's 3,000-kilometer highway network. Superficially, the purpose of building this highway network was to relieve unemployed people in Germany; but in reality, it was a purely military plan. Like the crisscrossing roads in the ancient Roman Empire, it was entirely used for rapid military transport.

The designer of this highway is a German engineer named Todt. The new fortress in the Rhineland area of ​​Germany, facing the French Maginot Line, also came from his mind.

Todt's highway network extends from the North Sea plains to the foothills of the Alps, from the industrially prosperous West to the barren East. On this highway, there is not a single village or a single thought, so driving cars can use the fastest speed without any restrictions.

Todt's plan is to expand by 1,000 kilometers every year. At the same time, under Todt's plan, a "National Socialist Motor Corps" was formed; this "Motor Corps" has great political significance; it is the same as the Brown Shirt "Stormtroopers" and the Black Shirt "Iron Guard," and is one of the three major armies of the National Socialist Party.

However, Germany's great highway plan is not so simple. Todt and his financial backer – the Reichsbank – are now preparing to extend this highway outside of Germany. According to their new plan, the first step is to extend it to Germany's newest victory, Czechoslovakia; then, a highway can extend from German Silesia, from north to south, directly to Vienna. In this way, the garrisons in Silesia and Austria can be concentrated in an instant, advancing eastward along the highways of the Czech Republic to attack Poland or Soviet Ukraine. Similarly, this north-south highway is also very rewarding for German-Austrian trade.

Germany is preparing to build this road with its own funds, and it also wants to manage it with full authority; even in the Czech territory along the road, Germany will enjoy extraterritoriality, which is simply a "German Corridor" within Czech territory. German merchants and people in this corridor do not need passports at all and are not subject to Czech inspection.

In fact, this is only the prelude to Germany's highway plan in Czechoslovakia; the rest is still being secretly designed. At the same time, the Czech government is now planning to build a highway in the country from west to east. All the grinding materials have been prepared, and it is estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 workers will be needed to complete the work in five or six years. But if Todt also joins in to help, I believe it can be completed quickly.

Now it can be said more clearly, if this Jinbu plan is completed, the German army can quickly concentrate from both ends of Silesia and Vienna along the "German Corridor" to the Czech Republic; then, it can rush eastward along the highways of the Czech Republic; reaching the border of Romania, which is the richest in oil production, which has long been coveted by the National Socialist Party. Extending from Romania to the southeast, it can reach the Black Sea and the important Soviet Ukrainian seaport of Odessa - a major goal of the National Socialist Party. To put it more simply, all the highways are heading straight for Ukraine; there is abundant wheat and ore and complex folk customs.

If a war breaks out between Germany and the Soviet Union, automobiles will occupy a very important position; tanks, armored vehicles, trucks, command vehicles, shells, and all other vehicles must be active. The armies of Germany and the Soviet Union have long seen this and are busy preparing. Infantry, artillery, and supply teams are all actively being motorized.

The National Socialist Party understands very well that the modern god of war is motorized; therefore, the entire German automobile industry is adapting to military needs, and Nanchang has standardized trucks and passenger cars. All trucks are divided into three types: one and a half tons, three tons, and five tons. There were originally 135 types of passenger cars, but now they are also limited to 15 types, all of which are suitable for military use. Motorized bicycles are also very important to the army, and Germany is storing them in large quantities.

Germany's motorized units now have three divisions, about 30,000 people; it has recently recruited a fourth division. However, Germany's cavalry has only one battalion, all of whom are descendants of the famous East Prussian cavalry. Recently, I heard that new cavalry are being recruited, preparing to be used on the plains of the East.

Germany's current land strength is roughly like this: 42 regular divisions, but the artillery is very short; 6 Austrian divisions, the results are not very good; 2 elite reserve divisions in East Prussia; among the other 38 reserve divisions, artillery, officers, and transportation are very far behind. This number totals about one million people, but the number of people is large, but the strength is not as good as generally imagined. This is because Germany only started training its own army in 1935.

But, if Germany really attacks Soviet Ukraine with the "Motor Corps," what is the Soviet Union's ability to respond?

Naturally, the Soviet Union is not willing to show weakness and is now actively preparing to counter Todt's big plan. Moscow's most famous Stalin Plant and Molotov Plant are the centers of Soviet automobile manufacturing, and the two plants produce 200,000 vehicles and $70 million worth of automobile parts every year.

Now, a highway is being built between Soviet Ukraine and Manchuria. It is generally believed that the construction of this road is actually part of a counterattack against Hitler's plan.

There have been many automobile competitions in the world. In the near future, automobile competitions will unfold in front of us in a new way, and the fate of Europe will be determined on that surface.

### Britain Actively Strengthens Far East Defenses, Will Recruit Chinese and Indian Soldiers in Hong Kong, Quota Set at One Thousand, Trained by British Officers, Hong Kong Air Force Commander Replaced, Brands Succeeds

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense, and Hong Kong's position has become increasingly important. Therefore, the British authorities have been actively strengthening Hong Kong's defenses in recent years. Yesterday (8th), the British House of Commons held a meeting to discuss the army's budget. The Secretary of State for War, Mr. Hore-Belisha, explained the various figures in the budget (see another article on page 4). Among them, regarding Hong Kong, he said that Hong Kong's defenses have become increasingly consolidated after being strengthened. At the same time, the number of defense forces has increased by more than 3,000. It is now decided to recruit a total of one thousand Chinese and Indian people, who will be appropriately trained by British officers to defend Hong Kong. The British Secretary of State for War, Mr. Hore-Belisha, said that the purpose of recruiting soldiers locally in overseas territories is to maintain peace in the area during peacetime and to ensure that the strength of the regular army is not affected in the event of a war and to take responsibility for defending itself. Therefore, if the environment requires it, local people will be recruited to engage in military tasks. From 1938 to 1939, the number of troops recruited locally in British territories was 250,000, which was more than the number of overseas territorial troops set in the past. This is a special situation that has never been seen before in peacetime. It is estimated that 77,800 people have responded to the call this year, while only 45,000 in the previous year. In addition, Singapore, which is closely related to Hong Kong, will also recruit one thousand people this year, the same number as Hong Kong. In addition, it is reported that the current Hong Kong Air Force Commander, Mr. Smeeton, has completed his term of office, and the vacancy will be filled by Squadron Leader Brands. It is known that Mr. Brands has served as the commander of the 35th Bomber Squadron of the British Air Force in Newton and other positions. Also, the army, navy, and air force stationed in Hong Kong have been constantly practicing for months to review Hong Kong's offensive and defensive strength. At 9:00 am yesterday, the Cape D'Aguilar Battery also held a cannon exercise. The sound of cannons rumbled and resonated far and wide. The exercise ended at 6:00 pm. The Hong Kong military authorities issued a notice in advance to inform the public.

### Emergency Refugee Association in Fanling, Manages Education for Refugee Children, Over a Thousand Students in Primary Schools and Kindergartens, Lack of Classrooms, Seven Hundred Out of School

The Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Association held a meeting at St. John's Cathedral at 5:30 pm yesterday. The attendees included Father Watterhouse, Mrs. Situ Yongjue, Miss Budinger, Huang Maolin, Father Lai Yien, Professor Foster, Miss Buko Yili, and others. Father Lai Yien chaired the meeting, and the secretary read the following report: (1) Financial report: The income for the month, together with the balance from January, totaled HK$122,334.32, and the expenditure totaled HK$30,304.38. The balance after income and expenditure was HK$92,029.64. The income in national currency, together with the balance from last month, was 63,949.78, totaling 63,999.78. The expenditure totaled 13,700 yuan, and the balance after income and expenditure was 50,299.78 yuan. The income in the construction fee account, together with the amount transferred from last month, was HK$20,714.45, totaling HK$39,814.45. The expenditure totaled HK$20,000, and the balance after income and expenditure was HK$19,414.45.

Establish People's Palace

Regarding the People's Camp, the Association has set up 40 People's Palaces. If the Public Works Department completes the various drainage facilities in time, they will be available for residence on the 19th of this month. Currently, there are 225 applications for residence, which are currently being considered one by one by the People's Palace Committee, but very few meet the requirements. The requirement is that they have a current occupation and have suffered significant losses due to the war. However, these 40 residents will now be selected separately. The subsidy granted by the Hong Kong government is 18,700 yuan. In addition to expenses such as construction, there is still a slight surplus. The Hong Kong government has now been asked to waive rates and to ask the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to agree to repay the advances in seven years. The rent for each People's Palace is less than ten yuan, and it is hoped that this number will include half of the electricity bill.

Refugee Tents

Regarding the various refugee tents, there have been many changes in the facilities of the various tents since the last conference. The North and South Tents in Fanling were closed on the 3rd of last month, but reopened on the 21st of last month, but they are no longer responsible for providing food. The Third Tent in Fanling has also been reopened, but it is managed by the International Red Cross. These three tents currently house 2,522 refugees. A new tent was built at San Uk Ling near the border on the 2nd of this month, which currently houses 910 people. The Association is currently responsible for managing the education of refugee children in Fanling. A place has now been obtained to teach 200 refugee children. The executive department of the Association has now approved the construction of a shed near the new tent for teaching refugee children, and another shed for the residence of staff. It has now been completed.

Education for Refugee Children

The British Zhenfen Branch and the Education Department have not approved the Association's application for education subsidies, so the Association can only manage within the 600 yuan education fee per month. At the same time, enthusiastic educators are invited to donate. Kindergartens and primary schools have been open for six weeks, with a total of about 1,100 students. The school to be set up in San Uk Ling and the new school in Kam Tin will both open next week, and the number can increase to 1,500, but due to the lack of classrooms, there are still 700 school-age children who do not have the opportunity to receive education. As for craft teaching, the grass bag products of the Kam Tin tent are quite successful, with four being produced each month. The King's Park ball field tent also produces a lot of bamboo brooms, with hundreds of orders received every day. A commissioner has now been appointed to be responsible for inspecting the handicraft work of the various tents and planning new facilities, hoping to make progress in the near future.

### Air Defense Exhibition Tour

— Qi Zhuo

Modern warfare is three-dimensional warfare, and it is also the most brutal. Progress in science itself is not sinful, but it is the aggressive nations that misuse science that are to be condemned. Condemnation is the cry of the weak; to eliminate armed force, one must ultimately resort to armed force; one must utilize science.

Our motherland has launched a sacred national liberation struggle to oppose aggression and eliminate tyrannical armed forces. No matter how the × people bomb and destroy, we are tempered and reborn in the war of resistance. This great war of the era has been unfolding on our vast territory for twenty months.

Under a forest of umbrellas, this reporter, along with a crowd of onlookers, ascended to the first floor of the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon to tour the Air Defense Exhibition. The first impression upon entering the first exhibition room was a huge painting titled "The Power of a Bomb Exploding Fifty Feet Away." It reminded people of the horror of the moment a bomb descends! Many compatriots who have fled to Hong Kong have already tasted this feeling! Could it be coming to Hong Kong? The second shocking picture was "Air Defense Instructor on Duty." The raging flames, the collapsed beams and walls after the bombing, and the casualties everywhere reminded people that this is already the common fate of our compatriots today!

Inside the room were models of four people, wearing special air defense and disinfection suits, as well as gas masks. The children said curiously and fearfully, "Ghosts—ghosts!" Yes, these are scientific "ghosts." To prevent soldiers on the front lines from being killed by × people's poison gas, we should transport a large number of gas masks to make them "ghosts" with resistance.

One room demonstrated how to seal windows with screens after glass windows were shattered by explosions to prevent the intrusion of poisonous gas. There was also a complete set of seven first-aid medicines on display, which could be purchased for five dollars.

The paintings of families building shelters seemed to be hinting that visitors should quickly grab axes and saws. In addition, there were also "Models of Chinese-style houses converted into air defense instructor posts," "Shelter models," and "Gas-proof windows," all of which were scientific equipment.

The first impression upon entering the second room was a "First-Aid Station Model" with a scale of six minutes to one foot, demonstrating the process of treating the wounded entering the station in an orderly manner. The attendant explained carefully to the visitors, causing the listeners to stick out their tongues and sigh, "So thoughtful! But it's better if such a situation doesn't happen!"

There was a "Poison Gas Gate Model." Those who were curious and wanted to experience it for themselves went in and held their breath for a moment before running out. Now, it was being treated as a game toy.

A section of the "Mask Management Method" displayed many gas masks, allowing visitors to try them on freely, and they put on "ghost faces" as if for fun. They laughed at each other before dispersing.

In addition, there were also "Civilian Masks," "Poison Gas Damage to the Body Meter," etc., all of which could give visitors a lot of common knowledge. Responsible for reception and explanation were Chinese and Western service personnel. Especially the girls in ambulance uniforms were solemn, lively, and moving. The reporter said secretly: If they return to the motherland and really practice what they learned, wouldn't it be even greater and more meaningful!

At the entrance of the first and second rooms, several Western women were selling pamphlets on "Building a Shelter," teaching people how to set up a shelter. It was easy to take out a dime to buy one. But to build it accordingly was not something everyone could do. The reporter stayed for a long time and learned that most of the customers were foreigners. There was also a notice calling on people to participate in the air defense training courses organized by the Air Defense Committee. To enrich wartime knowledge, this was necessary.

Chinese and Western men, women, old and young, as well as school students, came to visit in groups, which was extremely crowded. When the reporter stepped out of the door, several women without socks were turned away from the crowd pouring in. They knew to join in the fun and see something new, but they neglected that this was the "Peninsula Hotel," and finally left with disappointment and complaints.

In the open space opposite the Peninsula Hotel, there was also an outdoor air defense exhibition, covered with cloth curtains on the outside. Inside, there was a real air-raid shelter, very delicate, which could accommodate six people. The reporter drilled in to inspect it. The alarms again and again, the sound of bombing, the panicked state of women and children… the tragic past immediately rushed into the realm of memory. Is this the "past"? No! This is still the life lesson of the vast compatriots of the motherland—××××××××××, thinking of this, I felt a deep sadness!

It was reported that at 3:30 this afternoon, the disinfection team will conduct a drill at the outdoor exhibition area on the open space opposite the hotel, releasing poisonous gas at that time, and the team members will quickly go to the scene of the incident to survey and then carry out disinfection work, in order to increase the actual air defense knowledge of visitors. If the weather is clear next Saturday and Sunday, exercises on extinguishing incendiary bombs will also be carried out in the afternoon in the above-mentioned open space.

"Air Defense Exhibition"—Is this ultimately preparation for the worst? ××××××××?

### Compensation Distribution Method for the Luohu Bombing Incident: Chinese $300, Indian Soldiers $500, British Soldiers $3000

The incident of Japanese aircraft bombing Luohu in the New Territories has been resolved lightly with compensation of 20,000 yuan after Ando, commander-in-chief of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, sent Chief of Staff Tanaka to Hong Kong to represent the Japanese government and negotiate with the Hong Kong authorities. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. According to the reporter's investigation, this international incident, which shook the world, could be resolved in such a short time and at such a small price.

After the Luohu incident, the British side not only proposed compensation for losses and a guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again, but also proposed varying degrees of compensation. The British Foreign Office, after negotiations with Japan, soon received a telegram from the Colonial Office in Hong Kong, requesting compensation of 300 yuan per person for the six Chinese who died, 500 yuan for the one Indian soldier, and 3,000 yuan for the one British soldier, plus 8,000 yuan for material property losses. Since Japanese aircraft flew into British territory to bomb, it was a contempt for Britain and a violation of international law, so they specially requested compensation of 10,000 yuan, totaling ¥***. When Japanese Chief of Staff Tanaka arrived in Hong Kong and held negotiations at the Deputy Secretary's Office, Tanaka expressed full acceptance of the compensation item and promised to compensate a total of 20,000 yuan.

### He Minghua Goes to Guilin, Carrying Funds to Aid Guilin Refugees

### Labour Department Prepares to Proceed: Improve Working Hours for Printing Workers, Regularly Summon Representatives of Printing Trade Union for Consultation

There are approximately 4,000 printing workers in Hong Kong, most of whom work in newspaper offices. Their wages range from more than ten yuan to more than twenty yuan. Among them, those who work in printing houses work the longest, with daily working hours constantly between fourteen and sixteen hours. Due to the excessively long working hours, they are mentally exhausted, and many have developed opium addiction. The Printing Trade Union previously petitioned the Hong Kong Labour Department to improve working hours. It is reported that after receiving the petition, the Labour Department has scheduled to summon representatives of the union on the 15th of this month to inquire about everything in detail, so as to understand the living conditions of the workers and improve them.

### Hong Kong-Based Central Committee Discusses Rescuing Unemployed Educators Fleeing to Hong Kong, Plans to Draft Measures for Consultation with the Guangdong Education Department

Educational institutions in the country have been ravaged and destroyed by ×. Thousands of educators from various places have fled to Hong Kong. They usually live frugally, so they feel even more difficult after fleeing to Hong Kong. It is now found that about 200 of them have jointly requested political figures in Hong Kong to turn to the education authorities for relief. Many members of the Central Committee in Hong Kong held a discussion meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. Participants included Hu Wencan, Deng Qingyang, Chen Ce, and others. As a result, it was decided to draft detailed and fundamental relief measures, submit them to the central government, and request consultation with the Guangdong Education Department. The method is to discuss with Chinese schools in Hong Kong that have been registered with the Ministry of Education to borrow classrooms and use the evening or afternoon hours to run free schools for civilians or other easy-to-manage vocational schools, so that they can both educate out-of-school children and refugees, and rescue unemployed teachers, killing two birds with one stone. Detailed measures are being drafted and will be sent out soon. According to reports from various Central Committee members, among the unemployed educators in Hong Kong, there is a former director of teaching affairs at a middle school in Guangzhou who is now selling salty crispy peanuts at the Royal Pier to make a living. This is enough to show the general difficult living conditions of unemployed educators. Therefore, rescuing them is extremely urgent.

After deducting 600,000 yuan for the dividend of one yuan per share paid on September 8 last year, the board of directors decided on the method of distributing the remaining profits to pay a dividend of 1.5 yuan per share, totaling 900,000 yuan, and also to pay an additional bonus of 7.5 cents per share, totaling 450,000 yuan. Set aside the price of property at 147,276.21 yuan, add a bonus of 43,976.22 yuan for the Golden Jubilee for employees, and the remaining 267,880.85 yuan will be carried over to the next year's calculation. It is understood that the company has been established for 50 years, this year is the Golden Jubilee anniversary. Also, last year, due to the increase in the population of Hong Kong, the number of people installing electricity meters also increased by 3,432 households, and there are now a total of 46,510 households.

### Raising Funds to Rescue Wounded Soldiers and Refugees: "The Eve" Performed Tonight and Tomorrow, Tonight and Tomorrow Night at St. Paul's Girls' School

The drama craze is sweeping from mainland China to Hong Kong in this year, and it is truly thriving. Many famous dramas have been performed one after another using different Mandarin, Cantonese, or English, and many of them are for raising funds to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. If we cannot forget to commend this point, we must mention "The Eve," which will be performed at St. Paul's Girls' School tonight and tomorrow night.

"The Eve" is a masterpiece by the famous writer Yang Hansheng. It is a national defense drama that exposes the activities of traitors and the struggles of patriotic youth in Tianjin before its fall. Performing it at this time and place has great significance. Why is it also a charity event co-organized by St. Paul's Girls' School and the Hong Kong United Youth Society?

"The Eve" has been rehearsed many times at the girls' school under the guidance of Li Mulong. The cast members are entirely selected from the students of the school and many of its alumni. Wu Ailing plays a traitor. Bai Cishan's wife (Zheng Wenxuan) is in love with her tutor. Her methods and expressions of seducing young people, as well as her jealous performance, are good. But the best part is her sad and charming attitude when she tells her life story to her lover! Su Mane plays Bai Qinghong, the traitor's niece, and Pei Lian plays Liu Jicheng, the traitor's lackey. One is alert and wise, making her an opponent to her father, while the other shows the old, cunning, and slippery actions of a traitor. Li Huiqing plays Bai Cishan, and Song Shuqin plays Lin Jianping, both of whom can express the true vigor of saving the country. Regarding this point, Mr. Li Mulong and Principal Hu of St. Paul's expressed great satisfaction. They said, "It is commendable that people who have never seriously performed on stage can perform so well, because they are all female students."

For the sake of the salvation drama movement, for the sake of saving the displaced refugees, we are willing to make a voluntary publicity here first, hoping that everyone will come enthusiastically!

### Situation on the Northern Front Enters New Stage: × Troops Massing 6-7,000 in Congzengjian, Our Troops Prepare Counter-Offensive and Intensify Deployment, Yubei Militia Scores Victory Attacking × Camp in Jiangcun, Fengyong Official Kiln × Afraid of Us and Dares Not Disturbe

[Express News from Northern River] The southern invading × chief has recently repeatedly begged the Taiwan Xiamen × base camp for aid, plotting the last struggle. Therefore, it has recently been rumored that × troops have increased in number, being transferred to Guangdong, planning to spy on the north and invade the southern route to commit crimes in Guangxi. Therefore, the situation in the Guangdong war has entered a new stage. It is found that there are 6,000 to 7,000 × troops recently gathered in the Congbei Zengcheng strongholds. The information is recorded as follows:

Our Troops on the Northern Front Will Launch a Counter-Offensive

According to military news, Commander Zhang Fakeui of the Fourth War Zone, in order to smash the × bandits' conspiracy to spy on the north, took the opportunity to launch a counter-offensive. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed the frontline garrisons to attack the × on the date. It is found that the × in Huaxian Xinjie on the southern section of the Guangdong Road have been repeatedly raided by our Chen Division in recent days and are now in a state of panic. The × troops at the Sheigang Taipingchang strongholds are also afraid of our Liang's attack and are stepping up the construction of defensive stubborn resistance. It is heard that our counter-offensive military affairs on the northern front have been intensified, and it has been decided to launch them in the near future. In addition to the main attack on the front, a pincer movement will be used to advance from Tanfang on the left wing towards Zhongxin Fuhe, etc., in order to cut off the communication between the Conghua Zengcheng × troops, and join the Eastern Route Army to control Zengcheng.

Yubei Militia Scores Victory Attacking ×

In addition, the Second District Guerrilla Commander Wu Guanqi ordered Deputy Commanders Li Shuzong and Peng Linsheng to lead their troops in Fanyu Conghua Huaxian to launch guerrilla warfare to annihilate × for several months. Especially the Yubei Township militia is even more active, repeatedly launching attacks on various strongholds, making × exhausted. On the 4th of this month, our guerrilla team, which was ambushing in a certain place, gathered dozens of people at 9 p.m. and suddenly attacked the × camp in the suburbs of Jiangcun. In the darkness, they secretly sneaked up to the × camp. The × sentry could not detect it. At the sound of a secret signal, each team of soldiers fired at the × with machine guns and box cannons. Hearing the sound of gunfire, the × troops were startled and fought back in panic. Our team of soldiers bravely charged and killed. For a time, the sound of gunfire was rapid, like a string of beads. More than a dozen × troops were annihilated. Soon, × reinforcements arrived, and our team of soldiers returned to their original defenses after completing their mission. In this battle, they also obtained a × light machine gun and several long and short guns. Since this battle, the × army in Yubei has been extremely panicked and has intensified its vigilance day and night, inspecting the people coming and going in various villages to prevent our team of soldiers from attacking again.

According to Fengyong, The official kiln lies dormant in a corner

According to another report, on the Chantan Highway, the × entrenched in Guanyao Fengyong has been continuously reinforced, sending troops to disturb the towns of Sanjiang, Yinggang, Tanbu, and Fanhu near the hospital. After our guerrilla teams intercepted them in separate ways, they suffered heavy losses repeatedly. The × began to retreat to their original defenses and lie dormant, slightly restraining their atrocities. It is found that in Luoping Sanjiang, Yinggang Fanhu, and other places, the × troops have not dared to disturb in recent weeks. Therefore, the border between Nanhai and Sanshui has been quite peaceful in the past week. However, some traitors and local ruffians have taken the opportunity to collude and rob the villagers and people coming and going, which is extremely rampant. Those with a little property are often taken to ransom, regardless of the amount. For a time, there are thorns everywhere, and bandits are like hair. The nearby villagers are in a great situation of either dying from × or from bandits, and the situation is extremely difficult.

### Provincial Government Issues Order Commending Loyal Martyrs: Donating Money and Sacrificing Lives, the Mountains and Rivers are Magnificent; Achieving Benevolence and Taking Righteousness, the Sun and Moon Compete for Glory

[Shaoguan Correspondence] The Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday issued an order to the administrative commissioners of each district, the original text of which reads, "It has been found that the virtues are excellent, and the Central Government has decided to commend them. The loyal martyrs have achieved benevolence, and Qing Shi will serve as an example. The upright spirit fills the world, and this virtue is famous in the country. The great ones are related to the rise and fall of the nation, and the small ones are related to saving the fence. To change customs and eliminate turbidity is no small matter. Since the late Qing Dynasty, our party has advocated revolution, and people of benevolence and lofty ideals have emerged one after another. Those who have sacrificed their minds, energy, wealth, and lives to engage in innovation are countless. Some even do not occupy success, but return to their original state and remain hidden, living in poverty in remote areas, and their surnames are no longer mentioned, and there are many such people everywhere. Although the central government has tried its best to search for them, there may be some that have not been fully recorded. Since the Anti-Japanese War, famous cities have been lost, and houses have been turned into ruins. All those with blood and energy have the same hatred for the enemy. In the meantime, those who united to defend themselves, donated money and sacrificed their lives, bravely annihilated the enemy, died tragically, and the four husbands and wives who were unwilling to surrender to the enemy and sacrificed their lives to save the country are even more countless. Strengthening the spirit of the mountains and rivers and competing for the light of the sun and moon, the nation will not perish, and all rely on this. To explain the hidden virtues of the secluded light and express the great integrity of loyalty and chastity, it is appropriate to show condolence to encourage the future. Each administrative inspector should turn to the county magistrates under his jurisdiction to persuade them to search for them, and report them according to the merits. Those who collude with the enemy to act as traitors and are willing to humiliate themselves will be abandoned by the people of the country and should be punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing traitors, enforce the law to rope them, or present a clear wanted notice to do the rest, so that the evil will be eliminated and the truth will be distinguished between the superiors and the subordinates, and the sun will be bright and the shadows will disappear, and the spring and autumn will be severe and the axes will rejoice. The future of the Anti-Japanese War is truly dependent on this. In addition to the separate orders, the command is to follow them, and turn to the subordinates to follow them, and still report the obedience. This order, Chairman Li Hanhun."

### Headquarters of the Twelfth Army Group Trains Battlefield Service Personnel

[Shaoguan Express News] The headquarters of the Twelfth Army Group, because the ambitious youth from all parts of the province, and those who stayed in the Lian County Shaoguan area after the completion of the concentrated training, rushed to the headquarters to join the army, requesting to be sent to the front lines to serve, which is commendable. In order to accommodate people with lofty ideals and train wartime service talents, the headquarters specially set up a training class for battlefield service personnel at the end of last month and solicited students. Up to now, more than 1,000 people have registered for the examination. At that time, the headquarters will conduct a preliminary examination in batches. The first batch of 300 people has completed the examination at Li Qun Middle School on Xiaoti Road in Shaoguan. The remaining 700-800 people will continue to be examined before the 12th of this month. It is heard that the training period for the class is three months, and they will be sent to work on various fronts after graduation.

### Siamese Rice Traded at Shanton, First Batch of 15,000 Bags Arrives at Shanton, Second Batch of 10,000 Bags Has Also Set Off

[Shantou Express News] The rice shortage in this province, especially in Chao Shan, is severe. All sectors have repeatedly called for exemption from import tax on foreign rice as a temporary relief measure, but it has not been realized. Previously, the Chaoshan people telegraphed the Siamese overseas Chinese to transport rice for trading. The Siamese Chaozhou Rice Trading Company has been organized to transport rice to Shantou, and the common people are eagerly waiting. It is found that the first batch of 15,000 bags of Siamese rice has been transported to Shantou by the Meifu transport ship, and the second batch of 10,000 bags was also equipped for the next ship on the 4th and is already on its way. It is estimated that it will arrive on the 11th. The rice shortage in Chao Shan can be temporarily relieved, and the general public still hopes that the authorities will quickly implement fundamental relief measures.

### The Food Problem in Chao-Shan

— Zhang Wenqiang

During the war of resistance, it is certainly important for the government to enrich military spending and maintain tax revenues, but improving the people's lives to enhance the strength of the resistance is also an urgent task. Moreover, the current exemption of import duties on foreign rice does not have much impact on the government's financial revenue. The reason is that high exchange rates make the cost of foreign rice high. Coupled with an import duty of more than three yuan in national currency per unit, it has made the price of foreign rice so high that it is difficult to import. Although foreign rice tax is still being collected as usual, the amount of foreign rice imported is extremely small, and the tax revenue is very low. Shantou is one of the ports with the most foreign imports, but according to statistics, from January 1 to February 26 this year, a period of nearly two months, when Chao-Mei was in dire need of rice, the foreign rice imported by the Chao Customs totaled only over 44,000 dan, and the rice tax collected was only over 140,000 yuan. From this point of view, we can say that the current collection of foreign rice tax can only prevent the import of foreign rice and does not contribute much to the government's financial revenue.

However, some people also say that restricting the import of foreign rice and maintaining the price of domestic rice is to protect the interests of farmers, which is also one of the purposes of the government collecting foreign rice import duties. This view is correct in normal times. Because if foreign rice is imported duty-free, it will be dumped into China in large quantities, making it impossible for the surplus rice in various provinces to be transported to rice-deficient areas, resulting in a surplus of supply over demand, which will lead to lower prices and harm the interests of farmers. But now, in the corner of Chao-Shan, the situation is very different: first, the rice from the rice-producing areas in the country cannot be transported to Chao-Shan due to the * army's obstruction, and the rice price in Chao-Shan has little impact on the farmers in the rice-producing areas; second, the farmers in Chao-Shan do not produce much rice. The harvest of ten parts of tenant farmers and self-cultivating farmers after a year of hard work is not enough for their own consumption. Only a very small number of rich farmers and landlords have rice to sell, and only a very small number of rich farmers and landlords benefit from the high rice prices. It is harmful to the majority of farmers who do not have enough rice for their own consumption. Therefore, taxing foreign rice does not contribute much to financial revenue, and it greatly increases the burden on the people. It not only makes people's lives difficult, but also threatens to cause a rice shortage, putting the people in a state of panic with money but no rice. This is extremely detrimental to the anti-Japanese war of the Chao-Shan people. Therefore, we hope that the government will immediately exempt foreign rice tax!

Exempting foreign rice tax, allowing large quantities of foreign rice to be imported, can certainly prevent the arrival of rice shortages, but it may not be able to stabilize rice prices to improve people's lives. In the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China, in order to maintain the food supply and stabilize rice prices, the Chao-Shan area requested the government to exempt foreign rice import duties, considering the needs of the people, and to limit the quantity and period of tax-free foreign rice imports. As a result, although a rice shortage did not occur, rice prices remained high, and the benefits of tax-free foreign rice fell entirely into the pockets of rice merchants and some corrupt people.

The main purpose of tax-free foreign rice is to prevent rice shortages, so that the people have sufficient food to support the war of resistance, and also to stabilize rice prices, reduce the burden on the poor, and improve people's lives to enhance the strength of the war of resistance. However, merchants are fond of profit and good at profiteering. They collude with corrupt public officials and take all the benefits of tax-free foreign rice away.

Because tax-free foreign rice has a quantity and date limit, rice merchants often hoard a large amount during the tax-free period and do not sell it. Although there is a lot of rice in storage, it feels like demand exceeds supply, and prices are high. After the tax-free period has passed, merchants begin to sell the stored rice, and the price is equal to that of taxed foreign rice. Therefore, in the past two years of tax-free foreign rice, the people have not received any benefit.

The main purpose of exempting foreign rice import tax is to prevent rice shortages, but at the same time, it is also necessary to stabilize rice prices so that the general public can benefit from the tax exemption. The government should not lose foreign rice tax and let it all flow into the pockets of rice merchants and corrupt elements. In the past two years, the Shantou authorities organized an evaluation committee to prevent merchants from manipulating rice prices. However, the evaluation committee was too protective of the interests of rice merchants, and the prices they evaluated were even higher than the prices sold by the merchants. The evaluation committee not only did not restrict the manipulation of rice prices by merchants, but also covered up the behavior of merchants' manipulation. Before strict management of food is achieved, if we follow the old practice and limit the quantity and period of tax exemption, it will not be easy to stop merchants from cheating and achieve the effect of stabilizing rice prices. We believe that the local exemption of foreign rice tax in Chao-Shan should no longer have a quantity and period limit, so that merchants cannot manipulate it, so as to stabilize rice prices and benefit the poor. In the corner of Mei-Chao, during the war of resistance, we are worried about insufficient grain, not surplus grain. The government usually advocates grain storage, but the effect is minimal. Even if the amount of tax-free foreign rice imported exceeds the current needs of the people, in Chao-Mei, where grain production is insufficient, more grain should be more beneficial than harmful. After announcing the temporary exemption of foreign rice, the government can consider the situation and resume taxation when necessary.

To solve the food problem in Chao-Shan, exempting foreign rice tax is only a temporary solution. The fundamental solution should start with increasing production. At this early spring season, we should launch a widespread and enthusiastic spring plowing movement to encourage farmers to increase production.

The first thing to pay attention to when launching a spring plowing movement in Chao-Shan is to eradicate opium, the second is to reclaim wasteland, and the third is to improve farming methods. In the Chao-Shan area, there is a lot of fertile land. Currently, the crops planted are not rice, wheat, or other agricultural crops that are beneficial to people's livelihoods, but poppies that harm the people. In the remote villages of Jieyang, Fengshun, and Puning, there are many fields growing flourishing poppies, and farmers are planting more opium than before the war of resistance. During the war of resistance, in order to cope with the * people's maritime blockade, the requirement for Chao-Mei's self-sufficiency in food has increased a thousandfold. However, farmers are not only unable to increase food production, but are reducing production. The opium that we hate so much is produced more than before the war of resistance. This is a contradictory and painful phenomenon!

In Raohe, Nanshan, Fengshun, and other places, there is still a lot of wasteland that can be reclaimed into fertile land. Expanding the spring plowing movement should vigorously encourage farmers to reclaim wasteland. The county authorities should actively guide farmers to reclaim wasteland and provide them with various conveniences and guarantees, so that farmers can understand the significance of wasteland reclamation and can obtain tangible benefits, and thus be happy to engage in wasteland reclamation.

The farmers in Chao-Shan still use the old methods of farming passed down for thousands of years. Compared with countries with advanced science, our land production is far inferior. Although we cannot learn from industrialized countries and mechanize agriculture, ordinary scientific knowledge such as how to improve fertilization methods and how to eliminate pests in crops can be instilled in the general public, which is enough to make crops grow better, bear more abundant fruits, and increase the amount of harvest.

To resist the enemy's attack, food and bullets are equally important. Today, when the enemy is eyeing Chao-Shan, to solve the food problem in Chao-Shan, we should work hard to do it in a practical way!

Film and Drama

### One Hundred and One Ways to Hollywood's Path to Success

Hollywood, how many people yearn for this place name? Every time a new face is discovered on the screen, how many people wonder, where did she—or he—come from? How did they get into the film industry? Why don't I have such an opportunity?

Calm down and read these one hundred and one methods carefully. I dare say that at least one of them is suitable for you. Among these many methods, some require talent, some require courage, and some rely entirely on luck. Pick one that you can do. Who dares to say that you will definitely not be a shining star in the future? Conversely, perhaps these methods will only shatter your dream of becoming a star—but don't be discouraged, read them first.

(1) Put on a formal dress and attend a banquet on a British warship stationed in Santa Barbara—wake up in Catalina the next day and be put on a ship of a film company—tell people that you are determined to devote yourself to Hollywood—then, when you see a certain director who you met once in England, jump out of the car—as long as that director is happy, you have the hope of a screen test. David Niven entered the screen this way.

(2) At the right time, in the right place, dine in a beautifully dressed manner. Wendy Barrie, Sally Eilers, and Maureen O'Sullivan were all discovered in cafes in London, Dublin, and Hollywood, respectively.

(3) Be a descendant of a famous actor. Joan Fontaine and Constance Fontaine, Tyrone Power, Little Fan Pengke, and Ida Lupino all relied on this help.

(4) Grow up in an Italian working-class family—be able to sing like a lark without training—boast of your talent—raise money from the school to go to Hollywood—get a Sunday audition opportunity at Cullo Catelo. LenfLynn got a contract this way.

(5) Learn to make funny faces and strange noises, and then go to Hollywood to perform for people. Rufe Davis did it this way.

(6) Learn to dance as soon as you learn to walk as a child. As long as you learn well, you don't have to worry about being discovered after fifteen to twenty-five years. At least Freya Szu, Eleanor Powell, and Olin White Burrana succeeded with this method.

(7) Be a professional clown and be invited by people in the film industry to entertain guests at banquets. Vfnec Barnett went to the screen by making jokes.

(8) Invent a strange musical instrument, play it at the carnival for eight years, and then play it in a folk art troupe for eight years. Travel through the forty-eight states of the United States, listen to more gossip, and then put on a straight face and tell it to people. Bob Burns made a lot of money with this method.

(9) Enter a school, and the school's drama club sometimes also shoots some amateur films and dramas that are easy for filmmakers to see. This is how filmmakers discovered Antella Reis.

(10) Be a sister of a movie actress. Loretta Young was able to step onto the screen because she was Polly Ann Young's sister.

(11) Know an actress who has the courage to introduce you to a casting director. For example, Lynne Carver knows Polly Ann Young.

(12) Create news that can be headlined in large letters, such as being one of the quintuplets, or flying an airplane to Los Angeles but landing in Ireland.

(13) Follow a famous movie star to Hollywood and then marry him. Elafne Barrie chased and married John Barrymore, and now she is also in the film industry.

(14) Do stunts that stars dare not do. You may not become a movie star, but you have the hope of becoming a star's "double"—like Ione Reed.

(15) If you have never acted before, but an agent mistakenly thinks you are someone else, don't hesitate when asked what plays you have acted in. Give him a quick answer. Learn from Alan Mowbray.

(16) Hold the World Skating Championship and go to Hollywood. If no one notices, you might as well give a performance. This is Sonja Henie's method.

(17) Having a face that is half like Robert Taylor and half like Tyrone Power, Lee Krueger succeeded.

(18) Enter an actor training school. If someone gives you a screen test, don't be like everyone else. Show a nonchalant attitude so that he knows you are not the Hollywood type. June Carlson changed from this incident to Lucy Jones.

(19) Use eloquence to get a job as a screenwriter. Learn a little bit of the "secret of mystery" and apply it in practice. Hedy Lamarr entered the screen this way. One

(20) Marry a drama teacher. Clark Gable's first lady—Josephfne Dfllon—taught him how to act and tried her best to encourage him to try filming a movie.

(21) Be an old friend of someone who is now a Hollywood celebrity. Jack Carson got a chance from his old friend, the great director George Stevens.

(22) Make your singing talent impress the drama critics in your hometown. Let them record your singing and send it to Hollywood. Susanne Larson's road to Hollywood was entirely introduced by her singing voice.

(23) Learn to use a strange voice, completely different from the one you usually use. Then get a puppet and sit on your lap and play some small jokes. Enough, Hollywood will discover you like they discovered Edgar Bergen after seven years.

(24) Keep staring at a talent scout until he gives you a screen test before letting him go. Like Frye McCauley (this method is a bit stupid and requires good patience, but if the other party is more patient than you, I dare say you will fail).

(25) Be a passenger plane pilot on a route where film producers travel the most. If they give you some suggestions for filming, take it immediately, such as John Trert.

(26) Find a drama instructor who guarantees your success and can charge you tuition after you become famous. Marfe Wilson found one.

(27) Be a beautiful sports reporter and follow the sports team to their spring training camp. Many tired talent seekers are recuperating there. This is Ronald Reagen's way.

(28) Having some unique features on your face, like Jamie Duren's big nose, Joey Brown's wide mouth, and Meng Meng's pouty lips.

(To be continued)

### Errol Flynn Missing

### International Football: China and England to Play in the Quarterfinals on the 19th of This Month at the So Kon Po Stadium; Hong Kong Representatives to Macau for Inter-Port Games Intend to Select Young Players

[Special Report from This Newspaper] In the International Football Preliminary Round held during the recent Christmas period, the first act was Portugal's elimination of Ireland to win the final, and the second act was China's defeat of Scotland to win the quarterfinals. Therefore, China still has to play England in the quarterfinals, and the winner will play Portugal in the championship game on another day.

The quarterfinal match between China and England is scheduled to be held at 4:00 p.m. on the 19th of this month (Sunday) at the So Kon Po Stadium. This selection competition is stipulated to be 95 minutes. If the game ends in a tie after the stipulated time, 20 minutes of extra time will be added to determine the winner.

The trophy for this competition was donated by the Wenxing Newspaper. The proceeds from ticket sales will be used for charitable purposes. Now that the date of the quarterfinal match is approaching, it is hoped that the gentlemen in charge of our Chinese team will select good players to respond to this battle. The English team is very strong, gathering elites to form an army, so it is not easy to deal with.

Li Huitang is willing to play for good deeds. This is a charity match, so Huitang will definitely contribute without a doubt.

The Football Association accepted the invitation from Macau and selected Group A players as representatives to go to Macau for inter-port games on April 16. The selection matters are the responsibility of the management committee. According to reliable sources, the majority opinion of the management committee is to select all young players from each Group A team to represent them in the game in Macau. (Donglang)

### Shanghai Basketball Fierce Battle: Paramount's Momentum is Gone; Defeated by Mailinghong's Failure

(Shanghai News on the 4th) In the West Youth Basketball League, the two heroes of China and the West, Paramount against Mailinghong, met at the basketball hall last night at 9:00 p.m. Since the beginning of the battle, they have won many victories. This game is Mailinghong's last battle. After winning, they will win the championship. Although Paramount still has two makeup games, if they overcome this difficulty, they will also embark on a smooth path and can win the league championship. It is no less than the championship final. Last night, nearly a thousand people watched, and the West Youth was full. After the contact, Paramount took the lead with 9 to 2. Then it became 9 to 9, 11 to 11, and 13 to 13 three times equal. And Paramount again took the lead with 19 to 13, leading by six points. But Mailinghong scored eight points in a row. The first half ended with 19 to 21, Paramount losing by two points. A few minutes after the start of the second half, Cai Yanxiong was sent off. Mailinghong took the lead even more. Paramount worked hard to attack, forcing a 32 to 32 tie. Then it became 35 to 35, and Zhong En was sent off again. The situation changed suddenly. As a result, Mailinghong won with 48 to 40, winning the championship. Paramount's failure was a great pity.

Equally Matched, Suddenly Ahead and Suddenly Behind

The referee was Qu Lv Bolang. Paramount played with two Chen Zhous, Cai, and Lu. Mailinghong played with Mu, Pai, Wang, Sa, and Bo. After contact, the two sides were evenly matched. Mailinghong's five players defended continuously, and Paramount repeatedly failed to attack. Soon after, Bolien fouled, and Xianglong opened the record with a penalty shot. Zhong En and Yanxiong then scored, and Paramount took the lead with 5 to 0. Mailinghong hurriedly called a timeout to frustrate their spirit. Bolien broke the basket, and Xianglong Dayun immediately retaliated. Soon after, Cai Zongxiang Tie fouled, and Bolien made two penalty shots in one throw, forcing it to 6 to 9. Paramount called a stop, and Paerman scored three points in a row, making it 9 to 9. Dayun Muir each scored a goal, making it 11 to 11. Muir Xianglong made it 13 to 13 again. The intensity of the competition can be imagined. After Paramount called a stop at Liu Fang, San Yuan scored three times in a row, but Mailinghong suddenly added eight points. The first half ended with Mailinghong 21 and Paramount 19.

The Main General Was Sent Off, and the General Situation Was Gone

Changing baskets and fighting again, Yanxiong took the lead and hit the bullseye. Bolien immediately won two points. Yanxiong was dismissed with four fouls. Xilin entered the field. Wang Erde was penalized but did not score. Xianglong Zhong En was also penalized. Fortunately, Bolien Wang Erde did not make any achievements. Bo Yao probed the basket and entered the net in response. Seeing that the situation was not good, Paramount called a stop and transferred Xu Wenkui to replace Xianglong. Wenkui was flustered when he came on the court and was attacked by Bo stealing a city. Xilin Zhonghu, Mu broke the basket twice. At this time, Bo's one penalty and one throw were both successful. Paramount also increased by eight points, making it 32 to 32. The two sides were still in a fierce battle. After 35 to 35, Bo made another contribution. There were still five minutes left, and Zhong En was sent off. The general situation was gone. Mai Youliang entered the field and only scored one goal after the opponent scored two goals. After that, Paramount made a major adjustment, but it was useless. Instead, Mailinghong was in high spirits. Before long, the bell rang, and as a result, Paramount was miserably defeated by Mailinghong with 40 to 48. Mailinghong won the championship with a complete victory.

Matters needing attention when teaching ordinary exercises — Zhuoyue Yi

F. Dismissal – Dismissal seems unimportant in normal times, but in fact, we must cultivate students' disciplined habits and the spirit of finishing what they start. Even the smallest things must be regular and cannot be done casually. Because at the time of dismissal, if there is no fixed ritual or good habit, the students will gradually develop bad habits such as sloppiness, casualness, and perfunctoriness. Therefore, at the time of dismissal, there must be a certain ritual and the spirit of the end, such as the dismissal of the army. Before the dismissal, shout slogans (this slogan is about stimulating the spirit and strengthening the will). It can also be implemented in our physical education class, but it is not known whether it is adapted in Hong Kong or not, and it needs to be considered. For example, the boy scouts are used to taking a step back to salute, or turning around after saluting. etc., can be used arbitrarily. It is never possible to dismiss students freely. Now I will give two examples of the habits I usually use.

(1) If it is the time to transfer classes, in order to maintain the quietness of the school, and not to affect the teaching of other classes, it is best to bring the original team to the classroom to prepare for class.

(2) If it is necessary to dismiss the team on the playground, first stand at attention, then step the left foot half a step forward as the first movement, the second movement, buckle the right foot, and the third movement is to clap the hands, which is divided into three beats. It is necessary to strike and sing one, two, three to invigorate the spirit.

Although the above-mentioned things are ordinary, they are in fact the most important things that ordinary people easily overlook. In addition, regarding the breathing of students during exercise, it should be harmonious with the beat of the action, and there should be no pauses. I urge my comrades to pay attention. (The End)

### Some Ordinary Things

— Wei Fei

Post-war Hong Kong is overcrowded. Therefore, many businessmen and landlords regard this as a rare opportunity.

Although my time in Hong Kong is limited, I have moved houses many times. From the back room to the front room, from the front room to the middle room, from the bright room to the dark room, from the dark room to the black room, the big ones shrink, and the ones with windows become without windows. You have to turn on the lights to read, and even on a sunny day, you can barely manage for two or three hours at noon. The air is naturally not good, and hygiene is out of the question, but the landlord does not care about these. The rent has increased from four and a half yuan to five yuan two, and five yuan two to five yuan and a half. I think, if I have to move two more times, then, then I will only have to move to the bottom of the landlord's building!

Such a room has no meaning, no sunlight, and no good air. It is always gloomy during the day, and always dark at night. When cooking, the smoke makes tears flow. I am afraid that I will also have to shoulder one in the low units of the number of lung diseases reported in the newspaper.

Since I can't study in the room, I might as well take a walk outside, but every time I step on the pedestrian path, I don't know where to go. Especially in Kowloon, there are no bookstores or companies. Walking from here to there, from there to here, it's like having no home. Wandering, wandering, Hong Kong is indeed lively. People in suits, long gowns, and cheongsams, with their hands clipped, and those with shoulders, shuttle through the crowds. On the road, there are cars, buses, bicycles... coming and going. The number of shops is increasing day by day, and there are too many to see. There are candy companies, Western clothing stores, and European-style cinemas. This road is so beautiful! However, it has become worse day by day. There are two, five—homeless people sleeping on the streets. It's all vulgar.

I panic, afraid that I will occupy a place there, but I calm myself, knowing that panicking is useless. I am still walking, walking the same way, as if drifting at sea. From morning to noon, from noon to night, wandering east and west, from Jordan Road to Nathan Road, from Nathan Road to Shanghai Street, from this side to that side, passing the homeless shelter, many people are waiting there, waiting, preparing to wait for a comfortable night. I sigh. Passing a second-hand clothing store, it is covered with colorful paper strips, all writing, "Closing soon", "Forced to hand over the embroidery". I didn't decide, I sigh. I feel that my ability is only sighing. Looking ahead, I see many people surrounding a half-open silk shop, looking up. I walk closer to take a look. It turns out it's the same again. Everyone is silently reading three pairs of white paper couplets pasted on the wall:

"Money prevails over justice, human affection yields to power"

"The rise of pawnshops is a misery, the fall of golden rain is a joy"

"Borrowing the evil money, using despicable means at all costs, willingly harming the community"

"Taking advantage of a temporary opportunity, only caring about the swelling purse, greed blinds the mind"

I looked at it and there was nothing I could do, I could only sigh.

### "Great Victory in the Lanzhou Air Battle"

— Guo Nidi

——Popular Ballad——

The weather was clear on the 23rd, with ten thousand miles of clear sky and no clouds. Not to mention famous mountains and great rivers, just mention the city of Lanzhou. Lanzhou is located in Gansu Province, with access to all directions, and is well-known. It was exactly twelve o'clock noon on that day, the streets were crowded with people coming and going. Suddenly, they heard the wailing of the air raid siren, knowing that the annoying × planes were coming. The shops calmly closed their doors, and the timid citizens temporarily hid in the air raid shelters. The sound of the tracks was faintly heard, and the fuselage could be seen clearly in the distance. In rows of one character and human character, the whole team flew in with vigor. It was like a flock of wild geese in autumn, like dragonflies skimming the water. Count them with your fingers, twenty planes, not half a point off. Our air force was already prepared, and in the blink of an eye, they rose to the clouds and waited in a straight line. Sitting in the plane was a Flying General with a loyal heart. Without waiting for the × planes to get close, they rushed forward like lightning. In an instant, the sound of machine guns was crackling and popping, like firecrackers on New Year's Eve. They showed their skills like magpies rising and falcons swooping, and their power was unparalleled. A fierce battle began, shaking the heavens and earth and making the gods weep. The enemy planes panicked when they saw that we were prepared, and immediately their formation was scattered. They had to parry in a hurry, unable to escape our encirclement. Gloomy clouds were dense and the wind was rustling, the sun was dim and the universe was dark. Suddenly, a loud bang shook the mountains, and an enemy plane caught fire and exploded. Black smoke filled the air and could not be distinguished; a somersault from the clouds fell straight down to the lower world, tumbling and tumbling, like a kite with a broken string turning over and over, burying the dreamer from Sakurajima. Our planes were greatly encouraged, charging and ramming without mercy. The enemy planes had no will to fight, and the generals had no courage, running east and west, thinking of escaping. In another moment, two loud bangs like thunder, two enemy planes also suffered the same fate and turned to ashes. The situation suddenly changed again; each enemy plane accelerated and fled in all directions. Our planes bravely chased after them, the Flying Generals all smiling. One after another, enemy planes were hit and fell to Shili Dun in the east of the city. This time, the enemy planes lost a total of nine aircraft. The world's newspapers shouted together. Gentlemen, listen to me conclude the text. This is called "Great Victory in the Lanzhou Air Battle".

### South Wind

— A Tang

You grow in the bright southern land, your home is on the beautiful southern island. In your soul burns the wildfire of the tropics. Yet, your demeanor is that of a free and quiet palm tree.

You have existed long ago. You will eternally exist, yet I did not notice your existence before.

But we finally met. You gaze at me, your eyes slightly filled with melancholy, but at the same time extremely gentle; the color of your eyes is calm, but at the same time scorching hot, you gaze at me, but I do not notice your existence.

You came across the desolate, vast wilderness; you paused on the railing outside the window, you lingered in the boudoir, you lifted the curtain, and slipped into my hair.

From the haze of dreams, I opened my sleepy eyes and discovered your existence. But I held myself back, to your passionate gaze, I gave a cold glance.

However, when severe winter snow fell, the bitter cold froze my heart, so you came across the desolate and vast wilderness.

When the scorching summer heat burned my heart, so you came across the desolate and vast wilderness again.

When I was tired and wished to die, you brought fragrant flowers, awakening me with their scent.

You travel long distances, you are busy, not for reward or happiness.

You gaze at me, your eyes are melancholic, but extremely gentle, the color of your eyes is calm, but extremely scorching hot, you only gaze at me, and my heart begins to palpitate.

When you came across the desolate and vast wilderness, I was still in a dream. You feared awakening me from my deep sleep, so you silently paused on the treetops outside the boudoir, quietly lingered in the boudoir, gently lifted the curtains and gently slipped into my hair.

When the accumulated snow of winter froze my heart, you gave me warmth, and I felt the spring sun shine, the accumulated snow melt, and spring return to the world.

When the summer sun burned my heart, your gentle breeze brought coolness to my marrow, as if bathing in a clear spring. I no longer suffer from the heat, no longer feel agitated.

I love to hear your footsteps, I still recall your footsteps in my dreams, because they are so soft, and so steady.

I love to hear your voice, I still recall your voice in my dreams, because it is so earnest, so gentle, so low. I love your smile even more. I recall your smile even more in my dreams, because it is so sincere, so heartfelt, so gentle, and so innocent.

I love your eyes, I recall your eyes even more in my dreams, because they are so affectionate, so earnest, but also so pure. They tell me you are a noble soul: they make me think of a pure and flawless baby; they make me think of a holy and sublime angel.

Therefore, I need you, I find peace with you, I want to assimilate with you!

Come across the desolate and vast wilderness! You don't have to hesitate, don't linger, don't pause on the treetops or linger in the boudoir. Come, slip in, and stay in my hair forever.

### Country Gentry

— Li Liwen

In our place, there are many, many country gentry. These country gentry, just like reptiles, mammals, and birds in zoology, each has its own common traits, naturally they also have their common traits, which are: not working all year round, but comfortably living in that well-equipped house, smoking opium, playing cards, drinking ginseng soup, and, inexplicably, all officials are always their friends, and are on good terms with them.

For example, let me give you an example of a very reputable country gentleman in our area.

This great country gentleman of ours is not a businessman, he doesn't have a shop in town; nor is he a big landlord, his family only cultivates enough land for two or three dan of rice; he certainly has some sons—born to two or three wives, and those sons certainly hold some small 'official positions', but their income is not enough for their own extravagance; our great country gentleman is certainly not a rich man, people all know that his life was not very good in the past, and he himself, neither went to Nanyang when he was young, nor did he manage any decent business in middle age; in short, our great country gentleman is such a person: neither a rich man, nor seems to have much income.

However, speaking of the future, it is indeed somewhat like a myth—this fact, who can really believe it?

Our great country gentleman lives in an exquisitely ornate, large, and unusually spacious house. He rarely goes to the streets for a stroll, he stays in his house almost all day and night busy with many trivial matters, he has to entertain visiting or local officials—naturally, those banquets are precious, sumptuous, and novel, therefore, he is familiar with many officials, they often lie on the opium bed for most of the day discussing many things we will never know.

His heart is also the most kind and loving, although he has not joined the Jesus Church, he has learned the loving spirit of Jesus, he often receives many strangers with sorrowful faces, and is always so "duty-bound" to take on the burden of eliminating disasters for them, for example, once a woman found him and told him that the police station had arrested a relative of hers.

"She is actually not a prostitute—how could she be?"

"Hmm... hmm..." Our country gentleman nodded, he understood, "That would be a fine of several tens of dollars!"

"But still..." The woman said straightforwardly, "I know everything."

"—Then there is a way," the country gentleman made a phone call to the police chief, "That is my relative, she is not a prostitute—it's really outrageous, who said she is a prostitute?"

So that prostitute walked back to the street again, swaying.

Another time, someone asked him for help with land matters.

"That is really my land, but he insists it is his, he wants to seize it." That person narrated like this.

The country gentleman said nothing, he immediately had a solution in his mind.

"Your place is worth..." The country gentleman calculated the land price and then said, "That's fine, I'll guarantee you'll be alright, you give me the handling fee..."

That place was naturally alright.

There was another time like this—I still want to give another example; a young man who was drafted into the army pleaded with him like this:

"The township head wants sixty dollars from me, where can I get so much, although I have twenty dollars,..."

The country gentleman accepted the young man's twenty dollars, and so the young man was alright, our country gentleman is really such a good person.

His irresistable power can also be seen from the nameplate of his house—"Concession." What is a concession, people who have been to Shanghai naturally know, that is: a place where the government's power does not reach, our country gentleman's house is indeed like this. For example, if our government prohibits smoking and gambling, those who violate the law will have to pay a large sum of money to get away with it. But in our country gentleman's house, it's as if they never knew there was such a prohibition. Every day, all kinds of people rush into his gate like they are going to a fair. His house is naturally spacious, but it also seems unusually narrow because of this, people are crowding, just like in a market, fan-tan, dice, playing cards, mahjong, top-quality opium paste,... all this makes people's minds a little dizzy, but they are relieved, they don't have to worry about the police detectives, because that is a "concession," and, isn't the "banker" in the corner the police chief?

But one cannot therefore say that our great country gentleman is unpatriotic, absolutely not, he is actually very patriotic, although he rarely looks at the newspaper he subscribes to—he almost never reads newspapers, because there are too many words he doesn't recognize, but he often cares about national affairs, and also bought five dollars of national salvation bonds, and, he is also, it seems, a committee member of the self-defense force or something!

### In Memory of My Uncle

— By Anar Wright

Translated by Yuan Shuiyi

(A thirteen-year-old child's poem)

When Ben Wright came into the world, and saw the flag of democracy, he wondered: How long can this flag last? Later he saw the Spanish people, unable to endure the tyranny of the tyrant. He saw that they would have a terrifying king, he saw democracy wandering in the fog, the black curtain of fascism was being drawn tighter and tighter, Ben Wright threw himself into the Spanish revolution. Like every soldier, brave and good at fighting, fighting the fascist devil of Hitler. His friends and brothers were all fighting, he said: "Bullets cannot damage freedom." Even when he died on the battlefield, he still said, "Bullets cannot damage freedom."

(This is a poem written by a thirteen-year-old American child. In memory of his uncle Ben Wright, who gloriously died on the peninsula last year for participating in the Spanish anti-war and like other sacrificed comrades of the International Brigade. "Bullets cannot damage freedom"! The Spanish government, is in the storm, we bless them with these words! - Translator's Postscript

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

Then, he smiled at the perpetrator, expressing his intention: whether the bullet pierces his heart, or the blade grazes his neck, he will endure it with the same patience: because he is the son of the motherland, on the altar of the motherland, holding a great sacrifice for the motherland, so he has no sorrow, and no complaint, perhaps he has regrets—for himself, his comrades, the motherland.

However, between success and failure, there are still many conceivable problems; these problems made him hesitate. For example: if he was discovered by detectives before he reached the girl's home, should he quietly commit suicide? Or bravely duel? If that girl who has never been frightened, fainted at the sight of his pistol, lost consciousness, should he drag her away? Or wake her up and then leave? If everything goes smoothly, only at the time of departure, her family's guards block the way, pointing a pistol at him and saying:

"Hey, if you're a friend, please leave our young lady, I will definitely be courteous and let you go..."

At this time, what kind of situation should he enter? Play what kind of unimaginable role? If... In the end, he gave all the questions to his pistol; he believed it could solve everything. However, the principle is not to harm her, because as long as there is her, there will always be an object for this work; even if he is sacrificed, later, there can still be comrades who can replace him in the work.
