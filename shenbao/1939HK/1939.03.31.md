### A Warm Welcome to Overseas Chinese Returning to Serve the Nation

The War of Resistance has entered a more urgent and critical stage!

This is a turning point that will determine the survival or demise, enslavement or freedom, of the entire Chinese nation.

The turning point of the War of Resistance also marks the transition from a phase of "Japanese strength and our weakness" and "Japanese victory and our defeat" to a phase of "mutual stalemate between Japan and us" and "evenly matched strength." In this new stage, the main force of the Japanese has not yet suffered a fatal blow, and our strength has not yet progressed to the necessary degree to "overcome the Japanese and achieve victory." Therefore, the Japanese are still able to highly leverage their combat power and continue to display their ferocity in attacking cities, seizing land, and forcefully occupying roads. However, each time the Japanese combat power is leveraged to its highest degree (such as the recent costly capture of Nanchang), the rate at which their combat power declines will inevitably become more rapid and drastic. Coupled with the increasingly serious political, economic, and diplomatic difficulties faced by the Japanese, this will ultimately lead them toward a path of total collapse. However, if we do not add to this our own progress in military, political, economic, and diplomatic affairs, especially in the general mobilization of the people, and do not inflict even greater blows on the Japanese in the current stage, then when the Japanese highly leverage their combat power, engage in military adventures, and coordinate them with political conspiracies of division, fragmentation, compromise, and mediation, our War of Resistance will suffer a major impact, the success of our national liberation cause will be even more distant, and the hardships and dangers in its course will be beyond our imagination!

Based on these characteristics of the current War of Resistance, we must intensify our progress in political, economic, and diplomatic affairs, especially in the general mobilization of the people, and inflict heavy blows on the Japanese in many ways. It is particularly important to concentrate the spiritual and material strength of the entire nation as soon as possible to persist in unity, persist in the War of Resistance, and strive for victory. The efforts of overseas Chinese are especially important in this regard. Since the full-scale outbreak of the War of Resistance in the motherland, overseas Chinese everywhere have enthusiastically supported it, contributing money and effort. Although this cannot be compared with the arduous struggles and generous sacrifices of the soldiers on the front lines and the compatriots in the war zones, their spirit of sacrificing for the nation's crisis and dedicating themselves to the motherland occupies one of the most glorious pages in the history of China's War of Resistance.

According to news published in newspapers in Hong Kong and Japan, specialized technical personnel among overseas Chinese in various places have recently been joining forces to return to the country to serve. For example, the "East River Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps," organized by the Huizhou Fellow Countrymen Association in various parts of Southeast Asia, consisting of two groups, set off for home today, the 24th. The third batch of the "Drivers Returning Home Service Corps," organized by the Johor Bahru Fundraising Association, also completed its training period and set off for home today, the 24th. In addition, forty-two members of the "Taiping Mechanics Returning Home Service Corps" from Johor also departed from Penang on the same day to transfer to ships for Hong Kong and then return home. Furthermore, overseas Chinese from Malacca, Bentong, Senhua, Singapore, and other places have abandoned their professions and organized returning home service corps to serve the motherland's War of Resistance. They are all making preparations one after another and will soon set off for home to serve. There are countless others that have not been reported or are currently being prepared!

This righteous and patriotic action of overseas Chinese in various places demonstrates, on the one hand, that our government's national policy of upholding unity in resisting Japan and building the nation is fully in line with the common demands of all Chinese people for independence and freedom, and is a merciless blow to all traitors and rebels who attempt to incite disorder by advocating anti-communism and peace. On the other hand, it can also demonstrate to people all over the world the supreme and great spirit of the Chinese nation, enhancing the confidence of international justice and peace-loving people in our country's inevitable victory in the War of Resistance and inevitable success in nation-building.

Our government has promulgated many laws and regulations regarding welcoming overseas Chinese to return to serve the nation. We hope that the government can further enhance its concrete rewards in the future and help overseas Chinese solve many personal issues, such as the freedom to participate in the anti-Japanese and national salvation work, and the guarantee of their livelihoods and family finances. At the same time, we also have hopes for our compatriots:

First, we hope that overseas Chinese in various places will hold enthusiastic farewell or honorary meetings for groups or individuals returning home to serve, and express respect to the families of overseas Chinese returning home to serve through organizations and public opinion, hold regular condolences, and assist them in solving various problems.

Second, we hope that compatriots in the country and in areas close to the motherland will hold grand welcome meetings, farewell meetings, and honorary meetings, and other mass gatherings when overseas Chinese returning home to serve pass through. Moreover, we should use the power of various people's organizations and the broad masses to help overseas Chinese returning home to serve quickly and effectively solve the problems that may arise along the way. We want to make every overseas Chinese who is determined to return home to serve feel as intimate, happy, and excited as if they have returned to the embrace of a long-separated mother when they set foot in the motherland!

Third, and this is particularly important, we hope that wealthy overseas Chinese, as well as overseas Chinese who are unable to return home to serve immediately, should intensify and expand fundraising campaigns, debt repayment campaigns, charity sales, and all economic activities that meet the current urgent needs of the motherland and contribute to the cause of Chinese national liberation. As for investing in the motherland, developing the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, and developing the economic construction of the rear areas, these are major tasks for laying the foundation for building a new China in the future, and they require the efforts of overseas Chinese from all walks of life with vision, especially the press and educators, to intensify their efforts to promote their widespread and effective realization.

Overseas Chinese have long created a glorious page in the cause of world justice and peace. They have created great and immortal honor for the revolutionary and nation-building cause of the motherland. Now, at this critical stage that will determine the life and death of the Chinese nation and the severity of the War of Resistance, the efforts of our overseas Chinese are becoming even more important! Let us redouble our efforts! The bright and happy future of the motherland is waiting for us to create!

### The Establishment of the Anti-Japanese Base Area in the Ji'nan Plain

[North China Dispatch] Starting from He Shun, crossing the treacherous and towering Taihang Mountains, and winding out of the rugged Yangyang, one descends to the flat and boundless Hebei Plain. The Pinghan Railway, running north and south, lies there horizontally. This transportation line, which has already been occupied by the Japanese, can no longer lie there peacefully as before. Our Jixi guerrillas, lurking near the railway, and a portion of a certain Route Army frequently appear and destroy it mercilessly, leaving it in pieces and unable to connect from end to end, causing it to be restless and losing its normal function. Our guerrillas often set out several times a day, each time destroying the railway mercilessly and then returning safely with a victorious smile. Our troops and staff members also shuttle back and forth along the side of the railway every day. As long as the railway is broken two miles away, the Japanese cannot rule. In fact, they are at a loss even for this only transportation line and are instead under the control of our guerrillas.

The vast plain area of Ji'nan and Jizhong includes the area north to the Cangshi Road, south to the border of Hebei and Henan, east to the border of Shandong, and west to the Pinghan Railway, with more than twenty counties of varying sizes. However, since our army withdrew last year, it has become an area without anyone in charge, with the masses still vaguely living their "tranquil" lives. There is no government, army, or popular organization. At the same time, the Japanese have not bothered to occupy it, but they have never forgotten this vast area. They have bought off a large number of traitors and bandits to infiltrate various places and carry out activities, organizing all kinds of associations and groups to deceive our backward masses. Especially in the area near the Shandong border, the power of these sects is still quite large even now, and counties such as Nangong, Northeast Zaoqiang, Wuyi, and Daying have simply become their base camps and the base for traitorous activities. Because these places are close to the Jinpu Railway, they all have the original armed forces of the people, using the relationship of feudal superstition. After our government and army withdrew, in order to protect their families, they automatically united and called on backward masses to participate with slogans such as "Invulnerability to knives and spears." At the same time, traitors and bandits took the opportunity to be active, deceiving and anesthetizing the masses with reactionary slogans such as "Protect the hometown without resisting Japan," "Oppose the Communists but not the Japanese," and "Neither resist Japan nor oppose Chiang." Although since March of this year, a certain Route Army Guojin Column has swept across the area and various tasks have also been launched, we began to establish anti-Japanese governments, mobilize and organize the masses, and organize local armed forces in that plain area, and launched a large-scale guerrilla war in the plains, but the power of the sects did not weaken as a result, but instead became larger with the development of our work. The reasons for this are: (1) The mass work is not deep and universal enough; (2) The "fair burden" method promulgated by the J'nan Administrative Office at that time caused misunderstandings among the rich in the implementation process, creating opposition between the rich and the poor, and some wealthy households combined with or joined sects to oppose this method; (3) Because Ji'nan is a cotton producing area, the people's annual income is largely from the large-scale purchase of cotton by the Japanese at high prices. In order to resist this, the Ji'nan Administrative Office ordered a ban on the export of cotton. At that time, it was the time when cotton was on the market, and Ji'nan defended the large-scale export of cotton, which caused a major public resentment. The sects manipulated by the traitors and bandits took the opportunity to deceive the masses with "anti-Japanese and anti-communist" slogans, and many of the masses were deceived and used.

This finally broke out in the "Zaoqiang Incident" in early November. Because the "Baiji Association" in Zaoqiang at that time had considerable power and its members were particularly complex, it openly incited the masses based on the above reasons and colluded with the "Puppet Army" to oppose the government and a certain Route Army, attempting to overthrow the government and eliminate a certain Route Army. A unit of a certain Route Army stationed in Tanxian had long thought of dealing with it. At the same time, the Hebei Provincial Government also realized that the traitorous forces in Zaoqiang were too large and sent a team to prepare to resolve the "Baiji Association." The "Baiji Association" took preemptive action, first gathering more than a thousand members to surround the city and launch an attack, and prohibiting our troops outside the city from entering the city. In order to win over the deceived masses, our army did not retaliate and carried out propaganda and solicitation work with slogans such as "Chinese should not fight Chinese" and "Do not be exploited by Japanese imperialism and traitors." It is said that hundreds of people automatically dispersed, but a few still attempted to resist stubbornly, resulting in armed conflict and many deaths and injuries.

After the political teams' continuous struggle with traitors and bandits and propaganda work with great patience towards the masses, the power of the sects gradually began to weaken after this armed conflict. Some parts were won over and disintegrated, and some parts were incorporated into the current local armed forces - the Peng guerrillas. In the beginning, these guerrillas who had been incorporated in large numbers defected to the "Puppet Army." Even now, this phenomenon still occurs constantly. They openly opposed the anti-Japanese government and a certain Route Army. In that remote area - such as the Zaoqiang Wudao area, the antagonism between the sects and the army and government has not yet been completely eliminated. This still requires our continuous efforts!

In Nangong, the military and political center of Ji'nan, various salvation works are relatively developed, but the further away you go, the weaker it becomes. Although mass organizations, such as the Workers' Salvation Association, the Farmers' Salvation Association, the Women's Salvation Association, and youth organizations, have been generally organized and have general leading organs in Ji'nan; however, the grassroots foundation is still not enough. Because the development of the organization, due to various reasons, has been carried out from top to bottom, and there has not been in-depth and universal educational work and strict organizational life. For example, on the road from Renxian to Junglu to Nangong, which is more than 180 li, there are many villages and towns without self-defense posts. They are only formalistic, and they let passers-by go without asking any questions. It is said that they are all hired by wealthy people to guard their posts; no wonder they are so negligent in their own sacred mission. At the same time, it can also be seen how insufficient the grassroots mass work is in these places, requiring greater and more in-depth efforts.

The governments in more than ten counties in Ji'nan are unified under the leadership of the "Ji'nan Administrative Office." The administration has undergone considerable reforms, and it has achieved considerable results in the formulation and implementation of various new wartime laws and regulations, such as the implementation of laws and regulations such as mobilizing new soldiers, giving preferential treatment to families, fair burdens, and banning cotton exports. Although these laws and regulations initially suffered opposition from the masses to varying degrees, after in-depth propaganda and education work, the masses are now very willing to implement them.

Before the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, Ji'nan and Jizhong were no longer a peaceful place. In order to cooperate with the war on the battlefield, respond to the new combat missions, and welcome the new situation in North China, a mobilization for an emergency battle was launched in Ji'nan under the close cooperation of the military, government, and people. After this call was issued, the entire Ji'nan seemed to have been given a shot in the arm and was revitalized. Everyone, taking Nangong as the center and base, widely mobilized the people to dismantle cities and break roads, empty houses and clear fields... The Ji'nan Workers' Union, Farmers' Union, Women's Salvation Association, and Youth League were all mobilized. The female comrades of the Women's Salvation Association took on the task of supervising and supervising the dismantling of the city, and they always had to return late at night, and then go out early the next day. A few days before the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese attacked Renxian with more than a thousand troops. After occupying Xingjia (northeast of Renxian), they were surrounded by a certain Route Army and Liang Zhong. After two days of hard fighting and complete resolution, people's high work enthusiasm was further encouraged. The city of Nangong was leveled in just over ten days, and the troops were busy conditioning. The soldiers were excitedly waiting for the arrival of new and more cruel battles.

In mid-November, more than two thousand Japanese troops, filled with more than one hundred cars, swaggered out from Xingtai, attempting a major offensive in Ji'nan. The area around Yucheng, Shandong, in the east, also launched fierce battles. The Japanese attempted to approach Nangong from the east and west. On November 16, the Japanese approached Nangong, more than fifty li away from the city gate. At four o'clock in the afternoon, all the people in Nangong city retreated, and everything that could be moved was also taken away. Nangong City almost became an empty city. The four mass organizations, including the Workers' Salvation Association, the Rescue Association, the Women's Rescue Association, and a certain youth organization, and the unit of a certain Route Army, waited for everyone to leave, and finally withdrew after 11 o'clock in the evening. Although they had fought guerrilla warfare in the Taihang Mountains for more than a year, this plain guerrilla life was their first attempt. In front of them was an endless plain, and the Japanese tanks and armored vehicles flaunted their power. Everyone carried their luggage on their backs and walked for two days and nights without rest. On the third day, they arrived in Weixian and continued to advance to Guangzong, retreating and working along the way.

Nangong City was occupied by the Japanese on the 17th. After the Japanese entered the city, they saw only an empty city, ×××××××××××××. On the 18th, a big fire broke out in the city, but our guerrillas lurking outside the city did not move. On the morning of the 19th, more than forty Japanese cars safely drove to the southwest, but at night our guerrillas and self-defense forces outside the city showed their magical power. First, they completely destroyed the roads around the city. The remaining Japanese in the city were completely resolved, and Nangong, the center of the Ji'nan Plain base area, was returned to our hands.

The Japanese's large-scale siege plan against this plain anti-Japanese base area was finally completely crushed under the close unity, heroic struggle, and the three-in-one military, government, and people in Ji'nan. Before the Japanese attacked, when this place was still relatively peaceful, there were many unnecessary "friction" between the military and the government, but after the Japanese attack, this phenomenon of "those close to us are hurt and those who hate us are happy" has gradually been eliminated. This is something we should thank the Japanese for.

The Ji'nan and Jizhong Plain Anti-Japanese Base Areas were established in this way. The question now is how to consolidate it, develop it, and enable it to play its proper strategic role in adhering to the War of Resistance in North China, adhering to the protracted war, and liberating the Chinese nation.

### The Rising Tide of Anti-German Anger in Central Europe

(Special Translation) After annexing Czechoslovakia, Hitler is now launching fierce new conspiracies. His conspiracy lies in the absolute hijacking of Central and Eastern Europe, the plunder of all countries and parts of territories in Central Europe, and the active planning of attacks on Western European powers and the Soviet Union. But in Northern Europe, Germany is actively preparing to annex Klaipeda, control Lithuania, and completely apply the "Sudetenland experience" here.

Under the instigation of German fascists, friction between the Czech Republic and Hungary has greatly increased. German fascists previously provoked disputes between Poland and Hungary on the issue of the Polish-Hungarian border: they sacrificed the southern lands of Slovakia and Carpathian Ukraine to satisfy Hungary's demands, but now openly claim to support Slovakia and overturn the Vienna decision. At the same time, it is also instigating Slovakia against Poland. Germany is also using every means to worsen the relations between Poland and Romania. In the Balkans, Hitler's henchmen are inciting ethnic hatred, encouraging demands to break the status quo, and causing these countries to attack each other.

Obviously, any single country in Central and Eastern Europe is too weak to resist Hitler's oppression. This realization that Hitler's Germany's oppression can only be resisted with collective strength has affected the people of those countries, even the stubborn and backward elements. In the largest of these countries - Poland - countless appeals have been made, calling for the union of the Central European countries against aggression. Most worthy of writing about: These appeals are called out from those who launched the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in October last year: Of course, Poland should bear part of the responsibility for the predicament Poland is in today. Polish Catholic leader Keer Fangtai once wrote: "Today, very few Poles do not admit that the Munich conspiracy to destroy the Czech fortress has fundamentally changed the international situation and Poland's importance." Even some fascist henchmen, who were Hitler's admirers and flag-wavers of the Munich Agreement yesterday, are now shocked that the cession of the German Shen District to Poland is a major political loss for Poland.

The famous right-wing leader, Skulonski, directly suggested the establishment of a "Central European alliance against Hitler's ambitions," he said:

"Although no Eastern European country neighboring Germany has the power to resist German aggression and defend itself alone; but if they unite together - the Balkan countries, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia - they can say to Germany: we all intend to be friendly with Germany, but we cannot sit idly by while one of us is controlled and ruled by Germany. Therefore, we unite to resist any such attempt; it is very clear that the rise of German power in Central Europe is the end of our true independence."

Professor Skulonski clearly pointed out: Such an alliance will greatly enhance the resistance of the countries threatened by Hitler's conquests. In fact, the total population of the above-mentioned countries is 95 million, and if Bulgaria is included, the total can exceed 100 million, much more than Germany's population. Secondly, these countries have extremely important raw materials, some of which have great military value; these raw materials are constantly being transported to Germany, and Germany cannot fight a war without them. These raw materials are: Romanian oil, Polish, Romanian and Yugoslav grains, meat, timber, etc.

Especially important is that in the war to resist foreign aggression, the military discipline of a neutral small country must be more intense than the military discipline of the German army, which is driven to invade other countries' territories and destroy other countries' independence. But most important here is that such an alliance must be supported by peace-loving people and countries. Needless to say, such an alliance must be supported by the bastion of peace, the Soviet Union. For this reason, Mei Guanlitai expressed infinite welcome to the improvement of Soviet-Polish relations.

The people and politicians of Central and Southeastern Europe have now recognized:

"Any country that truly wants to consolidate its security under the situation created by the Munich Agreement must recognize the Soviet Union as a powerful factor in defending peace and can estimate its assistance." (Soviet News, November 1938)

Needless to say, this alliance is completely different from the so-called "neutral alliance" that former Polish Foreign Minister Beck attempted to organize, which was instructed to harm the independence of small and weak nations and harm the Soviet Union.

Of course, the prospects for a Central and Southeastern European alliance are still facing some major difficulties and obstacles. First, these countries still have the reactionary policies of the ruling class and foreign countries, and they often play a major or decisive role in these countries' policies. Secondly, there are still contradictions between the reactionary governments and all strata in these countries, old and new territorial disputes, irredentist movements, etc. The policies of reactionary traitors are indeed a terrible but not insurmountable obstacle. Now, even the reactionary government of Poland has had to improve its relationship with the Soviet Union. It was forced to do so by the struggle of the Polish people and the pressure exerted by those bourgeois; however, the traitors in Polish society still do not believe that cooperation with Hitler and participation in the partition of Czechoslovakia have severely harmed Poland's independence. There are countries in Central and Southeastern Europe in the same situation as Poland. But at the same time, the pressure of the working masses here is growing rapidly, and even in bourgeois circles, a change of opinion on relations with Germany can be seen.

Speaking of the current relations between countries, we can see from the following: Polish plunderers have caused great hatred in the Czech Republic. The first news of the improvement of Soviet-Polish relations immediately changed Czech public opinion. There is no doubt that destroying Germany's control over Central Germany will give a strong impetus to the democratization of the foreign or domestic policies of these countries, and will greatly help in the proper resolution of their mutual demands and disputes. It will accelerate the victory of the people of these countries in overcoming the reactionary forces in their own countries. Once the people in these countries unite, they will resolve all foreign and domestic disputes based on the democratic principles of national peace, and therefore, the alliance of neutral small countries that defend their sovereignty and independence and resist fascist aggressors is becoming increasingly popular. This alliance, which has friendly neighborly relations and cooperates with the Soviet Union and all countries that crave peace and independence, will become a powerful factor in maintaining peace.

### Aid China Movement in the Netherlands

(Special Correspondent V.O.) In the Netherlands, Esperanto is quite popular, especially among ordinary workers. Therefore, using Esperanto for international propaganda in the Netherlands can certainly achieve desirable results. Since the publication of the Chinese Esperanto publication "Eastern Call," it has received a great response in many countries, including the Netherlands. Dutch Esperantists often translate the materials from "Eastern Call" into Dutch and publish them in various newspapers, and they have written letters expressing sympathy and donating funds to support China. However, they felt it was not enough and were willing to hold an anti-Japanese war exhibition for China to further arouse the Dutch public's sympathy for China. "Eastern Call" agreed to their request and sent some photos (mostly provided by the International Propaganda Office and the Central News Agency). They held several exhibitions with these few photos and achieved satisfactory results. Recently, an enthusiastic Esperantist there wrote to "Eastern Call" to report on the exhibition process. The letter was full of brotherly affection and made people feel encouraged. Here is a translation of it:

To our comrades at "Eastern Call," last year you provided over eighty photos about China's war of resistance, which have been exhibited here many times, and the results have exceeded our expectations. The details are as follows, which you may be glad to hear:

First, it was held within the ninth branch of our organization, the "Dutch Workers' Esperanto Association."

Second, it was held at the tenth branch of the same organization, where Comrade Lange gave a passionate speech of sympathy. I did not know this gentleman before.

Third, it was held at the E.m.m. of the southern branch of the Dutch Metalworkers' Union. This exhibition was of great significance because the branch, under the leadership of the Dutch Aid China Movement Committee, had sent many fundraising personnel to participate in the city's fundraising campaign, raising over 12,000 guilders (equivalent to over 40,000 yuan in national currency).

Fourth, it was held in various educational classes in the large hall of the Association for Popular Culture in The Hague.

Fifth, it was displayed in rotation in the windows of a bookstore in the downtown area of Amsterdam. We plan to display it in other stores later.

Sixth, it was exhibited at the Krasnapolsky Building during the commemoration of Zamenhof's birthday (the creator of Esperanto was born on December 15). This exhibition was a great success, with over 900 people visiting. Their concern for China's war of resistance was astonishing. We sold thirty-one copies of the Aid China Committee's pamphlets and sixty copies of "Eastern Call." If we had more copies, we could certainly have sold them. Finally, we collected donations at the entrance, raising over ten guilders, which were all sent to the Chinese consulate to be forwarded to your government.

Our results can be said to be very satisfactory. Previously, the leaders of our association did not agree with our plan and took a completely bystander attitude during this exhibition. Initially, we and the representatives of the Aid China Committee who participated were not allowed to give speeches to promote public attention to our exhibition. But in the end, it aroused people's interest, and the authorities allowed us to collect donations and sell pamphlets and publications. The public's sympathy for China is active, but it remains stagnant if it is not continuously stimulated.

Finally, we must thank the many active male and female comrades who helped us to achieve success.

We made many beautiful propaganda banners, pasted photos on them, and lined them with artistic card stock and colored lace. We asked artists to write eye-catching slogans. All materials were carefully arranged and very beautiful. We also borrowed thirteen photos from the Aid China Committee. Some of your photos were not used because they were too blurry or showed nudity.

You wrote in your letter that you wanted to take these photos to France. But here, these photos seem to have many uses. Not only in Amsterdam, but also in other cities. Soon, we plan to visit other groups, hold exhibitions, give propaganda speeches to awaken sympathy for China, promote "Eastern Call," and cooperate with the Aid China Committee. They can present Chinese dance, music, and phonograph records, and the results will be more profound. We also feel that we need some inexpensive and useful illustrated pamphlets, perhaps you can provide them to us. Moving posters, such as those printed by Spanish Esperantists, are also very useful. Can you provide some Chinese textbooks for this purpose? We also need many photos, not only about the war, but also about China's entire culture, customs, natural scenery, transportation, women's and children's progressive activities, photos about schools, sports, art, and Chinese dignitaries, etc. These photos should not be larger than postcards. Because we have a set of projectors, when sending these photos to France, we can use them to give lectures, Chinese music, songs, and phonograph records of celebrity speeches are also very effective, and we hope you can provide some. The costs can certainly be recovered. You can print some postcards with slogans. If you have other ideas, please let us know, we are very willing to consider and implement them.

### The Battle in Hunan is Still Fierce, We Take a Circumferential Stance Against Nanchang, Casualties in Yueyang Exceed Two Thousand

[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 30th] Approximately one regiment of the Japanese army that crossed the Gan River from Shengmi Street continued to advance towards Liangjiadu (a station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway) southeast of Nanchang on the evening of the 28th, and was intercepted by our army. They are currently in a standoff at Shabutang (a station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway between Yuntang and Liangjiadu).

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] A Chinese military spokesman, in response to a question about where the Nanchang garrison had retreated to, stated today that the Nanchang garrison is still surrounding the outskirts of Nanchang and has not withdrawn elsewhere. Chinese military strategy does not involve withdrawing troops from Japanese-occupied areas. The current troops are adopting a circumferential formation against Nanchang, attacking the Japanese troops in the city at any time, and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Meanwhile, fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese forces continued yesterday in the Nanchang area.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 30th] Among the battles in northern Jiangxi, the defense of Wuning was the most tragic and heroic. All defending troops were able to display the highest degree of resilience and a spirit of revenge. The Japanese began attacking Wuning from the 20th, with a force of about one and a half divisions, advancing along the Ruiwu Highway and the Ruoxi-Wuning section. Our defending troops fought fiercely for ten days and nights. The Japanese, according to their own admissions, suffered the loss of two regimental commanders killed in action and two other senior unit commanders severely wounded. The casualties among soldiers are even more imaginable. Our army used the hills on both sides of the highway to check the Japanese advance. Every meter was fought with bayonets. After achieving satisfactory results, they began to retreat. To this day, the outer defenses of Wuning are still in our hands. South of the city, facing the Xiushui River, all our officers and soldiers are engaging in a bloody battle against the Japanese on the other side of the Xiushui River with the ambition to shake the mountains. The bravery and heroism of our troops in the past ten days has astonished even the Japanese. According to a Japanese broadcast heard here yesterday, reporting on the resistance encountered in the capture of Wuning and their praise for our army, only Yan Haiwen, the heroic pilot of our air force in the Battle of Shanghai, was described with such words. This proves that our troops in Wuning swore to resist to the death, using their advantages to put up a fierce resistance.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 30th] Chinese sources here claim that nine Chinese bombers flew to Anyi in northern Jiangxi on Tuesday and bombed, destroying twenty-eight Japanese tanks. A large amount of military supplies were also burned, and many Japanese soldiers were injured. These sources also claim that the Japanese suffered as many as 30,000 casualties in northern Jiangxi last week. The Chinese army has also obtained a large number of reinforcements and is carrying out the task of eliminating the Japanese army. At the same time, in the Wuning area, the Chinese army annihilated 4,000 Japanese soldiers and captured twelve artillery pieces and 500 machine guns.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The military here is currently planning to intercept Japanese forces to cut off their rear supply lines.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 30th] On the afternoon of the 28th, over a hundred Japanese cavalry, accompanied by three mountain guns, shelled Wucun (seven li north of Gaoyou City) with over ten shells. Japanese forces in the Fengxin area are now operating in two routes, one towards Gaoan and the other towards Xiushui. The Japanese forces in the Wuning area, with a force of about five regiments, crossed the river south of Ruoxi, seemingly to reinforce Jing'an. One of our divisions is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the area of Maanshan and Daqiao River.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 30th] Since the 25th, the Japanese troops in Xinkaitang and Matang in Yueyang have been constantly attacking our army after reinforcements arrived, but they have all been bravely repelled by our army. The other day, when the Japanese attacked, a part of our army ambushed on the flanks, and the fighting was fierce. The Japanese suffered more than two thousand casualties and fled in panic towards Caijiatian. After this major defeat, the Japanese offensive was thwarted. Now our army is taking advantage of the victory to advance.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 30th] At dawn on the 24th, our army attacked the Japanese forces in Xinkaitang and Matang, and recaptured Qiguling (thirteen li south of Yueyang) by noon, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops in Yueyang are reinforcing that area.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 30th] The Huarong telephone reports: (1) There are currently about 200 Japanese troops stationed at Bailuoji and Luoshan. They recently ordered the residents of the area to rush to build trenches. (2) Two Japanese warships are docked on the Yangtze River at Chenglinji. One of them withdrew downstream on the 29th.

Our Air Force Flew to Northern Jiangsu, Sinking Two Japanese Warships, Japanese Planes Raided Various Parts of Henan and Sichuan, Destroying Liangshan Prison and Schools

[Central News Agency, Somewhere in Northern Jiangsu, 30th] Eleven Japanese warships were anchored in the Sheyang and Hekou waters of Funing County. On the afternoon of the 19th, a squadron of our air force flying from the Japanese side discovered their location and dropped dozens of bombs on the Japanese warships, destroying two Japanese warships which sunk.

Shanxi Implements New Strategy, Expands Guerrilla Warfare, With Few Against Many Near Fenyang, Heroic Achievements Will Forever Be Remembered in History

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 29th] Zhou Ming, a platoon leader of a guerrilla detachment of our army, led thirty soldiers to advance towards Er'ya, Jiaocheng after launching a new strategy in Qianzhuang, Fenyang on the morning of the 19th. While passing through Fengjiaya Bottom, they learned that more than a thousand Japanese troops were opening Wucheng Town from Fenyang West. The platoon ambushed at Fengjiaya Bottom, letting the Japanese vanguard pass, and when the main force arrived, they suddenly fired fiercely and densely on their rear units with machine guns. The Japanese vanguard heard the alarm and turned back, launching a full-scale siege. Our thirty soldiers occupied three hills, forming a mutually supporting position. They fought fiercely from dawn for half a day, and the Japanese were never able to get close. Platoon leader Zhou commanded bravely and was seriously wounded. Their ammunition was also exhausted. A part of the Japanese launched a fierce attack on the hill. The platoon leader threw the remaining hand grenade to detonate himself together with the Japanese. Twenty of our soldiers took the opportunity to break through, five died valiantly in battle, and three were seriously wounded and captured. The Japanese army was killed by us reaching over a hundred people. After the Japanese commander received the report, he considered that the platoon ambushed the Japanese with mobility, fought with few against many, was brave and heroic, and could be a model for the whole army. He issued an order to give preferential treatment to the dead, and promoted the entire platoon by two ranks. He also erected a monument to commemorate them at the site of the martyrdom, and compiled and praised their heroic deeds.

It is reported that initially the guerrillas only captured six missionaries, but later the bishop of the church personally went to negotiate for their release, and the guerrillas also detained him together. It is said that the guerrillas captured the missionaries not for ransom, but because the missionaries were using Japanese military currency, which is currently circulating in the area.

### Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank Reports on Business Conditions

[Reuters, London, 30th] The "Financial Times" stated that Willis, chairman of Standard Chartered Bank, stated at the bank's annual meeting today that events in China and India have made it necessary for him to adopt banknotes with considerably limited value. The reason for the devaluation of the Chinese currency is due to the withdrawal of deposits. Therefore, Standard Chartered Bank's business in China is not inferior to that of HSBC. A "Times" financial correspondent stated, "Willis' description of China's situation is of great hope for the development of China and the world, because China is making extraordinary efforts to establish a new economic system in the western provinces, enabling millions of businessmen from the Yangtze River Basin to develop this rich and undeveloped region."

### Shanxi Pingle Land - People Capture Japanese Pilot Barehanded - Military Commission Gives Awards to Encourage - Requests the National Government to Issue Special Certificates

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] According to a telegram from the political department of the Shanxi Southern Maojin Division, the army shot down a Japanese bomber on the 28th. The Japanese pilot, Yamada, fired a gun and resisted arrest in an attempt to escape. Then, Fan Bitao, a citizen of Pinglu, bravely rushed forward. When Yamada was loading his gun, he tightly hugged his waist. Yamada struck Fan's head fiercely with the pistol grip, causing blood to flow all over his face, but he still refused to let go. Later, the troops arrived and were able to capture him alive. Fan had no official position, but his hatred of the Japanese was deep, and he did not care for his own safety. This is commendable. The Military Commission has given him an award in accordance with the regulations and requested the National Government to give him a special certificate of commendation. In addition, Lin Shu of the department persuaded Yamada to realize his errors and surrender, and publicly spoke about the crimes of the Japanese warlords, and translated the Prime Minister's will into Japanese. Ding Jiu, a clerk, incited the masses to capture the pilot. Both are models for government personnel and have been given a major merit to encourage them.

### Handling Measures for Secured Consolidated Tax Bonds, Spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Adds Explanation

Loans from Britain and France Will Still Be Paid on Time; Measures to Solve Other Debts Are Being Considered

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance made further explanations today regarding Minister Kong's statement on March 26 regarding the handling of debts secured by consolidated tax. The main points are roughly divided into three points: (1) Before the negotiations between the government and relevant parties are completed, the consolidated bonds secured by salt tax should be implemented in accordance with January 15. The same method applies to the consolidated bonds secured by customs duties. In other words, a portion of the debts secured by salt tax will be handled by the Central Bank in a separate account. (2) The British and French loans due on April 5 will still be paid on time because the paying agency had previously received funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance, which were sufficient for payment. However, this can only be regarded as a special event. (3) The government is currently negotiating with the representatives of the creditors, striving to find a suitable and practical solution under the current situation to maintain creditworthiness.

### Western Highway Construction

— Bi Cen

A Great Leap Forward, Mostly Completed - Six More International Routes Opened

[Kunming Special Aviation Dispatch] Highway construction is much easier than railway construction. Because the materials needed for highways are mostly domestically produced, and consist largely of earth and stone works, highway development is currently easier than railway development in our country. Now, the two major highway networks in the Southwest and Northwest have been largely completed. Before the railway network is completed, this is indeed a convenient transportation tool, both internally and externally.

In the Southwest, there were already over 27,000 kilometers of highways completed before the war. Since the outbreak of the war, many more routes have been completed. Currently, there are: (1) the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, from Chengdu through Ziyang, Zizhong, and Rongchang to Chongqing, about 450 kilometers long. (2) the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, from Guiyang through Zunyi and Tongzi to Chongqing, about 500 kilometers long. (3) the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway, from Kunming through Pingyi to Guiyang, over 600 kilometers long, connecting with the Sichuan-Guizhou and Chengdu-Guizhou routes to reach Chongqing and Chengdu. (4) the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway (Xuzhou-Kunming Highway), from Xuzhou in Sichuan to Kunming, is currently under construction. The section from Xuanwei to Weining has already been completed, and the entire route will soon be open to traffic. (5) the Yunnan-Burma Highway, starting from Kunming, passing through Xiaguan, Yongchang, Longling, and Mengyu to Lashio. The section from Kunming to Xiaguan, a total of 275 miles long, was opened to traffic three years ago. The remaining 340+ miles from Xiaguan to Lashio began construction in December of the year before last and is now complete. The designers of this road were entirely Chinese, and the work was done entirely with manpower, with almost no use of even the simplest machinery. Therefore, a correspondent from the London Times said: "What has been completed is excellent work, that only the Chinese could have achieved." The completion of this road has shortened the time of Sino-British traffic considerably. It takes a maximum of five days to travel from Kunming to Burma. (6) the Hunan-Guizhou Highway, from Changsha in Hunan through Huangxian to Guiyang. (7) the Hunan-Guangxi Highway, from Hengyang through Lingling to Guilin. (8) the Sichuan-Guangxi Highway, from Liuzhou through Guiyang, reaching Chongqing or Chengdu. (9) the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, from Changde through Yuanling, reaching Fuling or Chongqing. (10) the Guangxi-Vietnam Highway, from Liuzhou through Yongning, reaching Zhennanguan and Lang Son in Annam. (11) the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway, from Shaanxi [blanks in original] through Chengdu and [blanks in original], this is the only connecting route between the Southwest and Northwest. In addition, there are highways between Guizhou, Sichuan, and provinces [blanks in original], too numerous to list.

In the Northwest, in addition to the Shaanxi-Kangding Highway connecting to the Southwest, with [blanks in original] as the center: (1) the Xi-Lan Highway, from Gaolan through Dingxi, Longde, and Pingliang to Xi'an, a total of 700 kilometers long. The road surface is paved with pebbles, making driving very convenient. (2) the Gan-Xin Highway, from Gaolan through Yongdeng, Gulang, Yongchang, Jiuquan, and Yumen, out of Xingxing Gorge, then through Hami and Dihua to reach Tacheng, a total of 2,800 kilometers long, connecting to Soviet Central Asia. It is the only international transportation line in Northwest China. At the same time, the section from Gaolan to Jiuquan is the most resource-rich area. (3) the Gan-Chuan Highway, starting from Huajialing on the Xi-Lan Highway, passing through Tongwei, Tianshui, and Wudu to reach Guangyuan in Sichuan, connecting with the Shaanxi-Gan Highway, about 700 kilometers long. (4) the [blanks in original]-Lan Highway, from Fengxiang in Shaanxi to [blanks in original] Lanzhou, over 400 kilometers long. (5) the Gan-Ning Highway, from Gao Lan through Jingyuan to Ningxia, about 380 kilometers long. Unfortunately, due to the fall of Sui province [sic] [missing character], construction could not be started. (6) the Gan-Qing Highway, from Gaolan to Xining, about 280 kilometers long, is a massive project and has not yet been built. (7) the Shaanxi-Sui Highway, from Xi'an or Xianyang through Sanyuan, Luochuan, Fushi, and Yulin to reach Huanyuan. The area passing through Fushi and Yan'an is where the Eighth Route Army headquarters is located. Since the [missing character] Japanese invaded Shanxi, although they have often attempted to cross the river to the west [missing character], they have not succeeded, which is due to the Eighth Route Army constantly inflicting heavy blows. Yan'an has very [missing character] rich oil reserves, but new methods of extraction have not yet been used. Recently, the Ministry of Communications, in order to improve the transportation efficiency of the Southwest and Northwest routes, has issued orders to various road bureaus and companies to actively improve road surfaces, build bridges, add vehicles, expand repair shops, store [missing character] self-made parts, and use domestic substitutes as much as possible, in order to reduce the outflow of foreign exchange.

In short, the torrent of the War of Resistance has made all undertakings in our country make great progress, especially in transportation construction. From the brief description above, we can already see a general outline. Although the Southwest and Northwest railway network is still under construction and not yet completed, there are already highways, shipping, telecommunications, water transportation, and pack animals to supplement it. Once completed, not only can all the abundant resources in the Southwest and Northwest be developed, enhancing our inexhaustible material and financial resources in the long-term war of resistance, but also six international transportation routes have been opened: one can go from Kunming to Rangoon; two can go from Kunming to Haiphong; three can go from Liuzhou to Haiphong; four can go from [blanks in original] Lanzhou to Istanbul in Turkey; five can go from Gaolan via the Western Turkish Railway to Northern Europe; and six can go from [blanks in original] Lun via the Siberian Railway to echo Moscow and Vladivostok in the Soviet Union. Since invading China, the Japanese [missing character] have used tremendous effort to try to blockade our coastal [missing character], but we have the strength, and we have the methods.

### We Order a Large Number of Aircraft from American Factories to Strengthen Our Air Force - New Contract Established

According to two reliable sources, the news is completely true, and all proceedings may be taking place in China.

[United Press, Chongqing, 30th] Official sources here recently believed that China may be signing a contract with Western countries to purchase aircraft in order to rebuild its air force, and stated that Western countries have come to believe that China can achieve final victory and are therefore willing to provide credit.

### New Paths for Guangdong Politics (3)

— Li Yuzhong

Special Correspondent, Yun Guan

5.  Are People's Organizations Sound?

The advantages of Guangdong's self-defense [missing character] is that it first has universal organization. Some places have also established "Special Task Force Squads" as model basic units. The most obvious wartime self-defense corps have bravely carried out the battle to defend their homeland [missing character] and drive out the Japanese. However, there are still many weaknesses: (1) the leading organs are unsound, and the leaders are not virtuous [missing character]. (2) the organization is not strict, and many organizations exist only in name. (3) the general self-defense corps only take compulsory military training, and political training is particularly lacking. (4) the people regard the self-defense corps as [missing character] soldiers, thinking that participating in the self-defense corps is being a soldier. They do not trust the government. (5) there are many names for the self-defense corps organization, making their responsibilities not specific, causing these weaknesses: 1. It is a draft-style conscription, not political mobilization. 2. The quality and quantity of cadres responsible for military and political training are not enough.

B. How to Reform Guangdong Politics

1. Political Aspect

(1) How to Make Politics Coordinate with Military Affairs

Government Side: (1) It is necessary to show a firm determination to lead the war of resistance to the end, eliminate all wavering elements, and consolidate the anti-Japanese national united front. (2) Implement civil rights during the war of resistance, especially the realization of the program of national construction during the war of resistance, giving the people various freedoms; establish political participation councils at all levels to help and promote the development of the war of resistance movement, and establish the foundation of democratic politics. (3) Eliminate conspiracies in politics, saboteurs who deliberately undermine military-civilian cooperation, and provoke the opposition between the people and the government. (4) Establish organizations for regular liaison between the party, government, military, and public opinion organs. (5) Make good use of educated youth and go deep into rural work. (6) Provide relief, organization, and education to the poor and refugees. (7) Improve the people's lives as much as possible. (8) Eliminate corruption. (9) Strengthen the political education of civil servants. (10) Improve the military service system and gradually abolish the draft method. (11) Eradicate bureaucratic habits.

Military Side: (1) Strengthen the political education of soldiers, especially the establishment of conscious discipline in the army and raise national consciousness. (2) Implement military-civilian agreements, starting from the army. (3) Strengthen the disintegration of Japanese [missing character] puppet work. (4) Reform and enrich military and political education to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance. (5) Increase the status of political workers, establish the prestige of the political department, and wash away the past concept of treating political instructors as peddlers. (6) Political instructors should also be combatants, and military officers should be models of the military's political regulations. (7) Personnel from both the military and political sides need to obtain close [missing character] ties. Military officers must attend political meetings in the troops, and political workers should do the same in military meetings.

People's Side: (1) Sincerely support the government, resist the war to the end, resolutely implement government decrees, and actively participate in the war of resistance work. (2) Practice thrift, actively produce, and enrich the strength of the war of resistance. (3) Maintain rear area security. (4) Automatically eliminate traitors.

(6) Educated youth should automatically go deep into the countryside and play a role as a model of hard work and endurance. (To be continued)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Invites Ambassadors of Three Countries for Talks - Attempts to Adjust Japanese Relations with Three Countries - Hiranuma and Konoe Discuss Internal and External Situations

[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has invited the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to his residence on the 31st for "diplomatic talks." The nature of the talks has not been revealed.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: Yesterday, Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Minister Without Portfolio Konoe. They discussed internal Japanese problems and European problems for a long time. On April 1, when Konoe returns to Tokyo, the two sides will meet again. All parties attach great importance to the talks between Hiranuma and Konoe this time.

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita recently invited the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to hold talks tomorrow. The nature of the talks has not been announced, but all parties attach great importance to them. Some in diplomatic circles believe that Arita may be responding to the note submitted by the ambassadors of the three countries last year regarding the protection of the interests of all countries in China. On the other hand, it is believed that Arita may notify democratic countries that if democratic countries do not provide economic assistance to Japan's development in China, Japan will change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance according to the demands of Germany and Italy.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: The Japanese Ministry of Communications announced that starting April 1, telegrams sent to European and American countries will cost 2 yen and 55 sen per word. From April 1, the price per word will be reduced to 2 yen and 47 sen. The Ministry of Communications will lose about 1 million yen annually due to this price reduction.

[Haitong Agency, 30th, Tokyo] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma told reporters yesterday that the national policy of the Japanese Empire will follow the steps taken by the Konoe Cabinet. Regarding the development of the Anti-Comintern Pact, it is still unable to be announced. Due to differences in personality, Japan does not belong to the democratic group, nor is it a member of the totalitarian state [missing character]. Hiranuma continued, saying that adjusting Japan's relations with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is a difficult problem. Although this problem must be solved, no effective method has been found so far. Regarding the establishment of a puppet central political [missing character] in China, Hiranuma said that Japan must actively prepare, because the provisional governments in both Beiping and Nanjing feel that their power is insufficient. The Japanese Prime Minister also said that the cabinet may be reorganized, with Konoe Fumimaro as minister without portfolio.

### French Prime Minister Broadcasts - Willing to Cooperate with Major Powers - Maintain Peace and Jointly Resist Aggression - Determined Not to Accept Italian Demands

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] "Everyone is wondering whether our country is not threatened and whether our neighbors are reliable," this is the opening statement of French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech here tonight. It is said that it is precisely this state of uncertainty that has led European countries to implement precautionary steps. Treaties have not been signed without purpose, but they have not yet been implemented. Treaties no longer exist, because such treaties may provide protection to one party, but become an obstacle to the other. Those who do nothing feel like accomplices to violence, while those who do something fear provoking violent conflict. As a result, military frenzy everywhere has destroyed all other activities. Under this situation, the more one worries, the deeper the worry becomes. Those who expand their military seek super-special equipment, and the danger of war is imminent. France hopes for peace. At this time of dangerous omens, it has restored its material and spiritual unity. France's solidarity today is unprecedented, and France's determination and strength today are also unprecedented. It still believes that peace can be saved. However, if nothing but war can avoid extinction and humiliation, then the entire French nation will surely leap up and fight to the death to defend freedom. As a result of recent measures, France's economic position has improved and its national defense is as solid as gold. France's recovery has not yet arrived. Yesterday it still felt difficult, but today it has gained four tons of gold in one day. The whole people respond to the government's call with ten thousand valleys responding, and its resolute spirit is as enthusiastic as the glorious history of previous national crises. We will never allow force to dominate international relations, but when justice is extinct, force will inevitably become a responsibility. But a peaceful and powerful France has great confidence in the future. France has always shown goodwill to Germany, but Germany's sudden invasion of Czechoslovakia this time has dealt a great blow to France's peaceful goodwill. The French Prime Minister invited major powers sympathetic to France to cooperate jointly, on the one hand preparing to cooperate to maintain peace, and on the other hand preparing to jointly resist aggression. Daladier finally said: "We absolutely cannot accept Mussolini's argument, because every new plunder will be followed by new demands."

[Reuters, London, 29th] French Prime Minister Daladier gave a broadcast speech in Paris tonight. All necessary [missing character] measures here have been completed to convey the speech in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Arabic. Daladier described the current strength of France as the sole value of the past. The whole country is rich and evenly distributed, supporting the government, and the land is fertile, so there is no need to fear famine. In the vast French colonies all over the world, I felt the enthusiasm for supporting the French government during my tenure as Colonial Minister more than fifteen years ago. The greatness of France lies not only in its strong military power, but also in our spiritual and moral values. Today, our country's strength can be compared with any period in our country's history. We tirelessly pursue human dignity, freedom, and order. All people naturally unite to pursue truth and justice. Now, freedom is called slavery, surrendering to an ideal is called surrender, the desire for life is called despair, and progress represents the destruction of human values. The false service for the safety of the masses is precisely the regression of mankind. France maintains absolute calm in the face of the surrounding harassment and demands, because it knows that negotiation will allow its rights to be clearly expressed, and violent actions against France will be shattered. " Daladier spoke about French-Italian relations in the most frank terms. He recalled the French-Italian agreement of January 7, 1935, in which Italy could obtain certain non-territorial and border rights and economic benefits, and stipulated the status of Italy in Tunisia in 1945, 1955, and 1965. "This agreement has never been questioned. It was not until December 17, 1938, that we received an unexpected notification from Foreign Minister Ciano stating that the Italian side no longer recognized the validity of this agreement. This notification did not detail Italy's demands, nor did it raise the issues of the Suez, Gibraltar, and Tunisia. The main argument of the Italian side is that Italy has acquired new rights since the conquest of Abyssinia. We cannot accept this argument. The significance of this is that every new conquest establishes new rights, and every demand that is satisfactorily answered is followed by future demands. France is now prepared to faithfully implement the 1935 agreement. Within the spirit expressed in this agreement, France will give due consideration to any suggestions. " It is rumored that the 94,000 Italians, 108,000 French, and 2.5 million Muslims in Tunisia are being mistreated, which is untrue. On the contrary, the Italians there enjoy absolute freedom. I believe that my words will have a sympathetic response in friendly countries across the European continent and the Atlantic Ocean, so I can hope that all rational people in the world will listen to these reasonable words. If they can eliminate threats, they will listen to these words, so it is not searching for shame on anyone."

[United Press, Paris, 29th] French Prime Minister Daladier issued a broadcast speech today, stating that the responsibility for resolving the French-Italian dispute lies with the Italian side, and expressing his refusal to make land concessions in the Mediterranean.

[United Press, Rome, 29th] Senior officials of the Fascist Party believe that Daladier's speech has rejected Mussolini's recent speech expressing an attempt to resolve the French-Italian dispute, which is generally considered unexpected.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] All French newspapers, whether extreme left or extreme right, unanimously praised Daladier's speech, believing that the entire France has been united under the leadership of Prime Minister Daladier. "Le Journal" said that Daladier's speech was not only strictly worded, but also had clear and true reasons.

[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 30th] According to today's newspaper opinion, French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech disappointed German political figures. The general public also believes that the "Hamburg Free Press," which is closely related to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that Italian Prime Minister [missing character] Mussolini clarified the current situation in Germany, Zebita, Tunisia, and Suez last Sunday, and said that Italian newspapers will definitely interpret Daladier's speech [missing character] to make Italy's position clear and without doubt. The newspaper also attacked Daladier's so-called German aggressive intentions, and asked the United Kingdom and France to [missing character] rearm and adjust recent events in Central Europe. The newspaper concluded that Daladier may not believe that Europe regards France's natural situation as ordinary, which has been the case for centuries.

[Reuters, London, 30th] The newspapers here today unanimously praised Chamberlain's announcement of doubling troop increases in various locations and [missing character] Daladier's speech. Only the "Daily Mail" expressed opposition to the government relying solely on voluntary recruitment and not adopting conscription. "The Times" said that the people were pleased with the Prime Minister's announcement of increasing troops, which fully proved the unanimous demand of the people. "The Daily Mail" said that the Prime Minister's announcement of increasing troops was not only supported by the people, but also comforting. No step was more timely and appropriate than this. Regarding Daladier's speech, "The Times" said, "His speech fully represents his own determination and that of his country." Other places also unanimously detailed Daladier's firm attitude, believing that this warning is enough to alert aggressors.

### French Scrap Iron: Huge Quantities Shipped to Germany - The Order Newspaper Urges Immediate Prohibition to Prevent its Use in Manufacturing Shells to Return the Favor

[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] The Order newspaper reports that during 1938, an average of 500,000 tons of scrap iron per month was transported from the Lorraine region of France to Germany via the Rhine River. The newspaper claims that Germany could use this scrap iron to manufacture shells to return the favor to France. This action is a long-term act of treason and should be stopped immediately. Otherwise, the Maginot Line may one day be destroyed by German aircraft made from French scrap iron.

### Spanish Civil War Ends: Franco's Troops Enter Valencia - US to Discuss Recognition

[Reuters, London, 29th] A Reuters correspondent reports that the Spanish Civil War has ended today. All towns and cities of the Republican government have surrendered to Franco. The Nationalist forces entered Valencia tonight, just hours after Colonel Casado, a member of the Republican government's National Defense Committee, announced the surrender of the city on the radio. All members of the committee, except General Miaja and Colonel Casado, have been detained in Valencia. Twenty-three Republican government aircraft arrived in Oran today, with General Miaja on board, but there is no news of Casado. News of the surrender of other towns and cities is pouring in like snowflakes. Every few minutes, it can be heard on the radio, with each broadcaster saying in unison, "This city has been taken over by General Franco and the famous Fifth Column of the Nationalist Army." It is reported that the provincial capital, Lérida, and Almería have been completely occupied by General Franco's troops, and the occupation of Jaén has also begun. At the same time, Nationalist troops have completed the encirclement of Madrid. Order has been restored in the city, and public services are operating as usual. A special dispatch from Mussolini congratulates Franco, while Ribbentrop sends a congratulatory telegram to Spanish Foreign Minister General Jordana. Mussolini has ordered the entire country to display flags from dawn to dusk to celebrate the victory of the Nationalist forces.

[Reuters, Burgos, 29th] The Valencia radio station announced today that the city has surrendered to General Franco.

[Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 30th] Franco's vanguard troops have arrived in Valencia. It is reported that Franco has decided to station a large air force there.

[Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 30th] Yesterday, the radio station announced that the surrender of the Republican Army's southern forces indicates the end of the fighting in Andalusia. Currently, the Nationalist forces have smoothly entered the cities of the southern provinces without resistance. The majority of the Communist soldiers have surrendered to the Nationalist forces, while a small number have fled to the coast.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th] According to French newspapers, General Miaja, the former commander of the Spanish government forces, arrived at Oran airport yesterday alone on an aircraft from Valencia. Upon arrival, he was greeted by airport personnel and taken to a bedroom to sleep, as the general had not rested for three days after leaving Madrid. Subsequently, seven Spanish military aircraft arrived, carrying 54 military personnel. General Miaja took a fast train to Algiers last night.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] It is widely believed that before the US government recognizes the Franco government in Spain, it will require the Franco government to guarantee lenient treatment of the defeated government officials.

The French Ambassador to the United States had a long talk with Undersecretary of State Welles, reportedly expressing France's attitude towards Italy.

### Two Giants of Germany and Italy to Hold Meeting

### Eden and Others Suggest National Cabinet - Control Everything, Expand the Military as Much as Possible - Promote a Military Alliance in Eastern Europe - More Than a Hundred Members of Parliament Express Opposition

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Thirty-four members of the House of Commons, including former Foreign Secretary Eden, Conservative Party right-wing leader Churchill, Naval Secretary Cooper, and Conservative Party Sandys, have jointly proposed a motion urging the House of Commons to hold a discussion on this matter as soon as possible. The motion states: "This House, in view of the recurring acts of aggression in Europe, which threaten the British Empire, and the increasing pressure on small countries, considers that the situation has reached an extremely serious stage. Therefore, it believes that only by actively promoting the policies announced by Foreign Secretary Halifax can such threats be dealt with. This House also believes that, due to this situation, Britain should establish a national cabinet, the foundation of which should be as broad as possible. Once the national cabinet is established, it should be given full power to control Britain's industry, wealth, and manpower, so that the country's military expansion can achieve the greatest effect in the shortest period of time." Regarding the content of the military plan proposed by Eden and others, it is understood that (1) the plan also includes the possibility of the invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland; (2) the independence of Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia is threatened, and Britain and France should urge them to form a secret group, so that if one is invaded, the other two can provide assistance; (3) to promote the establishment of an Eastern European alliance, Britain and France should temporarily refrain from making promises, and only after the Eastern European alliance is established can Britain and France provide secret assurances, stating that if the Eastern European group can fulfill its mutual agreement, the Western European alliance can provide assistance; (4) all countries should maintain the most friendly relations with the Soviet Union, but do not want to invite the Soviet Union to participate in any restrictions, but only intend to keep it in a reserved position.

[Reuters, London, 30th] One hundred and eighty members of the House of Commons have jointly signed a motion opposing Eden's proposal, expressing full confidence in the Prime Minister and protesting against the distrust of the Prime Minister and the government.

### British-German Trade Negotiations Halted - Trade Minister's Report - Members of Parliament Cheer

### Bonnet Meets Polish Ambassador - Discusses German and Tense Relations - Poland Decides to Reject German Demands - Germany Builds Pillboxes on Slovak Border

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet had a long conversation with the Polish Ambassador yesterday. Political circles believe that their main discussion was about the tense relations between Germany and Poland and the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Beck to Britain.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 30th] Although officials here deny that Germany has made specific demands to Poland to modify the current status of Danzig and allow passage through the Polish Corridor, it is generally believed that similar conditions were indeed delivered to the Polish Ambassador by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. However, it is understood that Poland has expressed its unwillingness to discuss such demands under the threat of force. Partial mobilization has given Poland confidence to deal with oppression. It is reported that the government is only willing to discuss the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues on the principle of mutual equality.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] According to an unofficial report, Polish Senator Colonel Mieciski stated at a secret meeting that although Germany has not yet made demands on Poland, it is expected to do so soon, and Poland will resolutely reject this demand.

[Reuters, Prague, 29th] Germany is currently building a line of pillboxes in Slovakia, running from north to south across the White Carpathian Mountains, about 50 miles long. This line of pillboxes is intended to protect Austria in the event of an attack from the east by other countries. It is reported that Poland is also stepping up the construction of its line of defenses on the Slovak border.

Poland Will Not Change Its Foreign Policy

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 30th] Yesterday, a semi-official source here replied to a question from the German diplomatic and political newspaper of Tuesday, stating that Poland's foreign policy will not change, and that Poland very much wants to abide by the German-Polish Agreement of 1934. The recent anti-German movements in various places are not related to the Polish government. The authorities believe that the German newspaper's criticism of these movements further proves that Germany also wants to consistently adhere to its past policy towards Poland. It is also said that Poland is not only concerned with domestic affairs, so the Polish people also have reactions to external changes, and a few incidents cannot be considered representative of the whole country. Regarding the Germans within Poland, the Polish authorities believe that the German newspaper's remarks are inevitably excessive. It is also said that in the past few weeks, changes in the external situation and those that Poland cares about are not entirely consistent, so Germany must understand the actions of the Polish people. Finally, whether foreign countries welcome it or not, Poland's foreign policy cannot be restricted by others.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 30th] The Speaker of the Polish Parliament, Sonteski, replied to a question from a leader of the Polish United Party yesterday, stating that Poland will not agree to the annexation of Danzig by Germany, will not agree to the construction of a highway through the Polish "Corridor," and will not agree to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. If anyone proposes this, Poland will say "No." Therefore, it was a secret meeting of party leaders, and the content of the discussion is not known.

German Public Opinion: Jealousy and Intimidation

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th] Although German newspapers have not yet fully published reports of the German-Polish unrest, the German diplomatic and political correspondent said, "In recent days, anti-German unrest has occurred in many places within Poland. From this, it can be seen that Polish elements oppose the principles of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact concluded by General Pilsudski and the German Chancellor in 1934. Hitler disregarded the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and strived to promote German-Polish relations, and repeatedly urged the Germans to understand the importance of Polish independence and at the same time the key to stability in the East. This is why Germany and Poland are friendly. The purpose of the 1934 German-Polish treaty is also this. If Poland now believes that its attitude towards Germany no longer needs to remain the same, in other words, the fundamental interests and honor of the German people no longer need to be taken into account, then the future of European reconciliation will inevitably lead to unfortunate results. As far as Poland itself is concerned, it will also be in danger." The "National Times," which is related to General Goering, also wrote an article on this, saying that the anti-German movement has made the German-Polish friendship treaty lose its value. The newspaper also mentioned that during the mass procession held in Braunberg on Sunday, people shouted "Advance on Danzig." German women and children were threatened on the streets for speaking German. These anti-German behaviors are clearly planned actions, so the Polish authorities cannot pretend not to know. The "Hamburg News Foreign Edition" said that Poland's joining the anti-German group that Britain is trying to form makes it difficult for German-Polish understanding to go hand in hand. Britain's attempt to build a barrier against Germany is most focused on Poland, followed by French-Soviet cooperation. Although Poland has been under pressure from outside, it still maintains its correct attitude towards Germany. It can be seen that its most fundamental reason is that German-Polish understanding does not allow anti-German incitement.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 30th] According to well-informed sources, the close contact between London and Warsaw regarding the issue of the British guarantee of Poland's territorial integrity is progressing very smoothly. It is also said that the British-Polish agreement may be concluded before Polish Foreign Minister Beck arrives in London on the 4th of next month.

### Kalinin's 20th Anniversary of Service

[Central Agency, Moscow, 30th] Tomorrow is the 20th anniversary of the Soviet People's Committee Chairman Kalinin's service to the party and the country. He is 64 years old. For the past 20 years in politics, he has been deeply loved by the people. His contributions to improving rural life and establishing the collective farm system are especially indelible. At the recent Communist Party Congress, Kalinin also gave a speech, detailing the hardship and oppression of Japanese farmers. He was re-elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee Politburo.

### British Prime Minister Announces in the House of Commons: Decided to Increase Local Forces - Military Preparedness to Deal with Dictatorial Ambitions - Adopt Volunteer Enlistment Instead of Conscription

[Reuters, London, 29th] This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the number of local forces has now doubled. "I have previously stated that all aspects of national life, including defense procedures, will be re-examined and considered. I believe the House will recall that the government authorities, based on this attitude, believe that promoting the spirit of voluntary service is essential. Although the number of volunteers for the local forces has exceeded the set amount, they should still not be refused. Therefore, the government authorities have considered the situation and summarized it as follows: (1) The local combat forces, which are currently 140,000 in peacetime, should immediately be increased by 40,000. (2) After this doubling, the total number should reach 340,000. In addition, there are other important decisions, such as increasing supplies, increasing appropriate training personnel, replenishing all weapons and reserves, and maintaining the necessary supplies for the enhanced wartime force. All of this, I think, will be welcome news to you. The above plans are now being implemented step by step, and progress will be reported in the future. However, in order to achieve the above goals in the shortest possible time, greater efforts must be made. I believe that members of the House will be happy to do everything possible to help achieve it." When asked what impact Chamberlain's recently announced plan would have on the number of British troops sent overseas, Chamberlain said that the impact would be that the number of troops sent overseas would also be doubled.

[Associated Press, London, 29th] The British government has now replaced the method of military preparedness to deal with dictatorial aggression, ordering the increase of troops stationed throughout the empire to wartime levels, totaling 340,000. Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons that the troops stationed in various places have tripled due to the enthusiastic volunteering. This increase indicates that Britain can draw large armies for foreign expeditions, currently amounting to 34 divisions, approximately 600,000 men, who can be transferred to France for combat. The War Office previously announced only 19 divisions. Chamberlain said that retired officers and resident soldiers are now being used to be responsible for training reserves. He also stated that the government has now adopted a volunteer enlistment method to replace conscription.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Dominion Minister Inskip declared in the House of Commons today that the government is now considering enacting legislation to allow residents of trust territories to obtain British citizenship. Liberal Party member Mander asked if the government is considering Britain's participation in the French-Soviet agreement. Deputy Secretary Butler replied "No."

[Reuters, London, 29th] During the meeting of the British House of Commons today, British Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to a member of parliament's question, stating that during the recent visit of French President Lebrun to Britain, talks were held among the cabinet ministers of Britain and the representatives of France regarding the implementation of national service obligations in Britain, but he cannot announce the results of those talks to the public at this time.

### Diplomatic Observer Writes Article on the European Situation - Polish Foreign Minister's Visit to Britain is Very Important - Germany Begins Propaganda to Prevent It

[Reuters, London, 30th] A diplomatic observer here wrote an article today stating, "Two important events occurred yesterday: one was the announcement by British Prime Minister Chamberlain to increase the local forces to 340,000, and the other was the broadcast speech by French Prime Minister Daladier, refusing to cede an inch of French territory and give up any rights, and also stating that he is considering any proposals from Italy. After increasing the local forces, Britain will have 26 divisions of local forces (excluding six divisions of regular troops) that can serve overseas. Therefore, in case of need, it can have a strong military force to intervene in the European situation. The authorities believe that there will be a sufficient number of volunteers to recruit soldiers, and there are several officers who can take on command positions. British political circles welcomed Daladier's speech, believing that his words were moderate, but that there could be no compromise on major aspects. In view of this speech and the speech made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last Sunday, there is much hope that Italy's demands, if not excessive, can be resolved. The next important action in European politics is the arrival of Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Britain next week. Germany has begun a propaganda campaign to prevent Beck's trip to London. It is surprising that some of the articles in this campaign have only been given to foreign reporters in Berlin and have not been published in German newspapers. Poland has clearly prepared to respond to this German campaign. Yesterday, Polish newspapers indicated that the government, the Polish party, and the opposition newspapers have expressed a common determination to deal with the German side's attacks, specifically pointing out that Poland's policy has not changed, and that Germany has abolished Syndicalism and adopted European imperialism, which will inevitably cause adverse reactions in Poland."

### Mussolini Tours Southern Italy Yesterday

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 30th] This morning, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini took a special train to Calabria to complete his mission to tour the southernmost part of Italy last autumn. Only two cabinet members and his personal secretary accompanied him. It is reported that the Italian Prime Minister will inspect the coastal cities, first to Belmonte, and then to Cosenza, the provincial capital of Calabria.

Small Commentary

### "The End of the Spanish War"

"The Spanish Civil War has officially ended"!

The capitalist countries have all sent out such telegrams.

The leaders of the aggressive countries, Germany and Italy, have sent congratulatory telegrams one after another.

The Republican army was forced to surrender under the international conspiracy and betrayal of traitors. The Fascist rebel army occupied Madrid and Valencia, and the Spanish war has superficially ended.

However, the superficial and temporary end is not the solution to the Spanish problem.

We do not want to predict another major war in Spain, and we also hope that Spain will unite as a whole from now on, clean up the broken mountains and rivers, eliminate the forces of aggression, and rebuild a free country. Unfortunately, unfounded hopes are just dreams! Just self-deception!

Let's see! Why did the Spanish people resolutely support this anti-fascist and anti-aggression war? Isn't it for the liberation of the Spanish people and the maintenance of world peace? If so, then are the two aggressive devils of Germany and Italy willing to lead and help Franco fight for thirty months in vain and then withdraw from Spain? Can the current Franco regime be regarded as a truly Spanish regime, and can it slightly violate the wishes of its masters, Germany and Italy? Can the Franco regime break away from the manipulation of foreign bourgeois governments and truly seek the independence, freedom, and happiness of Spain and its people? If we cannot confidently answer these questions, then isn't our hope that the Spanish war will truly end a dream?

We firmly believe that the Spanish people are fighting in the past, fighting now, and will continue to fight for the independence, freedom, and happiness of Spain until the traitors, fascists, and aggressive forces are completely eliminated—

We should not only not stand by and watch the tragic betrayal of the Spanish people! We must also remember the lessons of blood and tears of the Spanish experience, beware of traitors, aggressors, and all other conspiracies to compromise and mediate that are prepared to sacrifice our twenty achievements in resisting the war!

In order to cope with the state of emergency, the Hong Kong government specially formulated the British Residents Registration Ordinance through the Attorney General, requiring all British people in Hong Kong, except for Chinese people and active-duty military personnel of the army and navy, and those with special circumstances who are specially exempted by the Governor of Hong Kong, who are between the ages of 18 and 45, to register with the competent authorities, so that they can be conscripted for service in wartime.

### After the Outbreak of War in the Five Counties, Refugees Flocked to Hong Kong and Macau; Jiangmen-Hong Kong Postal and Telegraph Services Stalled, Making News Unclear; Vegetable Supplies Cut Off, Prices Soared

The × army, which invaded Shunde, after capturing Rongqi and Guizhou, immediately advanced towards the Xin'hui county border. The war in the Five Counties thus began yesterday, the 29th. The focus of the war has shifted to Jiangmen, an important town in Xin'hui (see the South China News section for details). Last night, the Taisan and Haojiang ferries arrived in Hong Kong from Macau one after another. According to the ship's staff, due to the disruption of transportation between Jiangmen and Macau, there was no definite news about the battle for Jiangmen. However, due to the tense war situation, passengers transferring from Jiangqi to Macau and then to Hong Kong were extremely crowded. The Taisan ferry carried more than 800 passengers, and the Haojiang ferry carried more than 700 passengers. The crowded situation was rare this year. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the relationship between Jiangmen and Hong Kong has become closer, and there are also many fellow villagers from the Five Counties in Hong Kong. The fellow villagers in Hong Kong care about their hometown and are extremely concerned about the situation there. Various businesses that have traditionally traded with Jiangmen have also sent telegrams to inquire about the situation. Hong Kong society was shocked by this. Yesterday, reporters conducted investigations with various related parties in Hong Kong. According to reports,

Telegraph Difficulties, Postal Stagnation

Regarding telecommunications, the China Telegraph Office is still receiving and sending telegrams to Jiangmen. The reporter inquired with the office at 5:00 PM yesterday. According to the office, Jiangmen (belonging to Xinhui) and Qianshan (belonging to Zhongshan) both have telegraph offices. Communication between Hong Kong and these two places is usually relayed through Shaoguan. The current situation in Jiangmen is not yet known, but the office is still receiving telegrams as usual, but it does not guarantee when or if they will arrive. As for mail from Hong Kong to Jiangmen, it is transshipped through Macau. Yesterday, the Hong Kong Post Office, probably due to the chaotic situation in Jiangmen, suspended the forwarding of mail through Macau. A post office employee told reporters that parcels to Jiangmen were not refused, but were detained at the post office after acceptance and could not be sent.

Vegetable Supply Disrupted, Prices Double

Since the Jiangmen route is inaccessible, the most affected item for Hong Kong residents is vegetables. Hong Kong has a population of nearly one million, and the daily demand for vegetables is very large. A large portion needs to be supplied from the mainland, with about 20-30% supplied by Jiangmen. Therefore, as soon as the news of the suspension of transportation to Jiangmen spread, the market price of vegetables in Hong Kong immediately increased. Normally, it would cost three or four dollars per load, but yesterday it increased to seven or eight dollars per load, doubling the price. Newly produced water spinach, in particular, rose to thirty-five dollars per load. The remaining lowest prices also increased by one-third. Although villagers in various parts of Hong Kong plant vegetables, they are usually not enough to meet the demand. During this period, there is bound to be a greater shortage. If transportation is not restored, not only will there be a risk of further price increases, but it is also feared that it will be impossible to get them on the market at all. The price of freshwater fish has also increased from 40 cents to 60 cents per catty yesterday, due to the gradual decrease in supply.

### Two Major British and French Liners Collide in Fog Outside Hong Kong; The French Liner "Guangdong" Has a Hole and is Taking on Water, but Fortunately, It is Not Seriously Damaged; The "Chaffee" is Slightly Damaged and Also Returns to Hong Kong

The French liner "Guangdong", from the Iron Shipping Company sailing from Shanghai to the south, and the French mail ship "General Chaffee", which was going north from Hong Kong, collided at about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, about 130 miles from Hong Kong, at Suibo Point between Hong Kong and Shantou, due to fog. Shortly afterwards, Hong Kong received telegrams from both ships reporting that the "Guangdong" was taking on water in the middle and was more seriously damaged than the French mail ship, but fortunately it was not seriously damaged. After the incident, it was still able to come to Hong Kong on its own and is expected to arrive last night or this morning. The "Chaffee" also returned to Hong Kong and is scheduled to enter the dock for inspection. The French mail ship that had the accident weighed 13,000 tons and carried 167 passengers. French Ambassador to China, Gossamer, happened to be on board to Shanghai. It is unknown whether there is a need to enter the dock after the incident, and it will only be known after arriving in Hong Kong. The British mail ship weighed 16,000 tons and was one of the fastest new ships built by the Iron Shipping Company. It first came east in November last year for its maiden voyage. It is not known how severe the injury is this time. It is said that there are three holes. After arriving in Hong Kong, it is necessary to enter the dock for repairs for three or four days. For this reason, the Iron Shipping Company specially ordered the Zhiduo, which was scheduled to open to Shanghai yesterday, to remain in Hong Kong temporarily. After the "Guangdong" arrives in Hong Kong, see how many days it will take to enter the dock, and if it is believed that the injury is too serious and cannot be repaired in three or four days, then the Zhiduo will stop going to Shanghai and Japan, and carry the passengers of the "Guangdong" back to Europe, and the "Guangdong" will go to Shanghai and Japan for it.

### Three Magistrates Robbed One After Another; Magistrate Fu and Magistrate He Lost Before; Magistrate Yi Was Also Patronized Yesterday

The arrogance of bandits in Hong Kong has indeed reached an alarming level. Among the three magistrates of the Central Patrol Office, Magistrate Fu and Magistrate He have been patronized one after another, and yesterday Magistrate Yi was also patronized. According to Magistrate Yi's report to the police station yesterday, the bandits took his clothes from his car, worth about twenty-five yuan. At that time, the car was parked on Barker Road on the Peak.

### Robbery and Theft Are Rampant in Hong Kong and Kowloon; Baledro and Luo Xuhe Met Yesterday to Discuss Countermeasures; Preparing to Increase Police Officers to Maintain Public Security

Robbery and theft have become rampant in Hong Kong recently. Hardly a day goes by without robbery or looting on the road. It seems that it has gradually been proven that a large group of organized thieves is hiding in Hong Kong. Since the news of the gang's attempt to rob a wealthy family on Prince Edward Road in Kowloon was published, people have felt quite terrified, and the robbers are now getting more and more fierce. A robbery even took place in front of the police dormitory the other day, which is shocking. According to reporters, the Hong Kong government has ordered the police authorities to strictly search and arrest these lawless thieves. Yesterday morning, the acting police chief Baledro and the Legislative Council member Sir Luo Xu discussed the issue of arresting thieves and ensuring public security. In the afternoon, Sir Luo met with reporters. He said that the number of people in Hong Kong has increased greatly recently, and there are both good and bad people. Robbery cases will naturally increase. I understand that the police superintendent is extremely concerned about this matter and is trying to deal with it. The government is also considering increasing the police force to maintain public security. It is also understood that the number of police officers stationed in Hong Kong seems to be unable to adapt to the actual needs, which is what the general public feels at present, so that thieves are unscrupulous. It is a common fact that the police officers arrive long after the police whistle has been sounded.

### The Hong Kong Automobile Association Asks the Authorities to Plan to Build Three-Dimensional and Tunnel Parking Lots; Tunnel Parking Lots Can Be Used for Both Parking and Air Defense

At the annual meeting of the Hong Kong Automobile Association the other day, Chairman Balingmei said in his speech that the parking lots in the Central District are extremely crowded due to the sharp increase in automobiles. There should be an ideal parking lot plan to remedy this. One plan is to build a four- or five-story high-rise building in the Central District, parking cars on each floor. The building is equipped with giant elevators for transportation up and down. Plan two is also to build a five-story high-rise building, but instead of using elevators to transport cars, there is a ramp around the building leading to each floor, and cars go up and down the ramp. These two plans are for the design of three-dimensional parking lots. This method has long been implemented in England. Hong Kong has not yet seen it due to environmental reasons. Of course, private individuals cannot afford to carry out this kind of equipment, so it is best for the government to do it and hand it over to the Association for management. The problem of crowded parking lots at present needs to be resolved urgently, and we should not underestimate this social undertaking. There is also a third plan, which is to equip a tunnel parking lot and open up a mountainside parking lot. This plan is favored by the Air Defense Commissioner, Shi Dilubojian. Because it can be used for parking in peacetime, and can also be used as an air-raid shelter in emergencies. If this plan can be completed, all the difficulties in parking cars can be solved. The chairman now hopes that all committee members will work hard to cooperate with the government to achieve the ideal parking lot plan.

### The Hong Kong Prison Report is Published; All Prisons Suffer from Overcrowding; The Number of Male and Female Prisoners Reaches More Than 4,300; The Prison System Has Not Yet Reached the Standard

The Hong Kong 1938 Prison Officer's Report was published in the Legislative Council meeting yesterday afternoon. According to the Prison Officer's opinion, although the Hong Kong prison system has improved compared to the past, it has not yet reached the standard to meet the current needs. If it is to be as perfect as in the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire, a large amount of funding is necessary. The report briefly stated:

Prisoner Statistics

The Hong Kong Victoria Men's Prison was abolished in 1937. Since 1938, there have been only two prisons in Hong Kong, one is the Stanley Men's Prison and the other is the Lai Chi Kok Women's Prison. When the male prisoners of the Victoria Prison and the Lai Chi Kok Prison moved to Stanley, there were a total of 2,215 people. The number increased to 1,757 in November 1937. On January 1 last year, there were a total of 2,339 prisoners in the Stanley Men's Prison, including 18 Westerners, 8 Indians, and 2,313 Chinese. The highest number recorded was 2,908 on December 23. The number on December 31 was 2,844. The Lai Chi Kok Women's Prison had a total of 2,001 people last year.

Implementation of Labor

Both men's and women's prisons are currently overcrowded. The previous plan of one prisoner per room has failed and has now become three prisoners per room. A plan was proposed again in August last year to reform the prison system and reduce the number of prisoners. Part of this plan was approved by the government in October and is scheduled to be implemented within the year. The men's prison plans to implement prisoner labor, which will not only reduce the number of prisoners, but also allow prisoners to engage in productive work. The women's prison plans to build more prison cells, but it has not been able to proceed due to lack of funding.

The issue of fresh milk disinfection was passed by the Hong Kong Municipal Health Bureau and was initially scheduled to be implemented on January 1 this year. Later, some fresh milk companies failed to purchase disinfection machines in time, and the location where the machines were installed had to be inspected by the Health Bureau and approved before they could be set up. Therefore, the authorities postponed the date of implementation until tomorrow (April 1).

Outstanding Sons and Daughters of the Chinese Nation: Interview with Jinshan and Wang Ying

Wang Ying's Touching Words

After the other guests who interviewed them left, Mr. and Mrs. Jin Lin invited the reporter from the reception room to their room, which was also their temporary office, to meet Ms. Wang Ying.

We have long admired Ms. Wang Ying, who "jumped out of the dark film circle" to study in Japan. She is not only a star, but also a progressive new woman. Over the years, she has worked hard under the artillery fire of the × army and has deserved to be a fighter for national liberation. Meeting her, from her attitude and expression, even more shows that the soul of the Chinese nation is entrusted to these outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.

After the introduction, Ms. Wang enthusiastically, gently, sincerely, and optimistically told the reporter:

"China's progress is really fast! If it weren't for the war of resistance, 30 or 40 years would not have been able to exchange for this unprecedented progress!"

Ms. Wang opened the conversation softly and kindly, not deliberately emphasizing it like a propagandist, but with the true and reliable evidence of personal experience:

That is really rare! There are many young people serving in the army, they overcome their past comfortable living habits, their clothes are very casual, and their diet is very simple. All that occupies their minds is the revival of the motherland, and there is not a moment of rest in their lives.

Ms. Wang said more energetically:

"The phenomenon of the army and the people becoming one is also becoming more and more inspiring. The people give up their rooms for the army to live in, and also do all kinds of work for them. Young men and women, or old women, children go to the army to see them, help them, and live with them, it's simply like a family.

"I remember it was in the place of Xinjian'ao, where the old forces of the landlord and gentry class were very strong. When we started our work, we sincerely said to them: We will not do things that you disagree with. We are here to serve the people and have no prejudice whatsoever. The landlords looked at our work plan, sympathized with us, and allowed the villagers to watch our plays. Thousands of people poured in from all over the countryside at once. They watched the plays with fascination and became addicted, so they carried white rice from their homes. After watching the plays, they cooked rice in the open space where the plays were performed. They even slept in front of the stage at night, and some slept under the stage. They were very moved after performing like this for several nights in a row. One landlord voluntarily went on stage to give a speech, and the progress in his attitude was really beyond our expectations. After watching the plays, many people questioned us: Are these things you are acting really true? Or are they fake? So we showed them pictures of the × army raping, looting, bombing, and robbing. Some women covered their eyes and did not want to watch anymore, and they all cursed: How can there be such unconscionable ×××× in the world? If they come, will we still be polite to them? We must fight them to the death."

——The reporter was deeply moved when he heard this. A look of satisfaction was still etched between Ms. Wang's lips and eyebrows. She said eloquently:

"We seized this opportunity, put on clothes like the common people, and went to visit them separately. We harvested rice for them, helped them wash clothes, and naturally propagated to them from their real lives. The people are really lovely! If we hadn't gone to the front lines and deep into the remote countryside, we wouldn't have been able to understand the real China, and we wouldn't have been able to be sure that China has a glorious future, and that final victory is beyond doubt." ——Their firm beliefs and work attitude are really worthy of emulation by general salvation workers.

"Wherever we passed, the × army chased after us. When the sound of cannons in Xinjian'ao was getting closer and closer, we left to work elsewhere. Although the area was lost, the people and the Self-Defense Army rose up together to fight guerrilla warfare, and the results were very good. The big landlords have land and fields, and once they are occupied, they are as poor as ordinary people, so the landlords and peasants closely unite and fight the × army desperately, causing a major threat to the × army.

"The war of resistance is indeed a rebirth on one side and destruction on the other. All corrupt and backward systems and people are being eliminated in the artillery fire!

Ms. Wang said here, emphasizing her tone and becoming particularly excited. The reporter also responded with a knowing smile.

"We have been running around for more than a year, and we feel that we have made a lot of progress ourselves. We are very happy and very optimistic."

After listening to Ms. Wang's touching words, we were more ashamed of our own work and our own lives in the progress of our motherland. We are still far away from the sacred war of resistance in our motherland.

It is said that the cultural and drama circles in Hong Kong will hold a warm welcome meeting to express their sincere congratulations and to communicate the cultural exchanges between the group at home and abroad. The reporter also wants to send a message to the aspiring young men and women in Hong Kong to get close to them and learn from them, which is a great opportunity for self-absorption and learning (End)

### YWCA Lecture; Mr. Jin Zhonghua Speaks on "New Hopes in the Current World Situation"; Ms. Wang Ying Will Be Invited to Speak Next Week

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Hong Kong YWCA holds academic lectures every Thursday. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, Mr. Jin Zhonghua, editor-in-chief of World Knowledge and Sing Tao Daily, was invited to speak on "New Hopes in the Current World Situation." Ms. Liang Shude translated it into Cantonese. He explained thoroughly the hopes for new forces in the war of resistance, the hopes for new awakenings, and the hopes for the unity of democratic countries and peace-loving people to sanction the forces of aggression. He said that the elimination of aggressive countries and the coming of freedom and equality are the inevitability of evolution, and we must still add human power to promote their early realization. Clearing up the pessimistic tone of defeatists is also the current task. The listeners were very inspired by his eloquent exposition. After the lecture, the listeners were free to ask questions, and Mr. Jin answered them sincerely. The atmosphere of exploring learning was very intense. After the meeting, more than a dozen students from the Zhenguang Girls' High School asked Mr. Jin to answer their questions again. Their spirit of thirst for knowledge is commendable. It is heard that the YWCA will next invite Ms. Wang Ying, a progressive film and drama artist who has just arrived in Hong Kong from the mainland, to speak about her experience serving on the front lines. It is expected that young men and women in Hong Kong will definitely go to listen to the lecture enthusiastically at that time.

### Hong Kong News in Brief

The White Star Line's round-the-world giant liner Franconia arrived in Hong Kong at 7:00 AM yesterday and berthed at Pier 5 of Kowloon Wharf. It will stay in Hong Kong for two days and then depart for the United States. The ship weighs 20,000 tons and has seven floors, with luxurious facilities that are no less than those of the British Queen, which came to Hong Kong a month ago. This time, there are 230 passengers, mostly European and American wealthy people.

In order to promote Sino-American culture and strengthen friendly relations, the Sino-American Cultural Association was recently established in Chongqing. Many celebrities from China and the United States participated. There is also a move to form a branch here, initiated by Soong Ching Ling, Zhu Shaoping, and others. Many celebrities from China and the United States have joined. Once the list of initiators is compiled, it can be submitted to the General Association for approval and establishment, which can be realized in the short term.

On the 29th of this month, a tragic incident occurred near the Cheklap Kok lighthouse in Hong Kong's territorial waters, in which a fishing boat was sunk by a merchant ship and three young children drowned. After the accident, the merchant ship left without even looking back. The boat owner drifted on the sea surface and was later rescued by the fishing boat No. 4247. Yesterday, he returned to Hong Kong and reported the circumstances of the ship's collision to the police station and the Fishermen's Progressive Association.

The Hong Kong Student Relief Committee was established last year. Since its establishment under the chairmanship of Dr. Fu Shanglin, it has assisted more than 200 students in returning to China to resume classes. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00, the committee held a special meeting on the second floor of the Shengsi Hotel to report everything to the education circles in Hong Kong. Those who attended included Fu Shanglin (chairman), treasurer Bishop He Minghua, and representative Xu Shiying and dozens of guests.

The owners of rickshaws that travel in various districts of the peninsula have increased the daily rent of rickshaws from over sixty cents to seventy-four cents since the owners transferred the rickshaws to agents. The rickshaw drivers have requested the owners, the police traffic department, and the Chinese People's Office to maintain the original rent. The traffic department has ordered the rickshaw owners not to transfer the rickshaws to agents from April 1 (tomorrow) and to manage them themselves.

### A Heroic Page of Jiangmen: Large-Scale Invasion by × Land, Sea, and Air; Fierce Battle for Control, We Regain Possession; Our Troops Fight Bravely in Several Melee Encounters with ×; Heavy Losses on Both Sides, Casualties Equal

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After × resolved to invade Jiangmen, × planes frantically bombed Jiangmen all day on the 28th. On the morning of the 29th, × warships bombarded the Jiangwei area. At 1:15 PM, over 500 × soldiers, under the cover of × warship artillery, charged towards Beijie. Our troops fought bravely, engaging in fierce battle for several hours. The enemy forces became exhausted, and our troops vigorously advanced, finally driving out the stubborn ×. By 6:00 PM, our troops had completely recovered the area. On the morning of the 30th, × warships again heavily bombarded Jiangwei. Under the cover of superior firepower, most of the × army charged fiercely towards Beijie again. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in the Guangdong resistance war. To avoid excessive sacrifice, our side temporarily withdrew to the rear at 2:00 PM to prepare for a more vigorous counterattack, it is said.

Forces Returning from All Directions Drive × Out of the City

[Macau Express News] On the 29th, × troops attacked Jiangmen in four ways by land and water, occupying Baigaijiao, Zhutoushan, Dongmaning and other places in the Xinhui-affiliated Waihai area. The various units of our Fifth Guerrilla Zone, the Xinshun Special Task Force, the Jiangfang Command of Zhu Keqin, and a part of the Guangzhou Guerrilla Mobile Unit, fought bravely, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The battle continued until 3:00 PM, when the × army resumed its full-scale advance, sending 28 planes to bomb Jiangmen, dropping dozens of bombs. The sound of explosions mixed with the sounds of cannons and battle cries, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. Our troops bravely held their ground, but due to excessive casualties, they had to retreat slightly. A part of the × army entered Jiangmen city, but our troops continued street fighting. Each demolition squad was instructed to immediately destroy all buildings and set fires in various locations if the city could not be held. Although a part of the × army entered the city, they did not expect our troops to fight even more fiercely, charging back and forth. Because of the chaotic battle, × planes could not effectively deploy their firepower. Our district teams leaped into melee combat several times. Around 6:00 PM, the special task force and the Fourth Detachment, rushing to Zengshan for reinforcements, heard the alarm and returned to their posts. In addition, a part of Yuan's forces from Zhongshan arrived from Muzhou and immediately joined forces to fight the ×, advancing one after another. Finally, relying on the bravery of the soldiers, all the × were driven out of the city. The Fifth Detachment divided its forces to encircle the area near Beijie. The × retreated hastily towards Chaolian Waihai and other places. Our troops pursued closely. Most of the × engaged in a standoff with us between Baigaijiao and Zhutoushan. The two armies fought into the night, and the sound of gunfire never ceased.

× Reinforcements Invade Jiangmen Again

Unexpectedly, on the 30th, taking advantage of the heavy fog, × sent out several armored steamboats, rushing to Gubu, carrying 500 to 600 × soldiers and ammunition. Small wooden boats attached to the steamboats landed from Beijiao and Haideng, adding to the forces, and advanced in four ways. Around 11:00 AM, × sent more than a dozen planes to bomb Jiangmen, dropping dozens of bombs, including incendiary bombs, while covering the infantry's advance. Our troops held their ground and refused to retreat. Li Wuzi, Zhou Hanling, and Zhu Keqin personally commanded from the front lines, fighting fiercely with the × until 1:45 PM. The × focused their flat-trajectory fire on the front of the East Battery, causing heavy casualties to our troops. The × also suffered considerable casualties. For strategic reasons, our army retreated again, and Jiangmen city was recaptured. However, our troops continued to engage in mixed battles with the × in the areas outside the city, such as Fanluogang, Yuangang, and Zini Township. The people were determined not to give up until the × were driven out. The battle was fierce, making it one of the most heroic pages in the South China war. At the same time, because × had to divert forces to deal with Jiangmen and the Zhongshan area, the overall situation was slightly eased, it is said.

### The × Forces in Panyu Cannot Advance; Our Troops Become Increasingly Active; Our Troops Attack Lianhua Rock, × and Puppet Maintainers Disintegrate

[Panyu Express News] The × army occupying Panyu has exhausted all means to try to restore order, but so far it has not been restored, while our troops are becoming increasingly active. Yesterday, on the 23rd, one of our units attacked the × at Lianhua Mountain, and carried away all the stored food and weapons. The details of the situation are recorded below.

Puppet Maintenance Associations Disintegrate One After Another

To promote puppet government and eliminate the will of our people to resist, the × chieftain in Panyu has recently implemented the insidious plan of "using Chinese to control Chinese," inciting the puppet magistrate of the county, Mr. Li, to force all villages to establish local maintenance associations within a time limit, collect military pay, and force the people to obtain "good citizen certificates" to prevent the activities of our guerrilla troops. If guerrilla activity is discovered in an area, the maintenance association in that area will be held responsible. As a result, personnel of the original puppet organizations are fleeing one after another, and the various puppet organizations are disintegrating. Currently, only Xinzao, Shiqiao, Dalong, Chishan, and other villages have established maintenance associations, but none of the associations have anyone in charge, so order in the villages cannot be maintained.

Second District Incorporates Panyu Bandits

Commander Wu Guanhong of the Second District Guerrilla Column believes that bandits have been rampant in the villages south of Panyu recently. After analyzing the reasons, he concluded that it was caused by the environment, and that they should be quickly incorporated to enhance our guerrilla resistance forces. He specially appointed Deputy Commander and County Magistrate Li Shuzong to lead the Guerrilla XX and other teams to the area south of Panyu to carry out the incorporation and to protect the spring plowing of farmers in the sandy fields in the villages to maintain the people's food supply. It is reported that Mr. Li has arrived at a certain place and is preparing to lead his troops to the destination area to be responsible for maintaining order, incorporating bandits, and protecting spring plowing.

× Food and Weapons at Lianhua Rock Seized

Furthermore, Panyu's Lianhua Rock is located on the west bank of Humen Neiyang. The southern part of the mountain has a stone cave that is quite deep and wide. Since the × bandits occupied Panyu, they used the nearby Yanghai area to store food and weapons in the cave to supply the × soldiers stationed in Shilou, Daling, Mingjing and other villages. Recently, our troops lurking in Lingtang Village in the northern part of the mountain learned of this and sent dozens of capable team members disguised as farmers under the pretense of working to launch an attack on the 23rd of this month. It happened to be the market day in Shilou Village, and all the × soldiers guarding the cave had gone to patrol the market, leaving only a dozen × soldiers to guard it. Our troops, seeing that the opportunity had come, first surrounded the cave and then sent another group to rush into it. There were more than a dozen × soldiers guarding the cave at the time. Our troops took them by surprise and bombarded them with hand grenades. At the sound of the explosions, more than a dozen × soldiers fell to the ground and died. Our troops then calmly moved all the food and weapons in the cave. Around 4:00 PM, the × soldiers finished patrolling the market and discovered what had happened, but all the food and weapons had been taken away, resulting in considerable losses, it is said.

### Our Planes Display Power in Continuous Strikes; Bombing Guangzhou × Positions; Destroying Baiyun and Tianhe Airports

[Guangzhou Correspondence] Since our new air force was ordered to assist the various counter-offensive units of the Fourth War Area in annihilating the ×, it has repeatedly annihilated stubborn ×. From the 8th to the 27th of this month, our planes went to Guangzhou every day to bomb × positions. The 24th and 25th were particularly effective. On the 24th, as soon as it dawned, a fleet of ten of our planes flew to the suburbs of the city to conduct reconnaissance. At that time, the Guangzhou × army, caught off guard by the sudden arrival of our planes, did not have time to sound the alarm and fired frantically with anti-aircraft guns. However, our brave eagles soared freely, selected their targets, and continuously dropped more than 20 heavy bombs on the Baiyun and Tianhe airports in the suburbs. Soon, × planes rushed from overseas to intercept our planes, but our planes had safely returned to base. As a result of this bombing, in addition to the destruction of the Tianhe and Baiyun airports, six or seven × planes were also destroyed.

### The Rapacious × Planes at Seven Star Rock

[Zhaoqing Correspondence] Zhaoqing's Seven Star Rock, north of the city, has towering mountains and rocks and deep caves, making it ideal for citizens to take refuge. The Guanyin Rock cave in particular is very large, large enough to accommodate more than 2,300 people. The Zhaoqing authorities had long ago equipped it as a shelter for citizens to prevent × plane attacks. Whenever an alarm sounded, the residents of Zhaoqing City and the surrounding areas rushed into the caves. Unexpectedly, on the 26th and 27th of March, × planes flew continuously over Zhaoqing, indiscriminately dropping more than a dozen bombs on Seven Star Rock. The loud explosions shook the mountains and valleys, blasting more than a dozen large stones from the top of Guanyin Rock, which fell down next to the entrance of the cave. Each stone weighed more than a thousand catties, which shows the power of the explosions. However, thousands of civilians taking refuge inside the cave suffered no losses. Although the × frantically bombed our civilians, the result was merely a waste of ammunition.

### × Cruelty to Traitorous Troops in Xicun; Taiwanese and Koreans Rebel Against the War; × Kills Another Captain in Xiajiao

[Nanhai Express News] The Taiwanese and Korean × soldiers in Shi... Tao Shi... , because of harsh × treatment and unpaid salaries, mutinied, stabbing the × regimental commander and the × second lieutenant in charge of salaries. More than 80 people were arrested by the × military police, and the ringleaders were executed. Details have been reported in the newspapers. Recently, it was learned that the Taiwanese and Korean × soldiers in Leigang, Xiajiao, Yanbu, Shiwan, Lanshi and other places were dissatisfied with the × chieftain's handling of the Shiwan incident, extremely angry, and secretly plotting to rebel against the war. The atmosphere is extremely tense. On the 24th of this month, more than a dozen soldiers of Dong nationality stationed in... × army, had an argument with the × 12th Regimental Commander Kawaki Harano for failing to receive their salaries, which turned into violence. Kawaki Harano was outnumbered and was stabbed in the abdomen with a spear by a Shandong soldier, and died from his serious wounds. The dozen or so Shandong soldiers knew that they had caused a death and could not escape, so they disguised themselves and fled to surrender to our guerrilla forces. The Foshan × chieftain is extremely anxious about the anti-war incident of the ten platoons of soldiers, but there is no way to stop it, it is said.

China Travel Service Q&A Column

### To Chongqing Answer to Mr. Xu Shaowen

Question: Regarding traveling to Chongqing via Haiphong: 1. What are the procedures for obtaining a passport in Hong Kong? How much does it cost? Can your company obtain it on my behalf? Can a photo of six or seven people be taken together?

2. What is the lowest ship fare from Hong Kong to Haiphong?

3. I heard that there are many difficulties when landing in Haiphong, such as baggage inspection, item declaration, and various other problems. Is this true?

4. Regarding Vietnamese epidemic prevention regulations, is it necessary to have an official doctor's certificate proving that you have been vaccinated or inoculated with cowpox in order to land? Can you land if you have been vaccinated but do not have a doctor's certificate?

5. I heard that a head tax is required when landing. I don't know how much it is or if there is an age limit. Do transit passengers also have to pay?

6. How much is the train fare from Haiphong to Kunming? What are the conditions for food and lodging along the way? How much is the train fare from Kunming to Chongqing?

7. Regarding the route via Shantou and Shaoguan to Chongqing, which province and highway is the fastest? How much is the fare? Is the cost cheaper than going via Haiphong?

Answer:

(1) A transit visa can be obtained from the Consular Affairs Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong. Attach two personal photos. If it is a family, they can be taken in one photo. Servants should have a separate photo. The visa fee is 8 Hong Kong dollars, and the French consulate visa fee is 1 Hong Kong dollar.

(6) The lowest train fare from Haiphong to Kunming is 14.6 Vietnamese dollars. Food and lodging along the way will cost about ten dollars. The car fare from Kunming to Chongqing is 29.5 national currency. (7) The cost of this route is unknown.

### Maritime Special News

Since the beginning of spring, dense fog has frequently shrouded the ports, so the ships arriving in Hong Kong recently have often been delayed. Unexpectedly, this morning, the port authorities received news that the Guangzhou (CANTON) of the Yihang Shipping Company was coming to Hong Kong from Shanghai. When sailing to the sea 110 miles outside the port, it encountered fog and lost its way. Captain Jacques deliberately reduced speed to a minimum. Unexpectedly, when sailing to 22.41 degrees north latitude and 116.18 degrees east longitude, it suddenly collided with the French mail ship Marshal Joffre (MARECHALJOFFRE). Fortunately, both ships were sailing slowly at the time, so there was no major damage. For safety reasons, the French mail ship immediately turned around and returned to one port for inspection. After the Guangzhou ship arrives in Hong Kong, it must be docked for repairs before it can continue sailing. It is said that the two ships were blocked by thick smoke and were only able to enter the port this morning.

### Daliang After the Fall

— Shao Min

In order to report on the news from the occupied areas and investigate the situation of our compatriots, I decided to run to Daliang, Shunde, which had not been occupied for long.

Early in the morning of the 26th of this month, I hurriedly prepared my disguise and carefully checked my belongings, always adhering to the principle of not letting the × people recognize me as a reporter. I felt a little different, but my steps when I set off were particularly relaxed. In order to avoid the suspicion of the × people, I chartered a small lotus-picking boat from Bailian City. The boat then carried me, an old bumpkin, across Shatou, and I braced myself and steered towards the shore. "Halt!" A × soldier came over to interrogate me. Fortunately, the old bumpkin pretended to be respectful and sneaked through the first gate.

Walking along the Zhongshun Highway, I marched forward. Except for me and three or five listless × sentries, I couldn't find a single other person on the highway. After walking for an hour, I finally arrived in Daliang city. Because I didn't have a good citizen certificate, I went through a lot of difficulties and insults. However, the compatriots in the occupied areas that I saw in Daliang suffered even more severe insults than I did. This is not self-consolation, but a message to all compatriots across the country.

Jiangben, Harada, and Fukuda, these three × troops, occupy different sections, which are the areas where × people collect taxes on smoking and gambling. Jiangben's troops occupy Liao Xinshi's residence near the public ... Harada's troops occupy the Shatou ... factory, and Fukuda's troops occupy the county government. The puppet association chairman is Liang Tianlu, and the vice-chairmen are Su XX and Chen XX. The puppet self-defense corps is still composed of those traitorous puppet police corps members who led the ×, renamed the Daliang Self-Defense Corps.

In reality, Daliang has truly become a dead city since it was occupied. All the shops are closed and have stopped buying and selling. Nine out of ten households have been emptied. The only remaining shops are food shops that are forced to operate, and naturally occurring opium dens and gambling houses. Apart from × soldiers and undesirable elements - opium addicts - gamblers, perhaps less than one-tenth of the people are law-abiding citizens.

In the early morning of the 27th, a noisy crowd created a commotion. At the time, I thought the × soldiers had caused some trouble. Later, after some investigation, I learned that the × soldiers were setting off to attack Rongqi and Guizhou. Hearing this news, I tried several times to escape back to Rongqi to provide our troops with detailed intelligence, but the dense fog blocked all routes. Moreover, the × people's attack on Ronggui was launched in five ways, from Bailian City, Da'ao, Mentou, Gang, and Nansha, so none of the routes were passable and I could not complete my mission. This is a most regrettable thing.

At 11:00 AM, I heard in Daliang that our troops had retreated to Ronggui, but were still engaged in mixed battles with the ×, waiting for reinforcements to arrive, and would immediately launch a counter-offensive against the ×. At this time, I thought my mission had come to an end. No matter how difficult, I had to leave this occupied area in a short period of time and continue my anti-Japanese propaganda work. So I turned around behind Majiang, along the mulberry fish ponds, transferred from Nansha to Dongximaning, and after a whole day and night of nonstop walking, I arrived at Xiaolan, our military defense area.

Because the reporter's mission this time, in addition to conducting an on-the-spot survey of the news in Daliang, also included conducting an investigation for the cadres of the First District Separate Action Corps, there is less news reporting and more intelligence reporting, in order to directly help the war of resistance. Now the reporter has decided to throw away the pen and take up the gun to fight the × people. Arise, those who do not want to be slaves!

### The World's Highest-Paid Female Star: Gracie Fields

Who is the highest-paid actress in Hollywood? Is it Norma Shearer? Is it Garbo? Or is it even Deanna Durbin or Shirley Temple?... Not at all. It is someone who is well-known in Britain but still a new name in America - Gracie Fields.

"At that time, we were dirt poor, penniless, poorer than a church mouse - maybe even worse - so at the age of six, I had the idea of going out to earn a few pennies to help the family. I decided to sing on the street in the highest note of my six-year-old voice, thinking that passersby would be moved by my singing and throw a few pennies into my hat. But it wasn't quite like that. I seemed to have a little too much confidence in my own musical talent. People who heard me sing just looked at me contemptuously. Disheartened, I went home."

These are the words of Gracie Fields, who is now the highest-paid actress in the world. For seventeen years, she has held the highest star position in the British Empire, and also has a large number of audiences in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Norway, and Sweden.

She, a poor girl from a small mill town, was also honored by the British King and Queen to perform for them many times on the radio or on stage.

Because she came from a poor background, even though she is now famous and rich, she is still honest and open, and never feels ashamed of her past poverty. She is a performer with a good character.

"My mother was a washerwoman at the theater in Lancashire," she confessed candidly at a luncheon after signing a contract with 20th Century Fox - a contract stipulating that she could alternate filming in both Britain and the United States - "I often went with her when she brought the washed clothes. Gradually, I learned a few tunes backstage and practiced them at home, singing at the top of my lungs, disturbing the whole family. At the age of eight, I actually did pretty well and became a little singer in a movie theater. A month later, I quit this job and joined a children's performance group. The pay? Incredibly meager - one shilling a week."

"When I was fifteen, I went to join a musical revue, but unfortunately, the manager only glanced at me and deemed me unqualified. My heart was broken, thinking that I had lost the greatest opportunity to perform on stage. At this time, the family's financial situation actually improved slightly. My father wrote to me, saying that he didn't want me to be on stage and hoped that I could return to the Stanseville spinning mill to work. He also said that it couldn't be called a profession, but it was at least better than me trying to be a performer and starving to death. I agreed with great joy, because I hadn't eaten three meals at that point."

"When I got there, it was indeed as my father said, this job couldn't be considered a profession. The working hours were long and the pay was low. I still hadn't given up my desire to perform and sing, and I often sang loudly during work hours. When I sang, the other workers put down their work to listen quietly. They liked to hear me sing, and I was very happy, but the factory was greatly affected by me, and the work was delayed. So before long, the factory stopped my pay. In other words, I was fired again."

At this point, Hares Pyle brought his little daughter over to take a photo with her, interrupting her story. Hares said many admiring things to her, calling her the world's greatest comedian. After Hares left, 20th Century Fox star Virginia Fields came over and greeted her, and they talked very warmly for a while.

"My first real stage profession," he said, after Virginia left, "was in 1914, playing Princess Morocco in a pantomime, 'Dick Whittington.' Later, I got a good role in 'Mr. Bohrer of London.' The script was excellent and was later introduced to London and became a well-known play."

Gracie is very humble and does not attribute this success to herself, but we can see that this time she was successful not only in London, but also everywhere, and since then, she has become one of the most famous actresses in the British Empire, to this day.

After her career was successful, she married Archie Pitts, a renowned producer. Under his training and guidance, she further reached the pinnacle of her career.

"Sometimes," she said, "I perform six shows a day, three at one place and three at another. It's a little busy, but it's very interesting, and because so many people want to see me, I always try to greet them backstage."

Even now, she is still the same.

The name Gracie Fields is often mentioned in the same breath as Charlie Chaplin. This is for good reason. Just like Chaplin, she makes people feel a touch of bitterness and tears amid the laughter. Half of her plays are pantomime and half are talking, and her artistic achievements are widespread throughout the world. People all over the world can understand and appreciate her work. In Belgium, in France, in Germany, she does not change her movements or her English, yet everyone can understand."

"My first time in the United States was ten years ago, performing in a theater in New York. Someone advised me that I should change the tone of my singing to cater to American audiences. I listened to him for the first three days. On the fourth day, I went back to my old singing style. But the audience welcomed it very much. Good humor, as long as it is not too silly or satirical, will have an audience in any country, no matter what language they speak."

She does not broadcast often. The government limits the number of times she broadcasts, one reason being that after she did a broadcast a few years ago, theater owners and managers were terrified and complained that as long as she broadcast, everyone would stay home to listen to the radio. It is estimated that the number of people who listened to her voice was about 400,000. This greatly affected the business of the theaters, so later her broadcasts were restricted to only twice a year.

In 1931, she entered the film industry and became Britain's most popular and highest-paid actress.

How high is her salary? It is difficult to estimate. We only know that the net profit from her gramophone records is about 5 million pounds. She receives about 550 letters every week, all asking her to host charity bazaars, or to be a judge in beauty contests, and other things. In a recent election, 200 politicians asked her to endorse them, but she refused them all. She even has a steamship named after her. Her "fan club" includes hundreds of people, all loyal supporters of her.

She is very willing to stay in California for a long time, but she cannot. If she really stayed in the United States, it would be like Shirley Temple leaving the United States and living in England. The British would painfully lose their most popular and great artist of the generation.

### Today's First Division Football League: Oriental Club to Battle the American Military, at 5 PM at So Kon Po Field, Shanghai Stars Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to Participate

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Since entering the second round of the league, the Oriental Club's first division football team has been on a roll, with continuous point increases. As of now, they are firmly in third place, and their hopes for the runner-up position have not been extinguished. Therefore, today's match against the US Navy team is a crucial one. If they can defeat the US team in this final push, they will have 29 points and can then observe the outcome of the future match between South China South and the Navy team to their advantage. Although this is an opportunity dependent on others, and it is uncertain whether they can achieve their wish, considering the hope and reputation at stake, since there is an opportunity, they should do their best. After all, the runner-up position is also an honor, and it is not easy to obtain.

As the Oriental Club is about to embark on a southern tour, they have invited Shanghai stars Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to Hong Kong to join them. Today, with this opportunity, they can display their skills at So Kon Po Field, which is truly a blessing for the Oriental Club, and the fans will also be treated to a visual feast. Here is a brief introduction to the resumes of Xu and Cao. Mr. Xu is a versatile athlete of the present day, an exceptional talent. He has above-average skills in tennis and basketball, and even more insight into football. Since the Eastern China team, he has held the position of center forward or right inside forward in famous teams such as Ping Han, Bei Ning, and Sichuan, and is known for his skillful dribbling and shooting. At the end of last year, he left Sichuan and passed through [unclear word]. The Oriental Club intended to invite him to serve, and he was eager to try. However, the Shanghai Lido team urged him to return north, and the talk of his appearance in Hong Kong did not materialize. He has returned today and finally made it a reality, which is due to fate in football.

Mr. Cao is one of the top left-wing players in the country. His dribbling, passing, and shooting are clean and beautiful. When he was in Bei Ning, he had a good partnership with Jiang Lu, and they were known as the "front-line double excellence." At that time, Jiang played left wing, and he played inside forward. Today, he is serving the Oriental Club, and he may still fill that position, naturally being familiar with the job. If Hou Chengtiao is absent, he will play left wing instead. His nickname is "Little Sanzi." He has broken his leg twice while playing football. Recently, the Shanghai Lido team won the Skoto Cup and the Junior Championship, thanks in large part to Cao.

Today, with these two fierce generals on the field, the Oriental Club is as powerful as a tiger with wings and is confident of victory. Moreover, this match is a one-sided affair. The Oriental Club considers it important, while the US team considers it ordinary. Because the US team's position is lagging behind and they have no chance to compete, and since Watson and Corogan returned to England, their strength is not as good as before. Although there are replacements and the military appearance is still strong, because the gains and losses are not important, they are simply playing according to the rules. It is unlikely that the soldiers have fighting spirit, so the Oriental Club's victory is indeed possible.

The technical condition of the Oriental Club's players is improving day by day, which is visible to all. Today, they have also transferred Xu Jincheng to the center back position to strengthen the attacking power of the front line. The arrangement is organized and it is truly pleasing to my heart. If Liu Shizhan can restrain Strauss's progress at the time, Jincheng can intercept Pearson's rush, and Luo Weiquan can keep a close eye on Curney so that he cannot move, then the most troublesome figure in the US team's front line will have no room to play. However, the US team's forward line is very strong, so Xu and Cao, the two new generals, should plan in advance to avoid the solid and take advantage of the weak in order to be effective. Cooperation is especially important.

The weather has been clear recently, and the field is dry. The Oriental Club's front line is good at blitzing and should take advantage of this opportunity. Moreover, all the forwards are known for their agility, and their progress will undoubtedly be rapid. The only concern is that Xu and Cao are participating in the war for the first time and may not have a tacit understanding of cooperation. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

### South China's Charity Match in Vietnam Raises Over 7,000 National Currency Units to Be Remitted to the National Government for Disaster Relief

(Special Report from Water News) Last month, when the South China Football Team went to Saigon, they accepted the invitation of local overseas Chinese groups to hold a charity match in South Vietnam to raise funds. This is what it means to save the country through sports.

The ticket sales for the charity match were very good. Yesterday, Mo Qing, the director of the South China Football Department, received a letter from the overseas Chinese groups that organized the charity match, stating that the total income from the charity match, calculated in national currency, was more than 7,000 yuan, which has been remitted to the Finance Department's office in Hong Kong and forwarded to the National Government for disaster relief to the compatriots in the homeland.

### Pui Ying Middle School Today's Track and Field Meet Location: Caroline Hill

Pui Ying Middle School is scheduled to hold its sports day at the South China Athletic Association grounds on Caroline Hill today, starting at 8:00 AM. The sports program is extremely rich. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life are welcome to visit the venue. The field will be temporarily closed for other uses during the war period.

### Hong Kong-Singapore Football Match Ticket Sales Brisk Field Will Be Temporarily Closed for Other Uses During the War

The South China Athletic Association believes that the Singapore-China football team's expedition to Hong Kong is a rare event. The team is full of talented players, and the three matches are undoubtedly a combination of the elite of our country's football. The future candidates to represent our country in the World Games can also be determined from this battle. Therefore, in order to ensure order and focus during the event, so that the competition can proceed smoothly and perfectly, it is specifically decided that during the three-day period of the Star China team's competition on April 1, 2, and 5, all the basketball, volleyball, and tennis courts and venues of the South China Athletic Association on Caroline Hill will be temporarily closed to members. A circular has been sent to the heads of all departments to investigate and handle this matter. It is also reported that the Hong Kong-Singapore Star Game admission tickets that have been pre-sold at the South China Billiard Room and the Qianghua Company in the Chinese Building have been selling like hotcakes, with crowds gathering to purchase them. The one-dollar tickets are about to be sold out. Fans who want to get good seats should buy them as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.

Zhu Jianqiu and Daguan were at their peak, but at this time, Finster showed signs of fatigue and found it difficult to cope. Lin took advantage of his weakness and completed the victory in one go. This set was a 10-6 game.

### Yesterday's Tennis Match Lin Tiande's Skills Were Extraordinary Fought Hard and Defeated Finster 2-0 Three More Singles Matches Today

(Special Report from This Newspaper) The Open Grass Tennis Doubles and Singles Tournament has been underway for a month. In the process of weeding out the weak and retaining the strong, it has entered a tense stage. However, the intensity of the competition did not exceed yesterday's singles match between Lin Tiande and Finster. The two sides held each other for 32 games before resolving the victory or defeat. The tension of the situation and the closeness of the score can be imagined.

Lin is from Meixian, Guangdong, and grew up in Perak. He is 20 years old. He started playing tennis when he was over ten years old. Because he is talented, his skills have improved day by day. Before coming to Hong Kong to study at the University of Hong Kong this year, he won the Perak doubles and singles championships.

Finster was the singles leader in Hong Kong many years ago. Now, due to his age, his skills are slightly inferior, but his experience is rich, and he is still a veteran singles player in Hong Kong.

Yesterday's match was between a young general and an old master. Under the circumstances, there was bound to be a fierce battle, so there were many spectators and it was lively.

As far as the reporter saw, Lin's flat hand shots were accurate and powerful. His serve, which combined both soft and hard, was also ingenious. His victory yesterday was due to the above two advantages, and his youth and strength also gave him a considerable advantage. However, his backhand shot often lacked accuracy, sometimes good and sometimes bad. Therefore, his hard-fought victory was purely due to the fact that his backhand shot rarely yielded benefits. If this technique were also good, it would have been easier to win. Also, his style is only accustomed to using left and right baseline shots and rarely goes to the net. This may be due to Finster's sufficient experience, which made him afraid to try. It was also seen that his positioning often had errors, but fortunately, his movements were quick and he was able to make up for them. In short, Lin is a promising talent who will surely become famous in the future, but his experience is still new.

Finster's shots still had speed, and his mid-court chop shots were even more sophisticated. However, he was overweight and weak, and when he ran too much, he was most afraid of the ball's approach close to his body. Therefore, he often lost points due to the above two weaknesses, not due to a lack of skill or experience.

After the start of the match, Finster took the first two games, and Lin also retaliated. In this way, they held each other until 5-5 and 6-6, fighting hard and evenly matched. In the middle of the match, the two often had good plays, winning applause from the audience. Later, Lin made extra efforts, often attacking the opponent's weaknesses, and serving well, and then won the next two games, winning the first set 8-6. The score of the first set is as follows:

First Set

Lin Tiande 1 3 4 4 5 6 4 5

Finster 4 5 1 2 7 4 1 3

1 1 2 6 4 4 8 games

4 4 4 4 1 2 Games

Lin took advantage of the victory in the first set and won the next two games in a row at the beginning of the second set, making it easier to win. However, Finster had experience and was able to seize opportunities to counterattack, despite a lack of strength. Therefore, when the score reached 4-4, the situation was most tense and suspenseful. Looking at the scores of 10-8 and 8-10 at that time, the state of stalemate can be seen. Then 5-5, 6-6, 8-8, three times tied, if plum blossom

Second Set

Lin Tiande 4 4 1 4 8 3 2

Finster 1 1 4 1 8 5 4

1 3 2 4 7 4 0 2 4 4 4 10 games

1 1 4 6 5 2 4 4 1 1 0 8 games

The match between Naxi and Zhenxiang was also worth watching. In terms of technique, Lu was superior to Naxi, but Lu's physique was too weak, and in the last set, when the score reached 5-5, his right hand cramped, so he lost 5-7, which was a pity. In the match between last year's champion Xu Weipei and Huang Zhaorong, Xu calmly responded and won 6-3, 6-2 without feeling threatened. The doubles team of Xian Bing Shi gave up, and Luo Ding Xian Li Qi won without fighting. The results are recorded as follows: (Dongchu)

### On School Sports in Hong Kong (2)

— —Excellence—

The status of sports and the instructors of sports should emphasize universal sports. All students and staff in the entire school should be able to have a strong physique and a sound mind. This is the school's greatest and most precious trophy. I would not dare to say that Hong Kong schools do not have a relatively organized approach to sports and do not value sports. However, only a minority of them do so and cannot reach the majority, let alone be universal.

(2) Each School's Approach to

Sports Instruction

Because most schools in Hong Kong despise sports, the past sports instructors in schools have mostly been athletes or people who have graduated from ordinary schools and have a slight interest in sports. I would not dare to say that among these people, there are no outstanding individuals who can painstakingly study and achieve good results. However, they are not as good as those who graduated from the sports department of other universities or vocational schools, because sports departments or vocational schools are generally more substantial. Whether it is knowledge or technology, they will have deeper research. The reason why school sports in Hong Kong has not been able to develop universally in the past is also largely due to these sports instructors who do not come from proper backgrounds. It is hoped that in the future, school officials, if they truly establish schools for education and educate for the health of the nation, should pay attention to sports training and the appointment of sports instructors, and should respect their academic qualifications, experience, character cultivation, and spirit.

(3) Sports Field

Because of the terrain and environment of Hong Kong schools, the construction of sports fields has become a major problem. Many schools do not even have sports facilities, which has led many schools to use this as an excuse to despise or abandon the sports subject. In fact, we must not neglect the training of students' physiques due to the problem of facilities, and foster a general weakness among scholars and girls who cannot bear the weight of their clothes. We should strive to break through all adverse environments and difficult and arduous matters, and use our ingenious and lively minds to deal with everything, just to achieve the purpose of our sports training. We should have the courage to work hard. In this difficult environment, of course, we cannot build track and field fields or standard football, basketball, and volleyball courts, but we can always make facilities according to the environment and promote various sports that do not require wide spaces, such as lively calisthenics, etc. Even when these kinds of venues are not available, we can use the rooftop or balcony. Taking a step back, we can also do games and calisthenics in the classroom, or temporarily move the chairs to a corner and then carry out mat exercises, etc. It all depends on whether we are willing to shoulder the heavy burden of national physical training. If we can have this kind of determination, of course, we can overcome any difficulties, and the venue will not be our problem.

(4) Should Promote Lively Gymnastics

The reason why school sports in the past did not develop was largely due to the problem of venues, but other aspects were also due to the fact that previous sports instructors could not make facilities according to the environment. All they saw were ball games or track and field sports, and they did not pay attention to the sports that are most suitable for promotion in the Hong Kong school environment. The value of this kind of sports training not only includes the effectiveness of ball games and track and field, but is even more superior, which is lively gymnastics. Regarding this kind of equipment, it does not require wide spaces and is extremely cheap and durable in terms of cost. Therefore, this is a very good path for the popularization of school sports in Hong Kong. If each school can advance along this path, of course, it will be easy to implement and achieve the goal of "popularizing sports." Comrades, let's promote it together! (To be continued)

### The Comedy of Fleeing from the Besieged Madrid (Continued)

— Guzinan Translated by Zhuang Zhong

—We can't abandon the front line here and all run over there. Two thousand people are enough, and the rest can stay here... No one wants to stay there. It took a lot of talking to convince them. As a result, two thousand young people, with red and black scarves around their necks, shouting revolutionary slogans, and filled with fighting spirit, immediately set off for the defense of Madrid to face death and glory...

In Dalan there are hundreds of fighters who survived the Battle of Siguenza, and in addition, about the same number of Madrid workers and farmers joined their ranks. On November 6, they received an order saying:

—Don't let anyone pass with weapons—Madrid needs all the military!

A large convoy of cars set off from Madrid, carrying a bunch of cowards fleeing for their lives. In the Langon area, the militiamen with guns in their hands stopped the progress of those large cars:

—Where are you going?

—To Molins de Rei.

—Why?

—Special mission.

Indeed, in times of special missions, all mentally unsound people are looking for a special mission. But the militiamen didn't let it go like that.

—You are all cowardly things—go back to Madrid!

Some, feeling ashamed, turned back. Others tried to get through:

—Okay, then put down your weapons in Molins de Rei.

These are not needed, it's useless.

A car brought Pedro Rico (Mayor of Madrid - Translator). They fired a shot at the front of the car, turning Rico's face completely deathly pale. He was so frightened that he didn't know what to do. Seeing his embarrassed state, the militiamen laughed loudly:

A militiaman rebuked him. —Want to run away too? Coward.

Pedro Rico tried hard to defend himself, but another interrupted him, saying

—Do we have to smash your face against the wall!

He fled in panic, turning back towards Madrid amidst laughter and ridicule. As soon as he arrived in Madrid, he sought refuge in a foreign embassy... It was already dusk when the team was inspected by José Villalba, a gaunt, bold, and decisive figure. He had shown his bravery in seizing the Montaña Barracks and in the battles of Guadalajara and Siguenza. When Madrid was threatened, he led his men to defend the city. He achieved victories on the Casa de Campo battlefield and later died fighting foreign bandits in the Teruel area.

A convoy of cars arrived, and the militiamen detained them. A voice shouted:

—Let them go—there are many ministers in the cars!

All the passengers in the cars were called down. One of them said to Villalba:

—This is really outrageous! I am from such and such ministry, I am going to Molins de Rei...

Villalba replied: —Given the responsibilities of ministers like you, you should be staying with the people in this time of crisis. Now you are running away, you will demoralize the combatants...

Three or four more appeared, all of them ministers. Villalba disarmed them and put them in a room. One minister couldn't help but ask in a panic:

—What are you going to do?

—I feel like doing this—replied Villalba—Tomorrow, when we go to the front line, we will take you to the front...

—This is a barbaric act...

—Most likely, we will execute you, as you deserve...

He immediately called Mier (Mier is the head of the CNT, who is actually responsible for the defense of Madrid) and said:

—I have four ministers who fled from Madrid here. What do you want me to do?

Mier's mind was not confused. He knew that in this extremely serious situation, everyone's life was hanging by a thread. The government's relocation could only be interpreted as an evasion of responsibility. He was against the relocation. But what was the use of detaining those ministers, so he ordered:

—Let them go!

—But this is...

—Nothing, nothing! Do as I tell you!

—Okay, but I want to be relieved of my responsibility. Write me an order... Mier gave him the order he wanted. When he received it, he read it slowly, and then he said to the ministers: —The organization (CNT) opposes our views. I am now setting you free. You can go to Molins de Rei. But don't forget how you ran away today, and don't forget the bravery of the Madrid people in the battle...

The ministers climbed into the car in anger and drove forward at full speed. It was already dawn. Villalba watched them drive away on the road. Then he shouted loudly

—Now, we are going to fulfill our responsibility to save Madrid

People began to climb into those large military vehicles, heading in the opposite direction to the ministers. They were heading towards death, but also towards the life of freedom and victory... (The End)

### My Own Writing

— Chen Xianwen

Wanting to talk about literature and its sensibility, I inevitably thought of the phrase "my own writing" again. "My own writing" loses its seriousness because it is often paired with the phrase "another man's wife," and the part of the truth it contains is thus ignored. In fact, while we cannot affirm its absolute truth, its relative truth cannot be denied.

Authors have always used their works to depict reason, infect emotions, and reflect reality. From the classical school to the realist school, a series of them have been proving the correctness of this interpretation. The progress of literature, like the progress of history, is increasing in complexity. Therefore, modern literature not only accommodates the established interpretations as much as possible, but also often uses a critical eye on reality. That is, the author expresses his feelings (subjective and objective) based on his rich experience of reality in the most appropriate way.

The more excellent and flawless a work is, the more it can fulfill its mission in tiny paragraphs or plain situations. As a reader or critic, how should he understand and explore the author's true understanding and expression of nature, history, and human thought in the work? If they lack the same experience and understanding of reality as the author, that is to say, they lack the experience and understanding of the same reality, or they assess the value of that work in a careless manner, what will be the result? Undoubtedly, they will fall into great errors.

Therefore, while it is important for an author to have a correct experience and understanding of reality and a thorough method of expression, it is equally important for a reader or critic to have the experience and understanding of the reality expressed in the work when assessing the value of a work.

Therefore, the phrase "my own writing" cannot establish absolute truth because the author may not correctly express reality with a critical eye, and its relative truth is because the author sometimes understands the phenomenon expressed more realistically than others.

### Speaking up for Scientists

— Shui Chang

Ever since the World War, we have often heard the public criticize that scientists are creating sins by inventing all kinds of lethal weapons for the use of ambitious people, resulting in a situation where "one general succeeds upon ten thousand bones." In recent years, seeing so many people in East Asia and West Asia suffer great sacrifices, killed by airplanes, cannons, bombs, machine guns. This wave of blaming scientists is getting louder and louder. But these are all temporary emotional reactions that have confused reason. Many people believe that scientists should be responsible for inventing something new; whenever they encounter knowledge and methods that have the potential to kill, they must take precautions in advance; or not conduct the work before the invention; or keep it strictly confidential after the invention, absolutely not for people to use. According to this, our ancient sage Suirenshi committed many sins when he invented drilling wood to make fire. He should have foreseen that later people would use fire to kill, and that there would be fire attack methods in later tactics, so he wouldn't have drilled any wood.

The Yellow Emperor created the chariot, initially using oxen to pull it, and later using horses. When two countries fought each other, chariots occupied a very important position. The ancients also said: The great use of the Rong people lies in horses, so Emperor Gaozu of Han had the bold statement of "gaining the world on horseback," which shows that chariots and horses were necessary for war before the twentieth century. Chariots should not have been invented in the first place, and horses should not have been trained. In ancient times, metal was cast into blades, and blades refer to knives, swords, spears, halberds, and arrows, which can be said to be murderous weapons. Gold is metal, first copper, then iron, and finally steel. These metals should not have been invented either.

In the Stone Age, humans used stones as weapons. When everyone learned to use them, in order to resist and survive, they invented the use of bows and arrows. Later, they felt that it was not powerful enough, so they invented firearms, such as rockets and fire guns. A further step is modern guns and cannons. Who can say that when defending against foreign insults, one should not devote one's heart and soul to think of all kinds of self-defense methods? If someone said, "We have umbrellas, so it rains," then he must be considered to have a mental illness. Then, aren't those who criticize material civilization in place of scientists committing the same mistake?

Those who criticize science still want to argue, definitely pointing to modern airplanes and cannons as the crystallization of science. May I ask, what is the difference between the convenience of creating airplanes for transportation and communication, and the Yellow Emperor creating chariots? What is the difference between inventing explosives to open mountains and mines and subdue fierce beasts, and Suirenshi making fire? Are the inventions in science more beneficial to mankind? Are they more harmful to mankind? Even if scientists are scapegoated and forced to confess to all kinds of trumped-up charges of murder and arson. I am afraid that offsetting the merits against the crimes, the merits are already greater than the crimes.

Weapons can never be forcibly divided into two types, one for self-defense and one for attacking others. Only talking about self-defense and not attacking others is passive resistance, but absolutely passive resistance is not the case. To do the work of resisting aggression, we must seek relatively effective methods and strength of counterattack in order to be confident. In short, science can never predict whether an invention will have improper applications, nor can it prevent an invention from being used for evil by those who do not talk about morality. And knowing that an invention may not be beneficial to mankind, due to the special relationship of the environment, one cannot but work hard to carry it out. Critics must abandon their subjective attitude in order to be fair.

### East River, Flow On!

— Yuren

East River,

Flow on!

Take the surging waves,

Wash away on this earth,

The bloody and smelly traces!

Look!

In Danshui, in Baimanghua,

In all the towns:

The enemy has arbitrarily

Robbed, killed, raped,

Splashing the compatriots' hot blood!

On your side!

The enemy has destroyed

All the essence of your place!

The prosperous towns of the past!

Now all have become—

Desolate graveyards!

East River,

Flow on!

Take your great power

To avenge this blood-stained hatred!

Today,

The vigorous vitality

Has already filled:

Every town,

Every village!

Hundreds of millions of people,

Have already begun to create

Their new life—

"Guerrilla Teams," "Self-Defense Forces"

And "Anti-Japanese Comrades Associations,"

Have united

An infinitely vast power—

They tirelessly

Are tempered in work,

And more actively preparing for:

The harsh,

Arduous,

Great struggle!

East River,

Flow on!

Flood!

Roar!

You bravely live in

The sacred War of Resistance against Japan

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shuqun

Although she is a weakling, there are moments when a weakling completely controlled by fragile emotions takes the bravest actions. However, these actions lack the restraint of a strong person's reason, and are governed only by a kind of blind impulse – even a derangement of the nervous system. It is like the act and psychology of a weakling daring to commit suicide. The momentary psychology possessed by this action is abnormal; but the perverted wisdom, in the moment possessed by this action, is perhaps more clever than usual. It is like the ingenious methods discovered by the weak for suicide. She stopped waiting for him for a moment, let him walk parallel to her; she deliberately asked him softly:

"Are you too cold?"

"Don't you hate me anymore?"

"Of course, I don't hate you anymore! Are you too cold? I'll give you the scarf!"

"No!" He patted his chest to show her, and said, "I'm not afraid of the cold!" She didn't allow it. He had no choice but to reach out:

"Then give it to me!"

"No, I'll wrap it around you!"

"Thank you!"

Afraid of betraying her kindness, he stopped, leaned his head out from his collar, waiting for her to wrap the scarf around him. But, feeling a gust of wind, or perhaps an ice flow, enter his flesh; then, he realized that the sharp knife hidden under the scarf had suddenly pierced his neck, splitting it open, and blood was dripping down. At that time, he was fortunate to step back and grab her hand, otherwise, he might have been seriously injured. He never thought she would have such a brave experiment, let alone that the fierce tiger of the moment before would turn into a little lamb – she had collapsed in a daze, falling at his feet, the vengeful and bloodstained knife thrown beside her. After being startled and wounded, he couldn't help but feel some anger. However, comparing her two extremely different postures before and after that moment, she seemed like the possessor of two souls, making him feel amused and strange; so he endured his pain and helped her up from the ground. He brushed off the traces on her body, while smilingly calling her:

"Wake up, it's almost dawn!" Yes, she did indeed seem to have taken a nap; after waking up, she still had a heavy drowsiness.

"You won." She heard his voice, and cried, this cry, for him, was a kind of shame? Because he did not retaliate; for herself, it was a kind of self-reproach, because she had not been satisfied. (Twenty-three)
