### Re-examination of Japanese Policy

On July 6th, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma delivered a speech comprehensively outlining the Japanese government's domestic and foreign policies, with the following points being the most important:

First, strengthening the anti-communist axis. He said: "Strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact is an established policy, and we must continue to follow this policy. Japan may send representatives to the Nazi Party Congress in Germany." The fact that Japan continues to cling to this "anti-communist" magic wand precisely illustrates the increasingly serious and intractable difficulties Japan faces. It is forced to use this "anti-communist" magic wand to both intensify its collusion with Germany and Italy, obtaining political and military assistance from them in the West, and to confuse democratic powers such as Britain and the United States, seeking avenues for compromise, dividing the anti-aggression front, and weakening the forces supporting China and restraining Japan.

Second, regarding the attitude towards countries opposing aggression, Hiranuma's speech reveals the contradictions and cunning of Japan's recent policies. He adopts a seductive approach towards the United States, even brazenly saying: "The atmosphere in the United States is improving, which can be observed." However, in reality, as Japan's aggressive forces expand in the Far East, the conflict between its interests and those of the United States is increasing daily, no less than its conflict with Britain. Although a small number of isolationists and arms merchants in the United States deliberately ignore this, the fact remains. The United States will eventually reject this flirtatious gesture and take self-defense measures. Secondly, regarding the Soviet Union, Hiranuma said: "The Nomonhan Incident was only intended to drive out Mongolian troops who had crossed the border, nothing more." This even more blatantly exposes the shamelessness and powerlessness of the Japanese aggressors! While he shamelessly trumpets anti-communism, he also exposes his fear of the Mongolian and Soviet forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party, who are fighting back against Japan. It seems that the traitors who follow Japan in shamelessly "opposing the Soviet Union" and "opposing communism" should wake up a little. How has the motherland failed you that you must sell your souls to be the shameless and powerless lackeys of Japan?

Third, Japan is currently concentrating all its forces against Britain! If Japan truly wants to oppose communism, then Japan's enemy should be the Soviet Union. If it is for the future situation in the Pacific, then Japan's strong opponent is the United States, not Britain! If Japan wants to strike at countries that aid China's resistance against Japan, then the countries most actively aiding China today are the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. It can even be said that in the past two years, Britain's aid to China has never exceeded that of the Soviet Union and the United States. However, Japan today does not attack its main "true" enemies, but chooses Britain, which has the most moderate attitude, the most cautious behavior, and even shows deference to Japan in its diplomacy! Hiranuma said: "Japan will pursue its goals with firm resolve and resolutely reject all obstacles. If Britain does not understand Japan's intentions or does not agree with Japan's views, there is no other option but to sever relations." At the same time, an anti-British movement is being launched throughout Japan and its occupied areas in China. Here again, we see Japan's fear of the strong! We also see that the fate of any country that attempts to compromise with Japan is simply to retreat voluntarily and even become a sacrifice for Japan.

Fourth, on the China issue, Hiranuma did not dare to mention a single word about the current state of the war of aggression and its future when announcing his policies. This proves how Japan is currently trapped in an unprecedentedly difficult situation because of our insistence on unity and resistance! However, Hiranuma particularly emphasized the establishment of a puppet new central government in the occupied areas. In order to strengthen this new regime, dreaming of colluding with a small number of wavering elements, stubborn elements, and a small number of people who have abandoned their conscience, betrayed their country for personal gain, and are willing to be buried with the enemy, he announced that the Three Principles of the People and the Kuomintang, which are anti-communist, might be allowed under the puppet new regime. In order to consolidate the rule of the occupied areas and facilitate its oppression and plunder of the occupied areas, he also resolutely declared the semi-permanent stationing of troops.

Hiranuma's announced future policies of Japan, on the one hand, exposed the severity of the blows that Japan's war of aggression against China has suffered in the past two years, and revealed that Japan's own strength is no longer able to solve its current difficulties and crises. But on the other hand, it also revealed that Japan is trying to intensify its efforts to eliminate all British forces from its occupied areas and seize all British wealth. It wants to take all of China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to solve its difficulties. In order to realize this ambition, it shamelessly fawns on the United States and yields to the Soviet Union. It does not hesitate to unscrupulously use the magic flag of anti-communism to spread rumors, slander, and sow discord. However, precisely because of this, it further exposes the approaching end of Japan!

Chinese compatriots who are unwilling to be slaves, let us enhance our national self-esteem and self-confidence!

### The enemy's forces are increasingly pressured on all battlefields. The main focus of the war is now on the coastal provinces of Shanxi and Guangdong. Enemy warships harassing are not a major threat.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] A Chinese military spokesman said yesterday that after two years of hard fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies, the current confrontation line starts from Baotou, the end point of the Ping-Sui Railway in the north, extends south along the east bank of the Yellow River to Yongji, then runs parallel to the river, east to Kaifeng, then turns south, passing through Xuchang on the Ping-Han Railway, and reaches Qianjiang on the Han River along the railway, then south to Yueyang, before turning east to Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, then north along the Nan (chang)-Ping (jiang) highway to Jiujiang. As for Zhejiang Province, although the Japanese army once advanced south, it can now only hold the highway between Wuhu and Hangzhou. Regarding Guangdong Province, the Japanese army only controls 100 kilometers around Guangzhou. The West River and North River serve as natural moats between the two armies. There are no traces of the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. In Shantou, the Japanese army is now attacking the border between Fujian and Guangdong. The spokesman also said that the above is only the battle line on the surface. In fact, the Japanese army can only hold important transportation lines. Outside the transportation lines, Chinese officials can still exercise their functions, and guerrillas often attack the rear of the Japanese army.

Tension at the southern end of the Tongpu Railway. Fierce fighting near Anyi and Zhangdian.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] The enemy in Dongduan Village, Anyi, was attacked by our troops in the rain on the night of the 3rd, and there was fierce street fighting. The next morning, the enemy in Anyi was informed and sent reinforcements, and the fighting was even fiercer. More than 200 enemies were killed. Currently, our troops are besieging.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] More than 1,000 enemy infantry and cavalry who invaded from Anze were severely attacked head-on by our division west of Niegu Shop. Another unit of our army intercepted them in Shangyuan Baofeng (southeast of Zhangdian Town) and other places, killing many enemies. The remaining enemies have joined with the enemy in the southwestern area of Zouma Ridge to attack Qin Yuan. We are on high alert.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] More than 2,000 enemies from Hongdong, near the suburbs, recently advanced east through Gu Xian Town and Taiyang Town. After our fierce attack, more than 300 enemies were killed in the two days of the 3rd and 4th. They are still fighting fiercely near Xiluling (northeast of Fushan).

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 8th] More than 2,000 enemies from Zhangjing Town (north of Qin County) captured Qin County in the morning of the 5th and continued to attack Shihe Village on the west side through Duanliu Fan Village. After an interception by our troops, there was fierce fighting for half a day, and the enemy was defeated and retreated. Another 700 to 800 enemies captured Yikai Village and Guo Village (south of Qin County) and attempted to attack Guo Dao. We have strengthened our reconnaissance and defense.

[Minge News Agency, Kelan, 9th] More than 3,000 enemies in Shuoxian, Shenchi, Naihe Fort, Laoying Fort, and other places in northwestern Shanxi attacked our Bajiao Fort and Limin Fort (north of Shenchi) in five routes. Our army was already aware of the enemy's situation and had withdrawn its troops to nearby highlands for an ambush. On the evening of the 1st, the enemy invaded Limin Fort and, knowing that we were prepared, did not dare to stop and immediately retreated eastward. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, killing dozens of enemies. Because the enemy had not yet gained a firm foothold, they collapsed from the Shuoxian area. By the evening of the 2nd, there were no enemies near Limin Fort.

[Minge News Agency, Yulin, 9th] More than 500 enemies who occupied Guangcheng from Changning Town (east of Yuci) have been retreating from the Yuci area after being constantly attacked by our army in recent days.

The southeastern coast is consolidated. Our army successfully counterattacks Houtang.

[Our newspaper, Guilin, 9th, special dispatch] A military source said that the national defense on the southeastern coast is absolutely consolidated. The coast is mostly hilly. Even if the enemy lands, they have no hope of penetrating deeply. In the Chaoshan battle, we have gradually taken the initiative. The enemy in Chaoshan is being attacked by us everywhere on the road and is in a dilemma whether to advance or retreat. Although there are many enemy warships off the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang, only Dinghai, Shijiao, Renhuan, Chuanshi, Pingtan Islands are being harassed. This does not cause any military damage to us.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 8th] The enemy who sneaked into Shijiao Town, which belongs to Wenling County, has been building fortifications in recent days, intending to hold on. At 1:00 p.m. on the 8th, our army launched a large-scale counterattack. The enemy resisted stubbornly. After our fierce attack, the enemy was defeated. Some retreated back to the ships, and about 200 enemies fled to Ruoshan. There are now no traces of the enemy in Shijiao. There are one large enemy ship, three small ships, and two ships each in the waters of Huangdaao and Xiaomenshan. There are three to five ships in the waters of Damenshan.

### Preparations for the Youth League, Qinghai Branch, Instructor Ma Bufang

[Central News Agency, Xining, 9th] The Three Principles of the People Youth League is preparing to establish a branch in Qinghai, and Ma Bufang has been appointed as the instructor. Wang Wenjun, Guo Xueli, Ma Liangwu, Yuan Chunhui, Deng Qinyi, Mu Jianye, and Wang Shouniu are the executive members, and Wang Wenjun has been appointed as the director of preparations, and Yuan Chunhui as the secretary.

### Intense fighting on the Mongolian border. 60,000 Soviet troops reinforce the front line. There is a battle for Hailar.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Reuters correspondent on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, 9th: The battle between the Manchurian-Japanese and Mongolian-Soviet forces for Nomonhan on the border is becoming more intense. Both sides are now fighting for a certain mountain, and the scale of the battle is reminiscent of the Zhanggufeng Incident last year. The two sides are attacking each other with aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery. The mountain that is being fought for is 160 miles southwest of Hailar. The summit of the mountain is the target of both sides and has not yet been occupied by either side. Mongolian troops are braving heavy artillery fire to defend the ridge on the west side of the mountain. At the same time, some other Mongolian troops are divided into several small teams and are braving Japanese artillery fire to cross the Halha River to reinforce the Mongolian troops who are defending near Nomonhan. It is reported that the hills on the banks of the Halha River have been surrounded by the Japanese army. The war situation has turned into trench warfare, with both sides digging trenches and confronting each other. The Japanese side said that the Mongolian army is now making every effort to counterattack, and its combat plan has not yet been completed. Although the Mongolian army has suffered heavy bombing by the Japanese army, it is still able to use the large bridge of Halha to cross 4,000 reinforcements across the bridge in the dark. The reporter now sees several trucks full of Japanese wounded soldiers going down from the front line, which proves the intensity of the war. The Mongolian army has been reinforced by the Soviet troops and has taken a firm stand. Therefore, the war seems likely to be prolonged. According to senior Japanese military officers, 60,000 Soviet troops have been transferred from the Lake Baikal area (in the eastern part of Siberia) to the rear of the border to be stationed. As for the rumors that the Soviet Union intends to launch another battle elsewhere on the border to alleviate the crisis in the Nomonhan area, it is clearly inaccurate. The reason why the Japanese army made little progress at the beginning of the war was due to the difficulty of transportation and the lack of mechanized units. Currently, mechanized and infantry units have been reinforced. The most noteworthy things in the current war are two: one is the accuracy of the Soviet artillery fire, and the other is the intensity of the Japanese aircraft bombing. The Japanese side claims that since the outbreak of the war, it has destroyed 250 Mongolian tanks and armored vehicles and captured about 60 Soviet troops. Because the transportation to the front is inconvenient, the reporter cannot confirm the war results reported by the Japanese side.

### The Central Government holds a memorial for the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presides in person and hosts a reception for military and political leaders after the meeting.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The 9th was the anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking of the National Revolutionary Army. The Central National Government jointly held a memorial meeting at 8:00 a.m. More than 400 members of the Central National Government Committee and military and political leaders attended. President Chiang presided in person and performed the ceremony. Subsequently, Committee Member Wu Jingheng reported on the significance of completing the national revolution in the 30th year of the Premier's guidance. His words were insightful and vigilant. After the meeting, President Chiang held a tea party to entertain the military and political leaders to celebrate.

### Weng Wenhao talks about the current economic situation in China. At present, agriculture is more important than industry, focusing on self-sufficiency. The blockade of the coast has no impact on the overall situation.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Mr. Smith, the Far East President of our agency, met with Chinese Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao today and was given a statement, which roughly said that regarding the number of foreign goods imported, China still relies on foreigners for many types of goods, especially munitions. However, China now has a large reserve of arms, which is enough to support it for a long time even if it stops buying now. Moreover, the current war situation is not tense, and less is needed. Regarding the economic development of the southwestern provinces of China, especially the industrial development, Minister Weng said that the industrial development is not extremely important, because most of the people are farmers, and industry is secondary. As for the provinces west of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, such as Ningxia, because the land is barren, the residents do not need to transport goods in and out, and they are self-sufficient. Because transportation is difficult, most of them have not been developed. The Long Province is gradually becoming an important province because of the Sino-Soviet highway. As for the recent so-called "Berglas Plan" to relocate German Jews to Yunnan Province, Minister Weng said that although the government has indeed considered the issue of relocating Jewish refugees, it has not yet decided on any implementation plan. Minister Weng then admitted that the Japanese army's blockade of Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and other places has had a considerable impact on trade in these places, but said that the number of Chinese goods exported from these places is not large, so it has little impact on the overall situation. Now Annam and Burma are the necessary routes for imported goods. Although the handling of transportation is not perfect, it has been greatly improved and is gradually becoming better. Britain and France have also expressed their willingness to cooperate with China to improve the handling of transportation because of commercial relations. The Northwest Highway is only used to connect trade between China and the Soviet Union, so goods from other countries are not transported into China through this route. The reporter then asked whether the Japanese were able to extract resources in the occupied areas. Minister Weng said that the Japanese now have very little access to resources in the occupied areas, and their goal is in the future, attempting to control the entire Chinese economy. Therefore, the capital of the two major development companies in North China and Central China is borne by Chinese and Japanese merchants, but the real power is in the hands of the Japanese. The Japanese plan to control the entire Chinese economy with these two major companies when the war ends in the future. However, the Japanese financial groups and warlords cannot agree on their opinions and are dissatisfied with the economic facilities in the occupied areas. Now Chinese merchants in the occupied areas can still avoid the Japanese army's surveillance and transport a large number of goods into the inland. Regarding the indiscriminate bombing of various places by Japanese aircraft, Minister Weng finally said that this matter has no impact on Chinese industry, because the factories are scattered in various places and are not large in scale. Therefore, even if one or two of them are bombed, it does not matter.

### Overseas Chinese compatriots unanimously support the national policy of resisting the war. They held meetings to commemorate July 7th and sent telegrams of condolence to Chairman Chiang and the soldiers.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has just received a telegram from Wan Zuxu, the Consul General of Batavia, saying that the various overseas Chinese communities held a memorial meeting for the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Salvation this morning. The spirit was enthusiastic, and they unanimously supported the central government's policy of resistance. The meeting decided to send telegrams to Chairman Chiang and the soldiers at the front to express their condolences.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The Chinese Ambassador to Germany telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 7th, saying that a memorial meeting for the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and a memorial service for the fallen soldiers and compatriots who died was held today. More than 100 people, including party representatives, members of the embassy, representatives of various groups, students, and overseas Chinese men and women, attended. Ambassador Chen chaired the meeting. The crowd was enthusiastic and decided to send a telegram to President Chiang and compatriots across the country to pay their respects.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Qian Tai, Minister to Belgium, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 7th, saying that the embassy convened overseas Chinese to hold a meeting today to commemorate the fallen soldiers and compatriots who died. They unanimously supported Chairman Chiang and the soldiers at the front. On the same day, the China Friendship Association and the China College in Beijing jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Chinese soldiers fighting in the war, expressing their respect and wishing China victory. Please submit the telegrams.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Ambassador Guo in the United Kingdom yesterday, saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing presented it to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and all the officers, soldiers, and compatriots across the country are all in good health. This afternoon, the London General Branch of the Party and various industrial, commercial, and academic groups were invited to hold a memorial meeting for the second anniversary of the War of Resistance at the embassy. In addition to deeply mourning the fallen soldiers and compatriots who died, all unanimously supported the belief that the war of resistance will be won and the country will be built. They sincerely expressed their respect and concern for your loyalty to the country, the bloody resistance of the soldiers, and the perseverance and sacrifice of the compatriots. More than 7,000 yuan was donated on the spot, and the mood of fundraising was extremely enthusiastic and sincere.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Czech Embassy on the 7th yesterday, saying that it convened all overseas Chinese merchants and students to hold a memorial service today and held a national oath, supporting the leader in resisting the war to the end and opposing traitors and puppets.

### American Catholic Journalists' Annual Meeting. Bishop Yu Bin's speech denounces Japanese atrocities in China. The whole audience applauded and expressed deep sympathy.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] New York News: The 29th annual meeting of the American Catholic News Journalists Association was held in New York on June 22. Representatives from Catholic news organizations in various cities attended, totaling more than 150. The opening address was given by Archbishop Spellman of New York, who praised and encouraged the work in the past and in the future. The chairman then introduced Bishop Yu Bin's speech, and the whole audience applauded in welcome. Bishop Yu delivered a sincere speech, roughly saying that Catholic newspapers are praised by the world because they adhere to the three major principles of "justice," "humanity," and "truth." If these three major principles are applied to the injustice, inhumanity, hypocrisy, and fraud in society, they can be eliminated before they happen. The benefits to the world and people's hearts cannot be measured. Now in the East, there is a great power with 450 million people and a 5,000-year-old history. Its cities and towns have been tragically bombed, and no fewer than 30 million of its people have been displaced. The suffering of women and children is especially tragic. How can you turn a blind eye to this? The enemy breaks into homes and robs, ravages women, and it has not stopped yet. Its destruction of human culture is unprecedented. As for controlling public opinion and fabricating news, it is secondary. The term "Far East" is a European term. In fact, the distance from England is not far. What is being done to us today, who knows that it will not be done to the United States tomorrow? You uphold justice, advocate humanitarianism, and support the truth. You have been doing this for a long time. I hope that you will, with human sympathy and Catholic charity, expand the scope of reporting and commentary, and denounce the conspiracies of the Japanese military with both words and actions. Awaken the world to the arbitrary Sino-Japanese War. It is not a simple corner of the army, but a key to whether the world will move toward peace or war in the next thousand years. It also concerns civilization and barbarism. After the speech, the whole audience applauded warmly, expressing deep sympathy. Several well-known reporters continued to elaborate on the first theory. The first day's meeting ended successfully. The annual meeting continued the next day. Bishop Yu Bin introduced Zhang Shanzi to participate, so that the news media could understand our country's art. Zhang also brought many paintings, which were given away to the audience, and the audience praised them.

### The government officially promulgated the Excess Profits Tax during the extraordinary period yesterday. Taxes must be paid on profits exceeding 20%.

[Reuters, Qing, 9th] The Chinese government officially announced the rules for the collection of the Excess Profits Tax during the extraordinary period today. This tax system is a further implementation of the income tax. Any industrial and commercial organization, whether private or jointly run with the government, that has a capital of 2,000 yuan and makes a profit of 20% must pay this tax.

[Special News from Shanghai] From the 4th, the Shanghai silver and money industry will handle the interbank transfers for various banks and firms. The banks and firms will provide property reserves and receive transfer checks from the bank reserve committee. The transfer deposits previously stored in the reserve library will be converted into legal tender at 95% from the 4th, divided into twelve star Ming transfers, with a total amount of 22 million yuan. Therefore, in addition to the 50 million yuan of new transfer funds, the Shanghai financial market has also increased by more than 20 million legal tender, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the city's industry and commerce. In addition, from the 4th, the silver and money industry will implement centralized bill exchange.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Taiwan News, the City Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Association jointly formed a Transfer Preparation Inspection Committee. Xu Jiting was recommended by the City Chamber of Commerce, Qin Runqing was recommended by the Money Association, He Bosi Gen was recommended by the foreign merchant Money Association, Wu Yunzhai was recommended internally by the Silver Association, and one representative will be jointly recommended by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank, and Joint Bank. It is scheduled to be established within a few days. The first transfer preparation inspection will be held at the end of July.

### Guizhou's Volunteer Soldiers

— Liu Zhuzhou

[Guizhou Correspondence] When the Southern Route delegation of the National Comfort Association entered Guizhou, everyone was excited about one thing. This thing was the rise of a trend of voluntarily enlisting in the military among the strong young men in every corner of Guizhou.

The young men who voluntarily enlist are called "volunteer soldiers" in the classification of the military service authorities.

According to statistics from the local military district headquarters, as of the end of May, the counties where young men had voluntarily enlisted included Danjiang, Libo, Tongzi, Xiuwen, Xifeng, Zunyi, Qingzhen, Xingren, Jiangkou, Zhengan, Zhengyuan, Jiyang, Anyun, Lushun, Pingba, Guanling, Panxian, and other counties, totaling 298 people. Among them, 231 were general voluntary enlistees; 54 were serving in place of their brothers; 66 were students; 4 were members of the Miao ethnic group; 2 were brothers competing to serve in the military; and 1 was a monk. All have been commended by the authorities or given bonuses and certificates.

Since there are students, Miao people, and monks among the young men who voluntarily enlist, it can be seen how deeply the trend of volunteer soldiers in Guizhou has penetrated into all levels of society, all villages, and all remote mountainous areas.

Everyone should not think that these 298 people are too small a number and not pay attention to it. All trends are gradually formed. Taking Libo County as an example, because the Song Dengbang brothers competed to serve in the military, the news spread, and as many as 11 people volunteered to enlist.

The reasons for the rise of the trend of volunteer soldiers in Guizhou are: (1) It is due to prior publicity. The local military district has organized ten propaganda teams that regularly tour various counties to carry out various propaganda activities. (2) It is effective because of post-event encouragement. Administrative agencies at all levels, all schools, all organizations, and even all sectors of the public, hold enthusiastic farewell parties whenever young men voluntarily enlist, and the Provincial Women's Sports Committee also organizes women's comfort teams to frequently visit them. (3) It succeeds because young men follow suit. The general public has accepted the propaganda and is ashamed of being comfortable and happy to go to difficulties. They also feel that asking for a gun and killing the enemy is a supreme honor. Naturally, the idea of following suit arises in their minds.

Chairman Wu Dingchang said to his subordinates on New Year's Day this year: "This year's work, military service is the first." Recently, he himself has been constantly going to Qian East, Qian South, Qian North, and drought-stricken areas to inspect military service work and attend military service military training meetings, which shows his importance to military service.

Now, military service sections have been widely established in various counties, and the military service work in the province has made amazing achievements.

In short, the compatriots of Guizhou, who have always been known as "the people have no three cents of silver," have made their best efforts and achieved the best results on the military service issue, which has become a major factor in supporting the war. It is hoped that the trend of volunteer soldiers can quickly spread throughout the country, making the invaders tremble before us. (Central News Agency)

### The Japanese Army Induces and Threatens Us to Make Peace (Continued from yesterday)

— Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya

The Japanese Army's Anti-War Sword

The Sino-Japanese war has only lasted two years, and the flaws in Japan's interior are being exposed more and more every day. In addition to the news that we often see in the newspapers about mass suicides by Japanese soldiers, explosions of ammunition depots, and mutinies in various places, which are all gratifying and commendable news, the reporter also received a letter from a friend, Mr. Fan Jack, who actually participated in the war, which also describes the serious facts related to leaflets in the Japanese army. Mr. Fan used to work in the news industry, but he joined the military academy in his early years, so since the War of Resistance, he joined the XXX Army as a company commander. He said in his letter:

"During the Battle of Taierzhuang, the quality of the soldiers was very good. They were all young people in their twenties, and they did not retreat even after fierce fighting. Their advantages can be seen. However, the recent soldiers are a mixture of young and old. At the beginning of the battle, they often abandoned their weapons and fled, and some even wailed and sobbed. Senior commanders had no choice but to strictly organize supervision teams to try to remedy the situation, so infighting and killing each other was also common.

"The XXX War Zone, which is famous for the scenery of Jiangnan, has been constantly flying with drizzle recently. We arrived here, just in time for Jiangxi XX County to be recovered by our XX Division. We picked up three kinds of anti-war leaflets from the Japanese army on the edge of the city, all in fluent Japanese, with the following Chinese translations:

"Gentlemen, to enslave China is like a dream!"

"It is better to be a dog than to sacrifice ourselves for this invasion!"

"Gentlemen, do you know where the funds in the Tokyo treasury have gone!"

"The above three anti-war slogans, which are like sharp swords deeply inserted into the minds of Japanese soldiers, are all signed "Volunteers of the South China Expeditionary Army." We judged from the grammar, font, paper quality, and printing that these leaflets definitely came from Japan. The internal political chaos in Japan, the decline of the soldiers' will to fight, and the pervasive anti-war atmosphere can all be seen from this."

Mr. Fan's original letter is very long, but just the above paragraph alone has already outlined a profound picture of all the internal contradictions of Japan using a metaphor.

I would also like to summarize with one sentence: The many leaflets that the Japanese army spread to us on the northern battlefield had no effect at all, and the anti-war giant scorpion brewing inside them is so formidable. We only need to continue our efforts on the front line of the War of Resistance for a considerable period of time, and then their tragedy of military, political, and economic collapse will immediately continue to be staged! (The End)

### Japan Launches an Anti-British Frenzy Arita Emphasizes Domination of China Tokyo Thugs Threaten British Envoy

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The criticism of future Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident by the Japanese political and press circles has become increasingly sharp. Major General Muto, the leader of the Japanese delegation, told the press that Japan would raise the broad issue of foreign concessions. Muto said that Japan's military operations in China "have been constantly hampered by the activities of anti-Japanese elements in foreign concessions for the past two years," and specifically mentioned Shanghai and Tianjin, calling Tianjin "the center of Communist activities and incitement in North China." Muto concluded that "peace" is impossible without strict control of the British concession. Representatives of Japanese "patriotic" groups used even tougher tones. The "National Federation of Workers and Peasants" paraded in front of the British Embassy and sent a resolution to the U.S. Embassy, warning Britain that "Britain's anti-Japanese attitude during the Sino-Japanese War is sufficient to hinder peace in the Far East." The resolution also strongly stated that the "national people" of Japan are determined to support the government and the military, and demanded that Britain fundamentally change its Far Eastern policy. Tokyo "student" groups also sent similar demands to British Ambassador Craigie. Tokyo newspapers said that the negotiations would be a turning point in Anglo-Japanese relations. One newspaper, "Yomiuri Shimbun," called Britain "Japan's biggest enemy" and said that "eliminating Britain's potential power in the Far East is beneficial to mankind and justice." The newspaper also strongly criticized domestic pro-British politicians, financiers, diplomats, and university professors as "abominable." (Haitong News Agency, Milan, 9th) The Italian "Il Popolo d'Italia's" correspondent in Tokyo, in an audience with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, stated that Japan had decided to establish a "new order" in the Far East, and that Japan would be hostile to any third country that attempted to undermine Japan's implementation of this policy. Japan is determined to "prosper" East Asia, but believes that it cannot thoroughly implement this plan as long as China remains a "semi-colony." The recent Tianjin incident was caused by the fact that foreign concessions in China are the base for anti-Japanese "terrorists." Therefore, the issue of lifting the blockade depends on the situation. Arita then reiterated the declaration of former Prime Minister Konoe, saying that Japan "respects" China's sovereignty and that "the Japanese government is now considering abolishing extraterritoriality in China."

Japan Continues to Kowtow to the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 7th] Although conflicts occur from time to time on the border between Mongolia and "Manchukuo," Japan and the Soviet Union still maintain normal diplomatic relations. When Japanese Ambassador Shigenori Togo visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky yesterday, the discussion was limited to the dispute between the Sakhalin Island Japanese merchant oil and coal mining company and the Soviet trade union, and no other matters were mentioned. Regarding this matter, the Soviet court fined the company 630,000 rubles because the goods supplied by the company to Soviet workers were inferior to those stipulated in the contract. Now the Japanese government has also acknowledged the Soviet side's accusations, but has requested a reduction in the fine.

France and the Netherlands Emphasize the Far Eastern Situation

(Central News Agency, Paris, 8th) The development of the Far Eastern situation is being closely watched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to reports received here, when British and Japanese authorities conduct negotiations in Tokyo, the Japanese side intends to discuss the Tianjin British Concession incident and also involve the current system of general concessions. If this is true, the United States and France should step forward to negotiate in order to avoid setting a precedent that would be detrimental in the future.

[Haitong News Agency, The Hague, 8th] According to well-informed sources, Queen Wilhelmina's intervention in the Dutch government's cabinet crisis was due to the tense international situation and the desire to quickly resolve the cabinet's difficulties. The Queen not only invited the speakers of both houses of parliament and the vice-president of the Privy Council to participate in the consultations, but also the former Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Jonkheer and the Chief of General Staff of the Army and Navy were invited. The participation of senior military officials in the meeting led political circles to speculate that the development of the Dutch military position and the Far Eastern situation will have a decisive impact on the formation of the new government. General public opinion is deeply satisfied with the Queen's move. "De Telegraaf" speaks for public opinion, stating that for the sake of national interests and overseas property, all domestic opinions must be abandoned. Public hope is that Prime Minister Dr. Colijn is undoubtedly the most outstanding politician in the Netherlands and will be empowered to overcome all obstacles and form a new government.

### The UK, France and the Soviet Union Negotiations are in Progress The UK Intensifies its Military Build-up Air Defense and Navy Make Rapid Progress

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 9th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the British and French ambassadors and British special envoy Strang for two hours yesterday afternoon, but the results have not been announced by either side.

[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The British and French ambassadors and British diplomatic envoy Strang met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lotov this evening for two hours and fifteen minutes. Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Bodankin was also present. Negotiations are continuing and another meeting is expected soon.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again received British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Foreign Office envoy Strang today, and the talks lasted about two hours.

[Reuters, London, 9th] According to the naval correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," the British Navy's massive shipbuilding program is being intensified. As a result, a new fleet will be launched in a few months. Three cruisers will be launched simultaneously within two days next week, including the Marignia and the Dido on the 18th, and the Mauritius on the 19th. The Riginia and Mauritius are both 8,000 tons, while the Dido is 5,000 tons. In the following months, the 35,000-ton Duke of York and Batti, and the 23,000-ton aircraft carriers Victoria and Formidable will be launched. After that, there will be four cruisers and a number of destroyers and submarines that will be launched one after another. In general, this summer's naval magnetism can be said to have reached its peak, and there is still the possibility of further intensification in the future.

[Reuters, London, 8th] According to British Lieutenant General Mallory's speech in Birmingham today, Britain's air defense is now tight, and enemy aircraft that dare to attack rashly will be crushed.

### The U.S. Government Persuades Senators To Support the Government

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The U.S. government is now planning to restore President Roosevelt's old trick of dealing with a certain number of senators last year. Secretary of State Hull and other senior government officials have taken action to persuade Senators Gillette and George to vote in favor of the government's neutrality bill. Of the 23 members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 11 support President Roosevelt's proposals. All the others, except Gillette and George, are opposed, while the attitude of the two is hesitant and they have stated that they have not yet decided how to vote on the Neutrality Act. The Foreign Relations Committee will meet on Tuesday to decide on the form of the Neutrality Act to be submitted to the Senate. The government now believes that the bill can be successfully passed in the Senate, but it is afraid of even the slightest chance of failure, which lies with the Foreign Relations Committee.

### Moving Towards the Path of Slaughter! Germany Recruits 400,000 New Soldiers Deadline for Response is September 9th Italy's Military Expenditures Cause Financial Panic

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] According to a report from the Berlin Announcement Office today, the number of people being called up in Germany will reach 400,000. Those being called up are those who have not received any military service and were born in 1906, 1907, 1910, and 1913 to 1920. They will go for inspection between July 7th and September 9th of this year. The announcement only said that the personnel being called up will engage in labor service or military service. It is expected that young people will engage in labor service. Military officers said that this move is purely normal, but the crowds watching the announcement, given the speed of the call-up and the large number of people being called up, are predicting one after another. Everyone believes that September 9th, the deadline for the call-up, may be a major day. According to the current planned procedure, that time coincides with the last day of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg Congress. (Reuters, Rome, 8th) Italy's next year's budget (until next June) is still short of 60 million pounds. A quarter of the entire budget will be used for national defense.

### Danzig is Temporarily Calm Paris Observes the European Situation Germany Schemes for Slovakia

[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] Observers here recently stated that the Danzig issue has now returned to temporary calm, but Germany may take action on the Slovak State. This can be seen from the German authorities' decision to immediately repair all military highways in the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. In addition, the German army is conducting large-scale exercises in the central region, and other departments also seem to be actively preparing militarily. In view of these various actions, it is not unfounded to worry. As for the city of Danzig, the situation has eased, and it may not change within a certain period of time. This can be seen from the fact that the German head of state has gone to rest at the Berghof villa in Berchtesgaden, and Polish President Moscicki has also left the capital to spend the summer. In general, after the British and French authorities issued a firm statement, if the Danzig issue is attempted to be resolved by violence, it is difficult to hope that it will be a local event. In addition, German wheat is ripe and will soon begin to be harvested. It is not suitable for a large-scale action during this busy farming season. All of these factors are well-known to the German authorities.

[Reuters, Danzig, 8th] The situation in Danzig remains unchanged. Coastal defenses are being actively improved. A large number of Polish dockworkers have been dismissed. The Nazi Party newspaper said that the construction being carried out on the coast is to build a "children's playground."

### The Inseparable Fate of Europe and Asia

— London Correspondence, Shu Di

(1) A Very Clear Example

The inseparable fate of Europe and Asia could not be more powerfully illustrated than by these two recent events. The first was a little over two weeks ago when the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement was the talk of the town. Suddenly, Japan in the Far East created a tense situation on the Mongolian border. The meaning was clear: in the event that Britain directly formed a full military alliance with Soviet Russia, it would have to first consider the possibility of being drawn into war with Japan. The British government immediately sensed this intention, but most reactions were dismissive. Britain had much larger considerations in mind regarding the importance of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. At the time, it seemed that Japan, perhaps combined with Franco's Spain, did not weigh as heavily as Turkey on the scales of the British government's considerations regarding whether or not to ally with the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the early days of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, Britain preferred to intensify contact with Turkey while indifferently setting aside Japan and Spain. Later, once it was confirmed that Spain's joining the German-Italian axis had become an irreversible fact, the weight on the side of the scales opposing an alliance with the Soviet Union was greatly reduced.

It is true that, because of the difficult birth of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, they took the opportunity to show goodwill to the Japanese government. It is also true that some British people often cited Japan's attitude as one of their excuses against a complete alliance with the Soviet Union. However, the progress and difficulties of this Anglo-Soviet negotiation had little direct relationship with Japan's opposition.

However, even so, if the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance had already been established today, then the current situation in the Far East, with Japan's demands on Britain in Tianjin, would not have occurred. Japan probably misunderstood the weight its Mongolian border demonstration carried in hindering the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. So, perhaps it was thinking: if Britain was afraid of Japan's power and was even hesitant to ally with Soviet Russia, then, due to the same fear, what was to prevent Britain from submitting to Japan's threats regarding its attitude towards the Sino-Japanese war? Thus, it boldly put forward a demand that Britain could never accept: complete cooperation with Japan to create a "New Order in East Asia!"

However, the matter is not so simple. This sudden move by Japan is largely rooted in the current European situation. What exactly is the current situation in Europe? This is beyond the scope of this article, but the overall situation can be summarized in three points: First, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have made no progress, and there is probably little hope in the near future. Second, Germany and Italy are planning to create another crisis in Europe. Third, Germany and Italy are still working to win over Japan.

It is now very clear to everyone that Japan's current coercion of Britain is actually its final bargaining chip on whether or not to join the German-Italian axis. After this failure, it will probably formally join the German-Italian-Western group and establish a military alliance with them. Therefore, in the past two days, the Japanese ambassador to Italy has arrived in Berlin to cooperate with his German counterpart in maintaining close contact with the German authorities. At the same time, from the standpoint of urging the early realization of the German-Italian-Japanese-Spanish military alliance, Hitler naturally approves of Japan making such a provocative attempt to test Chamberlain's current cabinet.

Perhaps the Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance will appear after the German-Japanese-Italian-Spanish military alliance.

(2) A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity

In the past two days, British newspapers have been filled with accounts of the insults inflicted on Britain by Japanese soldiers and ruffians in Tianjin. Public opinion is at its peak. However, upon closer observation, one can immediately discover that this is not alarming. Britain now has a clear and accurate assessment of Japan's economy, military strength, manpower, and all other aspects. Britain does not currently want to go to war with Japan. However, they believe that Japan's difficult situation makes it even less likely to risk a large-scale conflict with Britain, or even the danger of a large-scale conflict.

I have had many discussions with some British people about this matter in the past two days. Their unanimous conclusion is that the focus of the issue is whether the current British government under Prime Minister Chamberlain is willing to make a firm decision. If so, then even thoroughly sanctioning Japan and ending the Japanese invasion of China in one fell swoop would not be difficult. Moreover, now is the best time.

Their reasons are: (1) Although the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is difficult to achieve, their positions on supporting China are largely consistent. So, at a time when this alliance is difficult to achieve, it may be worthwhile to conduct a concrete experiment in cooperation on the issue of supporting China as the first step towards a future alliance. (2) The American fleet has been redeployed to the Pacific, and yet a full-scale war has not broken out, and Japan is most afraid of the United States. (3) The Soviet Russian Far East Red Army has an absolute advantage over the Japanese forces stationed in Manchuria, and yet Germany and Italy are currently powerless in the West, and Japan is most afraid of Soviet Russia. (4) Japan's war against China has completely fallen into a passive position. Therefore, if Chamberlain's current government truly makes a firm decision to sanction Japan, the situation and the war can be relatively straightforward and predictable. For example: First, contact the Chinese government and guarantee large-scale material assistance from Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States. The Chinese side should immediately launch a full-scale general offensive. Second, correspondingly, the Soviet Union should concentrate a large amount of military force in the Far East, posing a most fatal threat to Japan. Third, the British, American, and French navies in the Far East should concentrate in certain areas and hold demonstrations. Then, fourth, send Japan an ultimatum and convene an international conference such as the Nine-Power Conference to resolve all disputes between China and Japan. In that case, Japan would only have two paths before it: either to submit to pressure and end its war of aggression against China, or to go further and join the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Spain.

"Perhaps there is a greater possibility of taking the latter path," I said.

"Not necessarily. Because in that case, even the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Spain would be very problematic and could not be relied upon as a backing for Japan." Moreover, at the very least, "this can promote the formal establishment of a global anti-aggression front."

As for the attitude of China, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, it can be said that there is no problem. As long as Britain is firm.

The current situation is so clear, and the British authorities are fully aware of these things. Therefore, in the past two days, according to what we have been able to know and see, Britain has been issuing subtle warnings to Japan, formally, privately, and through public opinion: "Danger!" "Danger!" "Your fatal point is already here!" "If we take action!" ... and so on.

(3) The Current British Government's Considerations

If the Japanese militarists are completely numb to the above situation, that may not be the case. They probably anticipated that the current British government would never make the above move. That is why they dare to be so carefree and casually insulting to Britain. However, we must know that Britain's current basic position in the Far East will absolutely not change due to Japan's disturbances. Moreover, the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is in progress, and the Sino-British relationship is at its closest. The only consideration of the British government now is how to find the most suitable way for itself in these complex international relations to get through Japan's current coercion. On the British side, there are still very many ways to do this. However, if Japan stubbornly sticks to its own opinions and mistakenly believes that Britain's uncertain actions are due to weakness or to force it to cooperate and create a "New Order in East Asia," then, in the end, Britain may be forced to take the thorough approach mentioned above.

I repeat here once again: To think that Britain and Japan can cooperate to create a "New Order in East Asia" is absolutely impossible from any angle under the current situation! Absolutely impossible! (Sent from London on June 16)

### Reuters Reporter Visits Forbidden Area in Danzig

[Reuters Danzig, 8th] The local National Socialist Party newspaper stated that a "children's playground" is being built on Mount Bischofsberg, a forbidden area overlooking the entire city of Danzig. A Reuters reporter made a special trip to visit today. As soon as the reporter started up the hillside, he saw many East Prussian military trucks speeding to the top of the mountain, stirring up sand. Guards were stationed along the way, and the top of the mountain was surrounded by barbed wire. Through a hastily constructed fortification, the reporter saw anti-aircraft guns being built. Two guards immediately confiscated the camera carried by the reporter and took him to the guard room. There, a team of workers was building a barracks that was about to be completed under armed guard. More than fifty military trucks, all marked with East Prussia, were parked on the square. The reporter explained to an official that he had come to visit the "children's playground" that was being built. The officer couldn't help but smile and said, "But we are here" (meaning that it is not a real children's playground, but a playground for soldiers). The reporter then asked, "Will soldiers wearing uniforms and equipped with automatic rifles use this playground?" The colonel replied, "This will depend on the future, but I hope not."

### British Aid to China Committee Pays Respects to Chairman Chiang, Celebrated Figures Deliver Speeches at July 7th Luncheon, Praising the Great Future of Our Nation

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] Today marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the war between China and Japan. The British Aid to China Movement Committee held a luncheon at noon. The keynote speech was delivered by the famous writer, Harold Stannard, who expressed his admiration for China's resistance. He stated, in brief, that "Our belief in the common culture of humanity is fortunately maintained by the experiences of the Chinese nation, and that which has been lost is restored. The importance of China's position is such that this is a belief that has not been lost, and that under certain circumstances, it is indispensable for those who understand the East. A great nation such as the Chinese nation, when it encounters oppression, will inevitably have new advantages, that is, human advantages, spontaneously emerge. Looking at countries around the world, none makes us feel more that the future is unlimited than China. The events that have occurred in that country are of a great nature, surpassing those that have occurred in other parts of the world. In a word, China is now moving towards a fulfilling and abundant life, and I am very happy to cooperate with this movement." The Aid to China Movement Committee also sent a telegram to General Chiang Kai-shek in China on the same day, expressing their respects in commemoration.

Brief Comments

### Japanese × Rampant Anti-British Sentiment

In recent days, world newspapers have been filled with news of the Japanese × anti-British movement.

Why is Japan × anti-British? First, they want to intimidate Britain before the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, forcing Britain to abandon its policy of supporting China. Second, they are preparing to monopolize, consolidate, and manage the occupied areas in China.

We must recognize here: (1) Anti-British is the first step towards anti-Western Europe and the United States. (2) Britain and Western Europe and the United States cannot compromise with Japan, whether on moral grounds or in terms of interests. (3) The Western European and American powers can only use force against force and an eye for an eye.

As for us in China, based on the experience of two years of resistance, what × people like is a disaster for our country, and what × people hate is to our country's advantage. Therefore, if Japanese × like to be anti-British, we must oppose anti-British. If Japanese × hate Britain, we must be even more pro-British!

However, Japanese × anti-British sentiment is by no means because Britain supports China. We are pro-British, and we are by no means dependent on Britain. Here, the rumors that are being spread at the behest of Japanese ×, talking about anti-communism and peace, and also advocating that Britain is about to force us to surrender, have no basis whatsoever! Here, the principle of striving for foreign aid while taking self-reliance as the basis must be thoroughly realized!

### War Situation on the Southeast Coast

The battles in the southeastern coastal provinces have suddenly become tense in the past few days. This is the first step in our strategic effort to achieve greater victories.

The Japanese × have recently landed in Shantou, Chaozhou, Yuhuan, Dinghai Mountain, Shishi, and other places. Their purpose is: (1) To cover up the inability of their army to attack on all fronts. (2) To threaten the position of Britain and France in the Far East. (3) To echo Germany and Italy. Therefore, it has no impact on our military.

However, the Japanese × harassment on the coast also contains an attempt to support their political offensive militarily and economically, in order to facilitate their organization into a central government, and to facilitate their use of the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of our Southeast.

Therefore, our counter-offensive in the southeastern provinces and the expansion of combat behind enemy lines, such as the recent attacks on Jiangmen and Guangzhou, and cutting off the Beijing-Shanghai railway, are of very great significance. In the future, we must also cooperate with large-scale anti-Wang Jingwei movement to achieve greater victories.

### London Newspaper Industry Concentrates Offices, Reuters Moves to New Location

### The Current Situation and Future of the War of Resistance

— Gao Shan

New Situation and New Crisis

Two years of heroic resistance, the Japanese ×× are not embarrassed in front of our entire Chinese nation! Their "not but yielding" top strategy has failed, their "quick battle quick decision" secondary strategy has failed, and their "quick peace quick conclusion" next strategy has also failed. Finally, when we had been resisting for a year, they tried to conquer us by occupying Wuhan, but in the end we still did not yield, we still did not recognize them, and all their attempts failed. After that, they had to admit: "The Sino-Japanese War has entered a new stage"; they had to admit that "the real beginning of the war is after the occupation of Wuhan"; they had to issue the lament of "preparing to fight a hundred-year war with China"!

The facts have made it clear to the Japanese × that they must adapt to the new stage of the war and decide on new methods to overcome difficulties. However, they are even more aware that to overcome the difficulties they are encountering in China today, they cannot rely on Japan's own population, land, and production. All of these have been almost exhausted in the past war of aggression against China. Therefore, they have adopted a new strategy of aggression against China that combines military, political, and economic means, using China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to solve their difficulties.

This new strategy shows that the main aim of the Japanese ×× is to rely on political power, combined with military action, to rule the occupied areas of China and to invade the unoccupied China, in order to achieve the goal of annexing all of China and monopolizing East Asia. Therefore, they have proposed to establish a "New Order" in East Asia, and they have proposed to establish a cooperative political system between China, Japan, and Manchuria. This all shows that the Japanese × want to completely use political methods, combined with military action, to annex China under the rule of the Japanese ××, in order to monopolize East Asia. The main direction of the Japanese × invasion of China has been placed in the occupied areas, in eastern China, North China, Central China, and South China, the entire area east of the Yellow River, and east of the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou railways. This is also the most populous, most fertile, and most productive area in eastern China. They want to use the rule of this area to absorb China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to attack and conquer our country.

The facts of the eight or nine months since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan have completely proven that the Japanese × are doing their best to promote this new strategy. Under this overall policy, they have adopted "leapfrog tactics" and "using war to support war" militarily. The so-called "leapfrog tactics" is to use their possession of important cities and transportation lines, their possession of modern mechanized troops, and the mobility of their troops to compensate for their insufficient and dispersed forces, to compensate for the disappearance of attack targets, to raid and occupy our weaker points and places, to gradually destroy our counter-offensive forces, and to wipe out guerrillas in the occupied areas, in order to expand the borders of their occupied areas and consolidate the rule of the occupied areas. The so-called "using war to support war" is to use this "leapfrog tactics" to strengthen the occupied areas and ensure their governance, to use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources in the occupied areas to supplement and increase their combat power, and to gradually realize the annexation of all of China. Politically, on the one hand, they are doing their best to consolidate the rule of the occupied areas, using deceptive propaganda and false appeasement to establish and consolidate the puppet regimes and puppet organizations in the occupied areas, and then using Wang Jingwei to actively prepare to organize a unified puppet central government or a puppet federal government, in order to promote the "using war to support war" strategy, and to use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to attack and conquer our country. On the other hand, they are intensifying their efforts to prevent China's political progress, intensifying their efforts to destroy our anti-Japanese national united front based on ××××, and intensifying their efforts to create wavering and pessimistic emotions in us about the protracted war of resistance, in order to achieve internal division, separation, and disputes in our country, and to end the war of resistance against Japan. For this purpose, they are currently using the "peace, anti-communism, anti-Chiang, pro-Soviet" arguments advocated by Wang Jingwei and others, doing everything possible to seduce some national scum, wavering elements, stubborn elements, and unscrupulous elements who still exist in our country, who still want to betray the country for personal gain, and doing everything possible to find a second Wang Jingwei in our country. In addition, they have also launched various offensives in the economic and cultural spheres, such as attacking the legal currency, such as taking foreign exchange, such as blockading the Tianjin concession, forcibly occupying Shantou and Dinghai, coveting Fuzhou and Wenzhou, in order to rob property, monopolize commerce, such as buying newspapers and schools, and intimidating those who uphold justice. They are truly shameless, despicable, and unscrupulous! Finally, in diplomacy, recently, on the one hand, they have expanded the anti-British movement, and on the other hand, they have expanded provocations against the Soviet Union, using the means of enticement and intimidation to force the British government, the weakest link in the anti-aggression front, to compromise with Japan, and attempt to jointly pressure our country to surrender under the beastly feet of the Japanese ×.

Spring and Autumn

### The Death of D'Annunzio

Unable to Live, Even More Difficult to Seek Death

Italy's greatest poet—forgive the impudence, in his own words, he should be "the world's greatest poet"—dramatist, and battlefield hero Gabriele D'Annunzio, finally met with the most heartbreaking thing, which was also what he had painstakingly tried to prevent for twenty years—that is "death," an ordinary "death," an unmoving death. Naturally, he was not afraid of death, but he always wanted an extraordinary "death." But now he passed away peacefully and quietly like an ordinary person, dying in his sleep. What an unpleasant thing for this great and world-renowned figure!

D'Annunzio was a great poet, a flying general, the hero of the Fiume incident, a loyal follower of Fascism, and also a "romantic seed," like a most wonderful drama. His life was full of climaxes, one after another winning endless applause. So he tried hard to make his death an even greater climax, so that after the curtain fell, people would still give a standing ovation, leaving a deep and indelible impression in people's minds. This matter, from any point of view, was very reasonable.

He planned many shocking ways to die. Unfortunately, each one had its difficulties. In the garden of his villa on Lake Garda, there was a huge Italian war cannon. He thought: wouldn't it be delightful and easy to stand in front of the muzzle and be blown into dust with a single shot? However, this required someone to cooperate, but the person firing the cannon would bear the crime of murder, and no one was willing to help him complete this earth-shattering death.

When the Abyssinian crisis occurred, there was a tense atmosphere between Italy and Britain, and he would never let the opportunity pass. He immediately decided on a good idea. He volunteered, requesting the military authorities to allow him to pilot a plane loaded with high explosives to bomb American battleships. He planned that, after selecting a target, he would make a swift dive, crashing into the deck of the battleship, so that the plane, battleship, and poet would all perish together. The method was not bad, and there was a high possibility of hitting the target. Although D'Annunzio was old and had only one eye, his heroic spirit of that year was still there!... Unfortunately, Britain and Italy had a period of empty threats, and everything was resolved peacefully. D'Annunzio's ambition was unfulfilled, and how heartbroken he was!

As a last resort, jumping into a volcano was also not bad, either nearby Mount Vesuvius or Quimbo Li volcano… However, when he learned that thousands of Japanese people were all committing suicide by jumping into volcanoes, he immediately abandoned the original plan. How could a great poet stoop to follow in the footsteps of others?

Similarly, he also gave up a poetic way to die: arranging a small bedroom in the villa, filled with roses of various colors treated with poison, then falling asleep in the flowers, dying in the fragrant, poisonous atmosphere… An uninvited friend told him that a Frenchman had also committed suicide in this way before, so this path was also blocked.

In terms of love, he was a ruthless demon, heartlessly playing with two actresses, Duse and Ida, and then discarding them like worn-out shoes. At one point, he fervently hoped that one of them would hate him so much that she would run over and kill him, so he could die by the beautiful hands of a woman. Unfortunately, neither of the two women seemed to have such courage. Duse was depressed and unhappy, carrying a broken heart until she faded away. Ida, on the other hand, ran to him, asking to remain a spiritual friend. The poet became furious and let out dogs to bite her, but the dogs were not up to the task and instead showed extraordinary affection for Ida.

The most exciting method was cryopreservation. It sounded easy: all he needed was for a pilot to fly him to the source of a large glacier in Greenland. Once there, he would parachute onto the glacier. The last thing he had to do was simply pose in the most beautiful and solemn manner, sit on the ice, and let the low temperature slowly freeze him to death. In this way, his body would be frozen in the ice, becoming part of the glacier.

The movement of glaciers is very slow. A hundred or two hundred years later, the body would flow downstream with the ice, and someone would eventually discover this "snow-covered poet," and newspapers and magazines would be in an uproar again, achieving the goal of attracting attention. To take a step back, even if he were not discovered, the fact that the poet had disappeared would surely be known to every household and everyone would know about it. However, the trouble arose again. Who would be willing to take him to his final destination?

Finally, he discovered a relatively simple method. One day, he was listening languidly to a conversation between two film technicians and heard the phrase:

"Chemical dissolution!"

A great revelation! In the age of scientific prosperity, is there no solution that can dissolve the human body completely, leaving not a single hair, tooth, or bone, without corroding the enamel of the bathtub? A few months later, a friend received a letter from him saying that he had found a potent acidic liquid that could dissolve the human body completely, leaving not a single hair, tooth, or bone, without corroding the enamel of the bathtub. He planned to take one last bath in this acid. In a moment, all that the great poet would leave in the world would be a little sediment at the bottom of the tub. What he asked of this friend was to come into the bathroom a few minutes later, drain the acidic liquid and the dregs at the bottom of the tub, and rinse it clean with water, ensuring that no trace was left behind. And this friend must keep his mouth shut, not revealing his whereabouts, so that this mysterious disappearance would become a great mystery in the world, and D'Annunzio's name would not be quickly forgotten.

At the same time, he wrote to another friend:

"I want to astonish the whole world with my death... I want to turn into a fragrance, mingling between heaven and earth. I will evaporate into countless tiny molecules. I will never rot in an ordinary tomb. Can you imagine 'Gabriele D'Annunzio' being killed in a hearse, sent to be buried by a group of wailing mourners and fools? Believe me, I will die in the most thought-provoking manner."

Indeed, the extraordinary D'Annunzio should have an extraordinary death.

In eleven days, it would be his seventy-fifth birthday. People generally believed that his death might be staged on that day, adding to the interest.

Unfortunately, the god of death could not wait any longer. The disease of cerebral hemorrhage—alas, this is not new. Cerebral hemorrhage has killed many people at sea, on land, and in the air—quickly took his life, so quickly that he did not even have time to put down the pen he was writing with, and the ink on the paper had not dried. Without any prior notice, it suddenly ruined the planned climax. A good drama turned into a dog's tail, D'Annunzio must have died with his eyes open. If it were possible, I believe he would be very willing to be resurrected and perform a more exciting and moving ending again.

"Hey! Friend, a little air, okay? I'm getting married tomorrow!"

### Weather Forecast

The puppet regime's wars are intermittent, stopping and starting, which is truly annoying. And what's most annoying is that while the official reports sound fierce, Reuters and the Central News Agency have nothing to say. It's really baffling.

Tokyo's ruling is set to begin next Wednesday. A message to our friends: be true friends and stand up straight.

German troops are building a "children's playground" in Danzig (?). Who would have thought that the German army also understands the art of reversing aging.

Everyone who goes to Hong Kong knows that there are swimming pools and sea swimming areas. This bay and that cove. But some people insist on swimming in the open sea, and as a result, they drown. It's really strange. Why don't these people go and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Repulse Bay?

Although the Legislative Council has passed an ordinance to protect tenants, there are still many landlords who are evicting tenants and raising rents. But homeowners who have houses that are about to collapse cannot see it. A message to landlords: quickly repair your houses. If they collapse, you will not only lose rent but also have to pay compensation.

### Snippets

Someone went to a tailor's house to have clothes made. The tailor stared at the fabric for a long time, unwilling to cut it. The owner asked him why. He replied: "If I cut this fabric, if you have yours, then I won't have mine. If I have mine, then you won't have yours. What should I do?"

### Believe It or Not

From the perspective of psychologists, European dictators are just like children. Each has different stages of psychological development. The countries of those dictators, in particular, are just like one-year-old boys, with a rebellious spirit, secret plans, militarism, uniforms, salutes, waving flags and shouting, and even oppressing women, all of which are typical actions of eleven-year-olds.

### One Person a Day

Yesterday, we talked about General Feng's shaving his beard. Today, I remembered former US President Hoover's growing a beard.

After graduating from Stanford University, Hoover worked as a secretary for a famous engineer for a while. Later, although he was promoted to engineering affairs, his salary was meager and he was frustrated.

One day, an opportunity came. Someone recommended him to a mining company in London to work as an engineer with an annual salary of seventy-five hundred gold dollars. The number made people laugh from the bottom of their hearts. However, there was a condition attached: the person taking office must be over thirty-five years old.

How disappointing! It would have been great if President Hoover had been born ten years earlier. But now, could he just watch the great opportunity slip away? No, President Hoover was not such a useless person.

Two weeks later, he arrived in London to meet with the Xinjiang chief's special envoy. He had two extra drooping mustaches on his face. As soon as the new chief saw him, he exclaimed:

"After all, you Americans have the skill to make people look old. Look at you, you don't even look twenty-five years old!"

### Sea Adventures 22

— By Captain Lauton, translated by Yang Bi

Previous Summary

In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Chukes Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, took advantage of the German ship going to Mexico to greet the new year. Because England and Germany had declared war, the British warship was coming to rob the ship. The ship frantically escaped, barely escaping from the tiger's mouth and returning to New York. Chukes then asked them to take the St. Mark to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that the guy was a German spy named Raviki. Suddenly, the ship received a distress radio signal…

They stared for a while, and suddenly, something made their blood run cold. They looked at each other, uncertain.

In the darkness, a sound from the burning ship reached their ears. It seemed like a moan of suffering. It came repeatedly, sometimes high and sometimes low, like weeping and complaining. It was not a human voice. The sound seemed to contain the groans of a resentful ghost.

"Oh! This is a little scary!" Bill exclaimed, "What the heck is going on?"

Fourteen, Jump into the Sea

The boat was lowered into the water, and the strange sound continued. This mysterious atmosphere made the rough sailors tremble with fear. Several churchgoers piously made the sign of the cross on their chests.

"Damn it, it's really ghosts crying and wolves howling!" One muttered to himself.

Jack and Bill sat in the first boat, next to Mr. Wood. The boat was being lowered, and on the top, on the ship's railing, were a row of heads. They were all passengers watching the excitement. After falling to the surface of the water, a wave hit. Mr. Wood shouted loudly.

"We need to row away quickly, otherwise, we'll be crushed!"

At this time, the big ship was also undulating. The small boat really looked like it was going to hit her steel hull and be smashed to pieces. The small boat swayed forward against the waves. Giant waves came over them and dragged them back.

"The weather tonight is really not helping," Mr. Wood muttered to himself. The small boat then entered a layer of bottomless darkness. From the burning ship, there was another bloody red light, rushing up, covering the stern of the ship, revealing that it was a large, decaying steamer.

"Are there any passengers on board, do you think?" Jack asked, a little chilly, because the mournful sound was still coming out.

"It looks to me like it's a weird thing. I can't see its head, and it doesn't have an upper deck," Wood said.

"I didn't see anyone on it," Bill said, after looking carefully for a while. The small boat crossed another big wave.

"We just hope they all get away," Wood said. "But this weird scream is really disturbing! It's not human, so what the hell is it?"

"It's scaring me to death," Bill said, trembling.

As they got closer, the strange sound got louder and more miserable. The heat of the fire and the falling embers made them very uncomfortable.

The receiver is only one of the banks, for business reasons, is willing to pay the price of payment, but the price of the goods is slightly higher, because each exchange draft can still be spotted in the market to exchange for legal currency, so the value of foreign goods has not increased significantly due to foreign exchange, but has also been spotted, and the native goods of China have also risen accordingly, resulting in today's Shanghai living standards, but in terms of the government, its goal of restricting the import of foreign goods can be said to have been achieved, especially the resistance to Japanese goods is more effective, because merchants have always paid in exchange drafts.

### A Few Opinions on Popular Vernacular Literature and Art

— Huang Sheng

The popularization and massification of literature and art is a new direction and a new starting point for the development of Chinese literature and art. The adoption of this new direction and the setting of this new starting point is a self-awakening of literary and art workers, and at the same time, it is limited by the historical lessons of the development of Chinese literature. The War of Resistance is a driving force. Due to the change of political conditions, the urgency of the need is declared, and the awakening of literary and art workers is urged, a new stage of literary and artistic development is born.

From the above understanding, we can clearly see two points: First, the current vernacular literature and art movement is a new literary and art revolution; the specific content of this new literary and art revolution is the popularization and massification of literature and art; second, this movement is a product of the War of Resistance, and it has developed in response to the importance of the War of Resistance; and in wartime, it marks the beginning of a new stage of literary and artistic development, so it is not an emergency movement.

In this movement, those authors who still regard literature and art as something to be enjoyed by a few people will be ruthlessly abandoned by history. On the other hand, authors who create popular literature and art—mass literature and art—must understand the development significance of the current movement and produce works with the utmost caution. Theorists and critics must also point out the direction of creation and the shortcomings that should be avoided from the understanding of the movement and from the criticism of the works.

Authors of popular literature and art must first know that what they want is literature and art, not works other than literature and art. This goes without saying, but now some authors of popular literature and art have forgotten or ignored this point and written some odd things. Seven years ago, Qu Qiubai said: "If only a few abstract theories are written in a spoken style, it can be regarded as a literary work, then there is no need for a literary movement at all, because this is only a popular thesis. Literary works should go through concrete images... using descriptive methods, not deductive methods." Some authors have now forgotten the special properties of literature and art, or rigidly and mistakenly understand the educational nature of the works. Although the works "borrow" the format and tone of old literature and art, they are a lot of nouns and terms, with absolutely no description to express. This is undoubtedly going to fail.

What's worse is the use of local slang and vulgar words, putting very crude language in the works. Some authors think this is popular, this is colloquial. They don't know that this is not popular but vulgar; it is not colloquial, but a degradation of the art of language. The language of popular literature and art must be the folk language that has been selected and refined.

Secondly, using old forms to create popular literature and art means using the essence of the old forms, not accepting the dross and poison of the old forms. In order to adapt to the level and requirements of the broad masses, and at the same time, in order to improve the artistic taste of the broad masses, we want to create new forms. Using the old forms in this way has a future. We are using the old forms, and at the same time, we are destroying the old forms and creating new forms! We very much agree with Pu Feng's statement: "If you mechanically judge 'new' and 'old', then the new will never be separated from the 'old', and new forms can never be established. Conversely, if our things pass through the current era's view of life and our works have the reflection of real life, and are extremely close to the masses in form, but are definitely not like Five Watch Tunes, Wuxi Scenery, etc., which have a certain form, then it can be said that the new form has already been established."

Some authors now seem not to understand this point. When using old forms, they are trapped too painfully by the old forms, thus leading to two problems: First, "form goes to content" because the format is that way, you have to fill enough numbers. Second, form hinders content. The so-called form has a backlash effect on the content. As a result, the work is either lifeless or "disabled", not "pregnant with falseness" or "bound feet".

Again, for popular literature and art, some authors have another misunderstanding, thinking that popular literature and art is a crude and simple thing, so a single-story story is considered "goods". Yes, that is "goods". It is popular literature and art, a work that the masses can accept. However, it only stops at the masses being able to accept it, but it is not welcomed and loved by the masses. Since it is not welcomed and loved by the masses, then you have to admit failure.

We cannot see the masses as too incompetent and ignorant, without the ability to appreciate artistic works. On the contrary, we should all know that many old works are very rich in content and very complex in plot, and these works are loved by the masses. The masses love it for being fascinating and tasty. If our work cannot be fascinating and tasty, then we also have to admit failure. Popular literature and art is not easy to write. Constant effort is the only way to break through the difficulties; as Qu Qiubai said when discussing "mass literature and art": "After the actual" work begins, experience will tell us many new methods. "

### A Critique of Pearl Buck's "The Patriot"

— Wen Yu

The American female author, Pearl Buck, who won the 1938 Nobel Prize for Literature, has published her novel "The Patriot," which depicts China, this year. It is said that this book has not yet been completed, but it has already been selected as the best novel of March this year by the American Book Club. In our country's publishing industry, which loves the poor and weak, at least three translations have been produced simultaneously. The sensational nature of this novel can be imagined. However, our spiritual and mysterious country is not easily seen clearly even by ourselves. Especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, social reality has shown great turbulence, making it even more difficult for people to discern. Yet, we don't know what blessing we have received, but there is a famous artisan of the twentieth century to portray this image for us. Undoubtedly, we need to be grateful; however, the amount of gratitude needs to be carefully examined.

Wu Yifan, the son of a capitalist, may be a rebel from his class, a revolutionary fighter, which is very possible in semi-colonial China. However, behind this title, there are various inevitable and accidental factors. Only through his own internal struggle can he shed his rich clothes and enter the ranks of the city. In typical creations, this is the deciding factor for success or failure. Those who can completely depict it are successful, and those who do not mention it are unsuccessful. How does Pearl Buck grasp the character of Wu Yifan?

Without exception, she attributes his radical change to his own willfulness and unrestrainedness. "That was in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, and his family never dreamed that Yifan would become a revolutionary," she lightly mentions, assigning him the role of a revolutionary. Then, this character is merely conceptualized and not flesh and blood.

An excellent but weak youth cannot withstand the work of battle, yet he worked, training and organizing workers in Shanghai to prepare for the arrival of the revolutionary storm. He worked hard, educating people, and should have been educated himself, and he should have become steadfast. However, at the height of his vigor, he failed, he despaired, he forgot everything about his motherland, and he began to live in Japan, becoming a hedonist. He fell in love, and he only knew how to love his Zhu, passing ten years in a daze. He no longer had the passion for revolution and had transitioned from a visionary to someone who "relied on reality for survival." He settled down in the ebb of the revolution. This has its shadows in reality. However, we cannot see the bridge in between this kind of transformation, making it impossible to see a "typical character," and thus it is merely conceptualized, without flesh and blood.

Enlan is the second protagonist of "The Patriot." Undoubtedly, the author regards him as a typical fighter of the emerging class. Such a portrayal is insufficient, and it is better to say that the image of the fighter is distorted by the reverse reflection of a concave-convex lens. Enlan, this passionate, violent, and absurd character that we see, she (the author) cannot understand the perseverance and heroism of these mass fighters and leaders. She does not understand how they are connected to the masses and how they fight for him!

Mudan is obviously a secondary figure in the book, but she reveals that the author has no clear understanding of the new Chinese woman. She has not been able to see that the two generations, old and new, are completely different. She still believes that the new female fighters are still just like the old days, solving problems for their husbands, sewing for their husbands, and giving birth to children. She does not know that the new Chinese women are independently and heroically participating in the struggle of the masses!

The error of "typical character" is due to the error of grasping the "typical environment." The author has not been able to grasp the nature of Chinese society, and lacks understanding and sympathy for the Chinese revolution. She believes that China is already a capitalist society "ruled by bankers," obliterating the semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature of China. In this way, she has no way to grasp the twists and turns of the Chinese revolution. Everything in old China, I am afraid, is too tightly grasped in the author's memory. Therefore, she regards the emerging group as the "borrowed corpse returning the soul" of the nursing home. Her knowledge of the Chinese revolution is only superficial and shallow. How can she grasp the men and women in the revolutionary wave correctly?

Speaking of the War of Resistance, the opportunity and impetus for the birth of this pseudo-new China, the author's knowledge is too weak. She distorted the "Xi'an Incident" - strangely, why doesn't she read Snow's "Red Star Over China." She does not understand the reality of the construction of the Chinese united front, and she still believes that the Chinese army needs to be bought with money. She disregards the glorious fact that China treats prisoners of war with preferential treatment and imagines a story of the masses abusing prisoners of war and even getting Enlan's acquiescence. This is a defamation and an obligation to do malicious propaganda for Japan! These stains cannot be washed away!

She remembers the filth, opium, superstition, and poverty of China; the disorder of social order. She wrote a clear contrast, that is, Japan's order, cleanliness, love of beauty, and no beggars (?) ... She expresses the "patriotism" of the Japanese - regarding this, her praise is more than the needles. She does not understand the structure of Japanese society and also praises Japanese women. In her mind, the families of Yifan and Zhu are the most ideal families. What about her political thoughts? She wrote:

"He (Yifan) often thought about these things, who could rule the country after the war, how to revise the laws, what kind of laws should be used, he now knows that Enlan is not enough to be a ruler, enlightenment, learning, order, and elegance are needed in life, but Enlan doesn't know. Yifan feels that Zhu has changed his thinking, she taught him to love order, good nature and attitude, she has been separated from him for ten years, his ten years of living in Japan are enough to make him know everything, he has seen the people of Japan are more loyal to this kind of thing, their lives are more orderly, he dares not tell Enlan the strengths of the Japanese people, because Enlan may think that he praises the strengths of the Japanese and does not trust his loyalty. ... His thoughts are enough to show that he has grown up ... "

This passage is exactly the author's speech, expressing her doubts and vagueness about the future of China. Undoubtedly, everything in China, the Chinese revolution, and the great Chinese War of Resistance, are very vague to her.

In the Chinese War of Resistance, people are eager for understanding of Chinese society and the Chinese War of Resistance. The appearance of Pearl Buck's "The Patriot" is naturally a sensation. However, she cannot show us the posture of the new China emerging from the old China, but mixes the new and the old, the good and the bad, into a "chop suey" that obscures China's way out and future. This cannot improve the understanding of China by Europeans and Americans, but instead increases their misunderstanding of China. Moreover, the author intentionally uses our leader Chairman Chiang as an interlude character, which is nothing more than a technique to confuse readers and cater to the readers. Her cleverness, her attempt to distort reality, makes her works fragmented, false, and ridiculous. Naturally, her trivial descriptions and artistic techniques do give the work a brocade coat. However, she can cleverly reveal the courage of the Japanese army in the revolution, which can prove that she is also very loyal to reality; however, she does not understand China and does not understand China's War of Resistance. There is no doubt about this.

### Popularity and Vulgarity

— Han Bo

It is especially difficult to write "popular literature" that is far from "popularity" without becoming "vulgar."

Vulgar articles are not necessarily popular works, but once a work wants to make it popular, it is inevitable to be close to the danger of "vulgarity."

To explain this principle clearly, it seems necessary to analyze the characteristics of "popular literature." In the field of literature and art, the popular category is the closest to the masses and the most capable of playing a role in the masses. However, to achieve this level, it is very necessary to cater to the tastes of the masses, and to write folk stories in folk languages. This is the most prominent feature of "popular literature," and it is also the key to "popularity" easily turning into "vulgarity." In order to make the article popular, it is right to devote oneself to studying the tastes and interests of the masses, cater to them, and adapt to them. Only through this popular form can literature and art penetrate the masses and win over the masses; however, if one accidentally reverses the order of importance and blindly changes the content of one's article according to the needs of customs, then popular literature will lose its original purpose of improving the culture and level of the masses and changing the ideas of the masses, and fall into the realm of "vulgarity."

This transformation is really a subtle mystery, a terrible evil situation, and every popular art worker should not ignore it.

We can very well imagine how tasteless it is for a propaganda team to go to the people and only win a big laugh from the people with absurd and ridiculous lies. The ending of "popular literature" once it becomes "vulgar articles" is not much better than this. Now some people advocate using the materials of "love change" or that kind of material as the framework to start the work of popular literature. I am afraid that it will become vulgar articles unconsciously. In fact, the "popularity" of articles does not only lie in the low level of interest and the mediocrity of the topics. It is only necessary to tell the truth of the masses, be easy to understand, and the story is simple and tense. Are they not all excellent popular literature? The masses like to watch "Widow Ma Opening a Shop" and "Pan Jinlian," but they are also happy to accept "The Biography of Hong Yang Heroes" and the War of Resistance. The reason is not necessarily to cater to low-level tastes, but mostly because what the latter writes are things that the masses deeply understand and want to do, and naturally it is easy to make them better. Therefore, "popularity does not necessarily mean blindly" catering to base needs and does not necessarily use old forms unconditionally. We must play a leading role among the masses everywhere and improve the cultural level of the masses through the form of "popularity." For the improvement of mass literary authors, the tastes and interests of the masses will gradually need to be changed in the transitional era, and she will never only try to obtain readers from the masses and fall into the shameful state of "vulgarity," and then lose the original intention of popularity.

"Vulgar articles" can only paralyze the readers of the masses, and we must be doubly vigilant and pay attention to preventing "popularity" from being considered "vulgarity"!

### A Letter of Condolence from a World Language Speaker

— Lü Jue Liang

Dear, heroic anti-Japanese soldiers:

As a reader of the world language, I extend my deep respect to you from the distant rear!

We, the Chinese Esperantists, stand at the forefront of international propaganda, and have successively founded Esperanto publications such as "The Messenger of the Far East," "Voice of the Orient," "New Stage," and "Justice." In them, we have introduced the heroic epic written by you in blood and flesh to "go abroad" and present it to the world's lovers of peace, equality and justice.

We all know that the work of propaganda is not only to report on the heroic resistance of soldiers and expose the evil deeds of the enemy, but also to actively engage in close contact with the progressive world organizations or national bodies of various countries. Therefore, various Esperanto publications have received multiple layers of letters of condolence from Esperanto speakers and national bodies from various countries, expressing great sympathy and encouragement to you - the heroic soldiers.

Now, let's show you a few postcards from the hundreds of condolence letters sent to "The Messenger of the Far East" by Esperanto speakers from various countries to be forwarded to you:

To the brave anti-Japanese Chinese soldiers:

In my school and family, as well as the vast majority of my friends, I firmly support your determination to resist and your heroic fight. In particular, my countrymen also feel that brave Chinese soldiers, our comrades, are protecting and resisting, and are tactical masters against fascism. At the same time, for us, this is a great, a true victory? We all believe deeply that victory is in the hands of the brave Chinese soldiers at the front! We salute you! Your friend

### Air Defense Equipment Commissioner Talks About the Completion of the Air Defense Force Preparation. Can Be Mobilized Immediately When Emergency Order is Issued. The Hong Kong Government Decides to Abandon Large-Scale Air Defense Construction. Residents' Participation in Training is Not Enthusiastic, Which is a Shortcoming.

Under the efforts of the authorities, the air defense deployment in Hong Kong has been largely completed. Various air defense forces have been established, such as fire brigades, excavation teams, and ambulance teams. Once a mobilization order is issued, they can return to their teams and concentrate their efforts.

Participation in Air Defense is Not Enthusiastic

What is currently used as a basis is that residents' participation in air defense services is not enthusiastic. Therefore, there is a great shortage of air defense rescuers, which is far from the original quota of 9,000 people. And those who sign up for fire reserve training are also not active. The strength of the fire brigade itself has been strengthened. Recently, a batch of fire trucks purchased from the UK have arrived. In the past week, there have been criticisms outside that the Hong Kong government is not nervous enough about air defense equipment. However, the conclusions drawn from Spain and recent wars believe that the cost of attacking cities with scattered populations and wide areas with willpower bombs is huge and is not allowed by economic principles. However, this kind of criticism only knows one thing and does not know the other. Air raids are not only poison gas bombs. If bombing and incendiary bombs are thrown into densely populated commercial areas, the loss of life will be great, and our losses will be huge.

Preparing to Defend Against Poison Gas Attacks

However, poison gas attacks are also one of the ways of air raids. We cannot lack this in planning the overall air defense equipment, so as not to leave a flaw in a hundred plans. At the same time, we can show the Japanese that we are prepared, so that they have something to fear. Incendiary bombs are an important air raid weapon with a wide range of destruction. However, if they can be extinguished quickly, it may not be difficult to deal with them. This depends on whether the deployment of air defense personnel is appropriate. If an incendiary bomb is found, all air defense personnel can quickly use the stored sand and long-handled shovel to extinguish it, so that it will not cause a prairie fire. For the sake of practice, a batch of incendiary bombs has been specially ordered from the UK, and will be transported to Hong Kong by the Blue Funnel Line soon. If the fire has already formed, the air defense personnel should quickly notify the excavation team and the fire brigade to come to the scene to extinguish and intercept the fire. As for the ambulance team and the disinfection team, they are also trained to be enthusiastic. They can gather and prepare to depart for the disaster area within a few minutes after the air raid alarm is issued.

Reserving Sandbags for Distribution and Application

A few days ago, the Air Defense Office held a poison gas test. Under the protection of gas masks, the disinfection team was able to rush to the disaster site within a few minutes. The price of each gas mask is HK$2.5. The Hong Kong government has now reserved a batch, which will then be sold during emergencies. If the poor people of the three people in Hong Kong misuse the purchase of the mask, it is really difficult to do. This is the truth. If we can give such advice and instructions to build economic air-raid shelters, then the government really cannot do anything about other issues at this time. Whether it can be realized in the future is not certain. As for the recommendations for large-scale air-raid shelters and secret passages, the Hong Kong government has decided to abandon them. The government is now beginning to reserve sandbags, which will be distributed to residents for use when necessary, and will instruct them to arrange them. If they are not directly hit by bombs, fragments and stray bullets can be defended. In the current situation in Hong Kong, this is the most effective and most effective method. The fire control has been prepared, but it is not scheduled, because it is waiting for the Hong Kong government to approve it.

### Special Issue of Movie News "The Great Bombing of Chongqing" to be Released

The 49th issue of "The Great Bombing of Chongqing," produced by the Chongqing China Film Studio and supervised by the Political Department of the Military Commission, has been shipped by air yesterday. The film has been edited in a very systematic way from more than 4,000 feet, using a total of 2,000 feet, making it a very valuable documentary film. The content first introduces the prosperous state of Chongqing before being bombed, and how it was quickly built into a modern city after the War of Resistance to take on the central role of commanding the front-line military. Japanese planes have been bombing in large numbers since May 3rd. In addition to recording the real scene of the bombing at that time, the film also systematically records the bombing of foreign industries. Moreover, French Bishop Shang Weishan inspected the church after the bombing and saw only the broken head of the statue lying in the rubble. Shang immediately gave a short speech in French for the movie news, denouncing the atrocities of the Japanese people. He said at the end, "There is always justice and public reason in the world. Anyone who can stop me from saying this is a supreme sin." The whole film has very clear explanations, explaining everything. In addition to being shown at the same time as the Cantonese film "Defending the Siyi," a special feature of the Chinese film anti-Japanese war, the film will also be shown with a Western film in a Western film theater in Hong Kong to make foreigners understand the situation at that time.

### First Aid Kit

— Luo Xia

The most important things to supply our heroic soldiers fighting bravely in the front lines amidst the rain of bullets are bullets, food, and medicine. Sometimes, when bullets and food run out, they can still fight hand-to-hand, but if they are injured and have no medicine, they are immobilized. Therefore, medicine occupies an absolutely important position in wartime. Whether in the past or present, what we hear from the staff working in the front lines is how scarce medical supplies are. Clearly, in the more than twenty months of the war of resistance, the front-line medical supply has not been able to adapt actively to the war effort.

We really cannot allow a soldier injured on the front line to suffer pain endlessly, or for a minor injury to become a major wound, even costing him his precious life. Because a recovered soldier has valuable and heroic experience that will make him several times more effective in combat than a new recruit. This is a fact, an ironclad fact.

To help address the inadequacy of front-line medical care, the "first aid kit" came into being. The contents of this "kit" are very light, small, and simple, including bandages, sterilized gauze, cotton, pain relievers, etc. They are composed of inexpensive materials. When a person is injured, they pull open the long string at one end of the first aid kit, and a pain reliever pops out. They swallow it to alleviate the pain, then apply the sterilized red medicine to the wound first, and then use the bandage to cover the wound. In this way, the wounded soldier not only reduces the pain, but also prevents the wound from becoming infected, so that when he is carried back to the rear for treatment, the condition will not have worsened significantly. This first aid kit is truly a practical solution for front-line soldiers in urgent need.

Now, almost every soldier on the front lines is equipped with one of these "talismans." With our battle lines so extensive and our soldiers so numerous, the need for these first aid kits is self-evident. Therefore, various salvation groups in Hong Kong have paid great attention to this matter, constantly producing them on a large scale and shipping them to the front lines. Now, the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association has launched a campaign to donate 500,000 first aid kits. It is gratifying that overseas Chinese compatriots deeply recognize the importance of this matter and continue to respond with donations.

Because of its important position, the selection of medicines and gauze should be taken very seriously, especially the pain relievers, because they are the soul of the entire first aid kit. We should not neglect this. In the past, the central government and the Red Cross had specified standard manufacturing procedures for these first aid kits. However, because the raw material for this pain reliever is a restricted irritant that cannot be purchased without special permission from the authorities, many manufacturers have used an easier-to-buy substitute. This easily available pain reliever is often the best medicine for headaches or other localized pain. Its primary effect is to induce sweating, which is terrible for soldiers' wounds. Therefore, its pain-relieving function may seem similar, but in fact, the effect is often the opposite. A pain reliever like this is not only unimportant for wounded soldiers, but also harmful. Therefore, those who are preparing them must be careful.

The central government attaches great importance to this matter. For this reason, they have repeatedly consulted with the central government and local manufacturers, and as a result, hundreds of thousands of first aid kits have been produced according to specifications.

A reporter took the opportunity to ask Mr. Xu, the person in charge of Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals, about the need for first aid kits and the manufacturing process. He analyzed it in detail, especially pointing out the problem of pain reliever selection. Because of various relationships, they have an easier time obtaining raw materials. At the very least, they will not use pain relievers that induce sweating. Secondly, they also have their own sterilization equipment, so all manufacturing procedures are very proper. This is a major reason why the central government has publicly recommended Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals.

Now, overseas Chinese groups in various parts of Southeast Asia are donating first aid kits, and most of them are ordering them from Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals. The Hong Kong Comfort Association, the Chinese Women's Association, and other salvation groups are mostly also ordering them from Xin Ya. If your organization is interested in donating, you can contact Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals, and they will manufacture them for you, and help you participate in this patriotic movement—donating first aid kits. The soldiers on the front lines who receive this support, I believe, will certainly be able to respond with even greater and more glorious victories.

### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Addresses the Japanese People Continuation from Yesterday's Third Edition

Then some people will ask: War is resolved by force, and the Three Principles of the People cannot be used as force. I can answer this question: war is determined by the sum of national power, and the greatest and ultimate force is the national spirit. I can say that the setbacks we suffered in the first phase of the war of resistance were mainly because our spiritual preparation and training in the past were insufficient, and rarely because our armament was insufficient. We have become stronger as we fight on, and of course there are various factors, but the biggest reason is that the experience and lessons of the two years of resistance have further strengthened our spiritual strength. Japanese people, if you want to judge the future of the war, you may as well compare the two sides: what do your warlords have besides force? What clear and proper reasons do you have in your thoughts for this war of aggression that are sufficient to make Japanese soldiers prove the price of their sacrifice? In reality, every one of our officers and soldiers knows that sacrifice is for the country, for the people, and for the principles; at least they know that sacrificing themselves will prevent the nation from being slaves and the country from being destroyed? In particular, they know that there will be countless successors who will continue to take responsibility to achieve final victory, so this sacrifice is glorious and justified. What about you? You claim to love your country, but the result is to harm your country. Now that you have been invading for two years, the more you invade, the more difficult it becomes. Not only is the future uncertain, but failure is imminent. You ask yourselves in the dead of night, China's self-defense is a necessity, but what is Japan's invasion a necessity? From the perspective of the world situation, even if the policy of subjugating China is temporarily successful, there will be even greater wars later on. The Chinese people will never yield and will eventually emerge to restore their country. Moreover, now that you have tasted the strength of China's resistance, there is absolutely no possibility of conquering China? I can say that Chinese soldiers are indeed sacrificing for their country, but Japanese soldiers can only be said to be sacrificing for the warlords, and the result is harming their country. You must know that the meaning of sacrifice is to sacrifice personal interests in exchange for higher interests of the country and the people. Chinese soldiers are like this, but Japanese soldiers are not, because the more Japan invades China, the more dangerous it becomes for itself. Therefore, Japanese soldiers' fighting is not only a futile death, but also harms their country after their own death. Truly patriotic Japanese people, think calmly, and you cannot but admit that my criticism is proper.

Japanese people, you must know that a nation should only fight for self-defense in principle, and should not fight for aggression. If the object of aggression is a nation without culture, without politics, and on the verge of extinction, it may be temporarily successful. But if you wantonly invade an independent country with culture and history, there is no way to avoid failure. Moreover, as far as the Sino-Japanese issue is concerned, although China is weak, it is a major cultural power, and it is also an emerging country in the midst of revolution? Moreover, the principles of the Chinese revolution will never infringe on Japan, and will even benefit Japan? So how can you wantonly eliminate China's independence and wage this war of aggression! I can declare that China has been invaded since it opened its doors to the world, and China is absolutely defending itself. Moreover, in addition to this, China has a firm belief in the Three Principles of the People, while Japan does not. Of course, Japan also has various so-called principles and many new slogans and new terms, but the essence of Japan's principles is aggression; at best, it cannot transcend the selfishness of the nation. And many new slogans and new terms recently have emerged with the progress of aggression. Their meaning is nothing more than to eliminate China's independence, make Japan the conqueror, and make China and other East Asian nations obey Japan. Therefore, these are all deceptive words to decorate the war of aggression and are not principles at all. From this point of view, China not only has principles, but also good principles. Because the war of resistance of China under the Three Principles of the People is to achieve saving oneself and saving others, benefiting oneself and benefiting others. What we are striving for with all our strength is China's freedom and equality, but we also respect Japan's freedom and equality. This is in stark contrast to the foolish policy of Japanese aggressors, who aim to harm others to benefit themselves, and will ultimately harm themselves as a result of harming others. Compared with this, the moral positions of the two sides are vastly different. I dare say that the final victory or defeat of a war depends on the moral standing of each side. We have the absolutely just and absolutely moral reasons for resisting aggression and the belief in the Three Principles of the People, while Japan does not. Therefore, in this war, we have already occupied an absolutely victorious position in spirit. This can be further explained: our Chinese military philosophy is consistent with the traditional Eastern moral creed. China emphasizes the Dao first and the law as the foundation in military affairs; and it also values righteousness over profit and wisdom over strength. These four key principles are actually the most important theorems in our Eastern ancient and modern war history for judging victory. Now your warlords' war of aggression against China is disregarding the Dao and violating the law, being greedy for profit and forgetting righteousness, blindly believing in violence, and obliterating reason, completely violating the principles of morality and military affairs. By comparison, you can know that we Chinese have the confidence to win.

Speaking of this, some Japanese people may disagree, because Japanese rulers often say that Japan's war is to liberate China and liberate Asia. Is this a moral basis? I can answer that you are even more deceived. The lies about the "New Order in East Asia" have already been discussed earlier, and I will refute two more points here:

First, China has only been subjected to Japan's aggression and has not been subjected to aggression by other countries. How can you say that invading China is liberating China? The doctrine of liberation is equal to freedom. Japanese aggressors are doing their best to destroy the political and economic freedom of the Chinese nation. Yet they say they are liberating China. Turning right and wrong upside down is most lamentable.

Second, your warlords say that China is oppressed by Europe and the United States and is a semi-colony of Europe and the United States. This is completely a deliberate attempt to use the situation in the former Qing Dynasty to slander modern China. In recent years, only peaceful policies of European and American countries towards China have been seen. Since our National Government came to power, the relations of various countries with China have generally improved, with mutual respect for treaties and adherence to good faith. And in general, they have expressed sympathy for China's peaceful construction, and our sovereignty is not subject to any oppression from Europe and the United States. Everyone respects us as an independent country. Therefore, the slogan of your warlords that China is a semi-colony is completely a deceptive propaganda to infringe on the commercial interests of various countries in China and to incite ignorant Japanese people to facilitate their attack on China, completely disregarding the facts. Speaking of the treaty relations between China and various countries since the last century, they have already been greatly improved in recent years. Since our National Government came to power, it has decided to seek gradual solutions to all problems through peaceful and faithful diplomacy. And because the related countries are all peaceful and faithful, if Japan had not invaded China and attacked China since the September 18th Incident, it is believed that China's revision of treaties would have been successful long ago. Recently, Japanese warlords have been oppressing concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. These concession issues can only be discussed by the Chinese government with the related countries. Japan's attack on the concessions is trampling on the rights of the related countries and at the same time despising China's national sovereignty. And its purpose is to occupy the concessions, so as to trample on Chinese residents and plunder Chinese interests. Therefore, it is completely an illegal act of aggression against China and aggression against various countries, which will intensify the enslavement of China. How can you spread rumors that it is liberating China?

In a nutshell, the policy of your Japanese warlords is to conquer China, and the goal of our national army and people's struggle is to seek liberation from Japanese aggression. No matter how your warlords turn black and white upside down in their propaganda, they cannot deceive the Chinese people and the people of the world. Only some Japanese people may not know the facts. Speaking of liberating Asia, it is even more ridiculous; China is the largest independent country in Asia, and you want to conquer it for no reason. How can you still say you are liberating Asia? If you are so destructive to Greater China, how can the intentions towards other small and weak countries still be worth discussing? Simply put, liberating Asia is conquering Asia. Its purpose is to liberate all Asian nations into the same state as the puppet state of Manchukuo and Korea, where the conquerors are the masters and the conquered are the slaves. I can say that this attempt is indeed ambitious, but unfortunately there is no possibility or opportunity for it to be realized.

To come back to the point: according to the above, it can be seen that Japanese warlords have completely failed morally, and China has already achieved spiritual victory. Now I will continue to explain: why can spiritual victory succeed in practical victory. Then you must know that the first thing in war is people, everything depends on people. And China's war of resistance, because it is absolutely voluntary and believes in the Three Principles of the People, has solved all problems related to people. The whole of China today has only one will and one task: that is, to resist aggression and build the country. And every Chinese person is very clear about the purpose and reason for resisting aggression. What is left is only technical problems and material problems. And the national wartime and post-war political and economic policies have already been determined, so the whole of China today has fundamentally no controversial issues, only hard work.

Of course, the enemy has occupied many of our places, but the spirit and will of the Chinese people in the occupied areas still forever support the country and will never be deceived by the enemy. As for the few traitors and rebels, they are the scum of the nation and will not affect the spirit and will of the entire nation at all. On the contrary, the more Japanese warlords try to use Chinese to control Chinese, the more the Chinese nation feels humiliated and strengthens its determination. In short, we are calm and optimistic. History has determined that the only difficult and bright road is for us to strive to walk. We can endure any hardship, and we should not be afraid of any sacrifice. Because today's suffering is the reward for insufficient efforts in the past. At the same time, today's sacrifice is the guarantee of future glory and happiness. Because we feel this common responsibility and maintain this consistent belief, although the environment is full of storms and waves, our mood is like a bright sky after rain. This is something that the aggressor country can never reach. To be honest, the solution to the problem of people in China was originally very difficult, especially the mentality of complacency and selfishness, which was extremely difficult to remove. However, since the war of resistance, the general public, because of their feelings for the loyal and brave soldiers and the pain of the country being broken and their homes destroyed, has actively brought their spirit and will to a climax; and passively made complacency and selfishness disappear naturally. I dare say that the degree of progress in the spirit and will of all our officers and soldiers, the young men who are conscripted into the army, the compatriots and comrades who are directly and indirectly engaged in various anti-war tasks in the north and south war zones, and the technical personnel and general workers who are working hard in transportation, production, and manufacturing in the front and rear is something that cannot be achieved in twenty years in peacetime. And the talents from all sectors of our education, academia, industry, and commerce, and the general male and female students and young people have all been sincere and hardworking in the past two years, making rapid progress. Therefore, I deeply feel the greatness of our nation and have confirmed the bright future of our country. Because war is about people, and we have mastered the advantage of people. And technology can be improved. Materials can be replenished. Why can't we fight? Why can't we win? Of course, the Japanese army's weapons and equipment are much larger than ours; but we are confident that we will make this gap smaller day by day and make the enemy armed but useless. Moreover, you have many ideological enemies, while we only have one enemy. So the more you invade China, the lower and more dangerous your international status will be; while we only fight this one battle. You are besieged on all sides, while we have the world as our friend. The final success or failure is self-evident.

Today, I am saying these words to you, the Japanese people, on behalf of the Chinese nation, based on the historical friendship between the two nations and the mission of the Three Principles of the People, with the spirit of loving my country and loving the enemy people, and giving you the most sincere advice. But at the same time, I declare that if you still follow the warlords, China will absolutely not be affected. Standing on the moral high ground, possessing endless manpower, and with an absolutely consistent belief in the Three Principles of the People, we will advance the war of resistance and nation-building at the same time. With the firm unity of the people's hearts internally and the assistance of fair public opinion from friendly countries externally, why can't we defeat this common enemy of the East Asian nations? Your force is omnipotent, but our Three Principles of the People is the strongest steel. In the end, we will see whether force wins or morality wins. I will not make predictions. The facts will prove it in the future!

4 Conclusion

The above points have been explained in great detail! And the reason why I said "The success of China's self-defense is not the failure of the Japanese people. The failure of the policy of aggression is precisely the success of the Japanese people." is probably understood by everyone. Now, in summary, I will offer a few more words to you.

China and Japan are neighboring countries and have had deep cultural ties since ancient times. This is a fact that we have always valued. We believers in the Three Principles of the People have the ideal of universal harmony in the world and have no prejudice against race or region. And for neighboring nations. Of course, we hope to be friendly. Therefore, even though we are in a bloody war, we have never despised the Japanese people emotionally, and because we firmly believe that there must be many sensible people among you. It's just that you have an unclear understanding and have been deceived by the warlords' propaganda, so today I am doing my duty and speaking frankly about right and wrong. This is entirely out of the moral intention of our nation and our principles. As for what I advise, first, you must thoroughly repent of your mistakes, and second, you must thoroughly change your policies.

Your warlords are absolutely wrong to want to destroy China. You must realize that the existence of a strong and prosperous Republic of China is in Japan's absolute interest. Therefore, if China becomes strong, peace in East Asia will be truly guaranteed. And the first one to benefit from this peace is Japan. Conversely, if China does not firmly resist aggression this time and becomes a Japanese colony; may I ask, don't the two million Korean people and the four million Taiwanese people, whom you mistakenly believe have been enslaved, all waiting for the opportunity to rebel? If you add 450 million Chinese people, who will harbor endless resentment towards Japan because they have been conquered, no matter how you exert all kinds of enslaving, poisoning, and destructive efforts, the long-standing, deep-rooted, and fundamental Chinese culture and national spirit can never be completely eliminated! At this time, tens of millions of you Japanese people will be ruled by warlords, preparing for war or fighting every day, and the political and economic situation will deteriorate day by day. In the end, a big storm will completely collapse Japan, and China and Korea can still take this opportunity to revive. Therefore, your warlords' policy of aggression is very harmful to others and to yourselves, harming China and also harming Japan. Therefore, the East Asia Development Board of your government is originally a "destroy China board" in meaning; but in the end, I am afraid it will become a "destroy Japan board." From this point of view, China's war of resistance is really beneficial to Japan. Because by relying on the strength of China's war of resistance, it is enough to break your warlords' delusion of omnipotence of force. At the same time, it is giving the Japanese people a good opportunity to save Japan from a major crisis. Therefore, I urge you to wake up quickly, repent quickly, and actively save yourselves quickly. What we Chinese soldiers and civilians rely on today to deal with the enemy is great benevolence and great courage. Even if the entire country of Japan is mobilized to attack China, we will become stronger as we fight on. At the same time, speaking of benefiting others, we feel the pain suffered by the Japanese people as if it were our own pain. The world is changing rapidly, and I urge you not to miss this opportunity to save yourselves!

As for how to save yourselves? First of all, you need to completely change your policy towards China and completely abandon aggression. I can tell you that you must definitely recognize and respect that China is an independent country with sacred sovereignty, just as we see Japan. And there should be no ambiguity in anything related to national sovereignty. Ambiguity will only lead to war. What's more, you still want to permanently occupy our territory and organize traitorous puppet governments? I urge you to recognize that the independent survival and development of the new China under the Three Principles of the People will not be hindered by Japan's military aggression. In the end, the only one who suffers is Japan itself. At the same time, let you quickly restore Eastern morality and recognize the true value of the Three Principles of the People. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the Eastern morality of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. Among them, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace are the basis of our international policy. I advise you to also correct this, at least from now on, do not tell lies. Use every term according to its original meaning, and do not deceive. And we respect the personality of the Japanese country and people, and you should also be willing to respect China in the same way, and do not insult China.

Finally, I reiterate what I said last year: "The Chinese soldiers and civilians have always regarded the people who love peace and are deeply oppressed by the warlords as good friends with common interests, and care for them with full enthusiasm and expectation. We deeply hope that you will consider the supreme plan for the safety of your country and unite to oppose all the actions of the violent military department and exert the just will and strength of the citizens of your country!"

Japanese people! I believe you will remember and understand what I told you at this time last year. I hope you will recognize that the enemies of your country and nation are not in China, nor in the world, but in Japan. Please believe it, please think it over! (Central News Agency)

### Cradle of Chinese Sports in Hong Kong The Lease of South China Field Is About to Expire Rumor Has It That the Government Intends to Take It Back and Use It as the New Site for Queen's College

Yesterday's English weekly newspaper reported that the ten-year lease of the South China Stadium on Caroline Hill will expire. The government plans to take it back. The sports community is very concerned about this. Since the establishment of the stadium, Chinese schools have often held sports meets at the stadium. At the same time, Hong Kong's football matches are also the most lively at the stadium. If it is taken back, it will have a huge impact on the sports community. It is rumored that the government's intention to take back the stadium is to build Queen's Hospital. This plan has been discussed for a long time, but it was finally abandoned. It is extremely likely that the site will be used for other construction purposes. It is also rumored that the government is planning to build a model new village there and choose the headquarters of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade on Tai Hang Road as the new site for the school. However, the Director of Education admitted yesterday that the government intends to take back the South China Stadium and said that Caroline Hill is only one of the locations that the new Queen's College has in mind. As for the South China Athletic Association, it has not received any notification. It is rumored that the government also has a strong interest in sports and knows that once this site is taken back, it will inevitably affect the development of the association, so it has not made a final decision.

### "New Gymnastics" Movements and Methods (II)

— Zou Falu

(5) Same-Side "8" Character Shape: Both arms move simultaneously from a hanging position, swinging upwards and to the right-rear side towards the front of the body, then drooping down from the front of the body, swinging upwards and to the left-rear side towards the front of the body, tracing an "8" shape in front of the body.

2. "Vibration" Movements: This type of movement emphasizes shortness and speed. Each vocalization should be accompanied by one or two vibrations. If it is an opening and closing vibration, then each time the arms close, one arm must be above or in front. After completing a set, if you feel muscle tension, you can add relaxation movements to adjust.

(1) Forward and Backward Vibration: Both arms vibrate forward and backward, with the arms kept straight. The arm position can be divided into three types: hanging down, sideways raised, and raised up. When performing sideways raised vibrations, the palms face downward. When performing hanging down and raised up vibrations, the palms face each other.

(2) Upward and Downward Vibration: Both arms are straightened and vibrate up and down. These can be divided into sideways raised and forward raised types. When performing sideways raised vibrations, the palms face downward. When performing forward raised vibrations, the palms face each other.

(3) Opening and Closing Vibration: Both arms are straightened and moved in an alternating opening and closing motion. This can be divided into four types: hanging down and opening/closing in front of the body, hanging down and opening/closing in front and behind the body, forward raised and opening/closing in front of the chest, and raised up and opening/closing above the head.

3. "Punching" Movements: This movement is a vigorous exercise, primarily focusing on the full contraction of muscles. However, the muscle contraction only occurs during the punch, and the muscles must relax when retracting. The lower limbs can freely flex and extend or touch the ground with the toes as the punch is delivered.

(1) National Arts Punching Method: Both fists are brought up from a flexed position near the waist, and then punched out. When punching out, the back of the fist must face upward, and when retracting, the back of the fist must face downward. This can be divided into punching downward, punching sideways, punching upward, and punching the left fist to the right, and the right fist to the left. The first three types can be further divided into punching simultaneously with both fists or alternately.

(2) Western Boxing Forward Punch: The foot is taken out of the upright position (left fist forward, right foot forward). Both fists are first placed in front of the chest in preparation. The rear fist punches forward first, while the front fist quickly retracts. Immediately, the front fist punches forward, while the rear fist quickly retracts. After performing this a sufficient number of times, the stance must be switched, and the feet and fists moved forward.

(3) Western Boxing Hook: From the position where both fists are still at the side of the body, the left fist punches to the right, and the right fist punches to the left in an alternating hooking motion. The arm is bent when punching, and the fist stops when it reaches the head, without straightening. The objective is to hit the opponent's chin.

(4) Western Boxing Uppercut: The same starting position as above. The left and right fists alternately punch upwards from in front of the body. The fist stops when it reaches the jaw. The objective is to hit the opponent's jaw.

4. "Pulling" Movements: For this movement, the application of muscles is precisely the opposite of the punching movement. That is, tightening during the pull back, opening the fingers during the reach, and clenching the fingers tightly during the pull back. The movement can be divided into pulling upwards from below, pulling downwards from above, pulling backward from the front, and pulling inwards from both sides. Each movement can be performed with both arms simultaneously or alternately.

5. "Circling" Movements: This type of movement can be broadly categorized into circling small circles and circling large circles. The movement of circling small circles is similar to the "vibration" movement. The movement of circling large circles is similar to the "swinging" movement. However, the amount of exercise for both is increased compared to "vibration" and "swinging". Since we have understood the "vibration" and "swinging" movements, the "circling" movement is not difficult. The only difference is that the "vibration" and "swinging" movements are modified to circle a circle. Therefore, we are only giving its name and will not explain it in detail.

(1) Circling Small Circles: Can be divided into sideways raised circling, forward raised circling, and raised up circling. Sideways raised circling can be divided into moving from front-up-back-down and from front-down-back-up. Forward raised and raised up circling can be divided into moving from inside to outside and from outside to inside.
