### British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Seek Italy's Intentions: Main Discussions Will Focus on the Spanish War; Franco-Italian Relations Will Not Be Mediated for the Time Being

[Central News Agency, Report from the 9th] When British Prime Minister Chamberlain travels to Rome tomorrow, he will carry a statement from the Spanish Republican government to discuss with the Italian authorities whether it is possible to change the Italian government's attitude toward the Spanish conflict. The statement contains two guarantees: (1) If the Spanish government forces are victorious, Spain will not become a communist state, but will continue to be a liberal parliamentary democracy; (2) The Spanish government will never adopt an anti-Italian policy. Although the Spanish people express resentment at Italy's interference in Spanish politics, if the Mediterranean agreement planned by the British government is successful, Spain will still be willing to sign the agreement with Italy.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 9th] Yesterday, political circles cautiously pointed out that the visit of British cabinet members to Paris is entirely an expression of British friendship and has nothing to do with mediation in Rome. Rumors that British Prime Minister Chamberlain is prepared to reach a settlement with Mussolini can be dismissed as unfounded. Furthermore, it is said that given the current situation, if Italy does not stop the anti-French propaganda campaign in its newspapers, there will be no opportunity for negotiations between the two countries, let alone the possibility of reaching an understanding. Parisians generally believe that the current situation is entirely the responsibility of the Italian press. Even newspapers that usually advocate pro-Italian policies say that in the current situation, if the Italian press provokes disputes with France, even the most clever diplomats will find it difficult to mediate. The Rome conference will be purely for discussing Anglo-Italian affairs. People close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs say that the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary are coming to Paris entirely to discuss the Spanish issue. Since the Spanish rebels launched their offensive, the problem has become more serious, and there are concerns that undue foreign influence within the rebel camp will expand. French political circles have expressed that they would be pleased if Chamberlain could raise this issue at the meeting and obtain Italian guarantees to maintain the status quo in the western Mediterranean. At the same time, some say that the French government will request the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to raise the Spanish issue specifically when they go to Rome.

### Roosevelt to Send Message to Congress: Requesting to Strengthen the Army and Air Force; Number of Aircraft Must Be Quadrupled Next Year; New Air Force Bases to Be Established

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] US President Roosevelt is scheduled to submit a defense message to Congress this week, the content of which is to request the strengthening of US defense capabilities, especially the air force. Well-informed sources predict that the President's message will state that Germany is superior to all other countries in terms of air power, and the United States cannot afford to lag behind. President Roosevelt's proposals will include: (1) The number of aircraft ordered by the Army and Navy next year must be increased fourfold; (2) 20,000 pilots and even more mechanics must be trained each year; (3) The number of Air Force personnel in the Army, currently 20,000, must be expanded to 60,000; (4) Infantry and artillery must be increased; (5) An additional £2,000 will be allocated to equip the US (first-line troops); (6) More munitions and educational supplies needed by the troops will be purchased; (7) New air force bases will be established. Government officials say that the President intends to propose that the number of Air Force personnel next year be increased by 5,000, with 2,000 for Army aviation personnel and 3,000 for Navy aviation personnel.

Relief Policies: Severely Criticized by Both Parties

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Roosevelt's relief policies are being severely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans today. This emergency relief bill will be reported to the Congressional Committee next week. The administration's proposal has now been submitted to a small organization committee for debate. The case will grant President Roosevelt $875 million for public works policies up to June 30 this year. The subcommittee will begin debating next week. New York Mayor LaGuardia will represent major cities in making demands. It is now very clear that the committee will specify the amount of funds, and some Democratic congressmen plan to propose amendments to prevent relief funds from being used for political purposes.

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] National Economic Executive Committee Chairman Angell issued a statement saying that the administration's continued wasteful policies will inevitably lead to unmanageable inflation. He said that Nanceford's budget is expected to reach 44 billion by 1940, which is enough to alarm millions of citizens concerned about taxes and the future value of gold dollars.

### Counter-offensive Progress of the Western Government Forces

[Reuters, Barcelona, 8th] In the past three days, the Spanish government forces have suddenly launched a counter-offensive in the Estremadura region, advancing 25 miles westward. They have cleared out rebels in the Su Jia Shui area north of Fu Ante Obei Xiang Na, and occupied the intersection of the highways to the province of Badajos, Parari, and Darasi Zuo, only about 9,000 miles from the Portuguese border. Furthermore, the occupation of Fu Ante O Yuan In Na has cut off the highway and railway traffic of the rebels to the famous Ban Na Luo Ye mine, and the continuation of this injury is also half-encircled. The occupation of the two towns of Ge Lin Cha and Di Duo Li Xi Luo Sa in Badajos Province, and the four villages of La Gui Long Na Qu and Estremadura, is an important advance in the government forces' attack.

[Reuters, Istanbul, 8th] Today, various newspapers published a message about the alleged use of the Turkish government's name and forged signatures to purchase 50 aircraft from the United States and Canada for resale to the Spanish government. It is reported that a Turkish Foreign Ministry official was arrested in Ankara, and another Turkish official was detained in France.

### Italian Fascist Congress to be Held Next Month

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 9th] It is announced here that the Fascist Party Administrative Congress will be held at 10:00 pm on February 4th at the Venice Palace. Furthermore, the recently established National Resources Self-Sufficiency Administrative Committee will meet at the end of this month.

### Southern Prince Meets with Romanian King

[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 8th] Prince Paul of Yugoslavia arrived in Trinsxi Wen Asia today to visit Romanian King Carol, who is vacationing there. Foreign diplomats believe that Carol and Paul are eager to exchange views in advance, given the imminent visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to Yugoslavia. It is widely believed that Italy will act as a mediator or peacemaker between its allies (on the one hand, Hungary, and on the other hand, Yugoslavia and Romania) to prevent German advancement.

### Daladier Returns to Paris: People of the Territory Pledge Allegiance; He Expresses Great Satisfaction

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 9th] French Prime Minister Daladier returned from North Africa yesterday afternoon and immediately reported to President Lebrun. According to the official gazette yesterday afternoon, President Lebrun expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Daladier for his service to France and its interests.

[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] Daladier issued a statement to the press, saying, "During my sea journey, I saw that the Tunisians and Algerians were extremely loyal to France, which was very gratifying. What I am even more satisfied with is their desire to see the French people unite to complete their current tasks."

### Palestine Border Closure: All External Traffic is Cut Off

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th] The Palestine border has now been tightened. According to official announcements, all borders have been closed and external traffic has been temporarily suspended. When traffic can be restored will be announced later. According to military authorities, starting from January 12th, restrictions on the passage of non-Muslim and non-Jewish car drivers and passengers will be implemented. At the same time, Syria and Transjordan are not allowed to enter by car or horse-drawn carriage. The reason is that some people have used the previously issued permits to harm military security.

### No Results in Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Issue Negotiations: Red Army Newspaper Warns Japan; Soviet Rights Will Not Tolerate Infringement

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 9th] Yesterday morning, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov resumed fisheries negotiations. The two sides argued for an hour and a half without reaching a conclusion. This was the eleventh negotiation between the two sides. The Red Star newspaper, the organ of the Soviet Red Army, recently commented on the Soviet-Japanese fisheries negotiations, saying that the Japanese government should know that the reason why the Japanese can fish in Soviet territorial waters is the result of the Soviet government's facilitation, not the strength of the Japanese government. In the last Zhanggufeng incident, the Japanese should know that the strength of the Red Army is completely different from that of the Tsarist Russian army. The Soviet Red Army has given the Japanese army a good lesson on the shores of Lake Hasan, because the Soviet people will never allow anyone to infringe on Soviet rights anywhere, etc. The tone of the newspaper is sufficient to represent the attitude of the Soviet government towards the fisheries issue.

### Hungary Issues an Ultimatum to Gabarso-Ukraine: Threatening to Cede the Basil Diocese; Constantly Provoking on the Czech Border

[Haitong News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 9th] It is reported that Hungarian Minister to Czechoslovakia Dr. Wilt Sheng has returned home. He will consult with the government before deciding whether to return to his post.

[Haitong News Agency, Czech Capital, 8th] It is reported that the Hungarian government has issued an ultimatum to the Gabarso-Ukraine government (translator's note: this state is an autonomous state in eastern Czech Republic), demanding that the latter's Basil Diocese be ceded to it. The deadline for responding to the ultimatum is the evening of the 9th, and military force will be used after the deadline.

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Representatives of Hungary and Czech Republic negotiated all day yesterday on the Muka Sheva incident, and negotiations seem likely to continue today. The Czech representative has proposed a counterproposal to Hungary's proposal, advocating the establishment of a Hungarian territory in the western country.

[Haitong News Agency, Lou Capital, 8th] According to a semi-official message from the Ukrainian side, tonight the Hungarian mixed army crossed the border near Duhe and opened fire on the Czech border guards, resulting in a serious conflict near Engersuo. After firing at each other for thirty minutes at the front, the Hungarian army retreated from the Czech border. Czech envoy Lieutenant Novotny and Sergeant Hacha, with white cloths in their arms and white flags in their hands, went to Hungary, intending to meet with Hungarian officers to investigate the cause of the conflict. While traveling on the road to Duhe Village, the Hungarian army suddenly opened fire on them, and Hacha's chest was seriously injured. One bullet also pierced Novotny's clothes. In addition, several conflicts occurred on the border between Capasso, Ukraine and Hungary, but the nature was relatively less serious. According to Ukrainian reports, before these clashes occurred, the Hungarian army usually opened fire on the Czech border guards first.

[Central News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 9th] The Hungarian official news agency recently published an account of the Czech-Hungarian border incident, saying that 200 Ukrainian terrorists first attacked the border of Naza Zhu, and the Hungarian guards immediately returned fire, repelling the attackers. The Hungarian border officer in charge started negotiations with the guards, but the Czech side still opened fire from time to time. There were no casualties on the Hungarian side.

Sudden Change in Attitude of German Newspapers

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 8th] Regarding the repeated disputes on the Czech-Hungarian border, German political figures are still uneasy about the tendency of Czechs, especially Slovaks, to be their own masters. According to German sources, they are no longer adding green onions to the Slovaks. Recently, various newspapers have mostly reported that the Slovak Provincial Autonomous Government discriminates against Germans. The newspapers originally said that the Muka Xie Cheng incident should be the responsibility of Hungary, but now they have changed their tune and attributed the responsibility to the Czech government. Among them, the National Daily of Eisen City stated that the communist doctrine is still sliding within the Czech border. This situation is not in line with the spirit of reconciliation between Germany and the two countries.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 8th] The recent Hungarian-Hungarian border conflict has attracted the attention of Italian people, but the newspapers have not yet commented. Most of them are waiting for the report of the investigation committee.

### New British Ambassador to the Soviet Union to Depart for His Post Today

[Haitong News Agency, London, 9th] Sir William Seeds, the Central Ambassador to the Soviet Union, will leave England for his post on Monday. The previous ambassador, Lord Joel Stondon, resigned due to his retirement age.

### Britain to Help Australia Expand Aircraft Production: Fact-Finding Mission to be Sent to Discuss and Draft Manufacturing Plans

[Reuters, London, 8th] Official propaganda has recently stated that the British government, at the request of the Australian Federal Government, will send a fact-finding mission to Australia in the near future to jointly discuss the possibility of expanding Australian aircraft production and draft plans for consideration by both governments. The fact-finding mission includes Sir Lewa Dong, a member of the previous fact-finding mission to Canada, Bankes, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Air Ministry, and Sir Lang Moore, Air Force General, as well as experts. It is said that the purpose of the mission is to create a manufacturing plan similar to that of the Canadian factory, but the aircraft manufactured in Canada are to be supplied to the United Kingdom, while the manufacturing in Australia is to expand the local air force.

### British Cabinet Members Discuss Far East Situation: Suggest Increasing Tariffs on Japanese Goods; US to Provide Currency Assistance to China

[Reuters, London, 9th] According to the Daily Mail's foreign affairs correspondent, before Prime Minister Chamberlain's trip to Rome, all cabinet members have today discussed the situation in the Far East. In the past few days, the government has considered using pressure to make Japan respect British interests and the open door in China. There have been many suggestions for oppressing Japan, which have been reviewed. Approximately, what is introduced to the Cabinet is to increase tariffs on Japanese goods and discriminate in favor of China. The United States is also reviewing this situation, and it is reported that it will also take helpful measure on currency for China, which is extremely harmful to Japan.

[Reuters, London, 9th] This agency's reporter visited an authority, who said that it is unbelievable that Britain intends to put pressure on Japan to force it to respect China's open door policy. In the past, Britain has considered how to protect its interests in China, especially the Yangtze River navigation, which is the most important. Although Britain and the United States can express the same trend, due to the complexity of all the many issues, the government must carefully consider each step before implementing it.

### Hitler's Hungary

Dr. Eckhardt, an old Hungarian politician, was the leader of the Agricultural Party in the former Bethlan Cabinet. He was the most vocal anti-fascist and anti-Hitler figure in Hungary. He once said, "Under the conspiracy of National Socialist Party activities, Hungary will be National Socialistized and encounter the same fate as the loss of the country in 1526." At the same time, he warned the domestic National Socialist Party, saying, "The Hungarian people will never be sacrificed by the Nazi." However, the domestic National Socialist movement in Hungary not only did not disappear because of this, but instead fanned the flames and agitated within the country. What is particularly noteworthy is that in April of this year, there were rumors in the Hungarian region of Albert that it would be occupied by Hitler.

The current Prime Minister of Hungary, Yin Wright, is a soldier and an experienced businessman. He has received many medals for his contributions in the war. He believes that Hungary's weakness and decline make it vulnerable to plunder by foreign powers. At the same time, he believes that the reason why the domestic National Socialist Party dares to carry out activities openly is also due to the country's weak power. Therefore, as soon as he took office, he announced five new reconstruction plans: internally, developing national finance, actively opening state-owned factories, training laborers, ensuring stable agricultural and industrial life, reducing unemployment among domestic workers, and improving the lives of laborers; externally, expanding military preparations to enhance national prestige. Although his foreign policy remains friendly and cooperative with Germany, his attitude towards Germany is much tougher than that of previous cabinets. He is determined not to fascistize his country, so he also uses extremely strict methods to sanction and stop domestic Nazi movements.

At the meeting of the Little Entente held in Yugoslavia in August of this year, Hungary was allowed to expand its military preparations. This cannot be regarded as a victorious harvest after Prime Minister Yin Wright took office. The reason why the Little Entente changed its previous attitude of opposing Hungary's revision of the treaty was of course because they saw the increasing power of the Berlin-Rome Axis in Europe recently. The Little Entente group itself was too busy to take care of itself and had no power to make things difficult for Hungary. However, on the other hand, it may not have been the result of the active communication of the Hungarian representatives with the Little Entente group.

However, we must know that the Hungarian authorities must not be satisfied with this. In today's Europe, which is full of the smell of gunpowder, preparation can defend against foreign aggression. Anti-fascists in Hungary, such as Eckhardt, mostly believe that relying solely on military preparations is not enough to save the country's crisis. Because in the border areas of Hungary, there are many poor farmers with arable land. They mostly live in semi-feudal poor rural areas, living in poverty. The National Socialist Party has used this weakness to provoke and agitate farmers to rebel against the government. Therefore, in these poverty areas, there are already several thousand people participating in the National Socialist movement. Dr. Eckhardt saw through this weakness. He believed that it was a domestic worry. He actively engaged in planning and advised the government to develop the border areas as soon as possible, so that farmers could live and work in peace, so that the schemes of the Nazi elements could not be implemented there. As a result, the Hungarian Congress passed Dr. Eckhardt's proposal and promulgated the Border Area Land Improvement Law. On September 4, Yin Lingte delivered an important speech in Caposvar on the implementation plan of the Land Improvement Law, stating that the plan is limited to be completed within seven years, and an average of 100,000 acres of good land can be reclaimed each year for poor farmers to cultivate. In addition, it also indicated that the government is willing to lend money to farmers as a farming fund. Due to the establishment of this kind of land improvement law, we can imagine that the anti-fascist faction has a great power in Hungary. Dr. Eckhardt also subsequently issued a statement saying, "Now Hungary's internal affairs have gradually reformed and moved forward. Although many policies are often subject to the conspiracies of reactionary elements during implementation, which causes obstacles, we will never be discouraged because of this. We believe that in the near future, there will always be more free and innovative political, economic, and diplomatic systems than the present."

The implementation of this land improvement law fully demonstrates that the Hungarian government has gradually turned to the anti-fascist faction. At the same time, this plan is completely aimed at the Nazi followers in Hungary. Naturally, the fascist bandits in Hungary will never want it to develop smoothly. They are also planning various conspiracies and evil schemes to stop and destroy this plan. According to the latest information I have received, the little followers and lackeys under Hitler's command have been lobbying in the border area, using the bait of allowing the immediate distribution of good land to farmers to instigate them to oppose the government and participate in their Nazi organization. Major General Chai Lai Su, one of the important leaders of the Nazi organization in Hungary, was recently arrested by the government for participating in this activity and sentenced to three years in prison. However, this kind of conspiracy will never be stopped because of this. Other fascist leaders are still continuing to carry out activities. Now, the Sderfen County in the border area of Hungary has been completely fascistized by the Nazi Party's activities. All politics and economy are also completely manipulated by the Nazi Party. Can the Hungarian authorities implement this land improvement as soon as possible to defeat the conspiracy of the broken society? I am very worried about this township issue for Hungary.

Since the Mingyi Conference resolved the Czech incident, the diplomacy between Germany and Hungary has also changed from its previous friendly attitude. Before the Mingxing Conference was held, Hungary had always catered to Germany and acted as Hitler's accomplice. She wanted to take advantage of the fire to rob and divide Louke's territory. Therefore, the authorities had visited Germany several times, and Hitler had expressed his support for the recovery of the lost territory within the territory. However, after the Ming and Congresses, Coke instead shook hands with Germany and asked Hitler to help curb resistance to Hungary. At the same time, Germany actually opposed Hungary's request to cede Chusennia to connect with Poland's territory, which made Hungary's attitude towards Germany had to turn around and change its consistent pro-German policy. In the past, Hungary advocated a Polish-Hungarian union to jointly defend the Union. But now, she is shouting high to organize the Polish-Hungarian axis to prevent Hitler from taking Romania's oil fields and Ukraine's agricultural products.

The reason why Hitler did not agree to give the Dillonian of Luxembourg to Hungary is partly because of his ambition to cover up and take over Ukraine, but the biggest reason is because he also has aggressive intentions towards Luxembourg. We know that there are a million Polish and Soviet minorities living in Chisenia province. Hitler can deploy war society forces there, and then use various conspiracies to make these people embrace his aspirations and serve as the base for the activities of the Nazi Party in this area, making it easier for him to realize his ambition to invade Greater Ukraine. If Luxembourg is occupied by Hungary, Hitler's invasion plan will become a castle in the air, which can be hoped for but cannot be obtained. Although Luxembourg is a mountainous lowland and its culture is not advanced, from Hitler's point of view, which is based on aggression, Luxembourg is a strategically important area. On November 2nd of this year, after the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy arbitrated the dispute between Hungary and Hungary, although Hungary obtained two important towns from Anke, the forest in the area was never returned to Hungary, and Hitler's ambition can be seen from this.

Now Hitler's followers are more active in Hungary, and some people in the country are deeply infected with the essential elements of the National Socialist Party. The German nation of Apad is also arousing ethnic emotions and rising up in rebellion, demanding to return to their homeland. In short, in today's Hitler's attempt to advance eastward, Hungary is regarded as an obstacle that must be removed, because it is one of the transportation hubs for attacking Ukraine and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Hungary's agricultural products and livestock are also being targeted by Hitler. However, one point should not be overlooked, that is, the anti-fascist faction in Hungary, under the leadership of Dr. Eckhardt, is also carrying out major activities. They have long known the poisonous tricks of the Fascist Party, so they are fully prepared and determined to be patriots to the end.

Brief comment

### The Honor of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines

There is a noteworthy piece of news in today's Hong Kong news section. According to confirmed reports from the Philippines, since the full-scale War of Resistance began, the donations from our overseas Chinese in the Philippines to support the motherland's war effort have exceeded 19 million, averaging over one hundred yuan donated by each overseas Chinese in the Philippines for the motherland's struggle for independence, freedom, and happiness. While this number may not be considered astounding, when compared to past achievements in Hong Kong, it cannot help but evoke the feeling that "the future surpasses the past by far." Furthermore, an examination of the living conditions of overseas Chinese in both places cannot help but create a different kind of feeling.

Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, especially those in the middle and lower-middle class, and the so-called "laboring masses" such as hawkers, have been ardent and sincere in contributing money and effort to the motherland in the past, truly moving people to tears. However, it is undeniable that many overseas Chinese have not consistently and enthusiastically donated to the country. We hope that everyone will look at the honor of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines today, become inspired, and engage in a glorious competition. This will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on the early realization of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The current enthusiasm of all sectors for the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement may perhaps prevent disappointing people at home and abroad again!

### Stop the Japanese Army's Offensive!

During the German army's offensive on Verdun in the European War, the French army naturally adopted the slogan, "They shall not pass!" It became like a command in the war, uniting everyone, and finally defeating the German army.

"Stop the Japanese army's offensive!" This is the urgent task currently inspiring our War of Resistance! It can also be used as a command circulating among our entire nation.

According to the 士幾西報, "Since the Sino-Japanese War began, it has recently reached the most surprising stage. Apart from the Japanese navy's bombing of our ships, the Japanese army has apparently completely stopped its offensive. Nanchang and Changsha, two important towns, were initially believed to be in Japanese hands before the end of the twenty-seventh year, but up to this day, the security of these two important towns remains the same as before the fall of Wuhan." From this, it can be seen that the statement "the Japanese army's difficulties are becoming increasingly serious, and our army is becoming stronger as it fights" is definitely not just an optimistic view of a few people, but an inevitable fact.

Of course, if we assume that the general lull in the war means that the Japanese army has no offensive power, it is clearly a mistake, because the Japanese army still has the possibility of exhausting all its resources in a desperate gamble. However, if our front-line combat strength can be increasingly strengthened, the battle groups behind enemy lines can be increasingly developed, the preparations for a counter-offensive in the rear can be actively completed, national politics can be accelerated, and the people can intensify their efforts to transport supplies and manpower to support the front lines, then not only can the war situation continue to stabilize, but the Japanese army will also ultimately be unable to launch or advance its "final offensive" until we finally drive the Japanese out of China.

The situation is becoming more favorable to us day by day. Everyone must redouble their excitement and redouble their efforts, sparing no sacrifice, to realize "Stop the Japanese army's offensive!"

### Our Guangdong Army Advances on All Fronts, Shilong and Shitan Can Be Recovered Soon, Japanese Plan to Retreat to Dongguan and Humen

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] Wu Qihui, Xia Wei, and Yu Hanmou's troops are encircling Guangzhou from the east, west, and north in part, while Li Hanhun's troops are also operating from the north in coordination. The Japanese in Guangzhou, Sanshui, Jiujiang, and Dongguan are extremely fearful, all shortening their lines in an attempt to resist stubbornly. At the same time, they plan to abandon Shilong and Shitan in order to concentrate their forces in Dongguan and Humen to guard the gateway to the Pearl River. Finally, when necessary, they will abandon the Dapeng Bay area and rely on naval power to preserve Guangzhou's sea route. Since Wang Jingwei's peace movement failed, the Japanese army in South China seems to have temporarily abandoned its attempt to invade Guangxi Province from the West River or land at Beihai.

[External Telegram, Shenzhen, Evening of the 9th] It is reported that Chinese troops coming from Huizhou have arrived in the outskirts of Shilong and are engaged in battles with Japanese forward units. The Chinese army has now recovered several small towns east of Shilong.

[Reuters, National Gate, 9th] Several Japanese planes bombed Shizhi with six bombs this morning, completely destroying the power plant.

Xue Yue Discusses the Situation in the Hunan-Jiangxi Theater

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Changsha, 9th] Xue Yue, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth War Area, told reporters: It is doubtful whether the Japanese can launch a large-scale offensive along the river in the Wuhan area. He believes that the Japanese will concentrate in the southwest and northwest to invade Guangxi and Shaanxi provinces because: (1) The Mufu Mountains lie between the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi border regions, acting as a natural barrier. We have built strong fortifications along the mountains. To the east is Poyang Lake, and to the west is Dongting Lake. The water levels of both lakes are low in winter, making it impossible for Japanese warships to operate. Moreover, there is only one highway and one railway between Wuchang and Changsha, and only one highway and one railway between Jiujiang and Nanchang. (2) The Xinxiang River and Miluo River flow westward into Dongting Lake, while the Xiu River and Gan River flow eastward into Poyang Lake—creating a natural defense line for Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. (3) The Mufu Mountains are undulating and densely forested, which the Japanese regard as a difficult path. (4) It is estimated that the Japanese would need to increase their forces by four divisions to break through our Mufu Mountains defenses. Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue finally made an important suggestion: In the future, we should advance our military, political, and economic forces eastward to engage in a comprehensive struggle with the Japanese, not just build up the western provinces. In the process of advancing eastward, the tasks of nation-building and the long-term War of Resistance can be smoothly completed.

[External Telegram, Shanghai, 9th] According to sources in Longtong, Yamada, the commander of the Japanese army in Central China, will soon order a large-scale offensive on Changsha.

[External Telegram, Chongqing, 9th] The Sino-Japanese war has now reached the most unusual stage. Apart from sporadic small conflicts, the offensive has been almost completely abandoned. It was generally predicted that the Changsha and Nanchang areas would fall before the end of last year, but now they are as safe as they were before the fall of Hankou. Except for the Chinese guerrillas attacking the Japanese army, there is hardly any war. The fiercest battle yesterday took place near Qiujin, southwest of De'an. Also yesterday, the Japanese army in the Xiushui area was about to hold a review when they were fiercely shelled by the Chinese army across the river. The review could not be completed, and the Japanese army soon returned fire. This continued for two hours until the shelling stopped. The Japanese army in Jining and Fanxian along the Yellow River is on high alert and is forcing civilians to dig three trenches at several strategic points along the river, each protected by barbed wire. Jinli, a small town west of Sanshui in Guangdong, was heavily shelled by the Japanese army yesterday, but the Chinese army positions suffered little damage. Also yesterday, Japanese planes were active only in Hubei and Hunan provinces. Hengyang was subjected to heavy bombing, killing nine civilians. Ten Japanese planes attacked Xiangyang five times.

### We Wipe Out Fenglingdu, Fierce Fighting on the Northeast Bank of the Yellow River

[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 8th] (1) The Japanese in the Qinghua, Yongji, and Hanyang areas have been repeatedly attacked by Li Tuan and Zhang Guo, disrupting their transportation. They are very frightened and have made strict deployments in Huangjiajiao, Fengboguzhen, and other places to prevent our attacks. On the afternoon of the 6th, a part of our local brigade advanced towards the Liuguan Village area of Hanyang Town and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese for four hours. Our artillery on the right bank simultaneously fired to assist in the battle, killing forty or fifty Japanese infantrymen, seven artillerymen, and destroying one artillery piece. The remaining Japanese immediately moved northwest of the village. We sent the main forces of the Wang and Yang brigades to capture Dongzhuang and wipe out Fenglingdu. Fierce battles are expected to unfold within days. (2) Tu Huting, the puppet magistrate of Yongji, had been in office for less than a month. Because he did not win the favor of the Japanese chieftain, it is reported that he was killed. Six people, including Zhong Wenhan and Shi Jianping, have now been appointed as members to prepare for the reorganization of the puppet county government. [Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] (1) Military news: The Japanese army along the Pinghan and Zhengtai railways has recently seen a sudden increase in troops. Yangquan has increased by more than 3,000, Yuanshi and Zanhuang have increased by 5,000, and Xingtai has increased by 6,000, showing signs of a large-scale attack on our western Hebei and southeastern Shanxi areas. (2) Military news: The Japanese in Jixian were forced to flee by our army. On the 6th, part of them fled north. Only a thousand or so remain near the suburbs of the city. It is also reported that after our army recovered Dongyumen, it immediately advanced northward. The Japanese in Shijiawan are panicked.

[Central News Agency, Hecheng, 7th] The self-defense forces in various parts of Suiyuan frequently attack the Japanese and have achieved some gains. (1) On the 16th, a certain unit launched a fierce attack on the Japanese east of Helin Tiefengu, engaging in a day-long battle, killing 30 Japanese soldiers. We also suffered some casualties. (2) On the 5th, a certain unit engaged in a two-hour battle with 200 Japanese soldiers in Bulan within the territory of Tokto County. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and fled in defeat. (3) On the 19th, a certain unit engaged in a fierce five-hour battle with more than 300 Japanese soldiers in Nana near Guihua. They were defeated by us and fled eastward. (4) On the 24th, a certain unit engaged in a three-hour battle with the Japanese near Qingshui. Both the Japanese and we suffered casualties. (5) Our army launched a surprise attack on Taosiqing Station on the 21st, causing significant losses to the Japanese.

### Xiangfan is Stable, Japanese Planes Bombard Continuously, Suixian and Yingshan are Quiet

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 8th] On the Suixian front, apart from occasional disturbances by the Japanese against us, there has been no significant change.

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 8th] There is no movement from the Japanese at Zongshan. There are no Japanese at Zongdimiao and Longquanzhen. The Japanese at Jiangjiagang were transferred back to Xihe yesterday. There are currently only a hundred or so Japanese troops there.

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 8th] At 10:08 AM on the 8th, six Japanese planes flew west of the county, and another nine Japanese planes flew west through Pinglindian, all bombing Xiangyang with 20 bombs, killing and injuring nine people and destroying four or five civilian houses.

The purpose of the committee is to harmonize the government's policies on Mongolia, Central China, North China, and South China. All cabinet members and powerful figures outside the cabinet will be recruited as members to help the Hiranuma cabinet determine the fundamental policies of preparing for national defense and formulate basic economic plans.

### After the Fifth Plenary Session, There Are Personnel Changes in the Central Government, The Session Dates of the National Political Council Are Undecided

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th] In order to enhance our strength and fight a long-term war, there will be some personnel changes in the central government after the Fifth Plenary Session on the 20th. The call for Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, to serve as Deputy Director-General is very high, but a decision must be made after the Fifth Plenary Session has added. However, it is rumored in official circles that Sun will be transferred to the position of President of the Executive Yuan, and Chen Cheng will serve as Minister of Military Administration. The above statements cannot be confirmed, but because the party continues to value the spirit of loyalty, the transfer of personnel in the Central Party Department is inevitable. The National Political Council was originally scheduled to convene once in March, but now, due to Wang's departure, the session dates are undecided. The speaker's seat will be announced after the meeting is convened.

### The Yangtze River is Treacherous, Foreign Ships Downstream Must Fly False Flags, Foreign Ships Robbed Outside the Wusong Estuary

[Reuters, Shanghai, 9th] It has been learned that the Japanese authorities in various parts of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have ordered that foreign ships will not be allowed to proceed unless they fly the Japanese flag and the Five-Colored Flag. As of now, British shipping and navigation have not been interfered with.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 9th] According to reports, six German expatriates residing in Hankou have taken a Japanese transport ship to Shanghai. Since the fall of Hankou, expatriates have not been able to leave the port, except for a small number who have been allowed by the Japanese authorities to take Japanese ships or planes to Shanghai.

### Japanese Threaten the Tianjin Concessions, Openly Making Demands

[Associated Press, Beiping, 9th] A spokesman for the Japanese special military office today publicly stated for the first time that the Japanese side strongly desires the Tianjin concession authorities to reorganize the police force in order to deal with the Japanese riots. In view of the current situation, the spokesman stated that the Japanese side will take more severe methods than those of December 12 last year, especially for Chinese transport, which is already severe but is still considered tolerant. It is necessary to take more severe measures. Due to the Japanese unification of vehicles, the number of Chinese vehicles going to the concessions has decreased by 20 to 30 percent, but foreigners believe that the Japanese side no longer prohibits food from entering the concessions. There are also few encounters between foreigners and the Japanese. These encounters often occur when soldiers from the British, French, and American forces take shortcuts back to camp at night, passing through Japanese territory and causing misunderstandings. However, they can be resolved, such as the conflict between the Japanese and Americans and the detention of the British. They are all resolved immediately. When foreigners asked the Japanese spokesman whether the Japanese side would deal with the situation again if the attitude of the concession authorities remained unchanged, the Japanese spokesman asked that the concession authorities reorganize the police force and take other necessary reforms in order to eliminate all troublemakers. Otherwise, they will take appropriate measures to deal with the situation. When asked about the nature of these measures, the Japanese spokesman replied that the Japanese side would not take inhumane methods such as preventing food from entering the concessions, but the Japanese side cannot predict what actions will be taken.

### Liyang Recovered, Our Guerrillas Increase in the Suburbs of Shanghai, The Japanese "Mopping-Up" Plan Fails

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Shanghai News: The guerrillas in the Jingqian area have established close ties with each other and are actively operating, having recovered Shenyang. The Japanese have repeatedly gathered troops from Jurong, Yixing, and other places to attack, but they have all been fiercely resisted and have failed to succeed. Currently, the Shen-Ju highway has been completely destroyed by the guerrillas, who are also operating in the Jurong-Nanjing highway area.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Shanghai News: Recently, for two months, the Japanese army has been mobilizing large forces in the western suburbs of Shanghai and in the Pudong and Puxi areas to carry out the so-called plan to mop up the Chinese guerrillas. The plan has now failed because the Japanese army cannot clear them out. When the Japanese army leaves, the guerrillas immediately return to their original defenses. The strength of the western suburbs of Shanghai has increased. The troops of Ding Xishan in Punan have even secretly crossed the river and entered the Qinghu Highway area. Currently, fighting has broken out again near Guanyintang on the Qinghu Highway. Japanese vehicles are now taking cover, and only a few small-caliber warships are patrolling the Huangpu River on alert.

Our Army in Northern Jiangsu Fights Bravely in the Snow

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 7th] Lianyungang has recently been experiencing continuous snow and rain, and the climate is severely cold. The mountain-ringed, sea-encircled war zone is swept by piercing north winds, yet our army continues to defend its positions in the ice and snow, and frequently launches surprise attacks. The Japanese stationed in Qishi, fearing our night attacks, burned down all the civilian houses in Qingzhuang to clear the line of fire. They attacked Daban jump, Climbing Hill Head, and other places, but were bravely repulsed by our forces. The Japanese also conscripted civilians to build aircraft in the port using coal as an air force.

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 7th] On the evening of the 1st, our army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese camp in the East Gate of Suyu during the Japanese celebration of New Year's Day, killing more than 20 Japanese soldiers and then safely returning to its original defenses.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Meets with Sichuan Military and Political Leaders, Instructs on Military Reorganization and Development Opportunities, Wang Zanxu is Steadfast in his Confidence in the War of Resistance

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Yesterday, Sunday, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with Deng Xihou and Wang Zanxu to discuss the reorganization of the Sichuan army. Today and tomorrow, they will discuss the progress of development in the southwestern provinces. According to external observations, after Wang Jingwei left Chongqing, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the National Government have gained greater support from the people, greatly increasing the strength of the War of Resistance.

[Special Dispatch from This Headquarters, Chongqing, 9th] Sichuan Chairman Wang Huanxu came to Chongqing to report on his work. According to him, "I have already made full preparations for a full-scale war with the Japanese. The Japanese can only occupy transportation lines and big cities, while we have a vast area beyond the points and lines. Our guerrillas make it impossible for the Japanese to advance further. The military operations of counterattacking Guangdong and Wuhan have already been arranged. Conghua, Huiyang, and Zengcheng will definitely be recovered. I have a strong division of troops stationed along the Yellow River. The Japanese are currently talking about attacking Lanzhou and Xi'an, which is just a pipe dream."

### Rumors that Wang Jingwei Met with Japanese Representatives in Hanoi, The Ugly Crowd in Nanjing Opposes Wang Serving as a Puppet, Wang Feels Distressed and Regretful

[Rapid Telegram from This Newspaper, Hanoi, 9th] According to informed sources, Wang Jingwei is still in Hanoi, residing at Zhu Peide's residence. Today, he and Zeng Zhongming had their first important meeting with representatives from the Japanese side at Zhu's residence. The details of the talks are unknown. His wife, Chen Bijun, has arrived in Hong Kong. It is generally predicted that Wang will also go to Hong Kong soon. Wang's spokesman categorically denied that Wang had gone to Shanghai to participate in the Nanjing puppet organization.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 9th] According to opinions in political circles here, Wang Jingwei has remained silent since resigning from the near cabinet. Furthermore, news has been obtained here that Wang had been in contact with the Chinese ugly crowd in Beiping before leaving the country, but had not contacted Liang Hongzhi and other rebels in Nanjing. As a result, the Liang rebels and others strongly opposed him becoming the president of a puppet central government. Japanese intelligence agencies urged Wang to organize a puppet government in Guangzhou, which Wang opposed. Therefore, Wang is extremely distressed and in a dilemma. Wang's whereabouts remain a mystery, and the news is conflicting. Some say Wang is in Hong Kong, others say Wang has left Hong Kong and gone to Shanghai to hide in the Hongkou area of Shanghai. As a result, the Japanese military police have imposed martial law in Hongkou. According to reliable sources, Wang is still in a villa six miles outside of Hanoi. Other news claims that Wang will go to the West soon and then to Europe because Wang is now disappointed and has encountered some difficulties.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 9th] Political parties here are not criticizing Zhuang Jingwei's "suggestions." The declarations issued by the Central Propaganda and Political Departments have clearly expressed their opinions, so it is not yet known whether the official criticism will be issued.

### Government Orders

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] National Government Order of the 9th:

(1) Dismissal of Anhui Provincial Security Department Deputy Director Jing Li Feng, this order. Appoint Huo Ou Tuan as Acting Deputy Director of the Anhui Provincial Security Department, this order.

### The Collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and Prospects for the Hiranuma Cabinet (Continued from Yesterday's Seventh Page)

— Li Wanju

Prospects for the New Cabinet

Kiichirō Hiranuma is one of the leaders of the fascist movement. This time, taking office as prime minister, his style is certainly not much different from Konoe's. However, his reckless actions will inevitably "go further." His future actions are worthy of our attention.

1.  Reorganizing the National Organization Movement. Although Japan is a country that reads martial arts and loves war, its people, who are relatively clear-headed, know that this invasion of our country is unjustified. Moreover, after the outbreak of the war, the large number of people mobilized, except for the ashes of the dead who were sent back, were never to return. The people fell from depression into pessimism, and their morale declined day by day, causing panic among Japanese party and government officials who did not know what to do. The arrogance of these warlords reached the point of helplessness. After the reorganization of the Konoe Cabinet in late May last year, with Araki joining, the so-called "National Reorganization" movement was accelerated in the hope of revitalizing the decadent spirit of the people. Now, one of the three giants of the National Reorganization movement, Kido, has taken the post of Home Minister, and the spiritual movement has been brought up again and actively promoted. This is naturally a matter of intention. As for the content, there will also be significant changes, but the extent of the changes is still unpredictable.

2.  Unlimited Spending on War Expenses. The amount of money Japan has spent in the year and a half of the war is not only unimaginable to the Japanese themselves but also beyond the expectations of people around the world. From July 7 to the end of last year, in addition to the consumption of most of the military supplies prepared by Japan in previous years, war expenses alone reached 8.4 billion yuan. Since the Sino-Japanese War could not be "resolved quickly" as envisioned by the Japanese military, no one dares or can determine when the war will end given the current situation. As the war is prolonged, war expenses will naturally have to be spent continuously, but how to raise funds has become a problem. Issuing huge amounts of public debt? Judging from past experience, Japan's stomach is not healthy, and its digestive capacity is very limited. Borrowing from abroad? During the year-long war, the Japanese military's bombing and killing in China, exclusion of foreign businesses, and restriction of foreign activities, in an attempt to dominate East Asia, have been deeply grieved by kind people all over the world. Recently, the attitude of British public opinion and even political circles has gradually become tougher, and large-scale foreign investment has become "impossible," without a doubt. The Japanese warlords, in a desperate situation, will force their government to implement the National Mobilization Law to allow for unlimited spending on industry expenses. If this is the case, entrepreneurs' investments and financial groups will inevitably stop moving forward, and the result for the war economy will inevitably be a hopeless situation.

3.  Domestic Affairs and Diplomacy. Hiranuma, as a leader of the fascist period, has always advocated the reform movement most vigorously. After the February 26th Incident, he became the chairman of the Privy Council. Due to his position as a senior official, all his actions were naturally cautious. He slightly concealed his edge for a while, but his original intention has not changed. Now that he has become prime minister, the so-called "administrative reform" is bound to be implemented. The results of its implementation will not only fail to clean up the domestic affairs but will also make them more chaotic. How it develops will soon be presented before our eyes. However, although Mikumo and other warlords strongly advocate dissolving the Diet, Hiranuma, for the sake of caution, is expected to temporarily find ways to avoid it. In terms of diplomacy, anti-British and anti-Soviet policies have always been the consistent policy of Japanese fascists. As for appeasing the United States, because the United States' policy is becoming increasingly tough, President Roosevelt, in his address to the 76th Congress on the 4th of this month, attacked dictatorial countries, using very strong language, and even advocated that democratic countries should unite to give aggressors severe sanctions. Therefore, the diplomatic policy towards the United States seems to have reached a dead end. As for diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, they will inevitably become more active. On the 5th of this month, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Ōshima held important talks in San Remo, Italy, and will also hold talks with their diplomatic personnel stationed in various European countries. From this, we can know that after Hiranuma takes office, Japan, no matter how it conceals its fascistization, will further establish close relations with Germany and Italy, which share similar interests. It is certain that it will strengthen the anti-Communist agreement and promote the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. (End of Collection)

### A Suggestion: Guilin Cave Education

— Tao Xingzhi

(I) Based on Several Facts

A. Guilin caves are famous all over the world. These caves are not only natural trenches but also natural public school buildings.

B. When the air raid alarm sounded on November 30, the common people went to these caves to avoid the air raid. The place I went to is called Zhiyan Rock. The common people gathered in three relatively large caves in huge numbers. I heard that there are more than a hundred such places in Guilin. I don't know if this is correct. Since several major bombings, the people's enthusiasm for entering the caves to take shelter must have increased.

C. When we are waiting for the emergency alarm to sound, we have half an hour to do nothing. After the bombing, the planes left, and we waited for a long time before the alarm was lifted. During this time, the common people have nothing to do.

D. I was originally giving a speech at the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement. Halfway through, I received an alarm and had to accompany the executive members of the association to Zhiyan Rock to continue the speech. The common people also felt interested and listened casually.

E. On the way to Zhiyan Rock, I saw several things that deserve attention and seem to need education to help solve: (1) There is no order in walking; (2) Many women are carrying one child and carrying another, and no one is helping. In narrow roads and cave entrances, children are in danger of being knocked down and trampled.

F. When there is no air raid alarm, the common people also go to the caves to take shelter until two or three o'clock before returning home, but the number is smaller.

G. It is estimated that there are 10,000 intellectuals in Guilin from both local and other provinces, and 1,000 to 2,000 people can be mobilized to engage in popular education to serve the common people. Wounded and recovered officers and soldiers can be selected to give speeches on heroic war stories.

(II) Propose Several Measures

A. Each large cave should be a wartime public school, and each small cave it contains should be a classroom. Educational arrangements and management should be made inside and outside the cave.

B. Organize the Guilin Wartime Popular Education Corps

1.  Organize education corps according to the number of caves. Each large cave should have a popular education corps responsible for it.

2.  Solicit voluntary corps members.

    A. Social organizations, government agencies, or schools that have the strength to independently organize a corps may establish a corps with the approval of the government, called a certain organization, agency, or school education corps, responsible for managing a large cave.

    B. Individual voluntary corps members will be assigned to a certain corps for service by the government based on their address and proximity. Or they will be organized into one or several corps.

    C. Corps members are purely voluntary.

3.  Each corps should have one corps leader, one deputy corps leader, and several branch corps leaders, who will be elected by each corps.

4.  Each corps may provide progressive teaching by teachers according to the needs of children, women, and young people.

C. Content of Cave Education

1.  First Grade - General Education Content Assembly:

    (A) Military and political reports (national, provincial, Japanese), focusing on recent news and analysis;

    (B) War stories;

    (C) Air raid common sense;

    (D) Teaching songs;

    (E) Scientific common sense - including public health and increasing production;

    (F) Preliminary civil rights and group life;

    (G) Literacy training, starting from recognizing slogans;

    (H) Children's games.

2.  Two lessons each time (air raid), half an hour each.

3.  Course materials should be prepared and instructed in general terms, experimented with, and revised.

D. Training of Popular Education Corps Members

1.  Preliminary centralized training for one week, two hours a day.

2.  After that, centralized training once or twice a week.

3.  Corps member training, based on general education content and the special needs of women, children, and young people.

4.  Establish demonstration areas, rotate to various caves to provide key guidance, so that the wisdom and education corps of each cave can learn better methods in practice.

E. Experimentation. Before general promotion, child drama troupes, the New Peace Travel Circle, the International Anti-Aggression Movement China Branch, and local organizations with rich experience in popular education may be selected to conduct experiments in a large cave, exchange results, and help solicit corps members during the experiment to facilitate the government's expansion of organization.

F. Organize a guidance committee, and the government will hire experts to be responsible for training corps members.

G. Organize an editing committee to produce materials for each corps to use.

H. Equipment. The minimum equipment is a map of China, a map of the world, and slogans that can be changed at any time. It is good to have a film projector, a radio, children's toys, and a simple medicine box, but it can be postponed if not.

I. Possible Achievements. The common people have ready-made time, intellectuals have ready-made contributions, and nature gives us ready-made classrooms. I think all three beauties are embodied. One thousand yuan can provide preliminary education to one hundred thousand or even two hundred thousand people, and the election can be extended to the same environment.

Editorial

### The Fifth Plenary Session under the New Situation

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee is now scheduled to be held within the month. As the national resistance war enters a new stage and the domestic and international situation is completely new, this plenary session has very important significance for the future of the Chinese nation and the future of world peace, and will have very important influence. We cannot but give it ardent support and close attention.

The Kuomintang is the largest political party leading the Chinese nation's resistance war and nation-building today, and it is also the party leading the country with one-sixth of the world's population to fight for independence, freedom, and happiness. This party has a glorious and great revolutionary history. Since the full-scale resistance war began, its prestige among the people of the country and international figures has been increasing day by day. However, it is undeniable that there are still many obstacles to the future of this party. Wang Jingwei's betrayal and the alienation and division of the Chinese people are reflections of shortcomings and obstacles. For the sake of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the future of world peace, we must strive for the Kuomintang to be more united, healthier, more advanced, and more revolutionary. The first task of this Fifth Plenary Session is to achieve this goal. Especially since Wang Jingwei's betrayal, on the one hand, a more united, healthier, more advanced, and more revolutionary future has been opened up before the Kuomintang. On the other hand, it has encountered the wanton alienation, slander, and destruction of national traitors, Chinese traitors, and corrupt elements within the party. Therefore, we hope that the Fifth Plenary Session will pay special attention to this, smash the traitors' conspiracy, improve the party's organization and discipline, and strive for a bright future. We hope that the Central Committee members currently abroad will rush back to Chongqing as much as possible to actively participate in the plenary session, while the Central Committee members who are usually close to Wang should take this opportunity to fulfill their loyalty to the party, clearly express their support for the central government, oppose division, and correct the views of China and foreign countries and break the poison of traitors!

The main condition for the Chinese nation to achieve victory is the unity of the entire nation, that is, the consolidation and expansion of the anti-Japanese united front. The reason why the Kuomintang's prestige has increased in the eighteen months of the resistance war lies in the fact that the party leaders are good at uniting people from all parties and factions and non-party people and implementing the national united front policy. However, the human traitors and national scum are doing everything possible to alienate and destroy it. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the same in the future. We admire the Kuomintang leaders for being able to overcome all obstacles in the past, but in order to thoroughly prevent and eliminate future obstacles, we should now determine the method of consolidating and developing long-term national unity, establish a national alliance for resistance and nation-building, and unite all parties, factions, ethnic groups, and sectors under the unified leadership of the Kuomintang for a long time, and work together to complete the sacred task of resistance and nation-building. News has come that the Fifth Plenary Session will seriously consider and implement the establishment of a long-term cooperation method proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China last year. This is good news for the people of the country, because this consideration can forever smash the traitors' conspiracy to provoke alienation and open up a bright and victorious future for the Chinese nation.

The progress of the political system and the improvement of political institutions are the basic conditions for ensuring the victory of the resistance war and the success of nation-building. This is the unanimous public opinion of the country since the full-scale resistance war began, and it is also the national policy that our central government has been seeking to realize day and night. However, in the past, due to regional or personnel relations, the central government's perfect policies and laws have achieved absolutely opposite results. This phenomenon is usually enough to hinder the implementation of the central government's policies and hinder the mutual trust and sincere cooperation between the government and the people, but during the period of resistance and nation-building, its impact is even more unthinkable! Recently, the Political Department of the Military Commission published an article "Discussion and Resolution on the Future Work of the Political Department," which stated that the Political Department has made very progressive resolutions on the political work in the new stage based on the bloody experience and lessons learned in the resistance war for a year and a half, which specifically pointed out that "politics is more important than military affairs." This is one example. How to actively support and develop public opinion organs, promote wartime democratic politics, implement necessary people's livelihood improvements, and eliminate corruption and local bullies and reform the Baojia system, etc., are all prerequisites for accelerating the concentration of national power to promote the work of resistance and nation-building and reaching the road to victory, and should also be the main topics of this plenary session.

At present, the resistance war has entered the second strategic phase of full-scale guerrilla counter-offensive from the strategic defensive phase of consuming enemy forces. The main task of this period is how to stop the enemy's offensive, how to widely launch and complete the new forces for counter-offensive preparations, so as to smoothly enter the third strategic phase and achieve the goal of expelling Japanese forces from China and establishing an independent, free, and happy new China. In order to faithfully implement and complete the major tasks of this period, we must redouble our efforts to enhance the combat effectiveness of the front-line troops, redouble our efforts to enhance and develop combat in the war zone and behind enemy lines, redouble our efforts to establish, consolidate, and expand anti-Japanese democratic power in the occupied areas, and redouble our efforts to develop military, industrial, transportation, construction, and production undertakings in the rear in a wider and more vigorous manner. Some of these requirements have been implemented, and some are being planned, but in order to achieve them quickly, effectively, and universally, this Fifth Plenary Session should further determine specific methods.

In addition, such as the implementation of new financial and economic policies, the universal implementation of comprehensive education for the resistance war, the wider and larger absorption of national youth into the Three People's Principles Youth League, improving the organization and development work, unifying and improving the public mobilization mechanism, and improving the diplomatic policy and its mechanism adjustment and enrichment, under the current new situation, we must also strive to realize them by means of a blitz. Regarding these issues, we have detailed our views in the New Year's message this year. We dare to submit them again to the Fifth Plenary Session as a humble offering, hoping that the members of the Central Committee will use them as reference materials.

### Deputy Commander Xiang Ying Talks About the Current Situation of the New Fourth Army: All 20,000 People Belong to Four Detachments; More Than 2,000 Casualties in Six Months of Fighting

[Reported from Shanghai by Our Newspaper] A foreign reporter sent a communication from the headquarters of the New Fourth Army south of Wuhu, describing the current situation of the army in great detail. He said that the area along the Yangtze River, from Nanxuan in the east to Anqing in the west and reaching the mountains, lakes, and rivers in the north and south, is where the New Fourth Army is active. At dusk and dawn, they suddenly attacked Japanese garrisons, sniped transport ships, overturned trucks, captured Japanese prisoners and returned to headquarters, and exploded Japanese storage areas, demolished bridges, and destroyed highways day after day, harassing Japanese sentries and occasionally attacking assembled regular Japanese troops. The New Fourth Army has about 20,000 people, divided into four detachments, two-thirds of whom are former Red Army soldiers, but they did not participate in the "Long March." At that time, they stayed in the rear, serving as conscripts to protect the Soviet area in preparation for the Anti-Japanese War. In 1934, when Zhu De and Mao Zedong led the main force of the Red Army on the Long March, a large number of Red Army troops led by Xiang Ying were also left behind to contain the attacks of the Central Army, and then they dispersed to various places. Xiang Ying is now the deputy commander of the New Fourth Army. According to reports, for the past three years, most of the Red Army has been living in the mountains, sleeping on the ground, often traveling more than a hundred miles a night, and carrying food for three days. Without the people, the Red Army would never be able to exist. When trapped, they relied on farmers and villagers to provide food and relied on their leadership to break through the encirclement. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the remnants of the Red Army in South China called on the government to transfer them to the front line to resist Japan. With the government's consent, in September, Xiang Ying went to Nanchang and held talks with He Yingqin, the representative of the Ministry of Military Affairs. In October, the Military Commission agreed to incorporate the former Red Army into the National Army. Ye Ting, the creator of the Chinese Red Army, was appointed commander, and each was designated as the New Fourth Army. Until December, they received an order to open the front line and summon the former Red Army scattered in various places. Each town and village left messengers to convey the message. The central government and the military did not fight. Since then, the Red Army's radio has also used this news to spread the news to middle-level commanders with radio. Officials used government trucks to go to Min, Zhejiang, Su, Wan, Yu, E, Yue, and Xiang provinces to spread Xiang's summons order. They then walked from these eight provinces to the meeting place. The shortest distance was 800 miles, and some people walked more than 2,000 miles. By the end of April, most of the army had gathered, accounting for 40% of the north bank of the Yangtze River and 60% of the south bank. Government personnel came to register the number of people and issue guns. Since the New Fourth Army fought with the Japanese army for the first time in Shucheng in early May, it has been fighting every day. According to their own records, the New Fourth Army fought for six months, and the Japanese army suffered more than 2,500 casualties, and about 500 rifles were captured. The New Fourth Army's base is in Anhui, and most of it is fighting on both banks of the Yangtze River in the province. A part of the army is active in Jurong and Jintan in the Nanjing area. Military supplies are supplied from the main base in Anhui. The New Fourth Army is commanded by the Third Theater Command and supplies military supplies. Its area of activity is roughly semi-circular, starting from the Nanjing area, extending 200 miles to the east and reaching Lu'an to the west. Its supply bases are within about 80 miles on both banks of the Yangtze River. The army on the north bank has 40% of its strength and is more suitable for guerrilla warfare than the south bank, because there are many steep mountains and forests, which can be easily hidden and ambushed, and there are also many large villages with sufficient food, and the mass movement is more popular. Therefore, when Japanese trucks drive into the area, the villagers are ready to help attack. According to the army, last summer, they overturned and destroyed as many as 60 Japanese trucks. The area of activity of the New Fourth Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River has two roads, which were used by the Japanese army to attack Hankou last summer. There is a mountain range between the two roads, so the area is also suitable for guerrilla warfare. According to the New Fourth Army, the highway from Hefei to Hanshan is now impassable, and the highway from Hefei to the south is often destroyed. When the Japanese army invaded Huangmei on the Hefei highway last year, although the New Fourth Army was not fully organized, it made full use of the terrain to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines, destroy highways, and destroy trees. At that time, the Japanese army had no surplus power and no intention of fighting with the guerrillas in the rear, and its invasion was therefore delayed. According to the army, when the Japanese army attacked Wuhan, they destroyed 150 Japanese trucks on the highway to Huangmei. Today, the New Fourth Army has captured Tongcheng, Shucheng, and Chaoxian. So far, the main bases of the Japanese army on the north bank are Hanshan and Anqing. The central bank is not as suitable for guerrilla warfare as the north bank, because there are many plains and crisscrossing rivers. The Japanese army can use small motorboats, and the river surface is about eight feet higher than the ground. The dikes are easy to break, causing floods, and there are almost no forests in the mountain range of Hejiang. The New Fourth Army is concerned about the people, so not only does it not break the dikes to trap the Japanese army, but it also prevents the Japanese army from doing so as much as it can. The Japanese army in the area, like the guerrilla areas in various places, only occupies the main traffic lines and large cities, and most of the area is still under Chinese rule. It is said that except for Jiangning County south of Nanjing, all other counties have county magistrates appointed by the government. To date, the Japanese army in the area has not dared to invade further, but has concentrated more to protect the traffic lines. The terrain behind the New Fourth Army on the south bank gradually rises, eventually reaching Huangshan, which is 1,400 meters above sea level. The area has beautiful scenery and a mild climate. Rice, wheat, and tea are the main products. The terrain is suitable for guerrilla warfare, and the products are abundant. The New Fourth Army in the area is expected to create a new record in its history.

### Specialized Personnel Trained in Yunnan: A Powerful Force for National Reconstruction

[Kunming Correspondent for This Newspaper] In the near future, Yunnan will become a major university center in China. Currently, important educational institutions in Yunnan include the recently nationalized Yunnan University and the Southwest Associated University, formed by Tsinghua, Peking, and Nankai Universities. The courses currently used by these universities are still pre-war. Many people are demanding the adoption of education for the extraordinary period and the abolition of pre-war systems. However, some experts want to maintain the old system, only adding or changing some courses. Their reason is that we must resist the war and build the nation simultaneously. Therefore, the responsibility of university education now is to cultivate talent that is currently adapted to the needs and to continuously produce elements for future national construction. Resisting the war is not just an empty slogan; we must have competent individuals emerge and we must have the knowledge and skills to meet our responsibilities. For a young person who has completed high school education, the country hopes that he can contribute more than just the strength of a 'soldier' to the country. Therefore, the country hopes that some young people will be mobilized to the front lines and some will stay in the rear to acquire knowledge, and then return what they have gained to the country. This is one conclusion of the war.

From the current point of view, this proposition does have its advantages. For example, the Burma Railway and the Xukun Railway currently under construction are both war resistance and national construction projects. The talent required for these two railways is entirely supplied by university graduates from 1938. The quiet construction in Guizhou and Guangxi is also based on this group of young people as the backbone. They only receive a salary of forty or fifty catties of rice per month, but their work is heavy and requires specialized training. If university education were abolished, how could we instill this basic and even specialized knowledge into this group of construction cadres without war? Another thing worth reporting is the Radio Research Institute established by Tsinghua University in Chongqing. Every year, it sends graduates from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University from the Kunming United University to work there and directly under the command of Tsinghua professors in the Kunming United University. Now, the radio vacuum tubes used by the national army are all supplied by this research institute. Each copper wire in these vacuum tubes is handmade by these young college students. They rely on their experience to use their hands to replace instruments. Although their products are not cheaper than imported products, we can at least save a lot of foreign exchange and don't have to buy from foreign countries!

The Southwest Associated University here is currently trying to enable students to acquire special skills in the War of Resistance while also having basic training. For example, for their fourth-year students in the Department of Electrical Engineering, in addition to the required course in wireless principles, they also need to discuss practical wireless tubes. This includes the manufacture of code transceivers, with an emphasis on manual training. The principles can be largely ignored. In this way, when they finish the course, they will be able to manufacture and erect communication equipment for three or four hundred miles. They themselves will also serve as receiver-operators, and they can also pass on this skill to a youth with a middle-school education, so that they also have this skill. That is to say, if a guerrilla detachment or any small unit has someone who has received this training, they can communicate freely with other places. But we know that a communication device for three or four hundred miles can be made by one person manually. However, a radio device that communicates with European and American countries cannot be erected and managed by the ability of one person alone. It requires more specialized knowledge. Electrical engineering alone is not enough. It also requires astronomers and mechanical engineers to help. Therefore, crash courses for the extraordinary period cannot replace the basic training of science. This is the principle of university education that can be seen in Kunming now. In the near future, Zhejiang Tongji University and Zhongzheng Institute will also come to Yunnan. Their teaching methods will certainly also embody this principle. - Min Ge She

### "Front Gate" Brand Cigarette Tin Explodes; Jiaxing × Chief Injured; Our Guerrillas Active Near Taihu Lake; Escapees from Jiaxing Talk About the Local Situation

[Shanghai Correspondent for This Newspaper] A certain businessman from Jingxing and Suzhou who recently went to the guerrilla area for business has recently returned to Shanghai. According to his interview with reporters, the guerrillas are becoming more active. Although × claims that the area has been pacified, this has not been achieved. In small villages less than five or six miles from Jiaxing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway line, there are guerrillas active. Those entering and leaving Jiaxing, unless they hang a "Good Citizen Card," are suspected of being the opposite. Those who offend × soldiers are abused. × troops explain their abuse of the people by saying that the person is a "Communist Party member." After Suzhou fell, only a small number of × troops remained stationed there. Recently, they have been harassed by guerrillas, and the × troops have no peace. Therefore, they are increasing their vigilance and reinforcing their forces. In the past, there were no military defenses in and around the city of Suzhou. However, in the past few weeks, bunkers and machine-gun nests have been built at the city gates. Every morning, gunshots from the × troops can be heard outside the city. The × troops say that they are practicing, but we know that they are fighting our guerrillas. Trains to Suzhou and Jiaxing run fairly on time. It is not possible to reserve or queue to buy train tickets, so people often gather at the station, waiting for the ticket windows to open. When × inspects the passengers' passes on the train, they collect a "small fee" for each item carried. One jiao for a bundle of fruit, two jiao for a package of clothes. Although there are no large-scale incidents of rape and looting now, at night, × soldiers still go to people's homes to rob valuables and harass women. Most of the rations needed by the Japanese army are forcibly supplied by the residents. × uses unscrupulous local ruffians as intermediaries to buy grain from farmers. Therefore, farmers and merchants can still buy and sell, but what they receive is the Japanese army's military currency. According to the current exchange rate, one yuan of Japanese military currency is worth one yuan of legal tender. However, in the past, the price of military currency was higher, with one yuan of Japanese currency being worth one yuan and two jiao of legal tender. The people have no trust in × troops due to the excessive issuance of military currency. They are also unwilling to accept Japanese paper money. Farmers often rely on homemade goods to survive, and they are still able to do so now. Therefore, the trade of Japanese merchants in the countryside has completely failed. Farmers try to exchange the Japanese currency they receive for legal tender, while merchants need Japanese currency because they are forced to use Japanese currency. The × army's efforts to prevent guerrillas from entering towns have also failed. A few days ago, a well-dressed Chinese man arrived at the military headquarters of Jingxing in a rickshaw. A servant came out to greet him. This person handed over two large tins of "Front Gate" brand cigarettes and a note, stating that they were to be delivered to the commander of the headquarters. "Front Gate" is the most popular cigarette brand in Jiaxing, so the × commander was very happy to see it. He opened the first tin and saw that the cigarette sticks were very neat. However, when he opened the second tin, a bomb exploded inside. The officer and many others were injured. When the Japanese army went out to arrest the person who sent the cigarettes, he had already disappeared. Although this person was able to enter, the local residents suffered a lot that night, as the × troops searched homes and arbitrarily arrested and punished suspicious people. The organization of the guerrillas behind the Japanese army's lines is clearly very strict. In addition to sniping at the × troops, there are also plainclothes teams active in towns and villages.

### Four Key Points for Young People

- Shen Junru

Starting from the life in the rural frontlines - Special report by this newspaper

Recently, I went to the front lines with Mr. Zou Taofen and others. I went to the Ninth War Zone. Due to time constraints, I cannot tell you all the details, but I will briefly talk about two points of my feelings. These two points of my feelings can also be said to be what I realized after going to the front lines.

These two points of my feelings are: (1) regarding the life of the soldiers on the front lines; (2) regarding the life of the vast majority of people in the country, which is rural life.

First, let's talk about the life of the soldiers on the front lines. People often ask: "Is the morale of the soldiers on the front lines strong?" I think this does not need to be asked, because what can we say about the hardship and loyalty of our soldiers and generals? The deeds are too numerous to mention. What I mainly want to talk about now is their lives. What is their life like? Their life can be said to have no so-called diet and daily life, nor so-called cultural life, etc. Not to mention the soldiers, even the generals often do not see a newspaper for half a month. How can we talk about spiritual food? As for another kind of food, they often don't eat anything for half a day. It is not necessarily because of a lack of food, but because they don't have time to worry about hunger, nor do they have time to cook. Cooking always has smoke and fire, which is enough to attract the enemy's attention and cause problems. Often, when cooking, if there is any disturbance, they have to give up. Food (especially drinking water) is really not easy to solve. On the front lines, there are no vegetables to eat. The people have run away, and there is nothing in the fields. In this way, vitamins are naturally lacking, and physical strength is affected. Regarding this vegetable problem, I heard someone say in Nanchang that transportation is very difficult. Because there is a lack of transportation, and even if it is transported, there are more important things than vegetables, so naturally vegetables cannot be sent first. Eating on the front lines is really a problem, such as salt, which is also very lacking.

There is no so-called "daily life" on the front lines. Often, when they need to sleep, they can't sleep, and there is no fixed time. Also, clothes are really not needed only when it is cold. Soldiers often sleep in the open air. Often, when they wake up in the morning, their chests are wet, which is very easy to get sick. It would be better if they had cotton vests.

There is also the problem of getting sick, which makes the soldiers even more painful. Not only the soldiers, but also the staff in the higher military organs in the so-called "rear of the front lines" also get sick a lot. Dysentery and malaria are the most common. Quinine is not absent, but the distribution is too insufficient. When they have chills and fever, they naturally have to rest, but they have to get up and hold a gun as soon as they feel a little better. They fight while sick. It is really touching. On the front lines, they walk at night. In the silence and darkness, we heard the moans of the soldiers and the sick soldiers. We only have emotion, only shame and uneasiness.

In this era of resistance, they have truly fulfilled the most arduous and sacred mission, but their lives are like this! This can and should be improved. As long as the front and rear are well connected, and the rear contributes more effort and more money, it can always be better. We people in the rear are really sorry for the soldiers on the front lines!

As for the so-called spiritual food, people in the rear now say that they want to send books and newspapers to the front lines. In fact, this is still empty talk. Because those books and newspapers can only be sent to the adjutant's office and the headquarters, etc., and cannot be sent to the soldiers on the front lines. Moreover, whether these books and newspapers can comfort them is still a question. From the point of view of volume, they cannot read our usual large newspapers in the trenches. They can only read smaller papers. I hope the cultural world will pay attention to this in the future. The reading materials should be small, and the content should not waste ink, because they need to save energy and time. The writing method should be concise, to the point, and clear, so that they can understand what is written at a glance. However, there are still very few such publications in the rear. If the cultural world sincerely wants to improve the lives of the soldiers on the front lines, they must do this!

Secondly, let's talk about rural life.

The life in the Chinese countryside can be imagined. In the countryside, regardless of men, women, old or young, they are all sallow and emaciated, not lively, not happy. The suffering they endure is by no means tolerable for people in the city. The houses they live in are very simple and dilapidated. They are very unsanitary. Most of the bedrooms are not lit by a little light, because there are no windows. It is pitch black at night, and there is still rotten mud under their feet. The construction of the countryside must be fundamentally changed. As for their diet, it is very bad. The things they eat and drink are simply unimaginable for their bodies. Since the bankruptcy of the countryside, the Chinese countryside is showing poverty everywhere. Also, there are too many illiterate people in the countryside. They cannot enjoy the pleasure of literacy like we do. They cannot obtain knowledge to influence their lives. They often cannot leave a place for the whole year. This is one reason why they have no knowledge. The War of Resistance has been going on for more than a year, but there are still many people in the countryside who are at a loss when asked about it.

After seeing the lives of the soldiers on the front lines and the farmers in the countryside, I thought that the sentence "young people should be hardworking" is for a reason. Today, our life should really take the life on the front lines as the standard. The responsibility of young people and cultural people is to reform society and change all the things that make people feel uneasy. Therefore, we should have a decision on our lives. What should our life be like? Currently, all parties are hoping for young people, and all parties are hoping that young people will take on the responsibility of reform. The generals on the front lines are eagerly hoping that young people will go to be lower-level enemy officers, hoping that young people will receive military education. In the administrative aspect, everyone also hopes that young people will go to be lower-level administrative officials. Currently, the county magistrates in many places cannot connect well with the troops, cannot cooperate well, do not know how to take responsibility, and do not care even when × people come. Therefore, good county magistrates are needed everywhere now, who are knowledgeable, capable, physically strong, enthusiastic about the War of Resistance, and even after being occupied, can still lead the people to fight as guerrillas. And this, everyone expects from young people. What all parties are hoping for from young people now is not empty talk, but hoping for actual responsibility. However, what should we young people do? We still feel that we need to learn, and young people still need to work hard to transform themselves and cultivate themselves. Working while learning in the work. According to general experience, young people are always stronger in doing things, but young people also have shortcomings, such as insufficient experience, etc.

Now I would like to suggest four points for young friends to consider:

First point: To be practical. - Young people are often too biased towards ideals, so there is a lack of young cadres who are truly capable of doing things. Therefore, to be practical. Everything must have concrete methods. Although the vision is very good, we cannot just have illusions. For example, a person's eyes can see a very far place, but there is no way under his feet. He cannot cross over there in one step, but must walk step by step. Whatever happens, you must act decisively.

Second point: To be great - I feel that the unity of Chinese youth is not enough at present. Often, they take themselves too seriously and cannot tolerate others. This has created all kinds of differences and all kinds of separations. It has already reached the point where we must unite to resist foreign aggression, but they are still unwilling to unite. This is very bad. We should make our minds and hearts great.

Third point: To be strong - After making a clear judgment on everything, we should do it strongly and not waver. - This is the strength of will. In addition, the body must also be trained to be strong. Only those with strong bodies can undertake arduous undertakings. For example, although I am old, I can still do some things because my body is still strong and can endure hardship.

Fourth point: To be tranquil - "Tranquility leads to far-reachingness" is the teaching of Zhuge Wuhou. These two words are excellent and not easy to explain. I would like to use driving a car as an example to explain it. When driving a car, the first thing is to concentrate. You must not think about other things when driving, otherwise problems will occur. To tell a joke, the philosophy of driving a car is "no two thoughts in mind." This is the root of tranquility. The second is to move forward. When driving a car, there is only forward, no backward. The third is to check yourself. When driving a car, the person and the car are one. I am the car, and the car is also me. Before driving the car, you must check the parts of your car, the water tank, etc., one by one. See if there are any problems that will hinder the journey. The most important part of tranquility is to check yourself. Fourth, pay attention to the actions on the street. When driving a car, you must pay attention to the actions of all people and things in front, behind, left and right. Pay attention to whether someone is walking over. Only in this way can tranquility be not a dead body. Fifth, avoid head-on collisions, because collisions do not necessarily achieve the purpose of eliminating obstacles, but will inevitably lead to the loss of yourself (the car). If you should stop, then stop. If you must take a detour, then you must take a detour. If you should get out of the car, then get out of the car. Persuade and take away the obstacles, and then move forward. Only in this way can tranquility have an effect.

My words should be over. In short, after I went to the front lines and saw the lives of the soldiers on the front lines and the lives of the farmers in the countryside, I thought of our responsibility, which should be to improve their lives in order to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance, and young people in particular should take responsibility. However, improving the lives of many people is something that only those who are hardworking and capable can do. Therefore, I suggest these four key points to young people: be practical, be great, be strong, be tranquil.

### Compatriots in Hong Kong Should Not Be Ashamed; Since the 15th Month of the War of Resistance, Compatriots in the Philippines Have Donated Over 10 Million; Calculated by Population, an Average of Over 100 Yuan per Person; The Boycott of Japanese Goods Has Spread Throughout the Philippines, and the Effects Are Becoming Increasingly Apparent

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the overseas Chinese in various places launched a patriotic donation campaign like a storm. In the Philippines, there are about 100,000 overseas Chinese. They are very enthusiastic about the patriotic donation campaign. In the ten days after the July 7th Incident, the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various chambers of commerce and groups to concentrate manpower and financial resources and unify the steps for resisting Japan and saving the country. With the cooperation of the local consulate and the party headquarters, and the harmonious cooperation of the Min and Yue overseas Chinese, the Philippine Chinese Anti-Japanese Committee was established. After one year and three months of hard work, it has concentrated on raising war funds, mobilizing public bonds, saving the country's regular monthly donations, and boycotting Japanese goods. The results are very good. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce received a work report from the association yesterday for the past fifteen months, which is excerpted as follows:

All Filipino Compatriots Are Mobilized

The Association is an organization spontaneously organized by the people. It is based on the spirit of automation and launches voluntary donations as the first step, calling on all compatriots, regardless of men, women, old or young, to mobilize together. On July 30, the Philippine Chinese Christian Youth Association invited wealthy merchants in the Chinese community to hold a discussion. In one night, more than 200,000 yuan was pledged. After the results were announced, the news spread like wildfire, and all parts of the island responded one after another. It is estimated that the association has remitted and directly remitted to the Ministry of Military Affairs and other government agencies successively up to 2,742,020.49 yuan. In September, Ning Hailing set up a fundraising committee for national salvation public bonds, a sub-committee in Hualvbin, and branches and fundraising agencies in various provinces. A total of 5,510,700 yuan was obtained for national salvation public bonds. After the fundraising for national salvation public bonds ended, in compliance with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, national salvation regular monthly donations were held. From the 27th of Ning Tuan Moon Scan to the end of September as the first phase, the amount collected and remitted was 2,378,798.40 yuan.

Donation Results Total Over 10 Million

The collection of war funds, national salvation public bonds, and national salvation regular monthly donations was at a time when business conditions were sluggish. Those who enthusiastically donated money often bear more than their own economic strength. This kind of rich spiritual sacrifice is admirable. However, there are also some who shirk their responsibilities and do not donate strongly, which is really regrettable. In the past fifteen months, the total amount of war funds, national salvation public bonds, and national salvation regular monthly donations amounted to 10,631,118.40 yuan. Calculated on the average of 100,000 people, each person has to bear 106 yuan. (The donations from the Aviation Construction Association, the Women's Comfort Association, the Guangdong Guild Hall, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Groups United Association, the Fujian Relief Association, etc. are not included). This result is really due to the sincere appeal of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the trust of the overseas Chinese, the efforts of the personnel of the Anti-Japanese Association in various places, the fundraising agencies, various national salvation organizations, various chambers of commerce, the efforts of various groups, and the cooperation of all members of the Association.

Mobilize the Whole Philippines to Boycott Japanese Goods

Under the decision of a long-term War of Resistance, boycotting Japanese goods to destroy the economic lifeline of the Japanese is a must. However, the overseas environment is different from the domestic one. How to avoid unnecessary sacrifices by overseas Chinese merchants, how to obtain the maximum price from the Japanese, how to take into account the neutral position of the resident government, and how to mobilize the efficiency of all the island's Chinese merchants must be planned in advance to be properly addressed. Therefore, before implementing the boycott, the Philippine Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce first convened various import merchants and trade associations, as well as relevant merchants, for detailed research. When the boycott was announced, a special committee was formed to carefully engage in the undertaking. The Boy Scout Corps was responsible for compulsory inspection and reconnaissance. Through the efforts of all parties, the gradual movement of resistance has now spread throughout the Philippines. The steps are gradually becoming more orderly, and the effects are becoming increasingly apparent. If our compatriots on the entire island can be united in good faith and maintain a unified will and steps, we will be able to achieve our established goals in the future.

Comforting Soldiers and Relieving Refugees

In addition to the above two points, the Association has also made joint efforts within the possible scope to promote a deeper understanding of the significance of our sacred War of Resistance to people of all countries, promote a deeper understanding, promote the sympathy of various countries, and connect the goodwill of friendly countries. In order to jointly unite the Chinese in the South Seas, the Association responded to the invitation of Mr. Chen Jiageng of Singapore and sent representatives Wang Quansheng, Chen Sanduo, and Xu Youchao to attend the General Assembly of Representatives of the Overseas Chinese in the South Seas for Fundraising for Refugees in the Motherland. In the future, our overseas Chinese in the Philippines should jointly promote the success of this great unity of the patriotic movement of the overseas Chinese in the South Seas. As for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees, its importance is no less than donating money to help the war. The Women's Group of the Association expanded its organization to form the Philippine Branch of the Chinese Women's Comforting and Self-Defense War of Resistance Soldiers Association, which is responsible for presiding over the event. The enthusiastic donations from the Chinese community have made its achievements very remarkable (omitted below).

### Restoration of Shipping Between Guangdong and Hong Kong? It is rumored that the Jinshan Ship Will Sail to Guangzhou Tomorrow; The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company Said it is Not True

After Japan occupied Guangzhou, it imposed a blockade on the Pearl River waterway, exclusively monopolizing shipping rights. The call for a quick restoration of the Hong Kong shipping line has been repeatedly rumored. However, due to the above-mentioned reason, it has not been realized. According to yesterday's De Chen West News, the Pearl River opening issue has been successful. The Jinshan ship of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company is scheduled to sail from the Wing Lok Pier to Guangzhou at 8 am on Wednesday, but it only carries passengers to Shameen. The ship will only stay in Guangzhou for 48 hours before sailing back to Hong Kong. After this experiment, the Pearl River is expected to be fully opened, and the ships can run as usual. However, according to the news from the Chinese office of the shipping company, they said that they had not heard of the news. The Jinshan is still sailing the Hong Kong-Macau line and has not prepared to change its route to Guangzhou.

### Relief Federation of All Circles Urges All Relief Receiving Organizations to Report Relief Fund Income and Expenditures

Deadline for Reporting to the Federation is the End of This Month; Report on Investigating Refugees Sent to Guangdong Chairman

The Joint Relief Federation of All Circles in Hong Kong for South China Refugees held a standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Lu Fu (Chairman) of the Chinese Arts and Sanitation Advancement Association, Li Jianfeng of the Journalists Association, Lu Guomian of the Qi Sheng Charity Society, Zhou Xingchi of the New Food Merchants Association, Zhao Ruolan of the YWCA, He Yuzhen of the Women's Comfort Association, Lin Peisheng of Tung Wah Hospital, Liu Qing of the Women's War Relief Association, Lin Siming of the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce, Ye Chanyuan of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, He Xiangning of the Children's Welfare Association, and others. During the meeting, it was discussed that since the establishment of the General Assembly, eight months had passed, and a report on the situation of the relief work in the past eight months should be made. It was resolved to send letters to each group and the various organizations receiving relief funds, requesting them to report. At the same time, regarding the telegram from Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, requesting an investigation of the disaster areas, it was limited to five days for the General Affairs, Investigation, Relief, and Propaganda groups to be responsible for the statistics. Five proposals from the Standing Committee were resolved, and the five resolved proposals are recorded as follows: (1) It is proposed to send letters to each group and the various organizations receiving relief funds from the Federation, requesting a report on income and expenditure before February 1st, in order to clarify procedures and facilitate public announcement. (2) It is proposed that future domestic relief efforts, to the extent that the Federation is capable, be handled directly or assisted by the Federation's relief group, with funds at the disposal of the relief group. If the Federation is incapable, it will entrust the requesting relief organization to distribute the relief on its behalf, but the details of the relief situation and the amount of income and expenditure must be reported to the Federation for investigation, and the funds will be signed off by the General Affairs Group. (3) It is proposed to allocate 1,000 national currency units to the Propaganda and Relief Association to relieve refugees. (4) It is proposed to entrust the General Affairs, Relief, Propaganda, and Investigation groups to investigate the disaster situation in South China and report in detail to Chairman Li Hanhun within five days. It is said that the above resolutions will be passed at the 31st Joint General Assembly today. The meeting address is at the 4th floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and the time is 3:00 PM.

In addition, Mr. He Xiangning handed over 100 national currency units from the Huizhou Association of the Dutch East Indies of Java, Nanyang, through Zeng Guihe, and Dai Quji handed over 90 national currency units from the "Polyphony No. 1 Union Workers," totaling 190 national currency units, which were sent to the Federation to relieve refugees.

### In the Fourteen Months Since the Anti-Japanese War, Over 10,000 Hong Kong Fishermen Have Been Killed, Property Losses Totaling 8 Million Yuan, and 628 Vessels Have Been Burned

Since Hong Kong fishing boats have been ravaged by × warships or armed fishing boats, the suffering of the population and the loss of silver have been incalculable. According to the investigation, from September 12, 1937, to November 30, 1938, the number of deaths reached 10,092, property losses amounted to 8 million yuan, and 628 vessels were destroyed. The figures for December to the present have not yet been calculated. It is now heard that the Fishermen's Association has petitioned the central government to find ways to provide relief. Mr. Xu Shiying of the China Relief Society has also reported to the central government to appeal on their behalf. After the central government investigates the matter thoroughly, there will certainly be legal measures to warn them in the future.

### A Builder in Shek Kip Mei Village, Sham Shui Po, Robbed Late at Night; Seven Armed Robbers Rushed in and Looted, Losses of Over 900 Yuan in Gold Jewelry and Clothing

Zhu Yangwen, a 50-year-old builder, lives with his family in a certain house in Shek Kip Mei Village, Sham Shui Po, and employs a female servant, Ouyang Yue, to assist with housework. They have been living in peace for a long time. At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhu and his family were fast asleep. Zhu woke up in the middle of the night and saw the servant Ouyang Yue in the hall. He asked her what was going on. According to her, she heard someone knocking on the door and suspected it was her sister returning home, so she got up to open the door. Zhu listened and allowed it. Unexpectedly, as the door opened, four unfamiliar men suddenly rushed in, one holding a pistol, two holding iron bars, and one empty-handed. They first intimidated the servant, then broke into the room and subdued Zhu and his family. Subsequently, three more men followed in and began to search and loot extensively. After several tens of minutes, clothing chests and valuables were all looted. Then they took a ladder and climbed over the wall to the neighboring house, escaping one by one from the rooftop. Afterwards, Zhu immediately blew a whistle to call the police, and after checking the belongings, estimated the loss to be approximately 973.04 yuan. Shortly after, the police arrived after hearing the news and accompanied Zhu to the police station to report the case.

### Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau Agrees to Allocate Railcars to Transport Refugees to Shenzhen; Rural Charity Society in Shenzhen Helps with Spring Ploughing; Guangdong Relief Society Establishes Mobile Hospital to Save Refugees

Since the Relief Federation took over the Shenzhen Refugee Reception Center, it has been actively expanding the internal facilities. In recent days, the head of the Federation's Relief Group, Lin Peisheng, has been very busy going to the local area to plan all the work. According to Mr. Lin's return, two broadcasting stations will be built tomorrow. After completion, refugees can reach the British border in less than two minutes, which will provide greater safety for the refugees in the future. He also said that yesterday they continued to select and move refugees from Ping Shan. Those willing to go to Shenzhen reached more than 300 people, which was one of the best results since the relocation began. After the relocation of Ping Shan is completed, they will successively select and move refugees from Fanling Station and Tuen Mun San Hui. They have already obtained the consent of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau to transport Fanling refugees to Shenzhen free of charge with multiple railcars tomorrow. In Shenzhen, there will be an organization of rural charity societies, whose purpose is to carry out refugee relief work in the war zone from the British border to the Dongjiang River. The first team of ten service personnel has already started preparing work in Shenzhen, and two more teams will depart during the day to assist refugees returning to the recovered areas to engage in spring ploughing. The society is managed by Chen Pishi and cooperates with Wu Changyao of the Chinese Red Cross. Wu is responsible for organizing the hospital, which is sponsored by the Guangdong Relief Federation and has obtained the cooperation of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, which will send personnel to serve. The hospital is planned to be converted into a mobile one in the future to meet the needs of the rural environment, but a surgical operating room will still be set up. The Chinese Red Cross has already agreed to donate a full set of surgical instruments, and the Chinese Medical Association has also sent a surgeon to serve. Although the hospital has only been open for a week, many villagers in the nearby area with illnesses go to the hospital for treatment. The hospital has now admitted 150 patients. Since its establishment, five babies have been born in the hospital's maternity ward, including one boy and four girls. The mothers are all refugees. In addition, the society hopes to establish medical clinics in Nantou and Shatoujiao to expand its scope of work.

### Another Brave Man Shot and Wounded in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon; The Shooter is an Indian Soldier Stationed in the Camp; The Wounded Man Fainted on the Spot and Was Sent to the Hospital

At around 6:00 PM yesterday, another shooting occurred in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon. As a result, a soldier in the camp was shot and wounded by an Indian soldier stationed in the camp. The wound was on the right shoulder near the kidney. The wounded man was about 30 years old. After being injured, he was unconscious and was sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. According to the Indian soldier who fired the gun, he told the commanding officer that the wounded man intended to leave the camp. He ordered him to stop, but the wounded man continued to move forward, so he fired the gun. It has been found that since the arrival of the brave men stationed in Ma Tau Chung, on the eve of Christmas, Indian soldiers stationed in the camp shot and wounded two people. One person died the next day, and the other wounded person is still being treated in Kowloon Hospital. Now, a similar incident has occurred again. Perhaps the Indian soldiers stationed in the camp and the brave men cannot communicate with each other, resulting in conflicts. It is hoped that appropriate measures will be taken to handle the aftermath. According to a report in the South China Morning Post yesterday afternoon, a brave man in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon had left the camp and his whereabouts are still unknown. It has been found that the Indian soldier rifle team stationed in the camp is only equipped with concussion guns. When the on-duty soldier discovered it, he fired a shot at him, believing that he had hit him. Unfortunately, only a few small bullets had little effect. It is also said that after this incident, the soldiers guarding the area were issued live ammunition for their rifles.

### The National Hospital Maternity Ward is Lent to the Children's Welfare Association to Shelter Refugee Babies; Renovation Will Be Completed in Two Weeks; Up to Eighty Refugee Babies Can Be Sheltered

The Hong Kong branch of the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association has requested the government to lend out the maternity ward of the old National Hospital for the purpose of sheltering orphan babies. Now, with the government's permission to lend it out, the Association has started to renovate the interior of the maternity ward in order to be able to move the refugee babies in as soon as possible. The interior setup is expected to be ready in about two weeks, and up to eighty refugee babies can be sheltered. It has been found that the refugee baby shelter not only shelters refugee babies under one year old, but also shelters orphans of Hong Kong residents who have died of illness. Currently, charitable organizations are sending more than ten orphans from Tung Wah Hospitals, twelve from Po Leung Kuk, and more than twenty from private individuals to the shelter, totaling seventy, including refugee babies. However, there is a severe shortage of breastfeeding utensils, powdered milk, and clothing for these dozens of refugee babies. The Association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate milk, milk bottles, clothing, and other items.

### With a Sense of Justice, Indian Doctor Yadao Flies to Chongqing Today to Return to the Front Line, Carrying Three Sets of Amado's Laryngoscopes Worth a Fortune

Indian doctor Yadao, who supports our country's War of Resistance with justice, led a team of five doctors to serve in China, traveling back and forth across the country, and his enthusiasm for treating wounded soldiers and refugees is commendable. It has been found that Dr. Yadao fell ill in late last month and came to Hong Kong for a long period of recuperation. He has recently recovered and is scheduled to fly back to Chongqing from Hong Kong by plane today to return to the front line to serve. This great spirit of fearlessness is worthy of our admiration. Dr. Yadao also mentioned that the equipment was prepared by the team itself.

### Guangdong New Chairman Li Hanhun Sends Telegram to Hong Kong to Console Overseas Chinese; Expresses Respect for Overseas Chinese' Concern for the Motherland; Hopes to Promote and Carry Forward the Responsibility of Every Citizen

Chairman Li believes that the Hong Kong overseas Chinese, whether they have enthusiastically donated money or participated in the war effort, are showing justice, which is admirable. On the day of his inauguration, he sent a telegram to Li Xingchong, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, to convey his condolences to all overseas Chinese. The text of the telegram reads: "Hanhun has served in the army for a long time. When Guangzhou fell, he was ordered to return to the army. He was just about to repair my spears and eliminate the stubborn ×, but he was briefly ordered to govern Guangdong. With the rest of his military life, he bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining the border. At a time when the four suburbs are heavily fortified, there are those who abandon difficulties and leave great achievements. The military affairs are urgent, and I cannot refuse to shoulder the responsibility. Therefore, I took office today. Considering the affairs of the province, there are countless things to be managed. After the relocation, it is necessary to rectify them. Han accepts the order to overcome difficulties and dedicates himself to his hometown. He only has to use his wisdom and loyalty to revitalize the Party and the country. The sages have said that governing does not require many words. I secretly admire this meaning. I hope that the people and gentlemen of the country will not hesitate to supervise and urge me, so that I can take it as a guide and use it as a rule. Since the War of Resistance, the people of Guangdong have been able to deeply understand the great righteousness and endure hardships without complaint. Especially my overseas Chinese compatriots have cared for the motherland, either with their blood and sweat, enthusiastically donating money, or with men rushing to me, not avoiding dangers. The righteousness is shining, which is admirable. The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. I hope that all of you will follow the precepts of not being proud when you hear of victory and not being discouraged when you hear of defeat, and even more carry forward and expand it. I respectfully send a telegram to express my condolences, and I cannot write them one by one. Li Hanhun (Four branches) Xu."

### Hong Kong Air Force Held a Large Bombing Exercise Yesterday; Dropped 500-Pound Large Bombs; Bombed Shek Ngau Wan in the New Territories

In order to review the air defense capabilities, the Hong Kong military authorities have been continuously conducting live ammunition exercises of the air force and anti-aircraft guns for the past month, and have achieved very good results. Recently, in order to test the power of bombs, a large-scale bombing exercise was carried out. The Air Force Headquarters issued a notice a few days ago, scheduling the exercise to be held at Shek Ngau Wan in Ma Shi Wan, New Territories, on the next two days. It has been found that from 10:00 AM yesterday, the Air Force Department dispatched multiple bombers equipped with multiple 500-pound and 50-pound large bombs, flying out one after another. At the designated exercise location, they took turns dropping bombs, and the loud explosions of the bombs resonated far and wide. The exercise ended at 5:00 PM, and the team returned to the airport. Planes will continue to be dispatched for exercises today. It has been found that the dangerous area of this exercise extends to within 2,500 yards of Shek Ngau Wan. Ships are not allowed to approach during the exercise.

Special Article of This Newspaper

### Mr. Tao Xingzhi Talks About the Education Problems in Hong Kong

— Zhuo Qi

Running a school should have a purpose, not to make money

Mr. Tao Xingzhi discussed the general education problems during the war, and the reporter once published a special article in this newspaper on New Year's Day. What are Mr. Tao's thoughts and instructions on education in Hong Kong? This problem, which is even closer to us, is an important problem that those who care about it are concerned about. Now, let the reporter report to the readers the conclusions drawn from the interview with Mr. Tao, and especially ask the school authorities and the cultural and educational circles to pay attention to it.

A building, a signboard, students paying expensive tuition fees, teachers "reading from the book," trading and leaving, each getting what they want. Let the personality edification and national consciousness be dead nouns in education. Such education really makes us feel a headache. The first question to ask Mr. Tao, of course, is this problem of commercialization of education.

Mr. Tao's answer is this: "We cannot be too harsh on the expensive tuition fees of general schools in Hong Kong, because the schools have no funds. How can teachers run schools on empty stomachs? Under a capitalist society, knowledge has also become a commodity, and the form of buying and selling is inevitable. The key is that schools should have a purpose in running the school in addition to charging tuition fees. It is still not blameworthy to work hard towards the purpose of running the school. If you collect the fees and then everything is over, and you do nothing in a muddled way, purely for the purpose of making money, then it is unforgivable. As for the implementation of education, there should be at least one current affairs interpretation per week. After understanding current affairs, young people will surely be aware of the hope that the motherland has for them, and will surely realize that it is not enough to just know English."

Although Mr. Tao's answer is very simple, the meaning is very concise. The first is not to be too harsh on the commercialization of education in a capitalist society, and the second is that there should be a purpose in running the school, and at least one current affairs interpretation should be given per week.

The second question is the ideological problem of some students in Hong Kong. The reporter uses the experience of a young friend as a concrete example: She is a student of a certain secondary school in Hong Kong. When she saw the heroic eight hundred warriors and the fluttering national flag on the screen in the theater, she sensitively stood up to pay tribute. However, she was the only one standing in the entire theater, and the contemptuous and horrified gazes were concentrated on her. She felt very embarrassed. She forgives the ignorant crowd. But she was indignantly dissatisfied that her classmates were also so confused. When she returned to school to debate, her classmates poured cold water on her with specious words.

Mr. Tao smiled and said: "This is because her skills are not enough. She should simply explain the reason for paying tribute and call on everyone to stand up together. At that time, some people will definitely be moved and respond, and even those who do not stand up will not dare to laugh at others, right? She is very enthusiastic and patriotic, but she doesn't have enough courage! ..." The reporter also laughed along with Mr. Tao.

The third question is the boredom of cultural people who have fled to Hong Kong.

With the expansion of the occupied areas, cultural people have also been forced to flee to Hong Kong. The number is so large that doctors alone account for more than 120 people. Other teachers, students, writers, reporters... are countless. Many of this large group of intellectuals are also sensitive. Lying idle in Hong Kong, they have tasted all kinds of embarrassing stimuli. Those with slightly less firm will immediately show signs of shaking, pessimism, and decadence.... In the midst of the high-pitched call for national mobilization, and the panic of the lack of cadres in the mainland, on the one hand, there are people who have nothing to do, and on the other hand, there are things that no one can do. What a contradictory phenomenon!

Mr. Tao's answer is: "Those who have no work to do in Hong Kong should return to the mainland to work. It is certainly not easy to find a job for a doctorate with several hundred yuan in this day and age. In fact, there is work to do everywhere. Zhao Laotai only knows the four characters 'Zhao Hongwenguo', how can she have something to do? Why is she welcomed everywhere? People should look for things to do, not wait for things to look for people...."

Hearing this, the reporter interrupted and said: "Indeed, there are also many young people who are willing to work hard and serve the country, but unfortunately there is no way to apply!"

Mr. Tao continued: "Mobilization work is now in progress; it is not a problem to find work in the mainland at present."

### The Gambling Case of Da Guan Film Company Adjudicated; Zhao Shushen and Chen Chengjia Guilty of Gambling; Representatives of the Women's Comfort Association Attend the Court to Deny Knowledge; Zhao and Chen Both Fined Ten Yuan, Others Reprimanded

The case of Zhao Shushen, the manager of Da Guan Film Company, and Chen Chengjia, an employee, who were previously charged with gambling, has been reported in previous newspapers. The trial resumed at 11:30 AM yesterday, with Deputy Attorney General Wei Yi prosecuting and lawyer Mai Jialin defending the defendants. Because the testimony of Tang Shurong in the previous trial of this case involved the Women's Comfort Association, the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association specially sent several representatives and entrusted the Association's perennial legal advisor, lawyer Guan Zuyou, to attend the court to observe the trial. After the court session began, the ninth defendant, Li Jia, did not attend, and the judge ruled that the bail money be confiscated. The second defendant, Chen Chengjia, testified, stating that he was an employee of Da Guan Film Company and a member of the Da Guan Company Sports Association. On the evening of the 24th of last month, the Sports Association held a variety show, which included poker, pai gow, billiards, ring toss, etc., with commissions donated to refugees. Gambling was not done with cash, but with green, white, and red paper slips instead. Green ones were worth one yuan, red ones were worth one dime, and white ones were worth one cent. About 200 people came to play that night from 1:00 PM. He then answered the cross-examination of the chief prosecutor, lawyer Wei Yi, saying that when the police surrounded and arrested them, he was managing the pai gow commission box. He had never been a banker, and there was no fixed amount for the commission, but it depended on the person. Approximately three or four tenths of the winnings were taken as commission. He was only in charge of managing the commission affairs, and he did not know about the other arrangements. Lawyer Guan Zujing then made a statement on behalf of the Women's Comfort Association, stating that although the Women's Comfort Association had held celebrity football matches and other events to raise funds to relieve refugees in the past, they had not heard of Da Guan Company raising funds for the Association this time, so they did not know the methods they adopted. Lawyer Mai Jialin, the defendant's lawyer, and chief prosecutor, lawyer Wei Yi, then discussed the case in detail. At 1:30 PM, the judge finally ruled that the first defendant, Zhao Shushen, and the second defendant, Chen Chengjia, were guilty and fined ten yuan. The other defendants were warned not to commit the crime again in the future.

### One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement; Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Expands Promotion; Held Separately by Various Merchant Shops

The Chaozhou Eight Counties Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong held a meeting yesterday afternoon to respond to the One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement. Chairman Lin Zican and other councilors jointly discussed and negotiated promotion methods. As a result, it was decided to expand the promotion, and the method was to be handled separately by various Chaozhou merchant shops, held by the east and west families separately. For example, if a merchant shop has 30 employees, the 30 employees will solicit from relatives and friends. Assuming that each person gets two people, then the employees of the shop can bear a minimum of 90 yuan in debt repayment money. The shop also repays 90 yuan from the east family. The number of employees in each shop is based on this method. In this way, the scope can be expanded.

### Hong Kong Tenants' Association

— Luoxia

A Conversation with the Person in Charge

To escape the ravages of the × people, hundreds of thousands of compatriots have poured into this haven of Hong Kong. As a result, empty buildings that were once overlooked are now being snapped up for rent, and some landlords are taking advantage of the situation to increase rents. Countless compatriots are being forced to move, and countless compatriots are being left to sleep in the open. The whole of Hong Kong has been seething. Today, the tide of evictions seems to have subsided on the surface, but the undercurrents are still too numerous to count. Therefore, the long-planned Hong Kong and Kowloon Tenants' Association was quickly established. Yesterday afternoon, a ceremony was held at the Winsor Hotel to receive reporters and report on the preparations. In today's situation where countless tenants are restless, the birth of this association is of great significance.

Before the meeting started, guests from all sides arrived one after another. At this time, they gathered in groups of three or five by the fireplace; or sat around the table, talking and laughing. The roaring fire reflected on everyone's faces, giving them a rosy complexion. When the topic turned to the unscrupulous landlords forcing evictions, everyone gnashed their teeth, their bodies burning with heat; it was hard to tell whether it was the warmth of the fire or the high tide of anger. On the left, someone said, "Secure housing before prosperous business"; on the right, someone said, "The landlord's forced eviction is tantamount to disrupting social order and tranquility." A 'Uncle' sitting on the side sighed and said, "Some tenants are suffering from the double oppression of the landlord and the sub-landlord, isn't that even more miserable?" Everyone listened, and fell silent!

Talking about the issue of membership qualifications, a member of the preparatory committee said, "According to the articles of association, not only can all tenants join, but landlords are also welcome to join, because the articles of association stipulate provisions for mediating member disputes." A guest on the side interjected, "Landlords and tenants are as different as horses and cattle. Since this association was established to resist forced evictions by landlords, how can we expect landlords to join the tenants' camp? Isn't this a farce?" The person in charge listened and pondered for a moment, saying, "This question is worth studying!"

Then they talked about the fact that the lower and middle classes suffer the most oppression, so they especially welcome tenants of bed spaces to join the association, provided they can pay the fees according to the rules. However, most bed space tenants are poor lower and middle class people, whose daily rent is only one or two dollars. Can they pay the membership fee and basic fund of three dollars and forty cents at once? The person in charge also pondered for a moment, saying, "This question is also worth studying!"

The landlord's unreasonable eviction will naturally lead to litigation, and the tenants' association will naturally help its members. In that case, all the costs of lawsuits will of course be borne by the association? The person in charge also pondered for a moment, saying, "This is also worth studying!"

The so-called unreasonable eviction by the landlord, but how exactly is it unreasonable, and what is the standard to use? "Of course, we will base it on the government's regulations that landlords' rent increases cannot exceed 25%," the person in charge said affirmatively. However, if a tenant suffers from the landlord's oppression, once a lawsuit is filed, the authorities will naturally cite this regulation, without the need for the Tenants' Association to worry about it.

Continuing to talk about the regulations for protecting tenants that the authorities need to issue, there are many points that are not yet perfect, such as "if the tenant's losses are not as great as the landlord's losses, the landlord can demand that the tenant move out." "This clause gives landlords many opportunities for forced eviction. Regarding this type of issue, we would like to collect all of them and submit them to the government, calling for improvement!" Among the many words spoken by this person in charge, this should be a relatively satisfactory statement!

Transportation and Travel

### A Tour of the Champs-Élysées in Paris

The Champs-Élysées is the most beautiful and moving avenue in Paris, and also the best-designed thoroughfare in the world. It is the first scenic spot for tourists who come to Paris for the first time. What Paris can offer is the Champs-Élysées. After I arrived in Paris, although there were many places I wanted to visit, the Champs-Élysées was an important destination. It was a clear and sunny morning. The rain had stopped, and the streets were still very wet. I put on a raincoat and hurried to the Louvre Museum. Leaving the square of the museum, I suddenly left the hustle and bustle of the city and entered another quiet and secluded realm. Around me were only green meadows, colorful and vibrant exotic flowers. In front was a round square, also planted with many flowers and plants, designed into various patterns, which is the Place du Carrousel. Cars can enter from the left gate of the museum, pass through this round square, and then exit from the right gate of the museum. Passing the round square, standing in front is the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. This Arc de Triomphe is much smaller than the Arc de Triomphe at the Place de l'Étoile. It is only 48 feet high, 63 feet wide, and 21 feet deep. It was built by Napoleon I to commemorate his two victories in 1805 and 1806. Although this Arc de Triomphe is not as magnificent as the one at the Place de l'Étoile, it is also exceptionally elegant in design. The original design was by the famous artists Fontaine and Percier, based on the Roman Arc de Triomphe. The top is engraved with many war-related reliefs, all carefully crafted by the major artists of the time. More interesting is a chariot drawn by four horses on the upper level. This chariot is no longer the original from that year. When Napoleon built this Arc de Triomphe, the chariot was originally a trophy seized from Venice, Italy. Of course, this was used by Napoleon to represent their victory commemoration. In 1814, when France was defeated, this chariot was requested by Italy and had to be removed from the top of the Arc de Triomphe and returned to Italy. Later, King Louis XVIII of France re-made one and installed it, which is the original object that remains today. The history of this Arc de Triomphe is nearly two hundred years. It has personally witnessed the rise and fall of the French dynasties. Now it is also weathered and dilapidated, no longer with the heroic posture of the past.

Walking forward from this Arc de Triomphe, you will soon reach the Jardin des Tuileries. At the top of the garden, there is a wide walkway, but vehicles cannot pass through it. This garden has an area of only about fifty acres, with trees, flowers, pavilions, and terraces, arranged in a charming and orderly manner, punctuated in the midst of the colorful scenery by fountains and art sculptures. This area was once the imperial palace. Napoleon I also resided here during his reign. Unfortunately, after he went abroad, several revolutions occurred. This palace was also repeatedly destroyed. Finally, in 1871, the Communists occupied Paris. This magnificent Tuileries Palace was also burned to the ground. The current garden is the site of the former palace. The vicissitudes of life are truly unbearable to recall.

Walking into the intoxicating Tuileries Garden, what appears in front of you is the world-famous Place de la Concorde. In my personal estimate, the perimeter of this square is at least half a mile. To the north is the Ministry of the Navy, to the south is the Seine River, to the east is the Tuileries Garden, and to the west is the Champs-Élysées. I remember that Su Dongpo has a famous saying, "All things are observable, and if they are observable, they are all delightful." I feel that when visiting scenic spots, if you always have a mood of appreciation and remembrance, then naturally "all things are observable," not only approachable but also delightful. The same thing, in the eyes of someone who is good at textual research, is loved and cannot be released, while in the eyes of another person, it may seem ordinary and not worth a look. I think it is a pity that a visit without the ability to appreciate and remember is a most regrettable thing. Why am I suddenly talking about this? Because the Place de la Concorde, in the eyes of ordinary people, is just a bustling place with heavy traffic, and it is over after a hasty walk. How can you know that this square contains many interesting historical materials and occupies a very important page in French history?

In the center of the square stands a stone monument. At first glance, it seems very ordinary. If you study it, then this stone monument has its origins. The monument is named Obelisk of Luxor, 76 feet high and weighing 240 tons. It was given to King Louis Philippe of France by the King of Egypt in 1831. Let's think about it, how could such a huge stone be transported from Egypt to Paris at that time? It seems like a dumb riddle. According to historical records, this giant monument was placed in the Place de la Concorde in 1836. From this calculation, the time spent transporting it in transit was nearly five years. At that time, for the sake of a giant stone, I don't know how much manpower and material resources were spent. The tyranny of the emperors in the autocratic era often created things that could not be created. The Great Wall of China and the Pyramids of Egypt are not obvious examples?

On each side of the giant monument there is a large fountain, divided into several shapes like candlesticks, spraying to a height of about 30 feet. The central pipe sprays straight into the sky, and there are several smaller pipes around it that spray towards the middle, splashing beads and flying jade, which is very beautiful. Among the many fountains in Paris, these two may be the greatest and most beautiful. Looking at this vast round square, and the bustling traffic of soldiers, horses, and pedestrians, it seems that this place is only full of joy and harmony. However, if we recall the history of France, then this "joy" and "harmony" will immediately disappear, "turning into solemnity" and "terror." Originally, at the end of the eighteenth century, France was plagued by wars. From January 1793 to July 1794, Paris was trapped in an atmosphere of extreme terror. This Place de la Concorde was the execution ground for killing people at that time. The killing of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette was carried out here. Other royal nobles, as well as later revolutionaries, killed people from time to time, and were killed from time to time. All kinds of tragic scenes were staged on the guillotine here. Thinking of this, the scene of Louis XVI ascending the guillotine seems to reappear in front of me, how terrible!

The cars on the Place de la Concorde come and go like shuttles. It is not easy for pedestrians to cross the road. I detoured in front of the Ministry of the Navy and waited for more than ten minutes before I had the opportunity to reach the entrance of the Champs-Élysées. There are two stone statues at the entrance of the Champs-Élysées, with a prancing horse carved on the top, galloping. A person on the side is holding a rein, showing a very anxious look. The expression is flying and free, and it is indeed a famous work of art. The Champs-Élysées itself can be divided into two parts. One part starts from the Place de la Concorde entrance at the east end and ends at the Rond-Point. This section is about half a mile long and is entirely a park. The avenue passes through the large park. On the side of the street are two rows of very neat plane trees, and next to the trees is a sidewalk. On the side of the sidewalk, there are four rows of trees, trimmed neatly, lush and beautiful. Next to the trees, there are several sections, which are the gardens. Therefore, this section of the Champs-Élysées is in the middle of the trees and gardens. Inside the gardens, there are pavilions, fountains, brilliant flowers, and beautiful ponds. In the afternoon, many tourists stay on the seats in this area. A children's playground is also set up in the garden, with various novel scientific toys to impart knowledge to the children.

### Chengdu's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Xu Eryin

Clothing In Guangdong and Guangxi, we see short outfits everywhere, and it's rare to see anyone wearing a long gown. But in Chengdu, we see long gowns everywhere, and wearing short outfits is rare. It's exactly the opposite. Chengdu also has a tradition of wearing mandarin jackets, and not only middle-aged and elderly people wear them, but young people can't do without them either. One of my classmates used to wear Western suits and hats in Shanghai, but after returning to Chengdu for four years, he now wears light silk robes, black mandarin jackets, and a melon-shaped skullcap. Civil servants naturally wear Zhongshan suits, but because most civil servants are a bit hunchbacked and can never stick their chests out, they still can't muster any spirit when wearing Zhongshan suits. Students, of course, all wear grey sesame cloth student uniforms. Many Sichuan students often go into tea shops, open the buttons on their necks, put their belts on the tea table, and sit like they're not sitting, sleep like they're not sleeping, sprawled in bamboo chairs. This is even more uncouth than the remnants of the long gown and mandarin jacket era.

Women's clothing is the same as everywhere else, from ancient times to Westernization, you can see it all.

On the street, what especially attracts the attention of newcomers are the lamas, in their dark red robes. The clothing of ordinary Hui people is exactly the same as ours, as are their food, housing, and transportation.

Food Speaking of Chengdu's food, it's really hard to put it all in writing. Sichuan cuisine is famous, needless to say, but what makes people even more unforgettable are the many snacks that you can only taste when you get to Chengdu.

On my first night in Chengdu, I was taken by my classmate Yuan to a snack shop called "Wu Wonton." I thought to myself, it must be named after a talented chef named Wu. I heard my classmate order "two servings of wonton," and I realized that wonton is a kind of food. I asked my classmate, and he told me that wonton is called 'chaosho' here. Besides Wu wonton, there's also Dwarf Wonton and Ye Deguai, all of which are clean, but the small storefronts are always crowded. It's well-deservedly famous. A small bowl is enough to make you ask for more. The taste is indescribable. In short, Chengdu's snacks all have several things in common: they're cheap, delicious, and never filling.

The water rice cakes in Lychee Lane are a pity because they have to add a lot of chili. If you can't eat spicy food, the spiciness will drive away the deliciousness.

A serving of steamed dumplings has ten pieces, but it's only equivalent to one or two pieces elsewhere. You can put them all in your mouth without feeling like it's too much. Lai Tangyuan and Twenty-Four Spring, no one can surpass its glutinous rice balls.

In short, Chengdu is a quaint city, and Chengdu has a lot of "decadent snacks" that don't hurt the spleen and stomach. As Mr. Zhou Zuoren said, it's a pity that Mr. Zhou didn't think that there was such a good place outside of Beijing.

Housing Of course, Chengdu also has slums, which are located outside the city and in remote areas.

Inside the city, it's completely different. The Europeanized area is Chunxi Road, with its shops on the commercial field, while the ancient style still remains in Shaocheng, with its residences, large, medium, and small mansions.

Whether a mansion is large, medium, or small, first, the gatehouse must look presentable. Second, there must be a red lantern hanging at the gate. Third, there must be a white-haired gatekeeper sitting between the front gate and the second gate. This gatekeeper may be partially paralyzed, or may be blind, and nine out of ten love to doze off, so people coming in and out will not be stopped every time. It is said that this is only to make the "mansion look like a mansion."

Entering the second gate, you can see one or two withered trees, three or four thin bamboos, five or six pots of chrysanthemums, a wide hall, and a lifeless courtyard.

Chengdu people's housing is probably the same as their transportation, maintaining a full officialdom atmosphere.

Transportation Chengdu people rarely go out. Chengdu is nine and one-third li, and they say they just live their whole lives within these nine and one-third li. Going out of Niushikou is already a big deal. Going to Shanghai is also called studying abroad, and you can get a scholarship from the provincial government. After returning from studying abroad, you don't have to compete for a job, and no one cares what you've learned outside.

But Chengdu people still don't like to move. They can't bear to leave the comfortable, leisurely, and carefree Chengdu.

Chengdu people walking on the street are mostly doing nothing. Maybe they just came out of a tea shop, or maybe they're going to some "De Yi Fang," "Yi He Yuan," or "Bu Ru Ti" to taste tea. They always walk very slowly, so even rickshaws can only go slowly, because the sidewalk and the road, except for cars that have to give way when important people pass by, the center of the road has leisurely strollers.

Chengdu has few cars and many rickshaws, which are also cheap, making it the best in the country. There are horses, mules, buses, sedan chairs, sedan chairs, wooden boats, and charcoal road vehicles. The roads of Shu are not difficult, but the difficulty lies in the lack of modern means of transportation, but it's still okay.

### Plummeting Paper Industry in Hong Kong

The paper industry in Hong Kong has always been stable. Moreover, with the flourishing of the printing industry in China in recent years, the paper industry has also become increasingly developed. Investigations show that annual trade reached a massive sum of over ten million yuan. However, since the start of the Sino-Japanese war, the areas in China where the publishing industry was most prosperous have successively fallen. The railway transportation of Hong Kong's paper industry has been greatly affected. And with the subsequent fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, various places in North and Central China have stopped purchasing from Hong Kong due to difficulties in transportation. Therefore, paper prices have plummeted continuously, and the market has become increasingly bleak. Goods ordered some time ago remain stored in warehouses, unable to be released due to stagnant purchases. Furthermore, Western merchants are urging shipment as the deadline has passed. Consequently, paper merchants are generally at a loss for solutions. Many are losing as much as four or five hundred thousand yuan, or two or three hundred thousand yuan. Comparing the paper industry today with its former state, there is indeed a world of difference. Investigations show that most of Hong Kong's paper goods come from abroad, with Germany and Austria being the most prominent, followed by Italy, and Sweden and Czechoslovakia the least. Japanese goods are now completely absent.

There are countless varieties of paper, making it impossible to list them all. They can be roughly divided into the following categories: (1) newsprint in rolls, (2) flat newsprint, (3) glossy white paper, (4) glossy colored paper, (5) semi-glazed newsprint, (6) Shandu paper, and (7) cardboard, etc. Among these, newsprint in rolls is the most commonly used, with the majority coming from Germany and Austria. Shandu paper is made from the local clay paper in Foshan, Guangdong Province.

The annual sales of Hong Kong paper to Guangdong inland reached more than four million yuan, while Guangxi accounted for seventy to eighty million yuan annually. Since the fall of Guangzhou, sales in the two Guangs (Guangdong and Guangxi) have almost come to a standstill. Currently, the only markets are Shantou, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and overseas markets such as Siam (Thailand) and Annam (Vietnam).

### The Latest Paper Prices Are Listed Below

50-gram newsprint in rolls: 6.4 cents per pound

48-gram newsprint in rolls: 6.8 cents per pound

Flat newsprint (500 sheets per ream): 3 yuan, 4 hao, 5 cents

Glossy white paper (14 pounds per ream): 1 yuan, 7 hao, 5 cents

Inferior glossy white paper (14 pounds per ream): 1 yuan, 7 hao

Glossy colored paper (500 sheets per ream): 2 yuan, 0 hao, 5 cents

Shandu paper (20 pounds per ream): 2 yuan, 4 hao, 5 cents

Shandu paper (22 pounds per ream): 2 yuan, 5 hao, 5 cents

### Japanese Army Eliminates "Youth Shelters," Northeast Agricultural Production Declines Year After Year

The Northeast Volunteer Army often utilizes sorghum and wheat fields as cover for guerrilla warfare, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, causing considerable difficulty for the Japanese army. Therefore, in recent years, they have vigorously restricted the planting of sorghum, advocating instead the planting of soybeans and cotton, under the guise of revitalizing specialty products, while in reality engaging in a war of attrition. However, the Volunteer Army can still hide in soybean fields and cotton fields. Therefore, with each battle, agricultural products are dug up and destroyed in retaliation. Under these circumstances, the harvest of agricultural products in the Northeast has, of course, sharply decreased compared to before the September 18th Incident. In addition, the war is ceaseless in various places, and farmers work intermittently. Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, Northeast youths have been forced to join the army, sent to fight their compatriots, impacting agricultural production, which is naturally even worse. According to a survey by the Yamazaki Economic Research Institute, the average harvest of agricultural products in the Northeast from 1934 to 1936 was already 16.5% lower than the average harvest from 1927 to 1931. This year's estimated agricultural harvest is even lower than the second estimate. A comparative table is as follows:

### Li Hua Cup Football: Preliminary Round, Chinese United vs. Navy; Silver Shield Quarter-Final and Semi-Final Dates Also Decided

[Our Newspaper's Telegram] Yesterday afternoon, the Football Association held its monthly meeting. Attendees included Hua Zhuan (Chairman), Jian Na, Huang Jiajun, Mai Jilufei, Gaodunbo (Secretary), etc.

The Secretary read out the minutes of the last meeting and discussed various important items.

(1) Discussion of the Special Silver Shield Quarter-Final and Semi-Final events. Regarding the competition dates, a draw determined the following: Quarter-finals will be held on February 4th and 5th; semi-finals will be held on February 11th and 12th. The order is as follows:

Group A Quarter-Finals

February 4th: South China South vs. Kowloon Club + Jia Hui Lian Shan

February 5th: Eastern Club vs. South China Hua, Hong Kong Club Ground

Group A Semi-Finals

February 11th: South China South or Kowloon Club vs. Eastern Club or Hua Hua, So Kon Po Ground

February 12th: Police Club vs. St. Joseph's, Navy Stadium

Group B Semi-Finals

February 11th: Western Engineering vs. Midu Xi, Kowloon Tsang Ground

February 12th: Public Works Department vs. Shi Team, Hong Kong Club Ground

(2) Discussion of the Li Hua Cup preliminary round event. Investigations show that the competition for the championship has always been limited to four teams: Chinese United, Western Civil Servants Team, Navy Team, and Army United Team. The competition adopts an elimination system. The dates for this year's preliminary round have been set for the 21st and 22nd of this month. The order of matches, determined by draw, is as follows:

January 21st (Saturday): Western Civil Servants United Team vs. Army United Team, Kowloon Club Ground

January 22nd (Sunday): Chinese United Team vs. Navy United Team, Hong Kong Club Ground

(3) Regarding the Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-Port Competition, a letter has been sent to the Philippines, inviting them to send a team to compete during the Lunar New Year period. However, the originally proposed competition dates may need to be changed in the future. This was brought up for discussion. It was decided that a reply from the Philippines should be received first, to see when their team will arrive in Hong Kong, and then a decision will be made. The originally proposed competition dates are as follows:

February 18th (Saturday, Lunar New Year's Eve): Philippines Inter-Port Team vs. Hong Kong Inter-Port Team, Navy Stadium

February 20th (Monday): Philippines Inter-Port Team vs. Chinese United Team, Navy Stadium

February 21st (Tuesday): Philippines Inter-Port Team vs. Hong Kong All-Star Team, Navy Stadium

(4) Discussion of the International Quarter-Finals. This competition will be between China and England. The winner will then play Portugal in the final. The committee members felt that since the South China football team, which is currently on tour in Saigon, has many Chinese national league representatives, it was decided to hand over the determination of the location and dates to the management sub-committee and the opposing team.

(5) Regarding the item of 2,028 yuan and 7 cents from the Shao Zerong condolence match, the committee members felt that since Mr. Shao died from injuries, leaving behind an elderly mother and younger sister, whose situation is pitiable, it was unanimously agreed to transfer the full amount to Mr. Shao's family.

### Women's Basketball Games Last Night: Hong Kong University and Southwest Both Win

[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch] After all the homes lit up, a battle unfolded in the basketball hall. According to the schedule, three women's basketball games were originally scheduled to be held last night at the Zijing Gymnasium. The first game was Snowflake vs. Hong Kong University, the second game was Southwest vs. St. Paul's, and the last game was Meifang vs. Sixiang. Later, because Sixiang withdrew from the competition, there were only two games.

Knowing that the performance last night would not be very exciting, fans were few, with the exception of cheerleaders and players, there were very few genuine basketball fans.

The first game was relatively tense and interesting, while the second game was not worth mentioning.

At 6:30, the battle began. Hong Kong University had Wenhua on the front line, who was very active, frequently attacking Snowflake's territory. But at this time, all the generals from Snowflake showed effort. Manhong and Qiao's performance was still acceptable. Until the end of the first quarter, Snowflake led by one point, 6 to 5.

In the second quarter, Wenhua's performance was brilliant, and her throws were also very accurate. Moreover, because Zou Defan provided many opportunities for Wenhua, her brilliance was revealed. So, at the end of this quarter, Hong Kong University reversed the situation with a score of 12 to 11, and the situation improved.

In the second half, Snowflake's formation shook, focusing more on defense than offense. On the other hand, Hong Kong University's Wenhua and Defan were very active. After a period of intense competition, 21 to 18, Snowflake was even further behind.

In the final quarter, Snowflake tried desperately to struggle, but could not break the deadlock. Moreover, because everyone was eager to win, their shots were often inaccurate. As a result, they lost 19 to 27.

(Total score: 27)

(Total score: 19)

After the end of the first act, the second game began. After the opening, Ruixin scored first for Southwest, with aggressive momentum, but in a blink of an eye, St. Paul's returned a basket, tying the score. Thereafter, St. Paul's still wanted to work hard, but unfortunately their skills were inferior, and they could only watch Southwest's score continue to increase, while they themselves remained empty-handed. After one quarter, the score was 2 to 16.

At the beginning of the second quarter, Southwest, with victory in hand, did not overextend themselves. They brought out Peizhi, Ruixin, etc., and replaced them with Yuechang and Xianghuan. But even after this personnel change, their strength was still much better than St. Paul's. So, after the end of the first half, St. Paul's still inevitably succumbed to a score of 5 to 20.

Both sides made progress in the second half, but St. Paul's had already lost too much ground in the first half, and it was not easy to equalize. In fact, the opportunities for St. Paul's to score were purely due to the generosity of Southwest's generals. Otherwise, it would probably not have been easy to gain anything. At the end of the quarter, 27 to 10, Southwest was far ahead.

In the final quarter, Southwest played solid defense. On the other hand, St. Paul's had many opportunities to throw the ball, but because Wanlian and Man'e's throws were inaccurate, they didn't score much. After that, Southwest's momentum was even stronger, and they frequently made contributions. Ruixin and Peizhi had the skill of hitting almost every shot. Until the end of the entire game, 33 to 12, Southwest cheered and celebrated their victory. (The person under the basket)

(Total score: 33)

### Yang Shuiyi's Wife Abuse Case: Liang Xiuying's Appeal Succeeds; The Decision on Alimony and Separation is Remanded to the Central Magistracy

Yang Shuiyi, a football star of the South China Athletic Association, was previously sued by his wife, Liang Xiuying, alleging that he had abused her at 15 Schooner Street between November 1937 and June of last year, seeking separation and alimony. The case was dismissed by Magistrate Bi Si of the Central Magistracy. The plaintiff, Liang Xiuying, dissatisfied, hired lawyer Liu Ruilin, who in turn asked lawyer Li Ronggen to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Justices MacKisack and Leong Yip-wing heard the case. After the court opened, the defendant, Yang Shuiyi, did not appear because he had gone to Saigon for a football match. Liu Ruilin's lawyer, Li Gengsheng, testified that he had sent a summons to the defendant and proved that the defendant was aware of this matter. The testimony was accepted.

Barrister Li Spoke on the Appeal

Barrister Li stood up and stated the grounds for the appeal, briefly saying that during the trial of the bill of complaint, it was learned that both parties had married in accordance with Chinese customary rites, which were consistent with the requirements of current Chinese law. This had also been proven by Chinese legal experts, leaving no doubt. Furthermore, the respondent, Yang Shuiyi, also admitted that the appellant was his wife. The judge's reasons for rejecting the request stated that, according to the interpretation of the ordinance, the appellant, Liang Xiuying, was not the respondent's wife. Regarding this point, it is very important for many women in Hong Kong. Because the type of marriage not recognized by the judge as being within the scope of the ordinance is not only practiced by the general Chinese people in Hong Kong, but is also very common in mainland China. The judge seems to have interpreted the 1935 Separation and Maintenance Ordinance as requiring reference to the conditions of 1905. The customary rite above was not practiced in 1905. Therefore, it was also said that it did not exist in 1935. If this is the correct interpretation of the ordinance, I fear that many wives will be deprived of the rights conferred by the ordinance. This seems to forget the original intention of the legislation.

The Meaning of Primary Wife and Concubine is Clear

The legislative intent of the ordinance regarding primary wife and concubine is very clear. I believe that it is merely a matter of rhetorical expression. It refers only to one meaning and does not need to invoke already repealed provisions for mixed interpretation. The ordinance does not limit its application to a specific period, nor does it exclude marriages existing in the year of legislation. In fact, the aforementioned marriage rite is the only rite prescribed by Chinese law. The judge intends to limit the interpretation of the ordinance, basing it on an erroneous assumption, distorting its meaning. This lawyer believes this is indeed wrong. The legislative intent does not limit the interpretation of the word "wife" or "married woman." Furthermore, the ordinance does not stipulate the regulations on marriage, then the relationship of husband and wife exists naturally. The only true test in this case is whether the marriage between the two parties complied with Chinese law and customs. If the answer is yes, then the requirements stipulated in the ordinance have been fully met. After that, Barrister Li said that both parties had married in accordance with the manner prescribed by Chinese law and customs. The judge's decision was erroneous.

Chief Justice's Original Judgment

At this point, Chief Justice MacKisack announced that the appellant's appeal was successful and ordered the respondent, Yang Shuiyi, to bear the costs of the appeal. The decision on alimony and separation was remanded to the Central Magistracy. His judgment briefly stated that since the establishment of the Republic of China, a new style of marriage has been adopted in China. This is recognized by the Chinese Civil Code. In this case, the respondent himself admitted that the appellant was his wife. The judge dismissed the bill of complaint. In his statement on the case, he continued that the two parties had, in fact, married in 1934, and their marital relationship was formed in accordance with the new style of marriage, except that it was not registered with the government. Despite the discovery of these facts, the judge believed that the interpretation of the 1935 Ordinance could not be sought from the Ordinance itself, but must refer to the already repealed 1905 Ordinance. As Barrister Li pointed out, the meaning of the 1935 Ordinance is very clear and unambiguous, and there is no need to cite other evidence. The second question is the matter of not being registered according to law. Although this point was not raised, the reason is quite simple: there is no such registration agency in Hong Kong. However, the judge believed that although there was no such agency, a similar procedure could be carried out at the Marriage Registry of the High Court. This view is obviously wrong, as the two parties could not register. Based on the above, the judge's judgment was legally flawed. According to the last section of his statement on the case, we should now allow the appellant's appeal to succeed. As for the request in this case, it is remanded to the magistracy for decision. The costs of the appeal trial are to be borne by the respondent.

### South China Conquers New Public in Second Football Match

### Training Methods for Track and Field

— Wang Xuecheng

Imbalance in the development of the body, or excessive development of one part of the muscles, are abnormal phenomena. Track and field athletes should be no different from musicians; their various movements must be harmonious with each other. Not only in the body, but also in the movements, one part cannot be focused on while neglecting others. For example, many field event athletes believe that the best method or most wonderful posture when launching a discus or shot put is that the foot used to support the body weight before the throw, i.e., the rear foot, should cross in front of the other foot. The drawback of this erroneous view is that it causes some field event athletes to focus too much on this movement, and they are eager to move their rear foot in front of the other foot, so that both feet jump up at the same time before the discus or shot put leaves their hand, leaving the ground. Thus, the body is suspended in the air, and the body and arm are not supported by the legs. It should be noted that the powerful thrust or throwing ability of the arm must rely on the shoulders and back, as well as the hips and legs. The body must be supported on the ground; otherwise, even with a strong arm, excellent results cannot be achieved.

In throwing the shot put, etc., the action of exchanging the positions of the feet is actually Newton's Third Law of Motion: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." The action of exchanging the positions of the feet is also due to the shift of the body's center of gravity.

Also, such as in high jump and pole vault, many athletes only focus on the body twist and the body extension posture when practicing high jump, and also only focus on the action of pulling the body up when practicing pole vault. They think that this is the key to success. As a result, those high jump athletes neglect the correct and powerful stabbing and jumping action, and sometimes also twist their body too early, thus hindering the jumping action and not being able to jump with full force. Similarly, those pole vault athletes also disregard the running or sprinting, jumping, and body ascending actions, and only focus on the action of hoisting and supporting the body. In fact, if the running, sprinting, jumping, etc. actions are done correctly, it is not difficult to have a correct and wonderful posture on the high jump bar, and the action of pulling the body up can also be correct and powerful. If the body is hoisted up prematurely, it will not only make the body unable to turn properly but will also affect the strength of the abdomen.

The main reason for forming this concept is the photos taken of famous athletes' running, high jumping, and throwing shot put postures. Those photos have actually ruined many promising young athletes. Many think that this is the correct posture, or the key to success. For example, in racing, most photos are taken of the situation when crossing the finish line. It should be noted that when we reach the finish line, we have already spent a lot of energy. The body must be very tired, and we must also exert all our strength to make the final struggle. Therefore, we cannot maintain the correct posture, even the most famous athletes cannot avoid this. Their victory is not in that moment. Most of what we see in the photos is not the key to their success. For example, when a high jump athlete breaks a record, some photographers often ask him to perform the high jump posture again. But the height jumped is far below the height when he broke the record. After the photo is taken, the general public thinks that this is the key to the success of that record-breaking athlete, so they all imitate this posture. It should be noted that not only is the key to the success of that high jump athlete not in that moment, but also his posture when he performs is not exactly the same as his posture when he broke the record. As for low hurdles, high hurdles, long jump, and javelin throwing, when an athlete jumps up or sprints, most photographers like to squat down to photograph his posture. Such photos cannot be used as a reference material, because in such photos, we only see the angle of the body, and what we see is not the original angle of the body when the athlete is high jumping or sprinting. On the one hand, because those photographers often squat down when taking pictures, and on the other hand, the camera is often tilted. (To be continued)

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment…The Corsair of Algfers

Algfers

The story's background is a mysterious and bizarre place, described as being like something out of "Arabian Nights." The place is called Algiers, which is now a territory of France. One part of the city is quite modern, but the other part, inhabited by indigenous people, still completely retains the mysterious colors of ancient East. There, lawlessness reigns, and thieves and desperados gather. The director handles this backdrop to the utmost of eerie and murderous ability, further embroidering it with a moving story. The treacherous and brutal actions of the bandits fill every inch of the photo with a mysterious, terrifying, and intensely stimulating power.

The story narrates how an international jewel thief, fleeing for his life, mixes in this place. Betrayal by his accomplices and encirclement by detectives are all cunningly evaded by him. However, he loses his life because of falling for a beautiful French girl.

Charles Boyer gives a very profound performance of the bandit's character in this film. Hedy Lamarr, the female lead who acted in "Ecstasy", also delivers excellent acting. Xue Li Jiali, in her first film, "The Travels of Marco Polo," left us with an excellent impression when she played Kublai Khan's daughter. In this film, she fully and wholeheartedly embodies a native girl passionately in love with the jewel thief, and her outstanding acting deserves our special praise.

Queen…Wings of the Navy

Men Wfth Wfngs

The entire film narrates the evolution of American aviation over the past thirty to forty years, and can also be said to be a systematic narrative of humanity's conquest of space. At the same time, we must acknowledge that this is one of the greatest and most valuable works in film history.

The story seems to draw on too broad a range of material, resulting in a lengthy plot that feels somewhat lacking in dramatic power. However, various tense and thrilling scenes completely mask this shortcoming. For example, flight accidents, aerial dogfights, life-and-death test flights, and the daring feat of the first transatlantic crossing – these are all extremely stimulating scenes. At the same time, women who are worried and sobbing – these are all capable of manipulating the audience's emotions.

The use of color in this film could not be more appropriate. The various brightly colored airplanes soaring in the blue sky filled with colorful clouds enhance the audience's aesthetic appreciation.

The performances of Fred MacMurray and Ray Milland are both extremely refined. The female lead, Loretta Young, is a rising star who has not received much attention. In this film, we discover that she is a highly promising talent.

Ping An…The Spy Ring

The Soy Ring

A spy film with nothing much to recommend it. The writers and directors failed to adequately develop the spies' activities and dangerous conspiracies, and forcibly inserted polo matches and some humorous scenes, piecing together a disjointed film.

The story narrates how a group of international spies operate in the United States, attempting to steal the blueprints for a newly invented anti-aircraft weapon. However, due to the inventor's courage and cleverness, their cunning plan is thwarted. The acting of each cast member is also very mediocre.

Eastern…Flash Gordon

Flash Gordon

A foreign fantasy film, relying on scientific ideals to create various strange things and inserting a story of heroes and beauties, is of no practical value. It only caters to the appetites of those who harbor curiosity.

Dahua—Blockade

Blockade

This is a film depicting the activities of traitors during wartime, but on the other hand, it exposes the cruelty of war. This is a point that the author particularly emphasizes. The director uses very lively shots to reveal the various vicious methods of bombing and blockades. Henry Fonda and Madeleine Carroll also give decent performances.

Jingxing…Sing Your Sinners

Sing Your Sinners

A musical film interspersed with humor, with plenty of laughs. The horse racing scene is both tense and hilarious. Starring Bing Crosby and Fred MacMurray.

Central…Woman

Mandarin Film

The concept of adapting a silent film from three years ago into a full-fledged talkie is very correct. The screenwriter is entirely appealing for the pain that women have suffered for thousands of years, which people have not understood. Overall, it is not necessarily more advanced than the silent film version, but the dialogue is more lively. The new actress, Lu Ming, and the other actors all give outstanding performances.

New World…Good Daughter Marries Eighteen Times Sequel

Cantonese Film

Starring Yue Er

Beihe…Cantonese Opera

Taiping Men's and Women's Troupe

Day Performance – Blood Stains the Statue of Liberty

Free Talk

### Is "Wheat and Soldiers" Worth Reading?

— Lin Huanping

I read Lou Zuojun's book review of "Wheat and Soldiers" on the 7th in "Constellation" and was quite surprised. On the 8th, in "Free Talk," I read Mr. Lin Youru's book review of "Wheat and Soldiers" and found it to be "a good work." Mr. Lin said:

"Japanese fascist literary 'critics' such as Xianye Akira have pointed out the failure of Japanese 'war literature' in recent years, saying, 'Works that were considered remarkable in the Japanese literary world were translated and published in Chinese newspapers and magazines, and when Chinese people read them, they were simply good materials for anti-Japanese and insulting-Japan [sentiments].' Indeed, we also feel this way after reading "Wheat and Soldiers," which is still very popular in Japan. (!) It is not only good material for 'anti-Japanese' and 'insulting-Japan' sentiments, but also does a good job of publicizing our war of resistance!"

Lou Zuojun first said:

"...But what is worth mentioning is that there are two more noteworthy works. One is Ishikawa Tatsuzo's "Living Soldiers," and the other is "Wheat and Soldiers," which is the subject of this article."

Then said:

"However, this book still has a certain value, because it objectively records the difficulties of combat, the encounters during the journey, the bravery of the Chinese, and the fragility of the Japanese army, within a certain range. And because of this objective narrative, we can at least have a further understanding of the sacred war of resistance for the survival of the Chinese people."

The views of the two people, the tone of the two people, are exactly the same. I dare not compliment such opinions.

It is true that "Wheat and Soldiers" is "still very popular in Japan." No, it is simply the most popular novel with the theme of the Sino-Japanese War. Perhaps our "translators" were blinded by this fact, and at the same time, they saw a few places in the book that "objectively recorded the events of the war within a certain range," and forgot the comparative level of the value of the good and bad aspects.

"Wheat and Soldiers" is under the absolute control of speech by the Japanese warlords. Why is it so popular? I wonder if anyone believes it. Is it because it exposes "the bravery of the Chinese soldiers and the fragility of the Japanese"? I wonder if anyone believes it. Is it because it "did a good job of publicizing our war of resistance"? I myself do not believe it. Mr. Lin Youru said:

"The author, Hino Ashihei, is considered a typical figure in the 'Imperial Army.'"

Lou Zuojun also said:

"Hino Ashihei is a typical patriotic figure, the crystallization of decades of military-national education. He is unclear about the purpose of participating in the war, and also believes that war is an inevitable fact."

Hino Ashihei also confessed in "Author's Words":

"In this grand war concept, everything unknowingly becomes blind."

Can such a person write a work that "does a good job of publicizing our war of resistance"?

Colonel Sato, the director of the Army Ministry's Intelligence Department, criticized this work, saying:

"...Generally speaking, the misery and sorrow of war make the author's emotions run high and his rationality blind. His writing tends to become an anti-war narrative; but the author of "Wheat and Soldiers" is not like that. When emotions run high, he can still revive his rational power of reflection... Transcending life and death, he directly analyzes the sense of responsibility and obligation for victory in war, which is expressed in his simple work. This is one of its characteristics. Another characteristic is the skillful depiction of the vast and boundless wheat field as the background, which can skillfully reconcile the sense of reality of the terrain with the warriors fighting in the summer battlefields, and comprehensively unfold the appearance of the front line battlefield to the rear nationals who do not know the real scene of the battlefield."

The Japanese military is making its best efforts to publicize this work and make it a tool for national spiritual mobilization. Its popularity is mainly due to this, but our "book critics" call it "doing a good job of publicizing our war of resistance" and praise it as being on par with "Living Soldiers"! What can I say?

### The Distance Between Two Eras

— Mengqi

Last night, I received the news of my father's death. At that time, I was stunned for a long time, and I felt as if my nerves were paralyzed from top to toe. I couldn't tell whether it was grief or bitterness!

Speaking of my father's death, it was my fault. In my understanding, it was not "sudden." When I was running around in the Shaanxi and Sichuan roads, I learned the news of my father's illness. At that time, I really felt "a mixture of joy and fear." What I was happy about was that father was finally safe in the human world. What I was afraid of was that my father had always been strong, and even if he felt a little uncomfortable, he would often force himself to endure it and would not admit to being sick. Now that he was willing to send the news of his illness, it showed that the situation was serious. So, on the one hand, I hurried on the road, and on the other hand, I sent a long letter home to inquire about the situation in detail. By the time I had exhausted myself to reach Chengdu, the reply from home had been waiting for a long time at the friend's place where the letter was being forwarded. As soon as I opened it, I knew that the situation was not good, because I could tell at a glance that it was not my father's handwriting. My father was the most prolific writer. No matter where I went, as long as the contact address was determined, he would never fail to send a letter a week, and each letter was always detailed and meticulous, and his instructions to me were particularly thorough and sincere. I remember deeply that when I was in Guizhou, because I wrote the letter a little too briefly, I was severely scolded by my father, who said not to write telegraphic letters. In the end, I was moved by my father's diligent writing, and I did not dare to be too lazy in writing letters home. My father, the happier he was, the more letters he sent. The frequency and length of his letters almost became a measure of his physical and mental health. Now that we are so far apart and have been separated for so long, he asked someone to write a letter for him, so I shuddered to know how serious my father's illness was.

After arriving in Chongqing, from the intermittent letters from relatives and friends and the person who wrote the letter for him, I learned that my father had been ill in bed for two months. At first, he was too worried about us who were away from home, which led to disordered eating, which eventually became chronic heart weakness. My father was originally in the countryside of ××. He asked the local doctor to diagnose and treat him, but it was of no avail. Later, my mother saw that the illness was not right and tried her best. Moved into the city. When Chinese and Western doctors were consulted, they had already expressed that they were helpless, so he lingered on, tossing and turning, and dragging on for more than four months!

I still don't know what kind of disease my father was suffering from. I saw in one letter that my father was delirious for a few days and wanted to find me. When someone stopped him, he wanted to hit them. Because of my unfilial conduct, my father was so worried that he became mentally disordered. How could this not make me feel bone-piercing pain?

### Moving Mountains and Filling the Sea

— Fei Zhi

There is an ancient Chinese story that is as famous as "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains." Needless to say, that is "Jingwei Fills the Sea." Literati often cite this story, just like they cite "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," to encourage people to persevere and to talk about the principle of "where there's a will, there's a way."

In fact, these two stories are somewhat different after all. The purpose of the Foolish Old Man is to move the mountain in front of his door, relying on the continuous manpower, "When I die, I will have a son, and the son will have a grandson, and the grandson will have a son, and the manpower will not increase, so why worry that the mountain will not be leveled?" Indeed, it is possible to use unlimited manpower to move a limited mountain, and it is necessary to persist for a long time.

Filling the sea is different. Dutch engineers have also failed at times, which shows that it is a very difficult task. Even if a small island by the sea moves "the wood and stones of the Western Mountain" into the sea day and night, the fluctuating seawater will always move its "wood and stones" elsewhere. What it wants to fill is the "East Sea," but the "wood and stones" may not have been put into the "East Sea" at all. No matter how hard you work, it is still a waste of effort. Persistence is also useless.

Therefore, "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" and "Jingwei Fills the Sea," although both are equally persevering, the former is doing what is known to be possible, while the latter is doing what is known to be impossible. There is also a certain limit to the truth of "where there's a will, there's a way." Do we have to snatch the moon from the sky? If we have the will and the forgetfulness, then can we "succeed"?

Of course, doing what is known to be impossible is the spirit of the great sages, which is worth promoting and respecting. However, this spirit is the great sages' determination to save the world, so it is worth respecting. If we use this spirit in another place, our evaluation of him will be different.

For example, negotiating "peace" with ×, colluding with × people, selling out national interests, and selling out national history, this is what the 450 million Chinese people who are fighting will oppose to the death. Whoever does this will be beaten and killed by the Chinese people. If a person just wants to do this and feels that it is impossible, and therefore stops, he is still a good man. On the contrary, if he does what he knows to be impossible for the sake of personal "sweetness," he will immediately be severely judged by the public and will have nowhere to escape!

### Night Crossing

— Xin Ding

The warm air of the day has disappeared, replaced by a cold sea breeze. The wanderer in thin clothes, filled with the fatigue of a day's work, as usual, stepped onto the huge ferry, bidding farewell to the brightly lit island of the South, and sailing towards the misty opposite shore in the night.

The narrow three-cabin ferry is like an iron cage selling pigs and dogs. People are crowded together, dark and black. Vendors selling marinated food, oranges, and crispy peanuts are flowing like shuttles through the crowd, shouting loudly. The doctor selling Jianghu medicine is touting his unique "effective for all diseases" medicine. This symphony of all aspects of society is playing. Playing, it disturbed the wanderer's heart who wanted to get a moment of peace, and interrupted the loner's meditation from time to time.

The cold sea breeze, in a harsh and尖酸manner, drilled into the gaps of the single clothes, and the only thing that answered it was the sound of the ship's side hitting the waves.

Looking at the island in the distance, the rows of lights and electric tubes emit brilliant light in the coastal buildings; however, hidden in this light are the charming smiles that are sold as commodities, and the decadence and decay of the soul that has been drained from the body; there are the blood and sweat that have been shed for the development of the barren island, and the hidden shouts of resistance to exploitation and pressure. Oh, isn't the line of street lights crossing the mountain top the torch of the anti-× demonstration parade? This torch will never be extinguished, and will forever illuminate the 450 million people, fighting for justice and freedom all the way to victory.

On the ferry, carrying hundreds of passengers who were eager to return home, even though they were also burdened with heavy fatigue, or worried about the food for their family of several people tomorrow, the expressions on their faces were all uniformly facing their destination. And I—this single guest who wandered from the war zone to the island, I don't know if there are any friends who have a light relationship with me tonight, who are willing to keep me for one night?

Tomorrow... I thought of tomorrow in the darkness. Tomorrow is bright. Tomorrow there is the roar of our thousands of brothers. Tomorrow we will see the demons running away at our feet! I will entrust all my hope to tomorrow. However, the night crossing released a calm, loud and bright whistle in the dark bay. It ruthlessly broke my reverie and forced me to face the serious reality... Go back to your motherland tomorrow, don't be foolish here!

The bright light on the island gradually faded away in the turbulent waves. Those sailing ships that are preparing to go out to sea to fish tomorrow are hanging a flashing light on the mast!

### Raising Funds by Gambling

— Yan Lianyi

A certain film company was charged for gambling. When the defendant Zhao was interrogated yesterday, he confessed: "This gathering of people to play was at the request of a certain comfort group, in order to raise funds to relieve refugees." Whether the confession is true or not is not discussed for the time being. However, raising funds by gambling is not a good topic after all. These four words are really a bit absurd when they are put together!

Of course, gambling is illegal, while raising funds is a good deed. Therefore, the two things are absolutely contradictory. Whether it is permitted by law to gamble for the purpose of raising funds is another question. However, we can learn from the inspiration of this incident that many people are making a fortune under the name of "raising funds."

Those who are good at Ge Li often skillfully seize the rare opportunity to grab a moving name and make a fortune. In the process of this war of resistance, many cold-blooded animals that make a fortune from the national crisis have been produced, and now, some people are making a fortune from refugees.

Really, if "raising funds" can be achieved by "gambling," there will be newer tricks that will be staged one after another, that's for sure. For example, raising funds by selling drugs, raising funds by robbery... wouldn't that also be legal?

But then again, we should support those who enthusiastically respond to the movement. However, I hope that everyone should raise funds for the sake of raising funds, not for the sake of making a fortune! At the same time, especially do not use unscrupulous means to respond to the fundraising.

### Serving the Era and the Environment

— Chen Shihhuai

Reality is complex and multifaceted, and it is also harsh and ruthless.

Indeed, the war has awakened and inspired the creative power of many literary and artistic workers. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, weren't there many writers who held a front-lineist view, wishing they could replace their pens with guns? It is true that they were a bit impetuous. However, there is such a rare phenomenon in our literary world, which can be regarded as a great continuation. For this war of national liberation, we are participating as a practitioner—not an observer. We grew up in this great era, and we have also witnessed those heroic historical events that make people cry and inspire people. Our encounters can be said to be the Asian luck. The question of "why great works cannot be produced" that was raging in the past can always be resolved now, I think. What is placed in front of writers is not a pile of bloody epics that are the most glorious and moving in the history of human struggle? I dare say that today's China should be an era that produces great works like the Soviet Union's "The Iron Flood" and "The Rout."

Gorky said: "As a writer who is a person of a certain environment and era, no matter what his intentions and conditions are, he must serve his era and environment." That's right, our writers should use their pens to "mobilize the people to defend the motherland." How courageous the anti-Japanese soldiers are, and how vile the invaders are, can all be depicted by our talented pens. The question is how to avoid the "formulaic," "vulgar," "slogan-like," and "propagandistic" aspects that are criticized by people. As long as you remember the saying "literature is the most jealous ugly woman," you can understand that those who engage in literary work with a mercenary heart or even a fluke heart will eventually decline. Therefore, the call for "realistic anti-Japanese war literature" does not seem meaningless. We explain it this way: "The subjective and objective aspects of realism are unified. The writer's worldview and creative method are inseparable." Many of our writers with a sense of justice, whether in the front line or the rear, are using realistic creative methods. We continue to receive many reports from writers who have witnessed the front line. Regardless of their form, whether they are short communications, folk songs, or ditties, as long as those are artistic and figurative works, we can consider them to be "realistic anti-Japanese war literature."
