### The Trend of Soviet Foreign Policy

The Soviet Union is the only country in the world practicing socialism; the people of the entire federation are striving to realize a classless and exploitation-free ideal society, an unprecedented attempt in human history; therefore, not only do the rulers of the old world regard it as a scourge, but even those who once held the grand aspiration of liberating mankind are shocked and horrified. However, the achievements of the Soviet Russian revolution over the past two decades have been quite unexpected. Their efforts have not only rescued the Russian people from the prison of Tsarist autocracy, poverty, and cruelty, but have also gone on to build a new country of independence, freedom, and happiness. Since the completion of the first and second five-year plans, internally, they have gradually eliminated the class system of "man oppressing man" and "man exploiting man," realizing the ideal life of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." Externally, they have abandoned the special rights of the Tsarist autocratic era to oppress small and weak nations, established a policy of sympathy and assistance to the world's small and weak nations and the oppressed masses in their struggle for liberation, strived for the practice of peaceful diplomacy, and maintained normal diplomatic relations with capitalist countries in order to ensure the smooth completion of socialist construction. Therefore, the scourge of the past has become a brand-new country, and what was once regarded as a mere fantasy has become the ideal heaven for righteous people. Since Hitler came to power and the fascists recklessly took risks, launching a new imperialist war, this socialist construction homeland of the Soviet Union has been regarded as the main force in maintaining world peace and the democratic system. Its prestige in the world is increasing day by day, its status is becoming more and more important, and it is even holding the power to decide the world's peace or war.

However, since the Munich Conference last year, the peace-loving and democratic countries such as Britain and France, under the insane intimidation of the fascist aggressors, have made unforgivable concessions, the strength of the peace and democracy front has been greatly weakened, and the actual effectiveness of the Franco-Czech Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty, which supported European peace and France's position in Europe, has become almost worthless. The clamor of "promoting the formation of a four-power group to advance anti-Soviet and anti-communist" has become more and more rampant. At that time, the deterioration of the Soviet Union's diplomatic environment can be imagined. The fascist aggressors even more unscrupulously used their consistent trick of spreading rumors and slanders in order to shake the prestige of the Soviet Union among peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world, such as the "chaos" of the internal purge of the party and the army in the Soviet Union, the "change" in the Soviet Union's foreign policy, the "improvement in relations between Germany and the Soviet Union," and the Soviet Union's "disregard for Czechoslovakia and Spain." There were countless shameless rumors. However, the Soviet government and people were able to persist in their peaceful foreign policy in this turbulent international situation, adhere to their policy of sympathy and assistance to small and weak nations, expose the fascist aggressors' conspiracy to create a great war and endanger peace and democracy, expose the truth that the foreign policies pursued by capitalist countries are based on violence, aggression, hypocrisy, cowardice, and fantasy, and repeatedly take various appropriate measures to strive to maintain world peace and national independence. In the Far East, the Zhanggufeng Incident taught the Japanese aggressors a painful lesson with a fearless counterattack, not only exposing the ugly face of the Japanese aggressors' "anti-communist" smokescreen, but even forcing the Japanese warlords to deploy heavy troops along the thousands of miles of the Japanese "Manchurian" Soviet border, indirectly achieving the purpose of containing and weakening the Japanese forces invading China. In Europe, the Soviet Union's policy of aiding the Spanish People's Republic remained unchanged from beginning to end, becoming more and more vigorous, and when the Czech incident occurred, it was the first to declare its determination to abide by the Soviet-Czech treaty and aid Czechoslovakia in wartime. However, the former was virtually impossible because Britain and France yielded to the "non-interference policy" of the Italian and German aggressors, making Soviet aid to Spain virtually impossible; and the latter was even more due to the rapid implementation of the British and French compromise policy of dividing Czechoslovakia to satisfy Germany's demands, so that the Soviet Union could not implement its military aid to Czechoslovakia, and Czechoslovakia was already dead in name! If we insist on saying that "this is the fault of the Soviet Union," wouldn't that be unfair and untrue?

Now, the fascist aggressors such as Germany, Italy, and Japan have gained unexpected encouragement and assistance under the implementation of the compromise foreign policies of the bourgeois countries based on hypocrisy, cowardice, and fantasy. The strength of the peace-loving and democratic countries has been greatly weakened. In Europe, small countries such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia have successively turned into "sharp blades in the hands of the aggressor countries," and various parts of Asia have long been trampled on by the iron hooves of the Japanese aggressors, bombarded by artillery fire, and washed in blood. The countries of the Americas have also fallen under the cloud of the poisonous flames of German, Italian, and Japanese aggression. People all over the world who love peace, freedom, and justice should know who is the enemy and who is the friend. Recently, the US government has actively adopted anti-fascist and anti-aggression policies, and actively called on peace-loving and democratic countries to unite to stop aggression. Although this cannot be confused with the aggressors' slander that "the United States has formed a branch of the Communist International," there is no doubt that the Soviet Union's foreign policy of defending peace and national independence has won the trust and support of hundreds of millions of people. After Roosevelt issued a statement vowing to aid democratic countries in resisting aggressive forces, the Soviet Union immediately responded by severing diplomatic relations with Hungary and striking at Germany and Italy. This can not only show the close relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and the increasing consolidation of the democratic peace front, but also prove the smooth and beneficial trend of the Soviet government's foreign policy. The great stimulus and influence this has had on the vast peace-loving and just people in the two major democratic countries of Britain and France should be expected. How they will push their respective national governments to abandon the compromise policies of hypocrisy, cowardice, and fantasy in order to stop aggressive wars and defend peace and democracy is what we should expect at present. The important position of the Soviet Union's current foreign policy in determining the world's peace or war is becoming increasingly clear. We must do our best to support the government's national policy of "uniting with peace-loving and democratic countries" and remotely wish the Soviet Union's foreign policy a smooth development.

### On the Guangdong Provincial Guerrilla Commander Conference

— Liang Yi

The Guangdong Provincial Guerrilla Commander Conference will be held in the first ten days of this month under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone and Chairman Li Hanhun. As the national war of resistance is about to enter the second stage, the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare needs to be developed more widely, and as the [Japanese] are preparing to launch a war to continue to penetrate our great southwest and northwest base areas, and the situation in western Guangdong is becoming tense again, the convening of this conference has very important significance. In particular, we believe that since the outbreak of the guerrilla war in Guangdong, there have been considerable achievements in the launch of guerrilla warfare. However, there are still many weaknesses in the consolidation and expansion of the guerrilla forces and the development of guerrilla warfare at present. This conference will review the achievements of the various guerrilla teams in the past and plan for the adjustment and development of the guerrilla teams in the future. Undoubtedly, it is extremely urgent. This precisely demonstrates the determination of our anti-Japanese authorities to persist in the war of resistance and persist in the guerrilla war in Guangdong, and gives a practical response to the conspiracy of the [Japanese] and Wang [Jingwei] to induce surrender, and the new military offensive of the [Japanese]. At the same time, we believe that under the correct call of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to launch guerrilla warfare extensively, the wise leadership of Generals Zhang and Li, and the efforts of the guerrilla commanders in various districts, this conference will gloriously complete its mission.

According to reports, the main contents of the Guangdong Provincial Guerrilla Commander Conference are six items: (1) the new organization of the guerrilla forces, (2) the division and organization of guerrilla areas, (3) the adjustment of middle-level command institutions and personnel, (4) weapons, ammunition, military pay, and supplies, (5) the joint combat plan of the teams in various districts, and (6) the rewards and punishments for the combat of the officers and soldiers of the teams. From these items, the content is quite rich. Now, I would like to contribute my humble opinions to the Guangdong Provincial Guerrilla Commander Conference.

In the past, the work of the Guangdong guerrilla teams, especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in Guangdong, has been fruitful, mainly manifested in: (1) Under the painstaking efforts of the authorities, the organization of self-defense regiments has been generally established, and the broad masses have increasingly actively participated in the guerrilla forces. The old green forest troops have also been reorganized, making the organization of the guerrilla forces increasingly consolidated and stronger. (2) Some of the troops have established company-level political work, and the team's combat consciousness has gradually increased, and discipline has become increasingly consolidated. (3) In some battles, many teams showed bravery and determination in combat, giving the [Japanese] considerable blows, recovering some lost ground, and raising the people's confidence and determination to defend their homes. (4) The leadership of the teams has gradually become unified and strengthened. However, these advances are extremely insufficient, and there are still many serious weaknesses: First, the organization is not consolidated and not sound: Many teams at all levels are formed by compulsory decrees, or even temporarily hired with money, resulting in the number of people and guns often not matching the reality, and the quality of the team members is very poor; the organization is complex, overlapping, and not unified; the organization is not democratic; there is a lack of systematic and correct policies for the green forest troops, the people's armed organizations have not been mobilized, and the government has not given strong assistance and leadership to the spontaneous people's armed organizations; there is a lack of daily military and political training. Second, the political work is not in-depth, the discipline of the troops is poor, the beating and scolding system still exists in the troops, the phenomenon of desertion occurs from time to time, and the relationship between the guerrilla forces and the people is still very poor. Third, the military training still stays at the level of formal drills, and the education on the theory of guerrilla warfare and actual combat experience is extremely lacking. Fourth, the ammunition replenishment and supplies are insufficient. Fifth, party prejudices in the teams are still quite serious. In some places, there are even heartbreaking phenomena of swallowing up dissidents to expand private power. Sixth, the command and leadership are not unified, not concentrated, and not flexible. Seventh, in the combat of teams at all levels, the correct strategies and tactics have not been universally applied, especially the spontaneous people's armed forces. When the [Japanese] come, they still copy the tactics of defending against bandits and building hard camps to fight to the death, suffering unnecessary sacrifices. I believe that the wise military authorities have a clear understanding of these weaknesses. At the same time, we hope that this conference will have appropriate guidelines and specific measures to correct these shortcomings. However, this conference only focuses on the military scope, without improving the team's political work and the political improvement of the guerrilla war zone. The adjustment of the command mechanism is mainly limited to the middle level, without involving the lower level, and does not pay attention to the thorough improvement of the quality of the team. We believe that this is a major shortcoming. Our opinion on the current improvement of the guerrilla team work is: First, thoroughly reorganize the team's organization: (1) Re-examine the real number of people and guns in each unit, and assess their actual work performance. (2) Eliminate corrupt elements who have bad discipline and waver in the War of Resistance. After political mobilization, absorb new positive elements of national salvation to participate and improve the composition and quality of the troops. (3) All spontaneous people's armed organizations should be filed with the authorities, and the government should strengthen their training and leadership. (4) Strictly prohibit the employment system in the team, and rely on political mobilization among the masses to expand the team. (5) For unsound teams, appropriate adjustments should be made, and active elements with prestige and ability should be selected from the masses to be responsible. (6) Establish guerrilla forces separated from production and reserve forces of an obligatory nature according to actual needs. (7) The command posts at all levels should be elected by the people as much as possible, and then submitted to the superior for commission. (8) Send political workers to strengthen the political work of the green forest troops, change their quality, and promptly eliminate bandit and traitor forces that have been proven to have insisted on reactionary actions and attached themselves to the enemy. (9) Organize the able-bodied men and women, old and young, without firearms in the form of village self-defense associations, and equip them with primitive weapons such as knives, spears, and wooden sticks. (10) Unify the organization of local teams in the province. The original teams (such as volunteer police, social training teams, etc.) should be merged as much as possible. Those that cannot be merged should: (A) Separate powers and responsibilities. (B) Avoid overlapping organizations and competing with each other. (C) Unify training, command, and combat plans. (11) The organization of the guerrilla team, (A), is not limited to a certain form, but is based on local conditions (terrain, weapons, etc.) with the principle of flexible action, suitable for promoting firepower and terrain utilization. (B) Guangdong has many people, guns, and mountains, and the organization of the guerrilla team may be larger. However, operations in the plains can be treated differently. (12) Establish the daily work of the team: (1) Regularly conduct inspections, sentry duties, and check road passes. (2) Build necessary defensive works. (3) Establish a Clear Traitor Work Department to detect and eliminate all traitor activities. (4) Help farmers with spring plowing and autumn harvest. (5) Educate the people and organize the people.

Second, step up the team's training: establish a political system for the team and improve the team's management: (1) Regardless of whether they are regular or reserve, there must be regular training, and the military authorities should formulate a uniform training outline for the purpose of unification. (2) Generally establish company-level political work, set up a fixed political instructor in each company, train and promote a large number of national salvation youths to be responsible for political training work, and strengthen the organization and leadership of the party and government offices. (3) Change the content of military training, and pay more attention to mountain climbing, shooting, and guerrilla warfare exercises. (4) Change the training methods, focus on enlightening and organized training, and improve the enthusiasm of the team members. (5) Establish a cultural and entertainment life for the team members, organize Sun Yat-sen rooms and national salvation rooms, and improve their cultural and political level. (6) The team members shall establish a life committee and a food committee to implement economic openness. (7) Improve the relationship between commanders and combatants, abolish the beating and scolding system, and cultivate the habit of consciously enforcing discipline. (8) Improve the treatment of soldiers, stipulate regulations for rewards and punishments, give preferential treatment to the families of the team members, and appropriately help them solve the difficulties in life.

Third, step up the training of a large number of guerrilla military and political cadres to send them to the front lines and to work behind the enemy: (1) Establish province-wide large-scale and district guerrilla cadre training classes. (2) A part of the cadres under training should be selected from the existing teams, and at the same time, call on outstanding national salvation youths to apply. (3) The selection, appointment, and promotion of cadres should be based on talentism. (4) Re-adjust and equip the cadres of each team. (5) Establish a cadre training team (short-term).

Fourth, strengthen the liaison of each team and unify the leadership of the province-wide team: re-divide the guerrilla war zone. (1) Carry out in-depth propaganda work in the team to eliminate their concept of guarding and seeking self-preservation, and strictly prevent the phenomenon of eliminating dissidents to expand their own strength. (2) Establish regular contact in work and organization among various units, and integrate the emotions of each team. (3) Establish the highest people's armed command institution in the province, so as to unify the number, unify the command, unify the training, and unify the supplies. (4) Re-formulate the division of guerrilla military districts, expand the scope of the districts, and appropriately divide the province into three or four guerrilla military districts. The military district is divided into several sub-districts, and each sub-district is equipped with a county command, and the county command is then equipped with several detachments according to local conditions. (5) The guerrilla military district should establish several independent regiments and battalions as the basic troops, and the sub-district and county commands should establish several independent battalions and companies as the basic teams. (6) The division of guerrilla military districts should be as consistent as possible with the administrative division, so that the military and political leadership will become more unified.

Fifth, appropriately solve the team's ammunition and food difficulties: (1) The government should supply each team with sufficient ammunition and weapons as much as possible. (2) Through political mobilization, collect civilian guns from various villages and supply them to the local self-defense regiments for use. (3) Collect and train a large number of skilled workers in repairing and manufacturing machinery and making uniforms, and establish small military factories, ammunition factories, and military uniform factories in appropriate locations in each district to speed up automatic life and seek self-sufficiency. (4) Strictly prohibit raising military pay by opening gambling and collecting protection fees, and change the methods of collecting surcharges and equally apportioning expenses, and adopt reasonable burden-sharing methods: (A) Collect patriotic public food and raise donations through propaganda and mobilization work; (B) In accordance with the principle of "those who have money pay money," set up services and urge wealthy families to donate more war funds; (C) Transfer all unnecessary expenses in rural areas (such as ancestral savings) to guerrilla warfare expenses; (D) Strengthen the propaganda work for overseas Chinese, and call on overseas Chinese to donate war funds to defend their homeland.

Sixth, establish guerrilla base areas and temporary resting places: (1) Establish one to two guerrilla base areas in each guerrilla military district, and one to two support points and guerrilla resting places for each guerrilla sub-district. (2) The following preparations should be made immediately in the selected base areas: (A) Send a work team to awaken the foundation of local mass work and extensively mobilize the local masses to participate in the war; (B) Establish small-scale military light industry: (C) Establish military and political education institutions; (D) Guide the masses to increase production and store grain.

Seventh, strengthen the guerrilla work on the front line and behind the enemy: (1) Transfer elite troops to important areas close to the front line, and fully replenish their ammunition and supplies. (2) Quickly send political workers to the front-line areas to call on the people to immediately mobilize and arm themselves to participate in the war of resistance. (3) Send outstanding guerrilla cadres and some of the teams to the rear of the [Japanese] to lead the people to launch guerrilla warfare. (4) For the people's armed forces such as the people's regiments and home protection regiments behind the enemy, we should try our best to win them over to the anti-Japanese camp. (5) Strengthen the education of the troops on the front line and behind the enemy on the work of disintegrating the [Japanese] and puppet troops.

Eighth, implement a large number of democratic systems in the guerrilla war zone to ensure the extensive development of guerrilla warfare, mainly such as (1) Elect the leading organs of governments at all levels as much as possible, and then commission them by the higher authorities, eliminate corrupt and incompetent elements from the government, absorb active elements in the War of Resistance, change the working methods of the government, promote a hard life, and use more political mobilization methods to realize government decrees. (2) Establish people's representative organs at all levels and give the people freedom of speech, assembly, and association in the War of Resistance. (3) Organize the masses and mobilize the masses in large quantities.

We earnestly hope that this conference will have correct, thorough, and needed decisions, and we hope that after this conference, the province-wide guerrilla teams will have great improvements, and the province-wide guerrilla warfare will have amazing developments. At the same time, we hope that the province-wide masses, especially all the armed forces, will enthusiastically care about and support this conference, quickly launch a heated discussion, and reflect more valuable opinions to the wise authorities, so that the [Japanese]'s new offensive plan against Guangdong will be completely shattered under our tenacious resistance, and let us everywhere grow new forces to drive the [Japanese] from our territory into the waves of the South China Sea!

### 行腳 to Yan'an

— Shui Bai

——Translated from the January issue of "Asia Magazine"——

Tens of thousands of people have already gone to the "new holy land" in the northwest corner of China. Among them are groups of two or three, twenty or thirty, and even hundreds of people, a pair of confidants, or those who happen to meet because of the same destination. From different provinces, near and far, there are men and women, middle-aged men, middle-aged women, actors, painters, scholars, soldiers, philosophers, journalists, missionaries, church members, doctors, and engineers. Some of them travel by car, some on foot, by ox cart, or by donkey, by large car, truck, or small car, or by airplane. This is the most peculiar "pilgrimage" of modern times. Their destination is Yan'an, the administrative capital of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government. They go there because they want to explore the truth of saving China.

It is only two hundred miles from Xi'an to Yan'an, but our departure was delayed for ten days due to continuous rain, and the journey took five days, and the flooded rivers delayed a lot of time. Along the way, we encountered countless "pilgrimage" groups, with all kinds of clothing, even those who were not wearing clothes, because the atmosphere was very hot at that time. But no matter how different, the Shaanxi hat is uniform. This is a very famous hat in Shaanxi, versatile, convenient, and good at adapting to the environment. It is made of grass. The top can be removed or added; it can be worn on top of other hats, or underneath other hats; it can be as small as a toy hat, or as large as an umbrella. It can be used for sleeping, writing, sitting, and even holding water and as a baby's cradle. This is a treasure of Shanxi. Another thing that female comrades like to wear is leggings, often sky blue, matched with a yellow top, which is very beautiful. Men wear shorts, and because it is hot, they all wear the tails of their shirts outside their pants.

This two-hundred-mile journey made everyone reduce their luggage to the extreme. I saw a group of people with only a toothbrush each, in addition to the clothes on their bodies. They sang loudly all the way. People who went to Yan'an forgot the troubles of the world and accepted all the hardships with great joy.

Taking a freight car suffers from bumps, but it has already been regarded as a "wealthy" trip by others. There are countless problems along the way. The wheels are stuck in the mud, the bridges are broken, overturned, sick, cold, and have a cold. But all kinds of difficulties and obstacles are overcome by the hope of moving forward. We are always in a happy state of mind.

The stories along the way are even more interesting, and each person's own history is also remarkable. Here is a girl who came out of Sichuan, passed through forests, grasslands, and bandit dens, and trekked nearly a thousand miles to Yan'an. When she arrived, there was not a penny in her pocket. But she proudly said that she had a ten-yuan note hidden in her shoe. Unexpectedly, when she unfolded it, she found that the handwriting on the note had become blurred and inseparable from the shoe. It took several hours to separate it, but as a result, it was inspected and found to be a ticket that was indiscriminately issued during the Sichuan warlord era, which was not worth anything!

The cartoonist Hu Kao left Hankou four months ago to go to Yan'an. Unfortunately, when he arrived in Zhengzhou, it was during the Battle of the Longhai Railway, so he turned to Xuzhou. Xuzhou was besieged, and he disguised himself as a farmer to slip out of the encirclement, escaped from the artillery fire several times, and was rescued by the local guerrillas before safely arriving in Shanghai. Then from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and now he is going to Yan'an again.

The movie star Lan Ping is also one of those who went to Yan'an, accompanied by her mother.

In our ranks, there is also a standard Chinese classical painter of flowers and birds. He is in his forties, thin and nearsighted, with a humble and ancient gentleman's demeanor. He did not flee to Sichuan and Yunnan to be a recluse like others, but actually came to this war-torn northwest. Later, when I visited the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, I also met him. Wow, good fellow, he was actually fully armed. But he still had that dashing appearance, lying on a straw mat reading "Guerrilla Warfare Strategy", always maintaining his scholarly style.

In our team, there are also many other students, artists, actors, and journalists. Their common belief is to find a free and broad place to develop their talents and abilities and contribute to the motherland.

After leaving Xi'an, we have been running with the Northwest Battlefield Service Corps. When they stop along the way, they put on plays for the people. The leader is the famous female writer Ding Ling. She escaped from Nanjing to the Soviet area in 1936. After the July 7th Incident, she organized the Battlefield Service Corps, which included more than thirty young men and women, writers, actors, musicians, and artists, who worked in Shanxi and Shaanxi and traveled hundreds of miles, reaching more than 300,000 audiences. The plays are usually performed in the form of old Chinese dramas. We saw a clown in a play playing a patient, and his brother came to take his pulse, deliberately exaggerating the appearance of panic. "You have a kind of women's disease!" What kind of women's disease is it? "Fear of the Japanese devils!" After speaking, he took out a set of medicine bottles from his bag, each bottle labeled with a drug name, all of which were slogans of the anti-Japanese united front. After the play was over, followed by "Living News", "Singing", and "Opera Interludes". The whole evening was surrounded by a patriotic mood. The finale often invited Ding Ling to say a few words or sing a song.

In the past ten months, she has organized a dozen such identical service corps in various troops. The material for the script is often written by herself, and there are also collective creations. She has been recognized and loved by the whole of China. She has a beautiful overcoat of a Japanese officer, which is her recent outstanding physical object. We asked her how she escaped from prison and arrived in Yan'an. She refused to answer. "Ah, that's a thing of the past." In recent years, she has rarely written novels, but has devoted herself to drama and sketches, reports. "I want to experience this real life. The changes in things are too fast, and novelists can't keep up." In small villages, when we sit down to eat, drink, and rest, the comrades of the service corps immediately gather a crowd of people, playing the huqin and strings, singing. Sometimes there are lectures.

"Do you understand what a traitor is?" the speaker asked the audience.

"I know!" a six or seven-year-old child shouted. After speaking, he immediately hid behind his mother.

I asked them if they were still the "red village." They immediately corrected me: "It's not red. Now it's the united front!"

The next day, we arrived in Yan'an. An ancient city, old buildings, inscriptions, caves, surrounded the city walls. The end of this pilgrimage has no relics or temples to see. Chairman Mao Zedong (usually referred to as Chairman Mao) is not solemn at all. It's like a neighbor sitting next to you on the streetcar. You meet him on the road, at gatherings, and in schools. In the theater, he sits on a stone or a stool like everyone else, taking off his clothes as a cushion like everyone else.

There, everyone is unpretentious, there is no need to be pretentious, and everyone is very natural. Mao Zedong's cotton uniform also has no gold badge to indicate his official title. He is an example, calling on people to work, dedicate themselves, to save China, to get rid of the horrors of war and the shackles of the old forces. Therefore, he is admired by people from all parts of China.

Yan'an does not boast of cleaning and beautifying the city government. It prides itself on a new social relationship that is in progress, and its foundation is: people treat people with humanity. Here, equality is not a slogan, but a fact. Officials do not "work among the people." Because officials are the people. Yan'an is democratic. Yan'an is realistic. Yan'an is pursuing the truth, and as soon as it finds the truth, it immediately promotes its realization. This is the reason why Yan'an is happy. This is the origin of the "pilgrimage" of people from all over China.

Outside the gate of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, there are 20,000 students waiting to enroll. I am afraid it is a new record for any university. Yan'an is like a university. Everyone comes here to learn how to mobilize the masses, do political work in the front and rear, help the army, and the whole nation participates in the sacred war of resistance. And the only qualification for going to Yan'an is a strong anti-Japanese volunteer. You can first enter the preparatory course, or directly study the main course, studying philosophy, politics, and economics. Mass work, military strategy, military training, party affairs, military engineering, and shooting practice, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University focuses on military expertise. Shaanxi Public School generally focuses on civil affairs, etc. The Lu Xun Academy of Arts focuses on propaganda. Literature, drama, music, and woodcuts are all closely related to China's current political and military problems. During the nine-month study period, three months are spent studying at the school, the second three months are spent on off-campus practice and propaganda work, and the third three months are spent studying at the school again to correct various shortcomings. Reading and life cannot be separated. The school is life, and life is equal to school. Graduates from various schools are assigned to work in various places, and many local governments come to hire students from Yan'an to work. Shaanxi Public School has a map showing that there are students from Shaanxi Public School working in all provinces of China.

In Yan'an, people's lives are as simple as Spartans. Most of the students live in cave dwellings and attend classes in the wild. The government provides seven cents of food per day. There is one yuan of pocket money per month. The professor's monthly salary is five yuan. The school discipline is clear, and everyone has very few things besides two sets of uniforms, a Shanxi hat, books, and bedding. Some people may also have a telescope or a mirror box. The life is busy, tense and lively. Almost every meal is unchangeable, everything shows the spirit of enduring hardship and saving the country through resistance.

The outskirts of Yan'an are extremely beautiful, and there are natural gymnasiums in the wild for playing tennis and football, and you can take a bath and swim in the river: the students have symposiums, concerts, watch performances by the Academy of Arts, and dramas by Ding Ling and others in the evening.

The famous people here include Cheng Fangwu, the president of Shaanxi Public School. An old writer, poet, and critic of the May Fourth era, who participated in the Long March. Ai Siqi is a famous young thinker and philosopher. Zhou Yang is an educator. Lü Ji, a composer, and other scholars and artists.

Sun Yat-sen was the first person in modern China to apply Western scientific knowledge and culture to China. After his death, there were more new leaders. The Communist Party has also produced several famous figures, and the Kuomintang is helping to develop together. Yan'an is just like the Whampoa Military Academy in 1925. The help to China is equally great. They inherited Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and conceived countless new Chinese politicians, soldiers, and builders of a new society here. Moving forward together towards the bright road.

### The war situation in the guerrilla area is tense × Fiercely attacking various counties in northeastern Shandong × I wiped out the × army on the border of Hebei and Chahar

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 8th] There are no major changes in the battle situation on all fronts. The war situation in the occupied areas has been tense for days. × Trying to clear the rear, a telegram from Shandong said that × is now reinforcing, most of which came from the Jiaoji Railway and the Jinpu Railway, and jointly continued to attack various counties in northeastern Shandong. More than a dozen counties, including Lijin and Huimin, were occupied by ×, but the four townships are all in our hands. I have sent reinforcements to counterattack, and I wiped out the × army on the border of Hebei and Chahar, and seized quite a lot. × Fearing that our army would attack eastern Hebei, heavy troops are now stationed between Nankou, Beiping, Baoding, Tongxian, and Gubeikou on the Ping-Sui Line. The Changfeng Island troops of × in Xinxiang have been sent to Shijiazhuang.

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 6th] According to reports, our army attacked Yueyang in northern Hunan yesterday, killing more than a hundred ×. The battles in southern Anhui and northern Jiangxi are fierce. Yesterday, Xiangshan × used artillery to bombard our positions south of Dongliu, firing more than two hundred shells. Two × warships in the river also used artillery fire to cover more than six hundred people, landing at Wushiji. I痛擊毙×甚衆, the enemy was severely attacked. Near Hukou, × attacked my Liusiqiao position and was repelled by me.

× Released poison gas in Huoxian

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] Military news, × The attempt to attack Fenyang by criminals in Huoxian is becoming more and more active. Bai Long (west bank of the Fen River) × The number of soldiers has now increased to more than a thousand. On the 28th, a certain unit of our army killed dozens of ×.

### From Shanghai to Jin Sui × 3,000 soldiers mutinied Navy and army opened fire in a melee Our guerrillas took the opportunity to attack

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Recently, more than 3,000 × troops mutinied in Dagu, and the situation is as follows: (A) On the 21st of last month, two × warships loaded with a total of more than 3,000 × army troops from the Huazhong and Huanan frontlines departed from Shanghai and arrived at Dagu Port. The next day, the troops suddenly mutinied. After investigation, it was found that the × troops departed from Shanghai by warship. When departing, the × military officer gave a speech, saying that he was ordered by the headquarters to be transferred back to the country. The troops were initially fortunate to be able to return alive. (B) Who knew that the × warship they were on did not sail to Japan, but arrived at Dagu Port. At this time, they began to have doubts, so they sent a representative to question the captain of the warship about the reason why they did not sail directly back to Japan. The captain replied that he had temporarily received a secret order from the headquarters, saying that the guerrillas in Jin Province were active, so he had to order a portion of the × troops to postpone their return to the country and transfer them to Jin Province to reinforce. (C) When the × soldiers heard this, some said that the captain's words were not credible, and some said that the × military authorities were obviously deceiving the soldiers. Although the captain repeatedly sent urgent telegrams to Tokyo for instructions, before long, he received a reply from the headquarters, still forcibly ordering them to land at Dagu Port and head to Jin Sui. On the 22nd, when the × warship captain and the × army officer announced the headquarters' reply, they euphemistically instructed the soldiers to obey the commander-in-chief's order. The × soldiers all showed anger when they heard this and clashed completely, and order was disrupted for a time. (D) The four warships that had been transferred by the × warship captain to nearby to be on alert were greatly shocked when they heard the sound, and immediately returned to the mutiny warship and opened fire to suppress them. However, the original land troops stationed at Dagu Wharf saw the × warship firing only at the wharf and recognized that the × navy was intentionally provoking the army, so they also opened fire at the × warship in retaliation. For a time, the sound of artillery fire was deafening. My guerrillas thought that the × army was fighting with me, and immediately sent many people to support them. At this point, it was a melee. After a long battle, there were casualties on both sides. Afterwards, the × military officer transferred another team of military police and another unit to Dagu Port to suppress them, and still forcibly ordered the mutinied troops to disembark and transported them to the front of Jin Sui in two batches. From this, we can see the intensity of the anti-war sentiment of the × army.

Shanghai Assassination Cases Two More Cases Occurred Yesterday [Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 6th] Since last week, there has been a political assassination in Shanghai almost every day. Last year, Shanghai had 30,000 criminal offenders, the highest in the country. [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Shanghai News: Zhu Jintao, director of the Nanshi Refugee Relief Group of the puppet Social Affairs Bureau, was having lunch at his residence in western Shanghai at noon on the 5th when two burly men suddenly entered and shot him. He was hit in the nose and chest. The assassins, seeing their mission accomplished, left triumphantly. Zhu was taken to the Red Cross Hospital but died at 1:30 PM.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Shanghai News: Qian Hua, who was assassinated this morning, has died from his injuries. Qian Hua originally had several bodyguards who accompanied him everywhere. Several weeks ago, he believed that he would not be in danger, so he dismissed all the bodyguards and publicly stated that he was a secret agent of the National Government left behind in Shanghai.

He stated in a speech to over 400 listeners today: "Although American manufacturers have stopped shipping munitions to Japan, large quantities of important raw materials such as cotton, iron, and gasoline are still being shipped to Japan. This is as if China is now at war with both the United States and Japan. I deeply hope that the U.S. Congress will pass laws prohibiting the shipment of these raw materials and goods to Japan." [Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th] The Chongqing office of the American company, Arnhold & Co., received a telegram yesterday from its Wanxian branch confirming the news that the company had been bombed by Japanese aircraft. The company has been operating in China for twenty years and has prospered by selling tung oil. The total loss from the bombing is over 500,000 yuan. The telegram also said that the French Catholic Church in Wanxian was also bombed, but details are unknown. Kunming Cultural Trends (II) Dream (II) Six National University Colleges Southwest Associated University, including the former "Tsinghua," "Peking University," and "Nankai" universities, is called "Associated" because, after the fall of Peiping and Tianjin, the three schools organized the "Changsha Temporary University" in Changsha. Soon after, Nanjing fell, and Changsha was threatened. Enemy aircraft constantly bombed the city. Therefore, in February of last year, it was decided to move to Kunming. Professors and students came in two batches, by sea and on foot, arriving in Kunming in May of last year. There are over a thousand students. The College of Arts and Law is located at the old Mengzi Customs House, the College of Engineering is located at the Naixi Huiju, the College of Science is borrowing a building from the Industrial and Agricultural School, and the first-year students are borrowing a part of the Normal School. The administrative office is renting civilian housing. After the summer vacation last year, the students from Mengzi moved back to Kunming. This year, there was a unified enrollment, and over 700 students were assigned to the Associated University. The Associated University itself enrolled over 300 new students and over 300 transfer students, bringing the total number of students, including the old students, to nearly 2,000. Originally, the three schools had only a small number of students: Tsinghua had over 200, Peking University had over 200, and Nankai had over 100. Because of the traditional school spirit of the past, there is now a strong atmosphere of studying within the school. Although group activities are not as active as they were in North China, they are gradually being organized. The Jiaotong University Tangshan College of Engineering moved to Xiangtan, Hunan, after the fall of Peiping and Tianjin. Later, due to the fall of Wuhan and the invasion of southern Hunan by the enemy, Xiangtan was no longer a suitable place to run a school. Therefore, in November of last year, it moved out of Xiangtan. It was originally planned to go to Longzhou, Guangxi, to hold classes, but unexpectedly, when the school's instruments and books arrived in Guilin, they were bombed by enemy aircraft and completely destroyed. Therefore, the plan was changed midway, and the school moved to Kunming. During this bombing, many students were in Guilin and fortunately were not killed or injured. Some of them went to Kunming via Longzhou and Hanoi, while others walked on foot. Now, several dozen professors and staff members have arrived in Kunming and established an office on Huashan West Road. Their school site is located in a temple in Yuxi County. (To be continued) Admirable and Lovable Hunan Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya I boarded a military vehicle of the Xth Route Army to go north from Hengyang. In order to make good time, we set off at dawn, when the moon was waning on the treetops and the stars were sparse in the sky. The warhorses in the distant villages neighed loudly, as if they were seeing us off. The car sped off on its journey. After a while, the sky had brightened. The horizon allowed one to appreciate the morning glow on the distant mountains. Looking at the Spring Festival couplets pasted on people's doorways, many of the lines read: "A true man dedicates himself to the country; a good son aspires to reach the clouds." "Seeking liberation for the entire nation; striving for revival through a long-term war of resistance." "We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor; we will not be traitors. Protecting China's territory is our responsibility." "Millions of people are of one mind, guaranteeing national independence; we will never yield in our struggle for national survival." "The current war of resistance relies on the broad masses; the key to final victory lies in the villages throughout the land." "People, regardless of age or gender, jointly contribute their abilities; places, without distinction between north and south, east and west, unite to fight desperately." "Four hundred million compatriots are determined to resist to the end; on the first day of the twenty-eighth year, we celebrate the success of the revolution!" Moreover, in all the counties, thousands of cities, and towns we passed through later, similar couplets were posted, encouraging the people in the rear to enthusiastically donate money, reward the soldiers on the front lines, and strive to kill the enemy. They simply and completely linked our front lines and rear areas, cities and villages, and the hearts of millions of people to a single battle line determined to resist to the end and strive for final victory. In addition, every few miles along the way, there were two or three newly built thatched houses, with black-lettered wooden signs hanging high, reading "Tea House for Soldiers Fighting in the War of Resistance in XX Village," "Temporary Food and Lodging Station for Wounded Soldiers in XX County," "Christian Soldiers' Hostel," etc., which also competed gloriously with the Spring Festival couplets in a manner that was "plain on the outside but beautiful on the inside"! Passing through Hengshan, I looked at the high peaks of Mount Heng in the south, half-hidden and half-revealed in the clouds and mist, with an extraordinary charm. But it was inconvenient to get out of the car and go for a visit, so I had to greet it with the enthusiasm of "looking up to a high mountain," and then see it off with the regret of "my heart longing to go there." The Xiang River, rich in mysterious legends and especially poetic, flowed gently with clear, bottomless water; although we only appreciated it briefly on the ferry, it gave us an infinite beautiful impression. A boatman with a belly full of resentment told me: "Several dozen thatched houses have just been built on the nearby beach, ready to be temporary shelters for ordinary refugees; I don't know what went wrong with the nerves of the enemy pilots? They went crazy and dropped a hundred or so bombs here. The empty houses suffered no damage, but they wounded several boatmen who were escaping on the shore. Don't you think that's infuriating?" Enemy planes intentionally bombed undefended cities and villages and massacred civilians. Not to mention that we are living people with flesh and blood and should strive to avenge the dead and wounded; even the Xiang River Goddess worshipped by the villagers, if she truly has divine power in the dark, would surely be filled with righteous indignation and smash the enemy planes into smithereens! During the great fire in Changsha, the ferries here were filled with endless streams of soldiers, and crossing them was somewhat crowded. Now, because the war in northern Hunan has subsided, only about two hundred cars come and go each day, so crossing is quite unhurried. More than two hundred civilian boats are rented and connected to form a flexible and stable floating pontoon bridge, with military police maintaining order and guiding pedestrians through. If enemy planes come to "patronize" us, both the ferries and the floating bridge can be untied at any time and floated in the middle of the river to eliminate the enemy planes' bombing targets. Hunan has beautiful mountains and rivers and abundant products: among the biological products, the rice from each county, the fish from Dongting Lake, the cotton from Changde and Fengxian counties, the tea from Anhua and Pingjiang counties, the hemp from Liuyang and Liling counties, and the timber from the mountainous areas can all be sold to other provinces. Among the minerals, the antimony from Xinhua and other counties accounts for half of the world's production, and the lead and zinc from Changning and the manganese ore from Xiangtan are all ranked first in the country. The coal reserves are second only to Shanxi. Other industrial products are also exquisite and renowned throughout the world. The population is also quite large, with over thirty million people. Among them, the populations of Shaoyang, Hengyang, Changde, and Xiangtan counties each reach over one million, which is especially unparalleled in other provinces and counties. Moreover, the people are brave and like to join the army, and they started their families through military achievements. This is similar to the situation in Guangdong, where people like to do business and mostly become wealthy through commerce; hence the saying, "No Guangdong, no market; no Hunan, no army." With Hunan's abundant products and brave thirty million people, during this period of extremely intense war of resistance and nation-building, if its resources are actively developed and its people are strictly organized and trained, it can become a great treasure trove of human resources needed for the war of resistance and nation-building. When the car came across the Xiang River, I heard the majestic and loud whistle of I don't know what factory; after asking the villagers, he said: "This is the whistle from the nearby Tanjishan Coal Mine. The mine was started by the government after the start of the war of resistance, and now there are two wells, producing five tons of coal per day. It is planned to add eight more wells, which can increase production by more than twenty tons." When I heard this at the time, it was like hearing the sound of the five elements, the music of the fallen country, and I truly felt a sense of comfort and excitement. After crossing to this side of the Xiang River, I saw many wartime schools in the villages we passed, posting recruitment advertisements that were enough to evoke beauty. One of them, printed on brightly colored paper and newly posted, was from the "Xiangtan Women's Vocational School," and its content: The purpose is to cultivate the living skills of female students and develop wartime production. Student books are supplied by the school. If it is necessary to live on campus, only three yuan is charged per month for food (other details omitted). We know that the flames of war are burning in the northeastern corner of Hunan, and Xiangtan is not very far from the front lines. However, the sounds of learning and chanting in the cities and villages continue uninterrupted: student food expenses are so low; the lives of the general population are also very stable. If Xiangtan County is like this, most of the counties in the entire province are also like this (the autumn harvest in western Hunan was abundant, and each stone of top-quality white rice is currently worth more than two yuan). This is such a beautiful wartime environment worthy of singing praises. Therefore, I drafted a few short poems to dedicate to the comrades in Hunan and to share with the readers: Lovable Hunan! Admirable Hunan! Wartime education is universal, White rice is three yuan a stone; You deserve to be called the "reserve of soldiers," You deserve to be called the "land of fish and rice." Since the July 7th Incident, Thirty million sons and daughters of Hunan; Whether in the front or in the rear, All have shed a great deal of blood and sweat! What if the flames of war are spreading? The north is encroached upon at Dongting, The east is invaded at Pingjiang; But we are united in sincerity, Our morale grows stronger with each battle, The main force for final victory, Remains safe and sound! Although the essence of the city, Changsha, Has unfortunately been burned to rubble, Flowers of revival bloom on the scorched earth, Who wouldn't sing of her being even more magnificent! Admirable and lovable Hunan! Please drink this glass of fine wine dry: Use your traditional revolutionary spirit, Abundant resources, and food: Quickly heal your glorious wounds, And bravely rush to the battlefield again! Eliminate the brutal Japanese bandits Restore our beautiful land.

Western War Enters Final Stage Government Troops Withdraw from Catalonia Franco Refuses Peace Negotiations [Associated Press, Paris, 5th] Spanish Republic Foreign Minister del Vayo, in light of the failure of government troops in Catalonia, has been working to mediate the war. This mediation is based on recognizing the integrity of the Spanish Republic. However, Franco's representative in Paris declared that General Franco will only consider the unconditional surrender of the government, with the final victory being won by the rebel forces. According to reports received by the French government, Spanish President Azaña, before leaving the country, urged the people to surrender unconditionally so that the war could end. However, according to other reports from here, General Miaja requested that the government not transfer all activities to the Madrid area and await the outcome of government efforts to mediate an end to the war. He also stated that he is currently able to continue defending the Madrid area. According to reports from the front lines, France has allowed 27,000 refugees and wounded soldiers to enter the country near Perthus on the border and expects 40,000 Spanish government troops to enter France. 10,000 of them are in the Pyrenees and Le Perthus. They will be disarmed before entering France. [Associated Press, Perthus, 5th] The Catalan government has abandoned the war. President Azaña and other important officials of the Catalan government have left the country for France. An official of the Catalan government said, "Since the fall of Catalonia, we can no longer defend anything." The situation is clearly serious. Government officials have decided to move to France, each paying 2,000 francs as a guarantee. At the same time, the French authorities have opened the Perthus border, allowing 30,000 people to enter. This afternoon, 1,200 women and children and a team of government troops entered France. They will be transported to Le Boulou by freight car. The electricity supply for Perthus comes from a power plant in Spanish territory, so there have been intermittent power outages in recent days. According to reports from Catalonia, the rebel forces are now advancing towards Olot to encircle Figueres. It is reported that the government troops in the area do not have artillery and cannot resist the rebel forces' attack. Rebel aircraft have been heavily bombing retreating government troops in the Puigcerdà area and strafing them with machine guns. [Reuters, Perthus, 5th] Spanish government troops under General Modesto of the Ebro River have been defeated, and three divisions of his troops will enter France tonight. However, the artillery and tanks they carry will be confiscated. 5,000 foreign volunteers have gathered three miles from the border, preparing to enter. 2,500 of them, mostly Portuguese, have already entered. It is reported that the authorities here have asked the rebel authorities to go to the border as soon as possible to deal with the refugee problem. The rebels replied that they are advancing as quickly as possible, but progress has been slowed because the bridges have been destroyed by government troops. [Haitong News Agency, Salamanca, 6th] The Spanish rebel army issued a military report last night stating that General Franco is still determined to quickly occupy the remaining areas of Catalonia. Late at night, the rebel forces had reached Barbastro and engaged in fierce fighting near Biescas. On the same day, there was an air battle, and a total of 34 government aircraft were shot down. [Reuters, Burgos, 5th] The Spanish rebel forces are pressing on all fronts in Catalonia and have controlled all the communication lines through the Pyrenees. It is claimed that they have occupied Urgell, a government stronghold, about eight miles from the border. Spanish President Flees to Paris [Haitong News Agency, London, 6th] According to unconfirmed reports, Spanish rebel aircraft heavily bombed Cartagena, killing 40 people, including two British sailors. Cartagena is currently the only important port remaining under the control of the Spanish Republic government. [Reuters, Paris, 6th] French and Spanish government representatives held a joint meeting in Le Perthus yesterday, agreeing that once the border refugees are cleared and the Spanish government troops are disarmed, they will be allowed to enter France and sent to the Argelès-sur-Mer concentration camp. The area between Le Perthus and the border has now become a military zone, and civilians are not allowed to enter without special permits. It is reported that the Spanish government wants to relocate to Valencia. [Reuters, Paris, 5th] Catalan Premier Companys and Basque Premier Aguirre have arrived in France and requested residence permits. Spanish President Azaña is also traveling to Paris. Twelve Spanish government fighter planes landed near Perpignan, France, today, and French authorities dispatched personnel to supervise them. Several vans carrying 800 boxes of art treasures to Geneva have also entered France without any losses. In the past few days, over 100,000 Spanish refugees have fled into France. The border was opened tonight to receive military refugees (previously prohibited from entering). 3,000 people have already entered and are being sent to the Argelès-sur-Mer concentration camp. [Reuters, London, 6th] Previous reports that Spanish government Premier Negrín had traveled from Figueres to Madrid have now been found to be inaccurate. According to a Havas News Agency reporter in Perpignan, Negrín crossed the border into France at 3:55 this morning. [Associated Press, Paris, 6th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with the British Ambassador twice yesterday. The two have met three times in the past 48 hours. According to political sources, the two had extremely important talks, the content of which involved the Spanish war, Franco-Italian relations, and issues between Britain and Germany. The Soviet Union has suddenly become excited in recent days. It is generally expected that the Soviet Union's actions will be a prelude to strengthening the "resistance" of Western European democracies. It is also reported that, in view of the Spanish rebel forces' recent gradual advance towards the French border, the French Minister of the Interior has ordered the government soldiers who have retreated into France to remain in France temporarily. Bengal Congress Political Conference Sends Ultimatum to Britain Demanding Indian Rights [Reuters, Calcutta, 5th] The Bengal Congress Political Conference today passed a proposal reaffirming India's right to formulate a constitution according to parliamentary precedents and sending a final ultimatum to the British government, setting forth the demands of the Indian people. The deadline for the ultimatum is June. If the British government fails to respond by the deadline or its response is unsatisfactory, the Congress will be free to take all necessary action to realize the demands. Italian Ambitions Exposed Gayda Writes Article Uttering Threats Determined Not to Withdraw Troops from Spain [Reuters, Rome, 5th] The local newspapers today unanimously praised the communique issued last night by the Italian Fascist Supreme Council. Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, wrote in the Italian newspaper that "This meeting focused on diplomatic matters. The world hopes that the leader (referring to Mussolini) will follow Chamberlain and Hitler in delivering a speech. The leader did deliver a speech, but it was only delivered to the attendees and was not allowed to be heard or criticized by outsiders lightly." After attacking President Roosevelt, Gayda said, "The totalitarian countries continue to be attacked, so they should strengthen their unity to defend themselves. Italy is prepared to do its best and unite with Germany to vigorously defend itself. Hitler's speech has repeatedly stated that the connection between Germany and our country is not only ideological and political, but also military." Gayda also said that the Italian troops sent to Spain will not be withdrawn until the Red Army and the forces of evil are completely eliminated. The victory of General Franco is not sufficient until the Red Army in Spain and its neighbors (the reorganization and relief of the Red Army is in this regard) is cleared. Diplomatic pressure and interference are currently developing, so German and Italian assistance cannot be withdrawn. [Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] The 16th annual meeting of the Supreme Defense Council is scheduled to open at 4:00 PM on the 6th. Prime Minister Mussolini will personally serve as chairman. All ministers, deputy ministers, army, navy, and air force generals, chiefs of staff, and the chairman of the Citizens' Mobilization Committee will attend. British Representative to Burgos, Hotson, to Return to His Post Preparing to Propose a Loan to Settle Debts Owed to Italy [Central News Agency, London, 5th] Well-informed sources recently announced that Hotson, the British affairs representative in Burgos, will return to his post in Burgos next week. This trip has a clear mission: to propose to the Spanish National Army government that Britain provide a loan to carry out reconstruction work, such as building houses and purchasing railway materials and tractors, but subject to political and economic conditions, namely: (1) the loan will be secured by Spanish customs revenue; (2) the National Army government should send all foreign combatants back to their countries and recognize Britain's position in Gibraltar; (3) British ships destroyed by National Army aircraft in Spanish government-controlled ports should be compensated by the National Army; (4) most of the goods needed by Spain should be ordered from Britain; (5) Spanish industries employing German or Italian technicians should not use British loans for development. In short, the purpose of the loan is to enable the Spanish National Army to repay the debts owed to Italy, so as to eliminate Italian influence and allow British influence to take its place. Japan to Reply to Britain, United States, and France Draft Completed [Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to official sources here, the draft of Japan's reply to the notices from Britain, the United States, and France has been completed and will be formally resolved at this week's senior military personnel meeting. Once approved by the cabinet, it will be delivered to the ambassadors of the three countries within a "reasonable time." According to political observers, Japan will explain the following three points: 1. Japan cannot agree with the observations of Britain, the United States, and France on Chinese affairs; 2. Japan does not clearly explain its policy; 3. Japan believes that the international conference proposed by Britain, the United States, and France is not sufficient to solve the Chinese problem. Hungarian Embassy Personnel Left Moscow the Day Before Yesterday [Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 6th] Hungarian embassy personnel left here yesterday. Prior to this, the Soviet government had notified the embassy that because Hungary had joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Soviet embassy in Hungary had been closed, and the Hungarian embassy in Moscow should also be closed. Liverpool Bombing Case Fire in Coventry [Central News Agency, Liverpool, 6th] After the bombing in the Irish residential area here the night before last, British police officers conducted a large-scale search yesterday but found nothing. Currently, all British police officers have been mobilized to search for privately hidden bombs, and the inventories of bomb factories must also be inspected. [Reuters, London, 5th] Warehouses in Coventry caught fire in several locations last Saturday night. It is believed that the fires were caused by incendiary bombs exploding. Fortunately, the fires were discovered early, so they did not cause a major disaster. All four fires occurred within a short time. It has been determined that there were ignition devices. After documents outlining the terrorist party's plan were found in Northern Ireland, British police detectives and others were issued firearms and were well-prepared. Military and police dignitaries were also strictly protected. [Associated Press, London, 6th] British authorities are currently taking emergency measures to deal with terrorist groups. They are also planning new riots. To help the demands of Irish extremists, the Conservative Party Club was bombed yesterday, and the windows were completely destroyed. Police believe it was caused by accidental ignition of gas. According to official sources, Foreign Secretary Halifax received a letter from the Irish Republican Army on January 13, requesting that appropriate action be taken, otherwise the Irish army would withdraw from Ulster within four days. Palestine Conference Arab Representatives Arrive in London [Reuters, London, 6th] The Arab delegation participating in the Palestine conference has arrived here and has consulted with the British Foreign Office many times, including discussions with Colonial Secretary MacDonald. It is understood that an agreement has been reached. It is generally expected that the Arab side will present its views at the meeting between Arab representatives and British government representatives tomorrow. Britain Set to Hold General Election in October United States to Elect President Next Year Herriot Denies Participating in French General Election [Central News Agency, London, 5th] The Sunday Chronicle reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain has scheduled the general election for October of this year, because there are several great achievements that can be announced to the people in a timely manner, namely: (1) Britain's strength in national defense, especially in air force armament, has exceeded that of Germany; (2) foreign trade has become prosperous; (3) all negative defenses have been completely improved; (4) agriculture has recovered; (5) Britain has accumulated abundant food supplies in preparation for wartime. [Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] The United States will elect a president next year. Some members of the Republican Party, such as former President Hoover, often use foreign policy issues as a tool when they have disputes with President Roosevelt. This has aroused the resentment of the local press, which has attacked these people and praised Landon, the former Republican presidential candidate, for his overall understanding. He recently stated that there should no longer be a distinction between Republicans and Democrats on foreign policy issues and that everything should be considered from the perspective of the United States. [Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] President Lebrun was elected on May 10, 1932, for a seven-year term, which is about to expire in May of this year. The general election is scheduled to be held in April of this year. Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and former Premier Herriot was rumored to be a candidate. He recently issued a statement denying this, saying that he had no intention of running for election. U.S. President's Foreign Policy to Spark Fierce Debate in Congress Lines Between Opponents and Supporters Clearly Defined [Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The lines between opponents and supporters of the President's foreign policy in the U.S. Congress have been clearly defined, and the President's foreign policy will be thoroughly discussed to determine where the government believes the front line of national defense is. Fierce debates are bound to occur during this week's Senate and House meetings. Isolationists and Republican leaders in the Senate and House are now planning to investigate the content of the President's statement made during a meeting with members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee the other day. Although President Roosevelt has issued a statement denying it, it is rumored that the President did declare during the meeting that the U.S. defense line is on the Rhine River. Several Republican members also said that the President may not have stated "the U.S. defense line is in France or on the Rhine River," but the meaning of the President's wording at the time was indeed to this effect. Republican Senator Johnson has decided to raise questions at tomorrow's Senate meeting. Johnson is the leader of the faction advocating that the President make his foreign policy public. [Associated Press, Paris, 6th] U.S. President Roosevelt has slightly denied the words he used in the foreign policy he announced to the Military Affairs Committee the other day, but he did not deny the original meaning he expressed, because the original meaning can be expressed in various words. It is said that Roosevelt's denial was issued after 48 hours of consideration. Hungarian and Czech Troops Clash Again on Border Both Sides Investigating Yesterday [Reuters, Budapest, 5th] Czech troops and Hungarian defenses have been fighting near Királyhelmec on the border between the two countries for 24 hours. It is reported that Hungarian troops are hiding in the village of Királyhelmec, and Czech troops are opening fire from a hidden location on the mountain. The local Hungarian commander has protested the "provocative actions of the Czechs." A Czech communiqué stated that 25 Hungarian armed "bandits" broke into the border and opened fire with five machine guns. The armed "bandits" were protected by Hungarian troops. Reuters learned from military sources that Hungarian and Czech officials have agreed to meet on Monday to investigate the matter. German Railway Transportation Suffering Difficulties Lack of Vehicles and Electricity Accidents and Delays Occurring Repeatedly [Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th] German railway transportation is currently suffering serious difficulties. In the past few weeks, accidents and delays have occurred repeatedly. An average of 200 vehicles are reported damaged every day. Most of the locomotives and freight cars currently owned by the state-owned railway company have been in use since 1935 and have rarely been replaced. At the same time, freight volume has doubled, so all vehicles are being used excessively. In addition, the frequent transportation during the army mobilization in September of last year also had an impact. It is reported that the shortage of freight cars totals 100,000. Although the state-owned railway company has ordered a large number of locomotives and freight cars, they may not be completed this year due to the shortage of labor and raw materials in various factories. The German authorities have also tried to employ Czech workers to make up for the shortage of domestic labor. In addition, trains in southern regions originally used electricity, but now they have to use steam locomotives due to the lack of electricity. According to the railway company's monthly report, freight volume has increased sharply, and the lack of vehicles makes dispatching extremely difficult. On some railway lines, especially those leading to Austria and the Sudetenland, passenger transport has had to be temporarily suspended to avoid congestion. The average number of vehicles running on each railway line is now 12% lower than in November of last year. Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Problem Remains Serious Japanese Political Parties Exchange Views Will Make Recommendations to Parliament [Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to general observations here, the Soviet-Japanese fisheries problem remains serious. Representatives of various political parties in the parliament are planning to make recommendations to this session of parliament, requesting the government to adopt a strong position to safeguard Japan's "treaty rights" through diplomatic channels. It is understood that a formal recommendation can be produced at the meeting of various political parties to exchange views on the 7th. [British Press Association, Tokyo, 6th] Japanese Army Minister Itagaki declared that "Manchukuo" is uniquely incapable of constructing "national defense" and that the Japanese government needs to spend 32 million yuan on building roads and border airports within its borders to defend against the Soviet Union. Brief Commentary Annihilate Japanese Aircraft! In recent days, the Japanese air force has been frantically bombing and massacring civilians in undefended cities in our provinces. The essence of Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, has been reduced to ashes. In Wanxian, a major city in Sichuan, the deaths and injuries have reached thousands. Recently, key areas in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, such as Jiangmen, Lianxian, Zhaoqing, Guilin, Liling, and Xiangtang, have continued to suffer tragic bombing and massacres. The destruction and deaths and injuries are too terrible to count! Nor can they be counted! This kind of frantic bombing and massacre, of course, exposes the destructive civilization of Japan's war of aggression against China, but at the same time, it also exposes that the attacking power of Japan's war has been brought to the highest degree. At the same time, the political strategy of anti-communism and ceasefire has also failed, and we have no choice but to implement this cruel bombing and massacre, as a final blow to our determination to resist for a long time, and to promote their conspiracy of a quick battle and a quick decision. But the result of this is the opposite, it is to expose the end of Japan, and it is to strengthen our confidence that a long-term war of resistance will be able to defeat Japan. However, our local people are innocently subjected to this massacre, but we must intensify the expansion of attention from all sectors at home and abroad. In order to save our compatriots who have already been victimized, and even more to prevent future damage, we must not only call on all people to quickly expand the movement to oppose Japan's frenzied bombing and rescue Chinese refugees, but we must also call on everyone to quickly launch a movement to annihilate the Japanese air force. First, among the officers and soldiers of our country, we must launch a movement to exterminate the Japanese air force. This movement can include: (1) fire and national affairs should be ; (5) Actively complete the air transportation connections between China and the Soviet Union, China and the United Kingdom, and China and the United States, and organize an international defense line in the sky. The compatriots of the motherland are in unprecedented suffering. The bombing of the rear and the use of poison gas warfare will be the main weapons of the Japanese in future operations. We must not allow our motherland to suffer again. We should wake up and start by contributing money and efforts to eliminate the Japanese air force! China's long-term war of resistance will surely win E. VARGA Translated by Bao Ren from the January issue of "The Communist International" monthly magazine in New York. What China is currently conducting is a bloody battle that determines the life and death of the entire nation. For more than twenty months, the unyielding and heroic war of resistance has plunged her enemy into a big quagmire, making it difficult for Japan to advance or retreat. She has no choice but to gamble on her last bit of national strength in a desperate struggle. However, even today, among us Americans, there are

20th Philippine Football Team vs. Chinese League Team, Navy Stadium
22nd Philippine Football Team vs. Hong Kong League Team, Navy Stadium

[All matches start at 3:30 PM]

Regarding the Inter-City Team's practice match, due to time constraints, it is difficult to arrange. However, to provide a practice opportunity for both the Inter-City Team and the Hong Kong League Team representatives, it has been scheduled for this month on the 9th (Thursday) at 4 PM, with the two teams competing at the Navy Stadium for practice. It is noted that among the Inter-City Team, there are six Chinese players in the starting lineup, and the Hong Kong League Team also has four Chinese players selected, which is truly an honor for the Chinese football community.

### Li Hua Cup Final Advanced

Yesterday at 5:30 PM, the General Association held its monthly meeting. Attendees included Hai Shi, Huang Jiajun, Mo Qing, Gaodunbei, Helanshi, Aoma, Yishidulanqi, Nilu, Mai Jilufei, Jingxian, and many others. Hai Shi served as chairman, with Gaodunbei as the secretary.

During the meeting, Huang Dijun read a letter from the South China Club, stating that the Singapore Chinese Football Team is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of the month and will compete in Hong Kong on April 1st. They requested that the date of the Li Hua Cup match on April 1st be changed to avoid a conflict. The chairman then proposed that the Li Hua Cup final be advanced to March 26th, which was approved by the attendees.

Last Saturday, the second甲組special silver shield match between South China South and Kowloon Club ended in another draw, leaving the outcome undecided. Chairman Hai Shi suggested a rematch this Saturday at the So Kon Po field. However, South China Club representative Mo Qing and Kowloon Club representative Mai Jilufei objected due to rights issues. Additionally, Mai Jilufei had not obtained consent from his club and could not directly agree with Mo Qing to hold the match at the 加路邊山 field or the 九能 field. Therefore, the location issue will be resolved directly between the two clubs.

During the 甲組League match between the Police Club and Scott on the 29th of last month, a Scott player attempted to punch someone. Subsequently, the player voluntarily left the field. Mr. Shidu reported the situation and requested that the Urgent Affairs Committee pay attention to the matter. Mr. Helanshi also stated that he had received a similar verbal report, but the Urgent Affairs Committee had not received a formal report from the referee in charge of the match. Therefore, the chairman proposed that the Urgent Affairs Committee be responsible for investigating the truth of the matter.

Hong Kong Club representative Shidulanqi reported that the club's original representative to the General Association meetings, Shijianna, had recently returned to England from Hong Kong. The club nominated him to fill Shijianna's vacancy and attend as a representative, which was approved by the attendees.

### Good Football Show Today; Middlesex Reunited with the Navy; To Be Held at So Kon Po Field at 4 PM

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The second 甲組football league match between Middlesex and the Navy, originally scheduled for March 11th, has been advanced to today at 4 PM at the So Kon Po Field with the agreement of both parties.

Advancing the match is obviously beneficial to the Navy. Most of the troops here have not yet set sail, and many outstanding talents are among the football players on the ships. Judging from the Navy team's easy 6-0 victory over 士葛the other day, their strength is evident.

Since the two famous players Watson and Cologne were transferred back to England, Middlesex's combat power has been significantly affected. Their former power has greatly diminished. However, "even a centipede dies hard," the team still has Bili Di, Pi Yaxun, Shu Shi, Shi Han and others to support the overall situation, and is still a good fighting team. Therefore, the Navy does not dare to be confident of winning again. However, the Navy is currently at a time of great talent and is in a more advantageous position by competing earlier. It is more likely to win. If the match were not advanced, the strength of the team might not be as strong as it is now when the warships successively set sail in March. Then, it would be difficult to defeat the Middlesex team. That is why I say advancing the match is beneficial to the Navy.

Since South China South lost to the Oriental team, the Navy has jumped to the top of the standings. However, they are currently only one point ahead of South China South, and there are still many obstacles ahead, so there is no room for optimism. They have the same mentality as South China South regarding the gains and losses of subsequent matches. Therefore, it is precisely because the future gains and losses of the team cannot be predicted that today's battle against Middlesex is extremely important. Our domestic fans hope that the Middlesex team can win. If not, a draw is also welcome, because the increase or decrease of the Navy's score is closely related to South China South.

Sometimes ideals can become reality. Today, we all hope that Middlesex can achieve something. Perhaps their wishes will come true. Moreover, the outcome of football is extremely difficult to predict. Middlesex is not a weak team either. It is not surprising that they can defeat the Navy. (In the first leg, Middlesex lost to the Navy by only 3-4.) Therefore, to know the result, it is best to watch the match in person. (Field Marshal)

The lineups for the two teams are as follows:

Navy Team

Di Jiachen
Shi Dilu Niuli
Feisha Dixun
Kendi Tuoban Mai Weita
Weiluo
Han Niweilu Yan Shidaolang

Middlesex

Jiechen
Shi Han Gu Ba
Weijianchen Bili Di Wo
Feishi Da

### Film and Drama

Entertainment – The Rich Girl's Secret
There Goes My Heart

This is an American-style comedy. The selection of the story and the arrangement of the plot are entirely for the purpose of achieving comedy. The director's ingenious techniques create many fresh laughs for the audience in this film. The crazy humor of the plot is also very captivating.

The film depicts the escape of a naive and freedom-loving rich girl, and how she falls in love with a reporter under special circumstances.

Fredric March and Virginia Bruce are not very good comedians and do not achieve much in the film. Their performances are mediocre. Pan Qian Kelly is bright and cheerful and gives an excellent performance. She is a lovable clown. Nancy Carroll plays a vain and jealous shop assistant, her second performance since returning to the screen, and she does a good job.

Queen … If I Were King
If I Were King

The story is set in Paris during the time of Louis XI of France, when there were strong enemies outside and starving people inside. A poet and swordsman rogue (Cole Men) becomes a leader among the rioting masses, killing strong enemies and managing the government with his courage and talent.

The entire performance is magnificent, and all the characters are lively and energetic. Basil Rothborn, who plays Louis, is particularly noteworthy. The director did not treat the film too seriously, and the whole film is full of humor, which is one of the reasons for its success. In addition, the story itself has a moving power, the plot is exciting, and the actors' performances are excellent, making it an impeccable work.

Ping An … Flying Elephant Crossing the River
Arfzona Mahoncy

This film can be said to be a martial arts film or a comedy, but both aspects are terribly mediocre. The film is set in the American West, depicting how a woman unintentionally softens a group of bandits, while interspersing a circus band that is too small to be true, and the bandmaster's funny performance. Apart from one or two scenes of fighting and humor that are slightly moving and funny, there is nothing else to recommend. It is a very old production from Paramount.

Oriental … That Certain Age
That Certafn Age

This depicts a precocious girl who falls in love with a reporter more than twice her age. At first, he didn't know, but after discovering what was happening, he tried his best to make her give up, but it didn't work. In the end, another girl solved the problem.

Undoubtedly, Diana Poppins is even more beautiful in this film. Not only is her performance subtle and lively, but there is also a significant improvement. The male lead, Moe Wynn Douglas, is very competent, like Mark Hersey in "Singing Voice of a Clever Woman." Jack Cooper still reveals his naive acting skills.

The four new songs inside are also quite moving.

Dahua … Swiss Miss
Swiss Miss

The second-to-last comedy that Laurel and Hardy made together before breaking up. The story is about two cheese sellers (Laurel and Hardy) who go to Switzerland to do business. The two silly and self-proclaimed clever guys make a lot of jokes. Some parts are indeed second-rate, but that is exactly why it is a comedy.

There are also two European singers participating in the performance, especially the woman's singing voice is very good. The performances of the two treasures are the same as before.

New World… Modern Woman Seeking Husband
Cantonese film

This is adapted from the dance "Modern Woman Seeking Husband." The plot tells the story of a millionaire who is extremely stingy and not only does not contribute a penny to any public welfare undertakings, but also tries to take advantage of others. At this time, because various circles have launched a fundraising campaign to establish a refugee industrial factory, they want to ask him for help, but the result is that not only does he not take out a penny, but he also steals a few pastries at the meeting. So everyone devised this "Modern Woman Seeking Husband" method to trick him, and then use female beauty to seduce him.

The main actor is the dance hall 红伶, Ma Shizeng Tan Lanqing, who is also a producer with a business eye.

It is still worth discussing the director's techniques.

Central… Hu Huigan Attacks the Machinery Room
Cantonese film

Because the box office success of "Fang Shiyu Beats the Ring" was particularly good, smart producers seized the business opportunity, and this film was produced out of this motive.

Hu Xiqian is weak and incompetent, and is bullied by the people in the machinery room. His father was killed, and they even wanted to occupy his wife and sister. Hu Huigan was forced by the environment and decided to leave the machinery room and go to the Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts in order to avenge himself in the future. After a lot of hardship and danger, he finally returned one day and finally avenged his father. The plot of this film is so simple. The director has no techniques to speak of. Kuang Shanxiao changed his style to play Hu Huigan, and his performance is still acceptable. Xu Renxin has been away from the silver screen for a long time. In this film, Feng Fu is back again, and her performance is good. The sets of the whole film are too simple, and several martial arts scenes are not tense.

Taiping … Cantonese Opera
Taiping Male and Female Troupe
Daytime Performance… Blood Stains the Statue of Liberty
Ending
Night Performance… Bowing Down to the Pomegranate Skirt

Free Talk Also Talks About Good Reportage Yi Shi

I just read "Talking about Good Reportage" in the Free Talk and felt I had something to say, so I came to talk about it too. I don't know that "a critic once advocated that writers can fire a gun with one hand and write a novel with the other." But in fact, writers galloping on the battlefield can indeed write excellent works, and it is not a specific family's dream talk. For recent examples, the Frenchman Andre Malraux wrote 300,000 words of "Hope" on the battlefield in Spain. The Americans Hemingway and Dos Passos also wrote many excellent short stories there. The American Smedley wrote nearly 200,000 words of "Return to My Old Home" on the battlefield in Northwest China. In Spain itself, Shanduier wrote more than 100,000 words of "Seven Blood Sundays" and 400,000 words of "Spanish Counterattack" on the battlefield. These are foreigners. Even in China, where there was originally not much vigorous creative production without being on the battlefield, many excellent novels and reportage have been produced continuously. The reports, dramas, and poems of Ding Ling, Bi Ye, Liu Baiyu, Hei Ding, Zhang Tianxu, Zang Kejia, etc., as well as Luo Binji's "Detachment in the Eastern Battlefield," Yao Xueyin's "Half a Car of Wheat Stalks," Duanmu Hongliang's "Fenglingdu," Wang Yaping's long poem "Portrait of a Chinese Soldier," etc. Although I cannot guarantee that they held a gun in one hand and wrote with the other, at least they had no time to take off their military uniforms or stop running around during the writing process. However, the large number of works listed above far surpass the artistic value of the "No Entry" type of works imagined based on newspaper materials that Mr. Qin specifically mentioned. Therefore, it is very easy to say "no" with your eyes closed, but to support the growth of the literary cause, careful and arduous searching and observation are needed.

It is a mistake to demand great works immediately, but it is also a very inappropriate statement to think that all great and good works must wait until the war is over and you sit down to write them. The anti-war theme is also the reason why "Fire" and "All Quiet on the Western Front" were not written during the war! A more appropriate example should be "The Iron Flood," "Defeat," and "Tsushima," etc., but there is no question of being able to sit down or not here, but because the fighting is exciting, life is exciting, and the themes and content of the works are still in the process of solidification. In this process, many things that are like scales and claws, lacking artistic description, and without touching power," or even clippings from two newspapers and a street leaflet, are not exactly the bricks and cornerstones for building "Defeat," "The Iron Flood," Tsushima, and other great monuments. We don't dislike having more of these bricks and cornerstones, but we don't just let them be bricks and cornerstones forever, but need advanced and established work. To give painstaking education and support, because we believe that not only can writers write on the battlefield, but the battlefield itself is also producing writers.

However, not being on the battlefield does not necessarily mean that there is no battlefield literature. Writers who do not go to the front line should not necessarily be considered backward and should be ashamed for them" if they are also working hard to cooperate with the war. The rear and the front line both need people to fight. Moreover, Tolstoy was not born a hundred years earlier and personally participated in the Napoleonic War, but he vividly depicted the artistic image of the Moscow attack in "War and Peace." Sinclair, the author of "No Entry," mentioned by Mr. Qin, has never been to Spain. The arduous work of cooperating with the war may not be writing. For example, Mr. Lao She is running around for the affairs of the Literary Association, seeking the unity of the literary and art circles across the country. Mr. Mao Dun is tirelessly engaged in the education and support of newcomers. Mr. Ding Ling leads a group of young people from the Northwest Battlefield Service Group to cultivate cultural cadres to do mass political propaganda, but he sacrificed most of his valuable writing work on the battlefield, which is even more worthy of our respect and emotion. As for visiting senior officers, taking photos, and making old poems, even if he doesn't do these things, what good works has he ever produced? The future of Chinese new literature has long ceased to belong to them.

From Collateral to Direct Lineage Spring Breeze

Yesterday (3rd) I read a strange article that started with "we" and "you," with clear boundaries. In fact, the author does not belong to any "we" or favor any party, but completely stands on the position of discussing matters on their merits. If you read that strange article carefully, you will indeed find a secret. The reason why they say "you" and "we" is not other than to show their proud and complacent strange identity. Aren't they simply criticizing others for being "foreign newspapers" and not understanding "local legal common sense"? Then their identity and status are self-evident. In fact, a certain faction is the adopted daughter of Japan, extremely shameless, selling their souls, and now they have established crony relations with the "local" authorities. If the master knows, they will be treated like "someone" who was sent to the cold palace and abandoned in a certain place. In this case, what is "worrying" is not the "foreign newspaper."

Some people say that the most pitiful people in China today are the traitors. Whether this statement is reliable remains to be verified, but judging from the fact that the traitors in the puppet organizations in Manchuria and various occupied areas were first used and then killed, this statement seems very reasonable. Even in ancient Chinese books, there is a saying that "the hunting dog is cooked after the hunt," which is even more credible when verified today.

Although there is nothing more strange in the world than this, even though they know that the end of the traitor is pitiful, some people still go to do it, and if speaking is not enough, they follow up with written propaganda. If confusion is not enough, they follow up with threats, lest the world be unfavorable to Japan, in order to please their master. In fact, Chinese people should of course be loyal to the Chinese government. If they have anything to say or any reason to speak out, they should do so in a fair and legal manner. Otherwise, running around, acting suspiciously, going to Shanghai today and worshiping at "Hongkou" tomorrow, while still using sophistry to try to convince the world, is really extremely stupid and pitiful and lamentable.

Recently, it was reported that "the Japanese government has now sent 60,000 widows to China to marry Chinese people in 'Manchukuo'." The purpose of this plan is "to create pro-Japanese husbands and pro-Japanese grandchildren..." (Three Japanese newspapers). If we calculate the fertility rate of each widow at three "pro-Japanese children" in five years, then we can get 1

### The Four Northeastern Provinces to Restore Provincial Government Organizations, Announcement Expected Soon

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] According to unconfirmed reports circulating in Chinese military circles, since the government decided to prioritize the establishment of legitimate organizations in the Northeast, the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces have been internally decided: Ma Zhanshan to head Heilongjiang, Li Du to head Jilin, Wan Fulin to head Liaoning, and Feng Yong to head Rehe. Ma Zhanshan is a national hero, known for resisting Japan at Nenjiang. He is currently leading his troops in fierce battles against the Japanese army in western Suiyuan. Li Du is a renowned leader of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, forced to retreat in 1932, returning to China via the Soviet Union and Europe with Ma Min. Wan Fulin is a veteran general of the Northeastern Army, and Feng Yong is a radical anti-Japanese figure who led his student army in the "January 28th Incident" and later served as the commander of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border region. It is understood that these appointments and the regulations for the organization of the provincial governments will be officially announced soon.

### From Chongqing to London in Five Days, Sino-British Air Route to Have Trial Flight

### Oxford University Emphasizes Chinese Language Professorship, Chen Yinke Appointed Professor

[Reuters, London, 6th] Oxford University has appointed Chen Yinke as its professor of Chinese. Mr. Chen is the first Chinese national to be a professor at a British university. The Chinese Committee of various British universities deeply understands the importance of Chinese professors. This time, Oxford University has appointed Mr. Chen as a professor because the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shi, has a high regard for Mr. Chen. Chen Yinke, currently 47 years old, studied at Harvard University in the United States and at renowned universities in Paris and Berlin. After returning to China, he served as a professor of history at Tsinghua University. He will begin lecturing at Oxford in October of this year. His salary is 850 pounds per year. The current Chinese teacher at the university, Mr. Hsu Szu, will continue to teach as a deputy professor of Chinese after Mr. Chen arrives.
