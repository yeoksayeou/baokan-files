### Concrete Instructions from Chairman Chiang for Obtaining Victory

In Chairman Yan's address to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee, he not only elaborated in detail and with depth on the fundamental arguments for our inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, but also provided quite specific and forceful principles on how we should strive for this victory. We believe that if all sectors of the military, government, party, and the general public can follow Chairman Chiang's instructions, consider the various national policies previously instructed, formulate detailed work rules, and make earnest efforts, our final victory will surely come quickly. This is the "supreme truth" stated by Chairman Chiang that "as long as we cooperate with our human efforts, we can surely defeat the enemy without any doubt." Now, I will briefly describe this in separate points:

(1) The primary way to achieve victory in the War of Resistance is to invigorate the national spirit. Our purpose in the War of Resistance is to overcome the strong with the weak and the few with the many, so the invigoration of the national spirit is a first-class weapon. We must not only have confidence in victory and determination to resist to the end, but also ensure that all the people of the country have a spirit of courageous advancement, so that confidence and determination can be manifested as victory in the War of Resistance. This is the difference between the actual sacrifice of the brave soldiers at the front and the verbal resistance of some debaters in the rear. We are not saying that propaganda is unnecessary, but what is needed is propaganda with "backbone," not mere echoing of others, or even "dual personalities," or resistance claims to maintain one's position. The Ming Dynasty perished due to "the timidity of will and spirit of a few generals and officials in the government at that time, as well as the social elites." Some areas were also lost in the first phase of the War of Resistance due to verbal resistance. It is believed that even now there are still some of these bad elements. To strengthen the resistance camp, these elements must be cleared out or transformed. This is the first step in invigorating the national spirit. Invigorating the national spirit must focus on the mobilization of the general public's spirit. The main reason for the fall of the Song and Ming dynasties was that "the court and the people were separated into two parts, and they were not very concerned about each other's pain, so the people's resistance force naturally could not be exerted." Therefore, we must make the people of the whole country deeply understand the significance of the War of Resistance and its relationship with them. People in the government "must fight for the interests of the people and exist for the interests of the people," set an example of sacrifice for the people, and be considerate of the people's hardships. Only then can "the will, spirit, and strength of the government and the people be closely integrated," and then can we, as Sun Tzu said: "This is the first great principle of opening the door to victory in war."

(2) Implement Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament that "China's revolution to save China is also to save the world." This is not only part of our mission in the War of Resistance, but also a major force for our victory in the War of Resistance. To accomplish this sacred mission, we must not only work hard ourselves, but also fight together with countries or nations that are in similar situations. Specifically speaking, there are roughly two types of countries or nations in similar situations: one is countries currently threatened by world aggressors, especially aggressors in the Far East, such as peace-loving democratic countries like Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and the small nations of Asia that have been invaded. The targets of Sun Yat-sen's instruction that "China's revolution to save China is also to save the world" are naturally first the Japanese people and the people of Taiwan who are directly trampled under the feet of the Japanese aggressors, and second, the democratic countries that are indirectly threatened by Japanese aggression, especially the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. In other words, these two types of targets are related to our interests, so we must sincerely associate and cooperate with them to form a strong camp against world aggression to defeat the aggressors of the common enemy.

(3) Use our economic advantages to strengthen our resistance forces. In analyzing the basic conditions for inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, the Committee repeatedly mentioned the vastness of our country's land, the richness of natural resources, and the tenacity of the existing economic organization. In the first phase, because "we are an agricultural country with strong endurance," we are "not as easily affected by war as industrial countries." However, in the subsequent stages of the War of Resistance, our economic base is concentrated in the southwest and northwest. We must not only continue to give full play to the tenacity of agriculture, but also actively build a new industrial base to cooperate with agriculture, creating a cornerstone of "self-reliance" to ensure long-term resistance. Therefore, the Committee Chairman strongly stated: "In the southwest and northwest provinces, which are our resistance bases, we actively develop defense industries, small and medium-sized industries, and the mining and forestry industries, concentrating the country's technical talents and capital to do so. This will surely establish a permanent foundation for the country's economic construction, and there will be no shortage of military supplies and people's livelihood." However, we would also like to add that all sectors of economic construction must find ways to eliminate the malpractices of past bureaucratic operations and adopt "democratic centralization" to meet the urgent needs of wartime without regret. In recent years, the economic construction of various countries has promoted "planned economy" or "controlled economy," but the basic spirit of "planned economy" lies in the Three People's Principles' centralization system, otherwise it is difficult to effectively achieve satisfactory results. The failure of Germany, Italy, and Japan and the success of the Soviet Union are ironclad proof.

(4) The most important condition for us to implement the national policy of resistance is that everyone must work hard, be thrifty, and have a strong will. Thrift and frugality are originally the characteristics of the people of our agricultural country. We must further develop this advantage and make it universal, and the generals and officials guiding the resistance should set an example. The War of Resistance is a difficult task, as Chairman Chiang said: "In the future, all difficulties and hardships will be ten times or a hundred times deeper than today," but "we must now plan with our existing land, manpower, materials, and financial resources, and restore the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs before the Tongmenghui who raised the banner of righteousness against foreign rule without an inch of iron or any support." The people of our country must reinvigorate this great spirit of fearlessness and follow Chairman Chiang's instructions: "Start from small places, low places, extremely difficult and arduous places, and set practical action methods and plans step by step, and after setting out the plans, we must devote our heart, soul, and physical strength to carry them out seriously, one by one, word by word, and sentence by sentence." However, based on the experience of the past eighteen months, the most inadequate aspect of implementing austerity and hard work lies in the "special classes," because soldiers and the general public, their past temperament and current environment, do not allow them to step out of the scope of austerity and frugality. However, we often hear and see that some idle classes in the rear are still dancing, hosting banquets, and even taking the opportunity of the War of Resistance to intensify exploitation for their own waste. This is something that the resistance instructors who implement the leader's instructions should be vigilant about and pay attention to.

(5) Chairman Chiang especially raised the issue of discipline at the end of his speech. This is not only an important issue that should be raised at party meetings, but also one of the important questions in general. Because in our all-out war of resistance, the Kuomintang is the party of resistance, and Kuomintang members must be role models for the general public. The invigoration and decline of the national spirit, and even the victory or failure of the war of resistance, almost depend on the leadership of the Kuomintang and its members. The responsibility of Kuomintang members is very heavy. Therefore, Chairman Chiang repeatedly encouraged them in the position of the Director-General of the Kuomintang, saying: "We ourselves must also establish before the portrait of Sun Yat-sen our own determination to be responsible, fulfill our duties, and fight to the end, implement the party's resolutions, respect the party's discipline, consolidate the party's foundation, and fulfill the party's mission." Chairman Chiang specially mentioned restoring the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs before the Tongmenghui, and his intention is probably here.

In short, eighteen months of heroic resistance have laid the foundation for "inevitable victory in the War of Resistance and inevitable success for the country." The possibility of final victory has appeared before our eyes like a beautiful flower. The remaining question is only how we follow Chairman Chiang's instructions: "Be able to do, be able to work, be able to work quickly, be able to work hard, be able to work diligently, and be able to work practically." We should remember: "Our urgent task today is to overcome matter with spirit, to make up for shortcomings with diligence and thrift, to make up for past mistakes with redoubled efforts, and to make up for our lack of weapons and modern military equipment with a determination to sacrifice and a belief in victory."

### World Trends in a Week

— Pan Lang

From January 21st to 27th, Year 28

Crisis of Great War!

Crisis of Great War!

Crisis of Great War!

The startling and pale cry of the crisis of a great war, along with the changes in the Spanish war, shocked all of Europe and shocked the whole world. This week, the whole world was in a storm. The Anglo-French policy of compromise and diplomacy has resulted in the victory of the two fascist countries, Germany and Italy, in Spain, and has also created traps for Britain and France themselves. Now, the Italian expeditionary force and the Spanish rebels under its command have captured Barcelona. The status of Britain and France has further declined. Europe will surely become a dark and filthy world where aggressors jump and wreak havoc. Fascist bandits in the Americas and even the Far East will also become more rampant. Thinking about the future, my heart aches like burning! However, the broad masses of the British and French people are stepping up their struggle against reactionary forces; the Spanish people are continuing their unyielding resistance; the American continent in the Western Hemisphere has been ignited with anti-fascist and anti-aggression anger; the Soviet Union, which occupies one-sixth of the world, is making rapid progress and becoming stronger day by day; and the struggle of our 450 million Chinese children for anti-aggression and freedom is developing more widely. Therefore, we can deeply believe that in our heroic and unyielding struggle, the fascist war will eventually be extinguished, and the dark and filthy world will also become bright, fresh, and free!

New Situation of Anti-Japanese War of Righteousness

Our anti-Japanese war of righteousness against Japanese aggression has become more tense and serious this week. First, let's talk about the North China aspect: The enemy army is based in Taiyuan and Linfen, and is constantly planning military actions to cross the Yellow River from western and southern Shanxi to invade Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. However, because our anti-Japanese troops in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region and the Lvliang Mountains and Zhongtiao Mountains are fighting heroically, the flanks and rear of the enemy army are under serious threat. Not only has it failed to achieve its plan to occupy our Hukou crossings, but even Fenglingdu was once recovered by us. Now, the enemy army has concentrated five divisions in Taiyuan, and the two and a half divisions in Linfen are reinforcing Hejin and Fenglingdu. Perhaps there will be more fierce battles next week. However, we can rest assured that not only are our troops densely deployed with new-type artillery positions and mobile forces along the more than 1,000 li of the southwestern bank of the Yellow River, but also the areas along the Great Wall of Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, and Rehe-Liaoning-Hebei have been attacked by our certain route army this week, on the one hand, preventing the enemy and puppet troops from outside the pass from reinforcing the south and west, and on the other hand, containing the enemy and puppet troops originally stationed in those places. Secondly, in Central China, the war situation suddenly became tense this week: (1) The enemy army in central Hubei attacked Zhongxiang from Yingcheng and Jingshan on one route, and attacked Shashi from Damen on another route. But they were all defeated. Now Xiangfan is safe, and the defense of the border between Henan and Hubei is also being actively strengthened. (2) The enemy army in northern Jiangxi and northern Hunan is trying to attack Nanchang and Changsha in separate ways, with a very fierce momentum, and the fierce battle has not stopped until now. Fortunately, our guerrilla war troops in the north and south of the Yangtze River are gradually developing. The great victory in the eastern battlefield on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will prevent the enemy army in central China from launching a general offensive immediately. As for South China, the war situation is even more tense than last week. As the situation in Europe becomes serious, the enemy army is launching a large-scale offensive in the southwest, which will inevitably become more intense in the future. Now, the enemy is taking an offensive posture on the two routes in the northeast, but the northern route is only to contain our main forces from advancing and suppressing them, and the eastern route is only to deal with our guerrilla troops. Its main force will gather in the southwest, unite with the navy and a large number of air forces along the southwest coast, and attempt to attack Wuzhou on one route and Nanning on another route. Further, it will echo the Yuehan Railway troops to realize the conspiracy to cut off our international routes in the southwest and encircle and suppress our main anti-Japanese forces.

The Achievements of the Fifth Plenary Session

The second phase of the War of Resistance is approaching the most urgent stage! Our difficulties will also increase day by day! The Kuomintang, the largest political party leading the War of Resistance and nation-building, is convening the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee at this time, which will have a decisive effect on the future situation. The issues that the Fifth Plenary Session must resolve are: how to recognize the new stage of our country's War of Resistance? How to strengthen domestic unity, adhere to the long-term War of Resistance, and overcome current difficulties? This plenary session opened on the 21st of this month and closed on the 26th. As for the results, because the authorities are strictly keeping them confidential, they are still unknown. However, after carefully reading the opening speech of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, the director-general of the party, which was announced yesterday, and the relevant Chinese and foreign military news, it can be seen that this plenary session has completed the following tasks: (1) Reaffirming the national policy of long-term resistance, firming up the belief of the entire party and the entire country in the War of Resistance, and the determination to fully support the War of Resistance. (2) Strengthening the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and national unity. (3) Improving the organization of the Kuomintang and enhancing its national leadership. (4) Stepping up the implementation of the Program for War of Resistance and Nation-Building. (5) Strengthening national defense institutions and establishing a supreme command participated in by leaders of various parties to unify military orders and military administration. (6) Implementing a two-year plan to improve administration, starting with provinces and cities, and thoroughly reforming institutions at all levels. (7) Mobilization of the masses and improvement of military service. (8) Strengthening economic construction and diplomatic array. In short, this plenary session will inevitably make the Kuomintang more progressive, the central government's policies more progressive, and the anti-Japanese national united front more progressive. However, we must step up our vigilance: (1) Surrender elements continue to intensify their activities at home and abroad. Wang Jingwei recently sent repeated telegrams with serious injuries, creating rumors that "there are still people close to Wang in Chongqing" to shake the people's faith in the central government and the leader. He also spread the so-called Three No's Doctrine (not participating in puppet organizations, not supporting scorched-earth resistance, and not interacting with the Hiranuma Cabinet) to conceal his traitorous face in order to carry out more vicious actions. (2) The enemy traitors are stepping up their propaganda against communism. This week, the leaders of the traitors in the north and south gathered in Beiping, decided to cancel the slogan against the Kuomintang, and attempted to forcibly pull the Kuomintang into the anti-communist group. However, Chairman Chiang once pointed out that "anti-communism" is a poisonous scheme by the enemy and traitors to destroy our country. We must step up the struggle to eliminate traitors!

Japan's Internal and External Crisis

The reason why the Japanese aggressors are actively preparing for a larger military offensive on the one hand, and on the other hand, must intensify their efforts to instigate their running dogs Wang Jingwei, Wang Kifan, Liang Hongzhi, and others to raise the banner of "anti-communism," provoke our domestic war, and stop the Sino-Japanese war is actually due to the deepening internal and external crises in the Japanese aggressive camp. Judging from the news published in the newspapers this week alone, the severity of Japan's internal and external crises can be proved: First, the financial resources have no way to support a long-term war. This can also be seen in the debate at the parliamentary session reopened on the 21st of this month. Not only is it impossible to raise huge war expenses, but also the production industry and people's lives are in a state of inability to continue. (Officials stated that Japan's 1939-1940 army and navy budget was 7.248 billion yen, of which 5 billion was for war expenses against China, and the full-year budget was 10 billion yen.) Second, diplomacy has no way. This is not only seen in the tragic questions in this parliamentary session, but also in the strong notes from Britain, the United States, and France to Japan and the League of Nations' adoption of resolutions to aid China. In particular, the United States' preparation to implement Guam's increased defense, Britain's increase in warships to protect Singapore and Hong Kong, and the Soviet Union's active development of its Far Eastern fleet have made Japanese aggressors painfully feel the threat of the Anglo-American-French-Soviet naval alliance. In addition, the development of anti-fascist people's fronts in Japan, the active anti-Japanese united front movements of the people of Taiwan, Korea, and Manchukuo, and the soldiers of the Chinese army's sloth in battle and opposition to war, and even the mutiny of a part of the Japanese army in Jiangyin this week, are all sufficient to explain that the Japanese fascist aggressors will encounter many difficulties in their crazy march. This kind of difficulty is being exposed, becoming more serious, and tending to an irreversible situation. At the same time, our foreign aid is becoming more and more numerous. This week there is also news that Soviet aid to China is becoming more active, and a large number of mechanized war tools are being transported one after another. There are also the facts that China and Britain have signed a general agreement and negotiations on Sino-Soviet air transportation, as well as the progress of Sino-Philippine relations and the large-scale material rejuvenation steps taken by the United States and France. The abundance of our country's foreign aid has also increased the severity of Japan's internal and external crises.

The Western War Changes and the World

The Spanish rebel army entered Barcelona on the 26th of this month, which is the news that shook the world this week and even in 1939. Barcelona is an important base for the Spanish Republican government to resist the Italian expeditionary force and the rebel army, and it is also the last and most important international transportation station. After this place is lost, the transportation between Spain and France and even other countries will be completely cut off, which will directly and naturally make the Spanish anti-fascist war more difficult and make their future of freedom and liberation more distant. At the same time, it will make France lose its support, and the northeast, south, and three sides will be completely surrounded by fascist aggressors! Looking back at Italy and Germany, after gaining this victory, they can not only forever subdue France, but also control Britain, and even establish a base in Spain to invade South America! And the oriental Japanese aggressors have taken the opportunity to prepare for a large-scale westward and southward invasion! The threat to the peace and democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States is really unimaginable! To investigate the reason for this unfortunate fact, first of all, it is due to the British government's policy of compromise with fascist aggressors and the French government's tailism, implementing the so-called non-interference policy, on the one hand, cutting off the aid of the Soviet Union and international peace and justice people to the Spanish People's Republican Government, and on the other hand, condoning the Italian and German governments' pretext of aiding the Spanish rebel army to implement large-scale military offensives. As for the sudden change in the recent Western War, it can be regarded as the result of some kind of tacit understanding in the Rome talks! So, as the situation evolves to this point, the European situation is extremely serious. What are Britain and France planning to do? We must uncover the outer curtain of the European situation to see the internal truth: It turns out that Chamberlain and Daladier's recent "peace" diplomacy is neither due to their fear of war and ignorance, nor is it because Hitler and Mussolini have boundless magical powers, but because the true leaders of the four countries, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the leaders of financial capitalists, are closely colluding. Looking at the European Chemical Factory Alliance, it is the "four strong group" combined by the Royal Chemical Factory of the United Kingdom (the major shareholder is Chamberlain), the German Pigment Trust, the French Courmont Factory, and the Italian Mondeca Nitchi Factory, which has always been opposed to the American DuPont Munitions Trust. For profit, what they need is war. Now the German and Italian aggressors are even more powerful. The crisis of great war is more serious, which means their profits will be even richer! Therefore, although the British Prime Minister shouted loudly this week to prepare for arms and implement civil service, in fact it was only a response to the anti-fascist movement of the domestic justice and patriotic people! This is the key to the European crisis, and it is also the basis for Britain's continued retreat and Germany's continued approach.

New Crisis and Future

The new imperialist war will advance to a newer stage, the fascist aggressors' adventures will be more rampant, (Associated Press Washington, 25th, said that Germany and Italy will greatly develop outward in March this year) and several democratic countries led to surrender and surrender will fall into a situation of internal and external attacks. This situation will facilitate the Japanese aggressors' intensification of the offensive, and this situation will also facilitate the Chinese traitors and pro-Japanese elements to use anti-communism as a smoke screen to move around. Therefore, first, we must raise our vigilance: eliminate traitors, enemy spies, and pro-Japanese elements, eliminate the enemy army's commando team that advocates "anti-communism, seeking peace, and surrendering to the enemy," and intensify the unity of all ethnic groups, parties, and sectors of the country to adhere to the long-term war of resistance. Second, we must recognize that the progress of fascist aggressors' foreign wars will simultaneously increase their internal crisis, and the struggle of the broad masses of democratic countries and the oppressed masses under the rule of aggressors will also enter a new stage. It is not surprising that we will encounter greater difficulties in the future of the War of Resistance, but our heroic and persistent anti-Japanese struggle is not alone! The people of Britain and France are now launching anti-compromise policies and anti-fascist struggles to reverse the national fortune and save peace. They are asking the financial capital to return their national defense forces to protect the country, protect the people, and protect peace. At the same time, the Spanish people, regardless of gender, age, or age, will continue to resist to the end for their own freedom and world peace; international justice people, especially the Soviet Union and the American working masses, will also show greater heroism in the face of difficulties (Reuters Berlin reported that Captain Gasca of the German General Staff also strongly praised the greatness of the Soviet army and the strengthening of combat power in the Nazi newspaper People's Observer on the 26th of this month) The anti-fascist anger of the world will be more united and will rise higher. Let us use the united front against fascism and anti-aggression to declare the end of the fascist regime and surrender diplomacy!

### Our Troops Continue Victories on All Fronts: Reinforcements Still Arriving in Guangdong; We Recapture Jingshan City in Hubei

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 27th] There were no changes on any battlefields yesterday. Reinforcements are still arriving in Guangdong. The southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway are impassable due to our sabotage. There have been localized engagements near Zengcheng, Dongguan, Conghua, and Huaxian. Over ten thousand [enemy] troops have gathered near Guangzhou. Fierce fighting raged all day yesterday in Jingshan, central Hubei, and our forces have retaken the county seat. The disturbances in western Shanxi, near Zhongtiao Mountain, are being caused by small bands [of enemy soldiers]. We have controlled and ambushed them, capturing a considerable number. Fighting is still ongoing. The enemy is continuing to advance on Huimin in northern Shandong. We have been counterattacking for days, with extremely fierce fighting.

[Foreign Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Office, 27th] According to a dispatch from Beihai this morning, the enemy intends to use bribery to entice local leaders to surrender without a fight, allowing the Japanese army to land freely. This plan has been sternly rejected by these leaders, but Japanese special agents are still actively working to achieve this.

[Local News] The Suzhou steamer arrived in Hong Kong at 9:00 AM yesterday, having traveled from Beihai via Guangzhou Bay. A reporter from the Hong Kong News Agency, concerned about the tense situation in Beihai for days, boarded the ship specifically to investigate. He met with Mr. Li Hejing, the comprador of the ship, and inquired about everything. According to Mr. Li, the ship arrived in Beihai on the 21st and departed Guangzhou Bay on the 23rd. During their stay, no fighting occurred at all. Only three to five Japanese planes were seen conducting reconnaissance in the high sky daily. There were no reports of bombing. Only one Japanese warship was seen, anchored offshore. In addition, one or two Japanese warships were seen passing back and forth, but none anchored. The city order was quite good, and most shops had their doors half-closed, but business was not bad.

Our Planes Bomb Guangdong

[Fast Dispatch from Shenzhen] It is reported that our Shenying squadron, stationed at a certain location, after receiving orders to cooperate with the Eastern Route Army in annihilating the remnants along the Wan-Long-Tai lines, had twelve of our aircraft appear over Dongmian at approximately 8:00 AM on the 24th of this month. The aircraft were painted with the Kuomintang national emblem of the white sun on a blue sky. Four were heavy bombers, two were reconnaissance planes, and six were fighter planes. They lined up in an imposing three-tiered combat formation and flew from north to south. Upon reaching the airspace over Shilong, they circled for a long time. The enemy troops occupying the train station and town scattered in panic upon hearing the sound of our aircraft, desperately seeking shelter. The anti-aircraft gun teams also fired wildly into the air, but none hit. Our aircraft calmly identified the target with precise maneuvers and swiftly descended from high altitude. First, they strafed the enemy troops on the ground with machine guns, and then dropped thirty to forty 500-pound bombs on the Shilong train station, blockhouse positions, and the enemy headquarters on Zhongshan West Road in the town. The deafening explosions shook the earth, completely destroying the enemy positions and ammunition depots, killing 150 to 160 enemy soldiers, and destroying countless enemy guns and supplies. Our Shenying squadron safely flew north back to its defense at 9:10 AM after completing its mission. It is noted that this was the first time Shilong had been bombed by our aircraft since its occupation. After the Shenying squadron achieved its initial success, seventeen bomber, reconnaissance, and fighter planes reappeared over Taiping at 7:30 AM on the 25th, again displaying their prowess. Four of the planes circled slightly and then quickly flew low, dropping over twenty bombs. Dense smoke immediately billowed, destroying the enemy positions. They then climbed to high altitude and flew north in formation. In this operation, another seventy to eighty enemy soldiers were killed, one anti-aircraft gun was destroyed, and two steel cannons were destroyed. It is noted that Humen has now been bombed twice by our forces, and Taiping has also been bombed twice. The enemy has suffered heavy losses.

Enemy Troops Stir in Southeastern Shanxi

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanyang, 26th] After suffering setbacks in various locations in western Shanxi and at Yumenkou, the enemy troops in Shanxi have recently shifted their focus to Zhongtiao Mountain and southeastern Shanxi. A portion of the enemy troops in Hejin has moved south, with reinforcements of approximately 4,500 troops sent to Jiangxian, 2,000 to 3,000 to Yuncheng, and over 1,000 to Jiexian. 2,000 enemy troops from the Daocheng Line have been sent from Jiaozuo to Boai. 200 enemy engineers from Jiexian, escorted by armed forces, have been heading south for days, along with over a dozen conscripted laborers, to construct a highway at Ershiling, reaching Qilizhi. They have also gathered a large number of railway ties, planning to repair the Xinjiang-Houma railway. The enemy claims that they will mobilize 45,000 troops on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway to thoroughly clear Zhongtiao Mountain before March, preparing to cross [the river]. Along the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines, the enemy has begun to stir in southeastern Shanxi. Approximately 2,000 enemy troops from Anyang and Cixian are encroaching west, disturbing Pengcheng town. Gaoyi and Xingtai each have 1,000 enemy troops, Lincheng has 3,000, belonging to the Isoya Unit. 5,000 enemy troops are gathered at Shizhuangji, Pindin and Yangquan each have 2,000, and Jianci has 3,000. On the 21st, 2,000 troops divided into three routes to invade south, occupying Chuankou, Duzhuang, and Xizhai at dusk. Our forces are bravely blocking the attack. Our Liang Detachment has destroyed approximately two li of the railway between Shouyang, Dongzhang, Jingzhen, and Xinzhuang.

### The Southwestern War Situation: Announced by the Southwestern Headquarters

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Guilin, 26th] The Southwestern Headquarters today announced the southwestern war situation.

Anhui Province Front: The enemy entrenched in the Anhui area is thinly manned. Our guerrillas are increasingly active and expanding their influence. Using tactics of resilience and attacking the weak spots, they have left the enemy unable to defend against them. Our troops who captured Qingyang divided into three routes and launched attacks on the 20th. Two routes advanced towards the northwest of Qingyang, while the third route maneuvered and attacked from the north of Yangyang. With the enemy forces scattered and unable to coordinate, it will not be difficult to defeat them individually.

Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Front: Our guerrillas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have also recently responded to the guerrillas in various war zones, actively engaging in combat on all fronts. A strong unit attacked the city of Hangzhou. The enemy stubbornly resisted from the city walls. Currently, we are conducting a general attack together with regular troops and local self-defense groups. A portion has already advanced to near [illegible].

Zengcheng Front: On the 15th, five to six hundred enemy infantry, accompanied by several cannons, launched a fierce attack against us. Our troops fought bravely, engaging in fierce combat for four hours. The enemy suffered over half casualties and eventually retreated in defeat towards Zengcheng. On the Conghua front, our unit counterattacked Jindong Shuangfeng Mountain at dawn on the 13th. At the same time, a unit was dispatched to flank the enemy on the north side of Shegang. The enemy stubbornly resisted, engaging in fierce combat until noon, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy troops, unable to withstand the pressure, fled towards Taipingchang. We immediately pursued them. Currently, the vanguard unit has advanced to near [illegible]. On the same day, a unit of over four hundred enemy troops engaged us at Gao'ao Peak. The battle was extremely fierce. The enemy then continuously reinforced with over seven hundred infantry, accompanied by a cannon company. Due to the disparity in numbers, we retreated to the advantageous terrain in the [illegible] area. That evening, we launched a night attack against the enemy forces facing us. The enemy initially resisted stubbornly, but eventually retreated in defeat before dawn, suffering over a hundred casualties in total. Our side also sustained some losses.

Huaxian Front: On the morning of the 14th, over five hundred enemy troops suddenly launched a fierce attack on our Ping Shan Liang Longxu position. Our defending troops fought bravely in response, holding out for half a day. The enemy's momentum was blunted. They then reinforced with over eight hundred troops and used aircraft to assist in the battle. At the time, the artillery fire was fierce, and the position was almost completely destroyed. We retreated to the previously established position on the [illegible] mountain. On the afternoon of the 18th, the enemy further reinforced with thousands of troops, accompanied by over a dozen tanks, and advanced north, attempting to counterattack Huaxian. As [illegible] held no defensive value, we defended the key point of [illegible], luring the enemy deep and waiting for an opportunity to attack. The enemy in Juntian once invaded west, but was intercepted by our self-defense groups and routed, fleeing towards the Chinishui market.

Yueyang Front: Our guerrillas are extremely active near Yueyang and along the railway lines. The enemy feels it is difficult to cope with the situation and is making every effort to shorten the battle lines and defend their strongholds. On the 19th, a unit of our guerrillas attacked the enemy in Yueyang, once charging into the east gate and engaging in close combat with the enemy. However, due to the enemy's superior firepower, and with the mission accomplished, we withdrew to the suburbs to defend. The enemy did not dare to venture out of the city rashly. On the 20th, three enemy motorboats were discovered near Huarong, attempting to harass the area by crossing the Dongting Lake. However, they were discovered by our defending troops, who launched a head-on attack, preventing them from succeeding.

Yongxiu Front: With the exception of a small number of troops left to defend the Baiyang, Ruoxi, and Qiujin areas, the main forces of the enemy in western Jiangxi are concentrated between Dean and Yangxin for reorganization. The enemy on the north bank of the Xiu River occasionally fire cannons southward, seemingly only putting up a false show of strength to intimidate our troops. A unit of our guerrillas is destroying the enemy's transportation lines near the Nanxun line. The enemy is intensifying the construction of blockhouses and barbed wire along the railway lines, attempting to hinder the actions of our guerrillas.

### Strange News Reported Outside Shanghai: Shao Lizi Abducted? Enemy Spokesperson Does Not Acknowledge

[Reuters, Shanghai, 27th] Shanghai's "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reported a brief message today: "Shao Lizi, a member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and former Minister of Propaganda, was abducted yesterday morning by Japanese secret agents. According to the newspaper, several Japanese secret agents, wearing Chinese robes and accompanied by a dozen Chinese, broke into Shao's residence in the International Settlement, ordered Shao out of bed, had him dress, and took him by car to a sub-leased house on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou." Ta Mei Wan Pao added that some senior Chinese officials often come to Shanghai on secret missions, and it cannot be determined whether Mr. Shao was one of them.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 27th] At a press briefing held by the Japanese side today, someone asked if the report in Shanghai's Ta Mei Wan Pao about Shao Lizi being abducted could be confirmed. The Japanese spokesperson said that they knew nothing about this matter.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 27th] The police authorities of the International Settlement here declined to comment on reports from the Chinese side that a certain important person - rumored to be Shao Lizi - had been abducted by the Japanese on Avenue Edward VII. Well-informed sources on the Chinese side believe that Shao is unlikely to be involved.

### Foreign Aircraft Flying Over Our Territory: Enemy Recklessly Interferes: Guangzhou Issues Warnings to All Countries After the Sino-British Aviation Agreement Is Signed

[Foreign Dispatch from Guangzhou, 27th] The Japanese authorities have warned Britain, France, and other countries that their aircraft traveling between Hong Kong and other locations in the Far East must not fly over Japanese-occupied territory. The warning was issued by Okazaki, the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou, and has been formally notified to the consuls of Britain, the United States, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy. The warning also stated that aircraft from third countries have recently been flying over Japanese-occupied territory, which has greatly hindered Japanese military operations. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a request to various countries last year, which was ignored. If aircraft from various countries fly over Japanese-occupied territory again, they must provide prior notification and report detailed information. Otherwise, the Japanese side will not be responsible if they mistakenly identify the aircraft as Chinese military aircraft and attack them. Any losses will be borne by the countries themselves.

[Local News] According to the Hong Kong Telegraph, the responsible authorities of the [Chinese] Navy and Air Force have issued a warning to the British, French, German, American, Italian, and Portuguese authorities, stating that aircraft flying over [Japanese] occupied areas must give prior notice, otherwise, anti-aircraft guns will be fired at them. The reason cited is that the [Japanese] Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued this warning months ago, but it was ignored by several foreign aircraft. As a result, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) aircraft incident occurred. Since [Japan] has not officially declared war on our country, it has not obtained the rights of a belligerent and is unilaterally imposing a blockade of the sky, showing extreme disregard for the rights of third countries. According to Morrison, the manager of the Imperial Airways office in Hong Kong, the company has not received this notification. According to news from the Hong Kong aviation community, the Japanese action is likely due to the continuous flights of Eurasian aircraft between Hong Kong and the mainland.

The National News Claims It Will Not Hesitate to Conflict with Britain

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Tokyo dispatch, the Kokumin Shimbun stated today that Japan's protest to Britain over the arrest of Japanese nationals in Singapore proves that the Japanese government is determined to risk a direct conflict with Britain. Britain's anti-Japanese actions also prove that Britain has decided to interfere in Japan's policy towards China. Therefore, Japan should act decisively, cancel the Nine-Power Treaty, support a new Chinese regime, and abolish the consular jurisdiction of various countries in China.

### Resistance Above All Else, Unity is Victory: CCP Sends Greetings to Fifth Plenary Session: Supports Chairman Chiang's Position

[Reuters, Chongqing, 27th] The Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) today sent a telegram of congratulations to the Fifth Plenary Session here. The telegram supports Chairman Chiang's position in his opening address, which rejects any compromise or capitulation to Japan, and declares that resistance is above all else, and unity is victory. The telegram concludes that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is inseparable from national unity, and with unity, there will be no obstacles. Thus, no achievement cannot be made, and no enemy cannot be defeated.

### Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers on Expedition

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 27th] The Chongqing Municipal Government has drafted measures to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers on expedition. Each person will receive 15 yuan in national currency, starting from February 15th.

### A Merchant Ship Sinks off the Coast of Wenzhou

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai Dispatch: The Panama ship "Kaibo", chartered by the Ningshao Shipping Company, sank off the coast of Wenzhou while sailing from Wenzhou to Kaihua and Ningbo.

### Enemy Finances and Economy Exhausted: Budget Debate in the Diet: Hatta and Ishiwata Unable to Answer

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Tokyo Dispatch: The Diet's debate on the budget system is more important than the general assembly, as all secret or detailed discussions take place in the general budget committee. The general budget committee is neither completely open nor completely secret. The record is limited to the part that can be made public. The Japanese House of Representatives held another budget meeting on the 25th. First, Toubu, a senior member of the Seiyukai, questioned why industries such as fertilizer, gold production, rayon, and coal liquefaction have not achieved results despite the government's efforts to expand them. Minister of Commerce and Industry Hatta replied that the reasons were very complex and that it will progress with government promotion. From this, we can see that the important industries the enemy has tried to develop in the past year have not achieved results. The director of the Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry supplemented Hatta's answer, saying that liquefied coal oil is scheduled to be sold at the end of this year. Toubu then inquired about rising prices, economic insecurity, and malignant inflation, asking what the government's response was. Hatta replied that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Price Control Committee are actively working on it, and fortunately, the prices of daily necessities have not changed much. From this, we can see that the Japanese people feel extremely uneasy about the rising prices and their livelihoods. Toubu further inquired whether the public bonds held by the Bank of Japan have not been sold out and whether it will be more difficult to digest public debt in the future. Ishiwata replied that the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan have decreased by 350 million yuan compared to last year. The bank has not sold out public bonds to avoid unnecessary inflation. Ishiwata's statement was very cunning, avoiding exposing its economic weaknesses and only engaging in side arguments. Next, Takeda, a member of the Seiyukai, questioned the government about its plans for a price reduction fund. Ishiwata replied that there are no concrete plans, but the government is very concerned about this. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's finances are in difficulty, with only increasing public debt and no debt reduction methods. Takeda then asked whether the government has an active plan for economic control and long-term construction. Hatta replied that the control of materials and economic consolidation are necessary, fearing that the difficulties of small and medium-sized merchants and the shortage of materials will inevitably worsen. From this, it is known that the enemy's peaceful industry will accelerate its collapse in the future, and the problems of retraining and unemployment will inevitably become serious. Takeda also raised an important question about the government's outlook for the economic world. Ishiwata replied that foreigners' speculation about Japan's economic strength is completely wrong, and that the government is continuing to promote plans to expand its productive capacity while engaging in long-term combat. Ishiwata avoided talking about pessimistic facts. Takeda refused to let go and asked what assurance the government has that the fiscal war expenses for long-term construction in the future are more important. Ishiwata began to reveal the truth slightly, saying that it is difficult to digest public prices and raise funds for long-term construction, but the government is devising foolproof measures and plans to save in order to avoid malignant inflation. The questioning has come to an end. Looking at Ishiwata's and Hatta's replies, it is sufficient to prove that the enemy's finances and economy have reached the point of exhaustion.

### Military Commission Strictly Prohibits Using Copper to Aid the Enemy: Violators Will Have All Property Confiscated and Forfeited: Those Hiding Copper Should Report to the Government for Purchase

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 27th] The Military Commission ordered military and political leaders at all levels to investigate and prohibit the use of coins or copper materials to aid the enemy. Violators will have all property confiscated and forfeited, and will be severely punished according to the circumstances. If there is a large amount of coins or copper materials in the area, they should report to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to transfer them to the Ordnance Bureau and the Resources Committee to find ways to purchase them, move them to the rear, and hand them over to the factory for use.

### Yu Hongjun Informs Shanghai Citizens on the "January 28th" Anniversary: The Enemy Intensifies Precautions and Sends Warships to Patrol the Yangtze River

Today is the seventh anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Battle. The mayor of Shanghai, Yu Hongjun, issued a letter to the citizens of Shanghai, saying: "Today is the seventh anniversary of January 28th. I cannot help but feel emotional when I look back on the past. January 28th was actually an extension of the August 13th full-scale resistance war. Ever since the January 28th Shanghai Battle, the enemy has become increasingly wary of us and eager to realize its intention to invade. That is why there was the unreasonable provocation of August 13th. Also, since the January 28th Shanghai Battle, the enemy's weaknesses have been exposed, inspiring our confidence in winning the resistance war. That is why the August 13th full-scale resistance war was launched. At this moment, the enemy is mired in quicksand, and the time of collapse is not far away. However, our country's spirit of resistance continues to grow stronger, and our strength of resistance becomes more resilient over time. Domestic unity is getting stronger day by day, and the international situation is improving. Compared to the time of January 28th, it is not the same. Today, we can only obey our leaders and implement ‘quick work, hard work, bitter work, and solid work’ in order to achieve the final victory. This is what I want to tell and encourage the citizens of Shanghai, who are in deep water, on the January 28th anniversary."

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters issued a letter to the citizens of Shanghai on the eve of the seventh anniversary of "January 28th", requesting the Chinese people in Shanghai to continue to support the government's plan to resist Japan and build the country. They are also requested to observe the following three points tomorrow: (1) fly flags at half-mast for one day; (2) observe three minutes of silence at noon; (3) voluntarily donate money to save the country. The Japanese military authorities, fearing incidents in the occupied areas, have intensified security measures. The locations where Japanese troops are stationed are heavily guarded to prevent attacks by guerrillas. Japanese warships are also patrolling in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

[Haitong, Shanghai, 27th] Saturday and Sunday are the January 28th memorial day in Shanghai. The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have taken precautions and measures to prevent riots. The Japanese military authorities are even more vigilant. Those crossing the bridge through the Japanese-occupied area must be strictly checked. On that day, the Japanese community will hold a memorial service for the soldiers who died in the January 28th incident.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 27th] Chinese guerrillas attacked Hongqiao last night, engaging in fierce fighting with Japanese troops for two hours. Clear sounds of rifles and machine guns could be heard at the Hongqiao Golf Course and in the residential areas of western Shanghai. By midnight, the guerrillas had achieved their mission and withdrew. Soviet Union

### China in Battle

— By Soviet · Carlman, Translated from the January 1st Moscow News

Our car stopped sixty kilometers from Changsha because it ran out of gas. It was midnight, and we dragged the car to the side of the road by hand, disguising it with branches, because Japanese planes were coming in the morning. The young adjutant accompanying us, a subordinate of General Chen Cheng, went to find a phone.

Night on the Outskirts of Changsha

Trucks streamed along the highway, columns of troops advanced, and groups of wounded soldiers walked slowly, some stopping by our fire to warm themselves.

We heard snippets of news from the front: the Japanese army concentrated its forces on the railways; Chinese troops heroically resisted in Yuezhou; the Japanese army planned to advance rapidly on Changsha; and the great fire in Changsha.

It was still early before dawn, and I thought of the extraordinary people I had met in the environment of war these past few days.

No wonder the world is discussing the excellent tactics, bravery, discipline, and extraordinary endurance of Chinese soldiers. Many people attribute this endurance and bravery to the Chinese poor's indifference to poverty and death. This is slander. In reality, what motivates the soldiers is hatred for the Japanese. A year and a half of national salvation war has awakened China's inherent patriotism. The longer the war lasts, the more earnestly the soldiers defend their country. Political work in the army is expanding. Once, soldiers asked questions in a political class, and every question revealed a noble consciousness. Every soldier understands why he is fighting, and they are all determined to sacrifice their lives to defend the country. The commanders of the various units I visited generally could not name individual heroes, but they spoke glowingly of how brave a certain platoon, company, battalion, regiment, or brigade was. The wounded see themselves as a burden. They try to crawl a little further away from the battlefield, and if they can walk, they slowly walk to the rear without complaint. They accept the comfort of the people and the treatment of hospitals and doctors in surprise. After recovering from their injuries, they immediately return to the front lines.

Someone approached my fire, sat down silently, and asked if we knew where a certain brigade was. We had just come from there, and one of its battalions was the front line. He was wounded twice in the Battle of Wuhan, he said: "The first time I was slightly injured, and I got better in a few days. My current wound will heal quickly. Our hospital has moved to Chongyang. I decided to return to the team, and when I get there, I can remove the bandage."

"You have to walk a hundred kilometers!"

"That's nothing. I can walk it."

He stood up, greeted us, and disappeared into the darkness. After a while, a child hobbled over on a crutch. There are many young people of sixteen or seventeen in the Chinese army. They are not the army's mascots, nor children for adults to amuse, they are bona fide formal soldiers.

The next day, we got a bucket of gasoline and arrived in Changsha. The night we left Changsha for the front, Changsha was like a fever with evacuation, and residents left their homes one after another. In fact, the front line was still a ways away, but thousands of people believed the rumors that the Japanese were pressing on Changsha. The streets and roads were also crowded with people: some walking, some taking boats, all carrying some belongings and helping the old and young. Changsha's 500,000 residents rushed south to the countryside like an angry tide.

"The Japanese are coming!" This feeling swept through the city like lightning. Those residents hated the Japanese so much that they burned their own houses when they left the city, as if they were crazy. Multi-story buildings and entire streets were burning. The empty city surged with a boundless sea of ​​fire.

Our car drove slowly through the streets. The scene after the destruction of Changsha, which was so lively and bustling with people not long ago, can be described as utterly desolate. Hundreds of workers were cleaning the streets, removing piles of wood and stone, and charred telephone poles. Police stood at each intersection, and groups of people looked at government notices reporting on the relief of disaster victims and the government's efforts to restore normalcy in the city.

Commentary

### Anniversary of January 28th

— Zong Hua

The January 28th Resistance has its indelible significance. It severely struck at the aggressive desires of Japanese imperialists. It clearly shattered the toxins of national defeatism of pro-Japanese elements and those suffering from "fear of Japan," such as the "weapons-only theory" and the "three-day subjugation theory." It enhanced the national self-esteem and self-confidence of the entire nation and inspired the morale of the national army to resist Japan. It promoted the progress of certain upper-level figures and raised China's international status and prestige. The January 28th Resistance was great.

Now, the seventh anniversary of the January 28th commemoration has arrived. After more than eighteen months of resistance and as the War of Resistance has entered a transitional period of a new stage, finding the experiences and lessons of the January 28th Resistance has positive significance for overcoming current difficulties, halting the Japanese advance, preparing strength for our counter-offensive, and striving for victory in the War of Resistance.

First of all, the experience of the January 28th Resistance tells us that China can persist in the War of Resistance and can achieve the final victory. With only a few tens of thousands of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, they were able to defeat hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers, shattering the Japanese's arrogant fantasy of "occupying Shanghai in four hours," persisting for more than fifty days, and winning many victories. Then, who can deny that with national unity, the total mobilization of the national army to participate in the War of Resistance, the mobilization of the national people to support and participate in the great war, and the sympathy and assistance of peace-loving people and friendly nations around the world, China can persist in the War of Resistance and achieve final victory! Therefore, the people of the whole country should enhance national self-esteem, strengthen confidence in the final victory of the War of Resistance, firmly believe in the bright future of the War of Resistance, and make every effort to strive for a bright future.

Secondly, the January 28th Resistance taught us that to persist in the War of Resistance and to achieve the final victory, national unity like iron is essential. During the January 28th Resistance, the civil war had not yet stopped. The various parties, groups, local governments, and people of all social strata across the country had not yet united. The necessary prerequisite and social foundation for the War of Resistance—the anti-Japanese national united front—had not yet been formed, making it impossible to sustain the victory of the War of Resistance. Today, the two major parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, have long been cooperating sincerely. All anti-Japanese parties and various political forces across the country have already united. The people of the whole country are gradually being mobilized extensively and deeply to participate in and support the government's War of Resistance. In particular, the great promotion of the anti-Japanese national united front by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has enabled our War of Resistance to persist for nineteen months and is still continuing. This teaches us that only by persisting in the War of Resistance can we promote unity, and at the same time, only by strengthening unity can we achieve victory in the War of Resistance.

Thirdly, the January 28th Resistance ended humiliatingly with Wang Jingwei signing the Shanghai Truce Agreement on May 5th. At that time, Wang Jingwei was doing his best to undermine the War of Resistance, advocating compromise and peace with Japan. In the years after the signing of the agreement, Japan's aggression did not lessen; on the contrary, it intensified, and the crisis of national subjugation and extermination threatened us even more severely. This taught us that the only way to survive is to persist in the War of Resistance. The supreme leader said at the end of the year before last: "Those who advocate peace are traitors!" At the same time, he repeatedly spoke of the defeat and demise of compromise halfway through. This taught us that to firmly resist Japan, we must resolutely oppose the traitors who advocate peace and must also eliminate all hidden pro-Japanese elements!

Fourthly, during the January 28th Resistance, the people of the whole country, especially overseas Chinese, made many efforts to support the army fighting against Japan. Today, the government is leading a comprehensive and protracted War of Resistance, which requires the active support of the people of the whole country even more. Protracted resistance has its obstacles and difficulties, but these obstacles and difficulties can be overcome as long as we do our best to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and rely on the power of the masses. Today, as the War of Resistance is about to enter a new stage of stalemate, compatriots across the country should do everything possible to support the government and help the government solve all the difficulties. First of all, they should enthusiastically participate in the one-dollar debt repayment movement.

As the great national liberation war has been going on for more than eighteen months, and as the dawn of victory in the War of Resistance is emerging, commemorating the seventh anniversary of the January 28th Resistance, we should deeply understand the past experiences and lessons and make all our best efforts to enable the war to quickly transition to a new stage and strive for the early arrival of the final victory of the War of Resistance!

We must commemorate the January 28th with practical work: We must commemorate the January 28th by supporting the National Government, supporting the supreme leader, supporting the closer cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese national united front; We must commemorate the January 28th by resolutely opposing all traitors who advocate peace and compromise, opposing their Wang Jingwei, opposing all elements who use "anti-communism" as a guise to sow discord, disrupt domestic unity, and undermine the War of Resistance, and opposing the representatives of such elements, Wang Jingwei and the Trotskyites; We must commemorate the January 28th by enthusiastically participating in the one-dollar debt repayment movement. We must, in the commemoration of the January 28th, mobilize thousands upon thousands of compatriots to help the government and strive for victory in the War of Resistance!

### The US Government Prepares to Deal with This Year's Global Crisis, Continues to Work for Peace, and Provides Economic Assistance to Aggressed Nations

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The US government is preparing to cope with another global crisis in the spring or summer of this year. Judging from the repeated meetings between President Roosevelt, State Department officials, and ambassadors recalled from various countries, this speculation is credible. Everyone who has spoken with Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy, Ambassador to Germany Wilson, Ambassador to Italy Phillips, and Ambassador to France Bullitt is convinced that a new crisis will occur this year. No matter what the nature of the crisis, there is no doubt that President Roosevelt will maintain the same firm attitude as last year and work for peace. However, there are two things that President Roosevelt cannot do: he cannot use force, nor can he assist aggressors, allowing them to achieve their aims of forcible occupation through other means of negotiation. The US government cannot order its officials to force the transfer of British, French, Portuguese, and Belgian territories to Germany and Italy under the threat of war. What the US government can and wants to do is to amend the Neutrality Act, providing moral and economic assistance to the aggressed. President Roosevelt does not want to maintain the "status quo" outside the Western Hemisphere by force. It is also clear that President Roosevelt does not believe that the United States will be drawn into the war within a few years. Otherwise, the military expansion plan he proposed would be insufficient to cope with the difficulties. However, judging from President Roosevelt's address to the new Congress, he hopes to do his best to prevent the outbreak of war in 1939. Therefore, he clearly declared to the world that any aggressor nation cannot ignore the fact that the United States will use its economic power to assist the aggressed nations. Moreover, even if the United States were to be involved in the war one day, many Americans believe that it would not be like the story of 1917, transporting troops overseas to fight. Modern warfare often emerges from undeclared fighting styles, such as the Chinese war, which is one example. It can also participate through "volunteer" means, as demonstrated by Germany and Italy's intervention in the Spanish war. Therefore, Americans believe that once the United States participates in the war, it will supply its allies with military supplies, aircraft, and gasoline, and will allow its "volunteers" to go abroad to enlist automatically, without having to send formal troops. If the future war is a war between fascist countries and democratic countries, there will be no shortage of Americans who are willing to enlist in the democratic countries. Even in the Spanish war, although the authorities did not approve, there were still thousands of Americans fighting in the Spanish border. If the authorities were to encourage it, the number of people enlisting would naturally be more enthusiastic.

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] Parliament expressed its confidence in the government's foreign policy and believes that a firm stance should be taken against Italy's territorial ambitions in Spain.

### French Premier Calls for International Conference to Stop Arms Race, Monitors Far East Situation Based on Treaties, Maintains Sovereignty and Does Not Interfere in Spanish Civil War, Pongiletti Explains Foreign Policy

[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] French Foreign Minister Pongiletti delivered a speech in the House of Representatives at 3:30 this afternoon, explaining the current foreign policy, stating that the French government is still determined to adopt a policy of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish issue should be resolved by Spain itself. France and the United Kingdom previously held talks and reached a consensus on various policies. If war breaks out, all the troops of the two countries will assist each other. British Foreign Secretary Halifax previously stated to the French side in Geneva that the British government attaches importance to maintaining the Anglo-Italian Agreement. The United Kingdom understands our intentions very well. We cannot tolerate the stationing of troops from other countries in Spain or Spanish-owned islands to avoid threats to the connection between France and North Africa. We will not allow any country to interfere in Spain to threaten French territorial sovereignty. The British Malta Strait and the Port of Gibraltar are also equally threatened by the development of the Spanish situation. Therefore, I dare to say that the United Kingdom and France must be united on this issue. The Foreign Minister stated that the French government is prepared to convene an international conference to discuss the issue of stopping the arms race. I have recently strived to improve Franco-Italian relations, but the Italian side believes that after the Franco-Italian agreement on colonial issues was established, the political situation changed, and requested France to reconsider the agreement. France believes that the agreement has already been implemented, and therefore cannot accept the Italian request. From 1936 to 1938, Italy repeatedly raised this agreement issue. The signing of the Franco-German Non-Aggression Declaration on December 6 last year was to seek peace. At the Munich Conference in September last year, French Prime Minister Daladier expressed the desire for cooperation between France and Germany. As for Franco-American relations, the French people today believe that American public opinion towards France is becoming more and more friendly. France's relations with the Soviet Union and Poland are also in close consultation. After the Foreign Minister's speech, members of the lower house stood up and applauded, but there were also one or two communists who interrupted the Foreign Minister's speech. During the lower house meeting, there were fascist party demonstrations outside the door, resulting in nine arrests.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Socialist leader Blum stated in the House of Representatives today that the Socialist Party supports Daladier's proposal to convene an international conference. The conference passed a vote of confidence in the current government by a majority of 364 to 232.

Franco-Soviet Agreement Remains Valid

[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] Foreign Minister Pongiletti stated in the House of Representatives that the mutual assistance agreement signed between France and the Soviet Union and the alliance treaty signed with Poland are still valid. When referring to the Far East issue, he said that General Chiang Kai-shek of China is leading troops in heroic resistance to maintain national independence and territorial integrity. The French government is closely monitoring it. Our representatives and citizens stationed in China are sparing no effort to alleviate the suffering of the ordinary people of China, and as a result, no less than hundreds of thousands of refugees have been rescued. Our Ambassador to Japan, Henri, has recently been ordered to submit a note to the Japanese government, reserving all French rights, as the British and American governments have done. In short, the position of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in the Far East is based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922. It was like this before, and it will be like this in the future. This is what the two governments have always believed.

The House of Representatives Passes a Vote of Confidence in the Government

[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] The House of Representatives continued to discuss foreign policy today. The government party, the Radical Socialist Party, also put forward a motion to support the statement issued by the government authorities and trust that the government will be able to maintain vigilance so as to maintain the integrity of French territory and the transportation between mainland France and its territories. The opposition parties intended to add to the wording of the motion, but the government immediately rejected it and put forward a vote of confidence. The House of Representatives finally expressed its confidence in the government by a large majority of 360 votes to 234, and then passed the above motion by a show of hands.

### British and French Seal Czechoslovakia and Continue to Lend Money to Aid Refugees

[Reuters, London, 26th] It is reported that the amount and conditions of the British and French loans to Czechoslovakia have now been agreed upon. In addition to the £4 million that the British government has already lent, the British and French have jointly guaranteed to lend another £8 million, most of which will be used to aid refugees. The interest rate has not yet been determined, and a final decision can be made when the financial experts of the three countries meet tomorrow.

### US Women's Groups Urge Amendment to Neutrality Act to Prohibit Arms Shipments to Japan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] The Conference on the Causes and Remedies of War recently passed a resolution advocating three things: (1) Amend the current Neutrality Act to prohibit arms shipments to Japan; (2) The arms embargo order on the Spanish Republican government should be lifted; (3) All members of the eleven women's groups in this conference should use their full strength to urge Congress to implement the amendment to the Neutrality Act.

### Mussolini's Speech Celebrates the Victory of the Spanish Rebels, Italy Continues to Conscript Reservists, Rumors of Germany Planning to Send Troops to Support Italian Demands

[Reuters, Rome, 26th] Mussolini delivered a speech on the balcony of the Venice Palace tonight, saying, "The victory of General Franco is greatly celebrated by the citizens of Spanish cities to free them from the ugliness of the Reds," and said, "The victory of General Franco's army in Barcelona is a new page in the European history we are creating. General Franco's troops and our brave Italian militiamen not only defeated the Spanish government but also defeated some of our enemies. The order of the Red Army was 'No passage allowed,' but we have passed. I now declare here that we will pass again." His speech was warmly cheered by the audience. All of Italy celebrated the fall of Barcelona as a victory for Italy, and the situation was reminiscent of the celebration of the victory in Abyssinia.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 26th] After the Italian government called up 60,000 reservists born in 1901, it is rumored that it plans to call up the remaining part of the reservists born in 1901 and the reservists born in 1902. At the same time, all young people in the country who belong to special army units will also be conscripted.

[Central News Agency, Danzig, 26th] The Danzig Post recently carried a telegram from a reporter in Berlin stating that the rumors that German troops are currently concentrated in the Carinthia region in southern Austria (adjacent to the Italian border) are not accurate, but German mountain troops are indeed holding winter exercises there. Yesterday, there were rumors that Germany planned to send troops to the Italian-owned Libya in North Africa to support Italy's various demands.

### British Parliament Reopens Next Tuesday to Debate Foreign Policy

[Reuters, London, 26th] When the Houses of Parliament reopen next Tuesday, Chamberlain will report on the visit to Italy and discuss foreign affairs. The first speaker will be Labour Party leader Attlee, and the scope of the discussion will be limited to Spain. It is said that Eden will also speak.

### German and Polish Discuss Economic Relations, Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Germany

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 27th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Polish Prime Minister Składkowski and General Smigly yesterday morning.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 27th] The German Foreign Minister visited the Polish Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon to discuss various important issues between the two countries. According to political sources, Weill, who accompanied the German Foreign Minister to Poland, will discuss the extension of German-Polish economic relations with Polish officials this morning.

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] Ciano will visit Berlin soon, and he can set off as soon as Ribbentrop returns from his visit to Warsaw.

### Japan Violates Treaty, US Actively Defends, Naval Committee to Recommend Increase in Naval Aircraft

[Associated Press, 27th] Representative Sutphen, a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said that Japan's abolition of the naval treaty, the overthrow of the naval ratio, and the construction of defenses in mandated territories in violation of the treaty have opened up the way for us to defend the westernmost front. He said that the US overseas defense plan should be the first thing the Naval Committee should pay attention to. This plan stipulates the development or increase of naval and air facilities in Kenehe Bay, Midway Island, Wake Island, Johnson, Palmyra Islands, Alaska, and Pearl Harbor. At the same time, air force bases in Puerto Rico and Florida must also be defended. He also said that other recommendations to be made by the Naval Committee include increasing naval aircraft and training air force technology guards, and continuing shipbuilding plans.

### The Spanish Government Army Constructs a New Front Line and Establishes a New Government in Figueres, While the Rebel Army Continues to Attack Catalonia

[Reuters, London, 26th] According to the Spanish News Agency, a telegram from Chalon states that the Spanish government army has constructed a new front line north of Barcelona, with a reorganized lineup, and, if the government army engages in street fighting in Barcelona, the rebel army's aircraft will bomb indiscriminately, causing great harm to the people. With few exceptions, all able-bodied men have retreated to the new defense line, and only women, children, and the elderly remain in the city.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] The Spanish government had already retreated before Barcelona fell, and it is now reported that it has established a new government in the city of Figueres (20 kilometers north of Barcelona from the French border).

[Central News Agency, Burgos, 26th] The Spanish rebel army completely occupied Barcelona at 5 p.m. today.

[Central News Agency, Barcelona, 26th] After the government army retreated, National Army troops entered the city this morning without encountering resistance. Most of the residents who had not fled the city expressed their welcome in the streets. The National Army troops were led by a tank convoy when they entered the city. The military authorities had also sent personnel to scout the city in advance to avoid ambushes. General Yagüe's Moroccan native troops are now stationed on Mount Ruhi outside the city, General Soult Xia's Navarre province troops are stationed in Tibidabo Town, and the Italian volunteer Black Arrow Division is located between the two armies.

[Reuters, Barcelona, 26th] A special correspondent of this agency followed the Spanish rebel army into Barcelona and claimed that the army had completely surrounded the city last night, and the Navarrese troops began to enter the city today, receiving cheers from 50,000 people. Rebel flags were hung from windows and balconies, rebel slogans were shouted, and rebel songs were sung. This clearly shows that they had been secretly practicing for the past few months.

[Reuters, Burgos, 27th] The rebel army is now rapidly attacking the entire Catalonia front. The government army originally intended to attack Estella, a town in the Llierca valley, to save Barcelona, but it was scattered by the rebel army. The government army also launched a final offensive towards Huesca and Rosas, but it was also defeated, and all the strongholds previously lost by the rebel army have been recaptured.

[Reuters, Barcelona, 27th] The rebel fleet, fully decorated with rebel flags, sailed to the port of Barcelona. Rebel aircraft performed in the sky. Following the rebel army into the city were many food trucks for relieving refugees. The trucks were surrounded by slogans and flags, with the words "Franco" written on them. All stations are protected by the police.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] It is rumored that the Chief Legal Advisor has advised Roosevelt not to open up the ban on arms imports to Spain. Roosevelt's opinion is that the chances of victory for the government army are extremely slim.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] According to the State Department, it is unlikely that President Roosevelt will lift the arms embargo on Spain. President Roosevelt told reporters that the Attorney General had studied whether the President had the right to order the lifting of the ban, and the result was still handed over to the State Department for review.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Spanish nationals here recently issued a statement on the situation in the country, saying that after the fall of Barcelona, the situation in the civil war has changed, and the situation can be drastically changed in the future. In other words, it is to restore the monarchy and form a permanent government in accordance with the normal course. The National Army government is said to have sent secret envoys to inform the British and French governments that the commander-in-chief of the National Army, General Franco, will completely withdraw all foreign volunteers as soon as he has won the final victory. As for the restoration of the monarchy, it is not that the deposed King Alfonso XIII of Spain will return to the throne, but that the deposed King's son, Prince Juan, will inherit the throne. Prince Juan is serving in the British Navy, and after he ascends the throne in the future, he can guarantee the territorial integrity of Spain to the United Kingdom. In addition, well-informed sources recently claimed that the Spanish Republican government's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Askarad, has been ordered to inform the British government that after the fall of Barcelona, the government army will continue to fight in the autonomous region of Catalonia.

### Rogers Returns to London, Report on Trip to China Prepared, Britain Hopes We Restore Customs and Repay Debts

[Reuters, London, 27th] Rogers of the Bank of England returned here from China today. He declined to express his opinion on this trip, but it is widely believed that he has prepared a complete report for consultation with Sir Leith-Ross, Bank of England Governor Norman, and the Export Credits Guarantee Department. All parties are still paying close attention to the restoration of debt repayment by China with customs revenue, and believe that China can agree to restore debt repayment, but they generally believe that the Chinese government can announce a method as soon as possible to clarify the air and enable the United Kingdom to help China with credit loans and money.

### China Urgently Needs Public Mobilization  Speech by the Author of "Japan's Quagmire"  China Will Never Surrender to Japan

[Reuters, London, 27th] Ms. Utley, author of "Japan's Quagmire," stated yesterday at the Royal Central Asian Society that the mobilization of the Chinese people, long advocated by the Communists, is now an urgent necessity. For the success of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare, farmers must be willing to participate. This mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare is what Chairman Chiang is currently carrying out as resistance. The Chinese Communists in North China have made it clear that some reforms for the farmers are enough to gain their support, and the sacrifices demanded of the rich are not excessive, so as not to force them into class reforms. However, using different methods, these reforms have made the people of Guangxi brave, kind, and fervently anti-Japanese. Ms. Utley also stated that Chairman Chiang was previously constrained by old customs and certain elements of the Chinese government. The loans from the British and American governments came at the right time to decide to remove Wang Jingwei. This demonstrates China's determination to never surrender to Japan and shows that the united front will not break down. Ms. Utley believes that Chairman Chiang now supports mobilizing the people. She stated that attention must be paid to the reform of the social system, which complements the guerrilla warfare in the vast areas behind the Japanese lines. In these areas, the Chinese government still maintains control. Asked if the Japanese invasion of China could achieve anything, Ms. Utley replied, "Some economic laws cannot be broken. Japan's financial strength is not enough to make the currency of the 'United Reserve Bank' redeemable and circulating. When people produce but get nothing in return, they will naturally stop producing."

Brief Commentary

### Italy and Germany to Hold Another Meeting!

Barcelona has fallen! Italy has gained a new victory in Spain, meaning the fascist invaders' prestige in Europe has grown even stronger! The position of France and Britain in Europe has further declined! The problems that Mussolini and Hitler are urgently seeking to solve are: (1) How to resolve the internal struggles within various countries that follow the expansion and increase of fascist forces? (2) How to resolve the conflicts in the development paths of Italy and Germany and jointly plot further aggression! (3) How to use the slogans of "anti-communism" and "anti-Sovietism" to enslave the rulers of Britain and France under the banner of the "Four-Power Group" to expand fascist power in the world? Therefore, the foreign ministers of Italy and Germany are preparing to go to Germany to hold Italian-German talks.

The international policy of compromise and surrender to fascist aggressors has driven hundreds of millions of people into a new imperialist war. Whether the Second World War can be eliminated depends on whether the tide of anger against this policy can quickly spread across Europe. We hope, and recent events have proven, that this tide of anger is surging in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic!

Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers

Our Chongqing correspondent reported on the 7th that the Chongqing municipal government has drafted measures to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers, issuing 15 yuan in national currency per person, starting on February 15th. We wonder if this news will be noticed by compatriots who have fled abroad?

Overseas Chinese should be the most aware of the pain of national subjugation. The suffering of the hundreds of wealthy Jewish people who fled to Shanghai yesterday morning should be even more heartbreaking! Now, soldiers at the front are fighting bravely to defend our country, and their families are either on the front lines or in a state of hunger and cold. Shouldn't we take out some spare money to help them? The government has many places to spend money, and we should automatically expand the fundraising campaign to help the families of soldiers!

Why Treat Soldiers at the Front Like This?

Today is the glorious 7th anniversary of the Songhu-Hangzhou Battle. In the past seven years, the war of resistance has achieved national unity, raised our country's international status, and shown the future of our country's independence and freedom. However, there are still many obstacles in our future. The Japanese are intensifying their frantic attacks because the European situation is serious, and Chinese traitors and pro-Japanese elements will intensify their activities of advocating for a truce, opposing communism, and being pro-Japanese because of the madness of Italy and Germany in Europe. While we are reading reports of the heroic resistance of soldiers at the front and the news of millions of compatriots losing their homes and fortunes, we are also seeing shameless traitors spreading inflammatory newspapers and pamphlets everywhere, advocating for a truce and surrendering. Recalling the painful history of Wang Jingwei undermining the Songhu resistance and signing humiliating treaties seven years ago, what will we feel? How deeply will we hate these pro-Japanese, anti-communist traitors and bandits! We should encourage righteous and patriotic people to rise up! ×××××××××!

### Recent Situation Inside Japan

Translated by Xia Yunjie from the Soviet Pravda

The Japanese invasion war, which has been brutally harming the Chinese people for more than eighteen months, is unprecedented in Japanese history in terms of its scope and losses. In the Russo-Japanese War, Japan lost more than 100,000 people in terms of population and spent 2 billion yen in terms of finance. Today, in the war of aggression against China, Japan spends at least 2 million yen per day. Since the start of the war, Japan's population losses, including deaths and injuries, have exceeded 700,000 people. Obviously, the burden of this war is heavier than in the past, and it has already fallen on the shoulders of the working masses.

If everyone still remembers the exploitation of the Japanese proletariat before the war, then it is not difficult for us to imagine what the situation of the working class inside this country is like today.

Forty percent are factory proletariat. Female workers from peasant families are ××××××××××. Capitalists use the semi-feudal forces remaining in Japanese villages to force ordinary farmers to sell their labor to factory owners at the lowest price. ×××××××××. Due to the constraints of contracts, those female child laborers have to work in a prison-like environment.

All Rights Are Being ×××

In Japan, workers are deprived of even the most basic political rights. Employers can freely lend workers with contracts to other factory owners. The vast majority of women weaving workers (accounting for 80% of all weaving workers) are not free to sell their labor. Due to the oppression of poverty, Japanese villagers have to sell their labor at low prices, and their wages have fallen to an unprecedented level, putting workers and their families in a state of semi-starvation. In Japan, the wages of female workers are only one-third of those of male workers.

Social insurance was established in 1927. Although the authorities only accounted for 10% of this insurance, the management and continuation were entirely in the hands of the authorities and producers. The remaining 90% of the insurance was equally shared by labor and capital. In 1937, a bill to subsidize laid-off workers was passed, but it was not implemented in factories with fewer than 50 workers, even though 4,286,624 workers worked under such circumstances.

The majority of Japan's proletariat is still trapped in the industrial system of handicrafts and domestic industries that maintain feudal exploitation.

Increase in Unemployment

Due to restrictions on imported raw materials, many Japanese factories unrelated to the military industry have had to close their doors, and millions of jobs have been lost, leaving people to wander the streets. This year (1938), the number of unemployed reached 1,815,000. The unemployed are starving, and the few excellent workers are forced to accept jobs with any kind of treatment.

Those regulations that guarantee the most basic labor rights are generally regarded as non-existent in factories. Work-related accidents are surprisingly numerous. In the Tokyo area alone, there were 7,986 accidents in 1935, which increased to 12,795 in 1937. Among these many accidents, the number of deaths in 1937 increased by 33% compared to 1936. Employers bear no responsibility for these accidents, completely shifting the blame to the workers themselves.

This unbearable burden of war is driving the Japanese working masses to gradually realize that their sacrifices will only benefit the warlords and financial cliques and will not benefit themselves at all. The Japanese government, because it has spent 70% of its gold reserves in the war, is trying to remedy the situation temporarily.

Lowering the Standard of Living

Japanese newspapers once wrote the following: "Now, all provinces (that is, all departments) are considering how to overcome the difficulties currently encountered by the country. The design bureau has proposed reducing gifts and letters of greeting to relatives and friends. We must abolish the habit of eating five-dish or six-dish meals. We don't have to be so particular, but should practice the principle of one soup and one dish." (To be continued)

### Food Panic Among Japanese Troops in North China  40,000 Bags of Rice Stored in Hong Kong Transported to Tianjin and Shandong  Japanese Merchants Indirectly Dispatch Personnel in Hong Kong to Collect Rice  Rice Merchants Also Acknowledge That a Large Amount of Grain Is Being Transported North

Japanese troops in North China have recently experienced a food panic and are making every effort to purchase rice in Hong Kong. In order to understand the truth, the reporter inquired with relevant parties. Hong Kong is located at an important outlet in South China. In the past, Guangdong's grain supply was sufficient for self-sufficiency. Every year, a considerable amount was purchased from Annam and Siam, transported through Hong Kong to Guangdong. Since the Japanese invasion of South China, land and sea transportation has been suspended, and the amount of foreign rice transported to Guangdong can be said to be completely non-existent. However, upon closer examination, the amount of rice transported from Annam and Siam, and transshipped through Singapore to Hong Kong, has not decreased and has even increased compared to before. According to unofficial statistics, in the past ten months, about 300,000 tons of white rice have been directly transported to Hong Kong from Siam, an increase of about one-third compared to normal records. The amount of Siamese rice transported to Singapore has also increased sharply by more than 100,000 tons. Singapore's white rice has always been mainly transported to Hong Kong, and last year was no exception. The amount of rice transported to Hong Kong from Annam has not yet been included, but it is believed that there has also been a large increase. After losing the huge sales market in Guangdong, the import volume of rice stored in Hong Kong has still been able to maintain its level, and the location of its sales market is indeed worthy of attention. According to recent news from rice merchants, due to a serious food panic among the Japanese in North China, they have telegraphed Japanese firms in Hong Kong to purchase rice, but they dare not show their faces and indirectly dispatch personnel to collect it. A few days ago, about 40,000 bags of white rice were transported to Tianjin, Shandong, and other places in North China in succession. In the past few days, there have also been more than 1,000 "junks" transporting rice out of Hong Kong. The reporter believes that Tianjin, Shandong, and other places in North China have been occupied by the Japanese. Whether the large amount of grain transported north is to relieve disaster-stricken refugees is a real question. For this reason, the reporter inquired with rice merchants. According to their statement, it is true that "a certain group" purchased 40,000 bags of white rice and transported it north, but they dare not say whether it was to relieve refugees.

### Clearwater Bay Forbidden Zone  Secretly Photographing Defensive Works  Authorities Dispatch Close Investigation

According to the Hong Kong Telegraph, someone was photographing the restricted area where defensive works had recently been set up in Clearwater Bay. At that time, a British military officer was driving a car from Clearwater Bay Road and saw this situation. He immediately got out of the car to investigate. The photographer immediately got into another car parked nearby, quickly accelerated, and fled. After this incident, the authorities dispatched police officers to conduct a thorough investigation throughout the afternoon of the previous day. In addition, an official was assigned to thoroughly investigate this suspected espionage case.

### Jinmen Exhibition of National Products  Final Batch of More Than 30 Crates Shipped to the United States Today  Many Works of Art Shipped for Display

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Our country is participating in the Jinmen World Exposition, collecting domestic products from Hong Kong and Shanghai to be transported for display. The first batch, totaling more than 130 crates, was shipped to the United States on the President Cleveland on the 14th of this month. The second batch of more than 100 crates was also shipped a few days ago. The final batch before the opening, that is, the third batch, is also scheduled to be shipped today (28th) on the President Pierce. This batch contains more than 30 crates. In addition to goods, it is said that many works of art are also attached. Famous Chinese painters such as Gao Qifeng, Xu Beihong, Zhang Daqian, Zhang Shanzi, and Fu Baoshi all have works shipped for display. The nature of the exposition lies in promoting national essence, and it is not limited to goods. In addition, our country's participation in the Jinmen Exposition is handled by merchants, so it is inevitably commercial in nature. It is said that 25% of the goods sold at the exhibition will be charged as rent and commission, and 20% will be charged as deposit. According to the person in charge of this matter, after the opening of the exhibition, the situation of sales of various goods will be observed, and various domestic products will continue to be selected and shipped to the United States for sale.

### Wang Jingwei's Daughter  Wang Wenbin Arrived in Hong Kong from Haiphong Yesterday  Wang's Subordinate Shen Accompanied Her, Acting Extremely Secretly  Wang Is Currently Hospitalized in Hanoi Hospital Due to a Fall

[Special Interview by This Newspaper] The French postal ship Guangdong arrived in Hong Kong from Haiphong at 9:00 am yesterday. Passengers on board included not only the South China team of players going to Saigon, but also Wang Jingwei's daughter, Wenbin, and her father's subordinate, Shen. It was found that after the two boarded the ship in Haiphong, they each occupied a room, as secretive as her mother, Chen Bijun, when she passed through Hong Kong. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong, they hurriedly disembarked, making it difficult for outsiders to discover them. It was also found that Wang Wenbin lived in room 22, and her name was not on the passenger list. It is possible that she has changed her name. As for her father, Wang Jingwei, it was previously reported that he fell and was injured in Hanoi. According to reliable sources, this matter has been confirmed. He is currently hospitalized in a French hospital in Hanoi, but his injuries are not serious. Visits to the hospital are generally refused.

### Landlords and Tenants  After the Implementation of the New Water Fee Regulations  Disputes Are Becoming More Acute  Waterworks Department Orders Both Parties to Resolve the Issue Quickly  First Installment of Water Fees to Be Paid in Two Parts

Since the implementation of the new water fee regulations in Hong Kong, disputes between landlords and tenants over the payment of water fees have become increasingly acute. The Waterworks Department issued a notice yesterday to explain to both parties. The original text is as follows: "Those who are responsible for paying water fees and meter rent, and who have signed to undertake the responsibility, are mostly landlords or their agents. If the guarantor (meaning the tenant) cannot pay on time, the landlord should not cut off the tenant's water meter without warning. This method is inconvenient for the tenant. Tenants should make arrangements with the landlord regarding the issue of water fees and meter rent as soon as possible to avoid putting themselves in inconvenience. At the same time, according to the new water fee regulations implemented on January 1 of this year, the first installment of water fees for this year will be paid in two parts: December of last year for the first part, and January and March of this year for the second part (because the water fees for last year and this year are different). For those in the Peak and various villages, November and December of last year are the first part, and January of this year is the second part. If the owner of a house changes, it should be reported to this department (Public Works Department) as soon as possible."

### Passports to Yunnan  Issued Cautiously  Strictly Preventing Traitors from Entering

Recently, in order to strictly prevent traitors from engaging in activities in Yunnan via Vietnam and undermining the united war of resistance mechanism, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country specially instructed the Hong Kong Visa Office to conduct a detailed investigation of the identity and occupation of passengers entering Yunnan in the future, and passports can only be issued after obtaining a reliable guarantor. The office director, Mr. Dai Defu, issued a formal report yesterday after receiving the instructions, stating that those who apply for passports to enter Yunnan via Vietnam should carefully select the guarantor in the future to avoid misleading themselves.

### Developing Civil Aviation in Hong Kong

Keeping pace with the times, Hong Kong today has become an important commercial aviation hub in the Far East. Although Hong Kong's civil aviation industry has only a short history, its rapid development has been astonishing. In a short span of three years, it has already reached a prosperous state. On March 14, 1936, a British Imperial Airways aircraft flew to Hong Kong from Penang for the first time, creating the history of civil aviation and arousing the attention of international figures to the development of civil aviation in Hong Kong. Since British Imperial Airways launched the Hong Kong-Singapore air route, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), Pan American Airways, and Air France have all successively established stations in Hong Kong. With four international air routes, the foundation for the development of civil aviation has been laid!

Hong Kong already has very close ties with air traffic to and from various parts of the world. British Imperial Airways has already opened the Hong Kong-Bangkok air route, which connects with the London-Australia main air route. Flights between Hong Kong and Bangkok operate twice a week. Departing from Hong Kong in the early morning, one can arrive in Bangkok in the afternoon of the same day, which is more convenient than by ship, so many travelers have switched to flying. Last autumn, there was a period when passenger traffic on the Hong Kong-Bangkok flights was exceptionally busy, and passengers had to book seats one or two weeks in advance. Not only were passenger seats crowded, but the mail delivery on the Hong Kong-Bangkok flights was also extremely busy. This was due to the British Post Office's implementation of the "First Class Mail Fully Airmail" program last September. In the weeks before Christmas last year, the number of holiday letters carried on each Imperial Airways aircraft was piled up like mountains, breaking the past record of airmail transport. Currently, British Imperial Airways has three aircraft on the Hong Kong-Bangkok route, but because passengers and mail are gradually increasing, British Imperial Airways plans to add larger aircraft to the route in the future and, to the extent possible, increase the number of flights to facilitate transportation. The passenger transport of British Imperial Airways has indeed reached an extremely prosperous stage. However, the operating conditions of British Imperial Airways have not actually yielded large profits, but with the subsidy from the British government, it is able to sustain itself!

The connection between Hong Kong and mainland China has become closer since China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation successively expanded their air routes to Hong Kong. These two companies originally operated the Hong Kong-Shanghai, Hong Kong-Hankou, and Hong Kong-Pingdeng air routes, but due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War, the Hong Kong-Shanghai, Hong Kong-Hankou, and Hong Kong-Pingdeng air routes were successively suspended. Currently, the only air link between Hong Kong and mainland China is the Hong Kong-Chongqing route. However, the CNAC or Eurasia aircraft on the Hong Kong-Chongqing flights do not have fixed departure dates, because there was an incident last year where the CNAC aircraft "Guilin" was shot down by Japanese aircraft en route. Without a guarantee of safety for civil aviation aircraft, temporary flight arrangements have had to be adopted. This is certainly inconvenient for passengers. Only when peace is gloriously restored can normalcy be resumed, and at that time, Hong Kong's transportation with China will not be threatened.

The establishment of a station in Hong Kong by Pan American Airways has greatly benefited the commercial development between Hong Kong and the United States. In the past, it would take more than twenty days to travel from Hong Kong to the United States or to send a letter from Hong Kong to the United States. Since Pan American aircraft started flying between the two places, the time has been reduced to seven and a half days. The flight route of the Hong Kong-US flights is from San Francisco in the United States, via Honolulu, Midway Island, Guam, Manila, and then to Hong Kong, and then back to the United States from Hong Kong. Pan American Airways has paid great attention to improving its business and has made many new constructions in the past two years. Recently, it has also built six Boeing-style jumbo jets, three of which have been completed, and the first one is expected to officially operate on the Hong Kong-US route at the beginning of next month. The Boeing-style aircraft is a modern new type of aircraft with complete equipment, and passengers traveling between Hong Kong and the United States will find it convenient in the future. Pan American Airways' Atlantic air route has been decided to open in May. After the opening of the route, people in Hong Kong who want to travel around the world by plane will be able to realize their wishes!

Recently, the Chinese government and British Imperial Airways have reached an agreement to develop Sino-British continental aviation. All procedures were signed and completed on the 24th. The Chinese side's shipping business is undertaken by CNAC, which specializes in the China-Burma-Hong Kong route, and the route from China via Burma to Britain is operated by British Imperial Airways. After this Sino-British cooperation, the addition of the Yunnan-Burma route will naturally bring considerable progress to Hong Kong's civil aviation industry!

Hong Kong's civil aviation industry can already be described as developed. According to official statistics, in the first half of 1938, the number of aircraft passengers increased by 4,024 compared to the full year of 1937, the amount of mail and cargo increased by 157 tons, and the number of aircraft landing in Hong Kong also increased to 201. This proves that Hong Kong's civil aviation industry is continuing to develop, and future prosperity is truly foreseeable. The various civil aviation companies that have already established stations in Hong Kong are still continuing to develop their businesses, and greater improvements can be expected in the future. At the same time, Dutch KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is in contact with the Hong Kong authorities to establish a station in Hong Kong, and it is unlikely that any problems will occur. After the company's Europe-East Indies route is extended to Hong Kong, Hong Kong's civil aviation industry will become even more developed. Kai Tak Airport is bound to become even busier, and the airport authorities have already noted the need for airport development, and the airport expansion plan has also been included in the government's construction plan. The Hong Kong government authorities have decided to build a grand and complete airport for the future development of civil aviation!

Hong Kong is the center of civil aviation in the Far East. This is not an overstatement! With even greater development in the future, Hong Kong will simply be an important world aviation hub!

### Prevent Tuberculosis! Prevent Tuberculosis!

— Luoxia

The prevalence of tuberculosis in Hong Kong is gradually spreading, and the number of deaths is increasing day by day. In the past year alone, the number of deaths has reached more than 5,000. This has aroused the close attention of the Health Bureau, which has taken all necessary steps to prevent the breeding and growth of this terrifying disease, including the printing and distribution of pamphlets listing the dangers of tuberculosis and the reasons for its formation, and advising citizens to enjoy as much sunlight and fresh air as possible in order to avoid the invasion of tuberculosis. Food should be light and nutritious, such as meat, fresh fish, eggs, beans, green vegetables, and fresh fruits. If everyone can follow the above methods, although tuberculosis cannot be completely eradicated at once, it will at least reduce the chance of its breeding!

"Fish, meat, fresh fruits, fresh air..." The various foods announced by the health authorities to prevent the invasion of tuberculosis are almost the minimum enjoyment that everyone should have. However, the majority of the working class, who account for almost half of Hong Kong's residents, earn the lowest wages with extreme labor, just over ten dollars a month, and more than twenty dollars is already considered generous. There are also those who rely on small businesses on the street, and what they earn each day, after deducting all "expenses," is only a few cents. A family of several people lives on that little bit. Each dollar can only buy a dozen catties of rice, and sixty catties of firewood. What about rent? What about vegetables? So, just having two bowls of hot white rice is already not an easy thing. Apart from green vegetables, which are always a regular dish, what else is there to talk about? Fish? Meat? Fresh fruits? They dare not often turn these things over in their minds, because all of these are only "festival" feasts!

Speaking of residence, before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, they could still get relatively comfortable housing. After the fall of Shanghai, especially after the opening of the war in South China, refugees from all war zones fled to Hong Kong, and the housing situation became more demanding than supply, with every inch of land being precious. As a result, the trend of forced eviction and rent increases began. Higher-class refugees paid high rents and lived in the houses of middle-class people, middle-class people lived in the houses of lower-class people, and lower-class people could only squeeze into slums. The narrowness, dampness, and baseness of the back streets and alleys do not need journalists to describe them in detail. Those places never have the shadow of the sun. Except for a little light revealed by the sky, it is always dim and dark, and you cannot see your fingers no matter day or night. A small room that is a little more than ten feet wide and a little more than twenty feet long, including the room and the beds, is inhabited by thirty or forty people, filled with a strong atmosphere of stale air. These places, where are they houses, they are simply "human warehouses"! What is there to talk about enjoying fresh air?

A worker living in the "back shop" of a paper shop in ×× told reporters that he felt very scared being squeezed into that dark and dirty room, especially since the house was full of easily flammable items. He often thought about finding a place to move, but because he could not afford the rent, there was no way. Their lives are already under direct threat in these places, and there is no way to think about fresh air or the invasion of tuberculosis!

In addition, there are countless people who develop tuberculosis due to working too long, accumulating fatigue, or being suppressed by other harsh environments. Therefore, we feel that if we can find a fundamental solution in addition to advising citizens to eat more nutritious food and enjoy fresh air, and implement it in conjunction, we believe that the elimination of tuberculosis can achieve twice the result with half the effort!

The Original Address by President Chiang at the Opening of the Fifth Plenary Session, Continued from Page Three Yesterday

That is to say, the National Government and the Revolutionary Government must strive for the interests of the nation and exist for the interests of the people. It is to recognize our own responsibilities and not to be threatened by others. It is to complete the National Revolution, implement the Three Principles of the People, and absolutely not fear the use of force. Our current War of Resistance is a unified action in which the will, spirit, and strength of the government and the people are closely integrated. As Sun Tzu said, "The Way is to make the people agree with their superiors, so they can face death and live together, and the people will not fear danger." This is the first major principle for winning a war. We can truly achieve this principle in this War of Resistance against Japan. Our entire country is of one mind, and from top to bottom, under the orders of the National Government, the old, weak, women, and children all know how to kill × and defend themselves, and they all obey orders and commands. It is truly what is called "dying without regret," and no one is willing to sell the life of their ancestors and generations and willingly become a Japanese slave. Our country's spirit of "rather die than be humiliated" for thousands of years has been widely aroused by ××'s × actions. Therefore, historically speaking, there is no reason for China to perish. Judging from past history, and measuring it today from the perspective of national consciousness and the spirit of the times, it is even more impossible for China to be conquered and subdued in this War of Resistance.

(B) Geographically speaking, our country inherently has the natural advantage of resisting foreign aggression. The construction of the Great Wall in the past was a great project by our ancestors to utilize the terrain as a defense facility. Our country has a vast area, spanning more than sixty-five degrees of longitude from east to west, and encompassing the climates of the cold, temperate, and tropical zones from south to north. Therefore, when discussing the success or failure of military affairs in our country, both the timing of heaven and the advantage of terrain are mentioned together. The inland and western regions are crisscrossed with lakes and swamps, and mountains are intertwined, with plains and deserts everywhere. Therefore, in terms of area, in the past, no foreign race could permanently occupy all of our territory, but could only occupy a part of it for a period of time. Even during the most prosperous periods of the Yuan and Qing dynasties, they could only occupy a few strongholds, while our people's resistance forces still existed and spread throughout the country. Today, × people, with a population of only seventy million, want to swallow up our country with a vast population that is more than six times larger than theirs, and want to eliminate our nation with a long-standing culture and history. Isn't this a dream? As for the current War of Resistance terrain, our country's terrain is complex, as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Coupled with a strong national spirit and manpower, any weapon will have its limitations. Therefore, geographically speaking, it is also impossible for our country to be conquered and subdued by ×.

(C) Culturally speaking, since the beginning of history, only China among Asian countries has had an independent culture. Only China has assimilated foreign races through culture, even to the point of making foreign races that entered China become assimilated. No foreign culture can diminish our country's inherent culture. As for modern science, it is a shared achievement of world civilization. However, Chinese culture naturally has its unique spirit. There is no need to cite extensively. Just look at the people in remote rural areas in our country, regardless of men or women, who often exhibit acts of loyalty, righteousness, and martyrdom that are worthy of praise and tears when they encounter × people. This shows the deep foundation of Chinese cultural strength. × people want to eliminate our national spirit with a culture that is neither Eastern nor Western. They have already suffered many failures in many occupied areas. As long as we are united and determined to fight, the longer the War of Resistance lasts, the more the righteous spirit of the people will be developed. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, we will forge an even more glorious and solid force in our culture. Therefore, in terms of culture and national spirit, it is also impossible for China to be destroyed by ×.

(D) Economically speaking, the cause of wars often lies in economic plunder, and the success or failure often depends on whether the economy can be sustained. Our country is an agricultural country and is in the midst of construction. It suddenly suffered violent aggression, which was originally a deeply worrying crisis. However, since the beginning of the war eighteen months ago, not only has our financial foundation not been significantly affected, but also our finances have remained stable. The lives of the people in the rear have not been affected by the war. Moreover, in most provinces, due to the bumper harvest last year, consumption was reduced and savings were increased, and the people actually showed signs of affluence. This is because we are an agricultural country and have strong resilience, unlike industrial countries that are easily affected by war. Now that we have entered the second phase of the War of Resistance, we firmly believe that there will be no problems with the wartime economy. In the southwestern and northwestern provinces, which are our bases for the War of Resistance, we are actively developing national defense industries, small and medium-sized industries, and silviculture. By concentrating the strength of technical talents and capital from all over the country, we will be able to establish a permanent foundation for national economic construction, and there will be no shortage of military supplies and people's livelihood. The resilience of our agricultural country's wartime economy is something that × people have not taken into account, and it is another major failure for × people. Therefore, economically speaking, China is fully capable of long-term resistance and will not be subjugated by ×. Modern warfare requires not only knowing the enemy and oneself, but also understanding the direction of the development of the international situation. × people not only do not recognize themselves, do not recognize × people - our China, but also simply do not recognize the environment of the times. Of course, they will step by step tend to failure. In general, the international situation over the past year, although seemingly turbulent, has always been moving in the direction of safeguarding credibility and peace. In particular, the democratic powers of Europe and the United States are very cautious in dealing with the situation. In terms of the people, they reject aggression and advocate fairness, and they are becoming more and more powerful every day. Even their politicians are painstakingly trying to stabilize the existing situation, while at the same time never relaxing the preparations to strengthen their own forces. From various aspects, we can see that we have the determination to curb aggression and safeguard world peace. Recently, this situation has become increasingly clear. Since the September 18th Incident, we have long determined that the only path in the world is the path of public reason and justice, which is the path followed by all mankind. Any country that can strengthen itself and stand on its own, even if it suffers hardship and sacrifice for a time, is right to do so. Over time, it will naturally gain the resonance of the righteous. The signs of the continuous international evolution confirm our observations over the past six or seven years without the slightest deviation. This is not because we have any prophetic ability. We are just adhering to the revolutionary stance of our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen to save the country and the world. Therefore, everything comes from conscience and justice. Comrades, you must understand that our Founding Father's lifelong revolution to save China is also to save the world. (The following hundred or so words of telegram code are unclear)

We do not insult the weak, nor do we fear the strong. We advocate mutual assistance, seek self-improvement, respect credibility, and oppose aggression. Therefore, our Founding Father also said, "China has been strong for thousands of years, but Korea still exists. Japan has only been strong for twenty years, but it has reduced Korea." This is because China has always taken aiding the weak and supporting the declining as its policy and self-preservation and coexistence as its model. Our National Revolution is to promote our morality of credibility and peace and promote the common and lasting peace and happiness of the world's human beings. At the end of the European war, our Founding Father drafted a National Reconstruction Strategy, the purpose of which was to promote the modernization of China's industry, that is, to find a very good outlet for world capital and technology, so as to avoid the recurrence of tragic wars among the world's human beings due to the competition for resources and markets. The two most important sentences in the middle are to use the principle of "survival depends on self-control" to utilize foreign capital and machinery. Unfortunately, these two compassionate proposals for saving the country and the world have not been concretely realized. Instead, Japan took advantage of the opportunity after the European war to gradually invade our country. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has always been wronged and endured the pain, respecting peace. × people continue to expand their aggression without limit. They do not know that this is an era of surging "national goals" and "nationalism" trends. Small nations are also demanding to rise up and become independent, and the world powers have also changed their past attitudes and methods. In such an era, our × people still delusionally want to swallow up China, a country with 450 million people, with a population of 70 million. After the Tanggu Truce, our country's existence had reached the lowest limit. At this point, Japan still wants to destroy the last line of life that China depends on, and occupy our Peiping and Tianjin for no reason. Even this lowest limit is not allowed for us to preserve. That is to say, it is better to die than to live, and it is better to perish than to exist. Rather than existing as if we were perishing, we have no choice but to fight desperately. As the saying goes, "When two armies meet, the one that is grieved will win." At that time, there was no reason for us not to resist. Our morale and popular sentiment were full of sorrow and anger, with death as the only option. This is the "grievous army" that has never been seen in the history of the world. Our War of Resistance is not only for the independence and survival of our own country, but also for the maintenance of world peace and regional credibility. Therefore, this war of ours is also a righteous war. × people's unprovoked invasion of China is a violent war of suicide and self-harm that is unjustified. At the beginning of our War of Resistance, we had already calculated all the difficulties and hardships of today, even if they were ten times or a hundred times deeper than today. However, since this sacred obligation has been placed on our nation, we must overcome all difficulties and achieve the tasks of our National Revolution with supreme sacrifice. We must strike down aggression, restore the effectiveness of international treaties, uphold public reason and justice, and especially prove the inevitable defeat of the violence that runs rampant through our resolute War of Resistance. We must change the vision of all mankind and ensure lasting international peace. Comrades, you must know that before the War of Resistance, the world regarded our country as inferior to third-class countries. Now, we have been fighting Japan, a first-class power, for more than a year and a half, and we have not been defeated by × people. Of course, we no longer need to fear the violence of × people. Our future will inevitably have many difficulties, but after the War of Resistance has entered the second phase, we are convinced that the war situation will inevitably be smoother and closer to the light day by day. The whole question lies in whether we have the indomitable spirit of long-term perseverance, and whether we have the effort to unite the whole country and fight to the death. Based on the above description, all comrades can truly recognize our country's own strength to support the struggle, recognize the strategic policies of × country, and recognize the various practical situations and the process of evolution in other aspects. From this, you can realize the inevitability of the development of all things in the world, and you can clearly understand the number of successes and failures. Since ancient times, great courage has been born from great wisdom. Since we have such an indestructible righteousness for the mission and future of the War of Resistance, we will naturally be able to generate unparalleled determination and confidence.

Now our War of Resistance has already entered the second phase. It is undeniable that we have lost a lot of land and most of the transportation lines, sacrificed many lives and property of our compatriots, and seized countless industries and resources. But we must know that most of the revolutionary work is started from the ground up. From now on, we must plan with the existing land, manpower, military power, and financial resources, and restore the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs before the Tongmenghui who raised the banner of righteousness without an inch of iron and without any basis to resist foreign rule. From small places, low places, and extremely difficult and arduous places, we must be down-to-earth and set concrete plans and schedules. After the plans and schedules are set, we must devote our efforts and strength, and every word and sentence must be truly implemented. × people declare that the war will be for a hundred years. We believe that there is no definite time limit for the work of resisting the war and building the country. If it does not succeed in five years, then ten years. If it does not succeed in ten years, then a hundred years. We will not stop for a day until we achieve our goal. How are we going to work hard? We must work hard in response to the situation of × people. Today's × people are just as Sun Tzu said, "The high officials are angry and disobedient, and they fight on their own when they encounter opposition. The generals do not know their ability, and they collapse day by day." Knowing this, we must use our unity and solidarity to deal with the arrogance and chaos of × people, and the phenomenon of subordinates overcoming superiors. We know that during the war, the industry of × people is stagnant, and economic loopholes are increasingly exposed. We must give full play to the characteristics of our agricultural country, be frugal and economical, and persevere to deepen the weaknesses of the industrial country of × people. We know that the great desire of × country is to fundamentally destroy the economic foundation of our nation. We must step up the enrichment of all our wartime construction and cultivate the strength for sustained resistance to cause a crisis of social collapse in × country. We know that since last year, natural disasters have been prevalent in × country, with continuous military disasters and floods, coupled with constant major earthquakes, which have caused the people forced to fight in their country to suffer particularly. We should use our advantages of heavenly time and geographical location to step up agricultural production to counter the shortcomings of the island country that is constantly facing natural and man-made disasters. We know that the suffering of the people of × country is deepening day by day, and the anti-war consciousness of the × country's government, which has no virtue in its rule, is growing stronger day by day. We must truly implement our Three Principles of the People to fight the × people's cruel and self-harming militarism.

In short, our main task today is to use spirit to overcome matter, use diligence and thrift to make up for deficiencies, use redoubled efforts to make up for past procrastination, and use a sacrificial determination and a belief in victory to make up for our lack of weapons and modern military equipment. Comrades, you must also recognize the responsibility of our party to the country, and the responsibility of party members to the revolution. Such a gathering in the midst of the tense War of Resistance is not an easy thing. We must make this plenary session a firm and concrete plan for the second phase of the War of Resistance. We ourselves must also establish before the portrait of our Founding Father the will to be responsible, to fulfill our duties, and to fight to the end, to implement the party's resolutions, to respect the party's discipline, to consolidate the party's foundation, and to fulfill the party's mission. We do not need to pay attention to how many branch difficulties there are during the War of Resistance. We should always ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled our responsibilities. There is no self-improving and self-reliant revolutionary party in the world that cannot lead the revolution to success, nor is there a nation with a long history, a vast territory, a large population, and a deep foundation that cannot seek complete independence, equality, and freedom. Comrades, our creed, "self-reliance," is our motto. As long as we can do it, be capable, be quick, be tough, be hard-working, and be practical, there is no reason why we will not succeed. Today, with the most enthusiastic and sincere spirit, I hope for the success of this plenary session, and I wish the success of our great cause of resisting the war, building the country, and revolution! (End)

### Northwest Journey Continued

— Mai Yeyu

At nine o'clock, the car advanced towards the leading carriageway, the road was rugged and uneven, and the passengers suffered greatly. At eleven o'clock, we reached Gan Cao Dian, a village of a hundred households, with soldiers stationed there, and the passengers all stopped there for a snack. Rice was fifteen cents a bowl, and the only vegetable was cabbage, which was hard to swallow. Traveling west, I saw a basin of about seventy li in circumference, the only plain I had seen from Xianyang to here. The car sped along, and the passengers' heads collided with the car roof. One person wearing a felt cap even punched a hole in the army hood. At that time, the passengers all called for a reduction in speed to prevent danger, but to no avail. In an instant, we passed through Donggang Town, with the plain in sight, and the Yellow River like a belt, winding westward, only twenty li away from Lanzhou. At 2:30, we arrived at Lan Jie.

The Xilan Road is 753 kilometers long and takes five days to reach. This road was built by the National Economic Council for 1.4 million yuan. Nine-tenths of the roadbed is clay, and several of the crossbeams are made of wooden frames. Whenever the rainy season comes, the road and bridges are often washed away by water. This road line is the roadbed built by Zuo Wenxiang when he conquered Zhun'er, and during the Shaanxi-Gansu drought, the Chinese and foreign relief associations rebuilt the old road. The vast projects of the Liupan Family and the Huajialing Family were all built by the association. Before the Xilan National Road was realized, there were already merchants operating passenger and cargo transportation to the east, and the word "National" was only an epoch-making event.

Seeing the stationmaster's two faces to the mechanics and passengers on the road is really "laughable and absurd." The station is equipped with a dining hall, and the waiters and attendants of the hotel are all building frames. The mechanics regard themselves as having a high position. If they greet them, the minimum is to call them "Mr.". I remember at Dingxi Station, the passengers called him a "driver" when asking when the car would leave, which caused a conflict and almost led to a fight.

Ten Days in Lanzhou

Lanzhou is located in a basin surrounded by the West Qinling Mountains, more than 4,000 feet above sea level, and the land belongs to the alpine and cold zone. Because it is shielded by the Gaolan Mountain in the south and the White Pagoda Mountain in the north, the geographical environment is special, and the climate is quite different from that of the south of the Yangtze River. The surrounding countryside benefits from the irrigation of the Yellow River, which is very suitable for cultivation, but cannot be self-sufficient. In addition, jujube and pear trees form forests, spread all over the countryside; the most famous is water tobacco.

In terms of commerce, Lanzhou is the transportation hub of the northwest provinces. Goods from Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Tibet to the mainland, and goods from within the customs to the northwest provinces, all pass through Lanzhou for unloading and transfer, and commerce is prosperous. Every year during the fur season, merchants from all over the country gather here. In recent years, many young people within the customs have come to the west in the sound of developing the northwest, seeking new environments, and Lanzhou has become the center of their activities. In order to meet the needs of the market, the number of shops, hotels, restaurants, and warehouses has increased several times compared to before. In the past, the people of Lanzhou had never seen movies, electric lights, and southern goods, but now they have everything they need, but the prices are extremely high, with bananas selling for five cents each. The population has increased from tens of thousands to 120,000; the land is high and cold. In the northwest, where the land is sparse and the population is sparse, Lanzhou is the most densely populated metropolis. Undoubtedly, she is the Shanghai of our northwest provinces.

In the sound of developing the northwest, Lanzhou has become a prosperous city; but the streets are pitifully small, and some streets are actually four feet lower than the entrances of the shops, and the width is only enough for one car to pass through. The only new-style building is the Lishi Society. Traveling in Lanzhou, food and accommodation are easily solved. Most of the restaurants are Tianjin restaurants, and each meal costs no more than forty or fifty cents. For accommodation, the Jiangsu, Longhai, and Ganlu hotels are the best. In addition to beds (without bedding) and sandalwood benches, there is nothing else in the room. The Qilu Hotel has the cheapest room rates.

The Zhenyuan Bridge across the Yellow River in the north of the city is the main road to Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia. The bridge was built in 19099, and the two ends of the overseas Chinese are inscribed with "Two Sides Benefit" and "Nine Curves Peaceful 安", which were written by Peng Yingjia, Lanzhou Road in the late Qing Dynasty. The water flows rapidly under the bridge, like thousands of horses racing, and I suddenly feel a surge of ambition. The north end of the bridge is the White Pagoda Mountain, which is also a famous scenic spot.

### Today's Caroline Hill: South China vs. Hong Kong Football Club; Middlesex vs. Kwong Wah at So Kon Po Ground

Today, a total of eleven matches will be played in the First, Second, and Third Divisions of the Football League. In the First Division, South China will face Hong Kong Football Club at Caroline Hill, and Middlesex will play Kwong Wah at So Kon Po Ground. These two matches are more eye-catching than the others. South China has returned yesterday from its expedition to Sai Kung. However, the players have been continuously participating in major battles and are inevitably injured and fatigued. Therefore, in today's match, reserve players may be deployed as replacements. Although South China was the champion last season, it has suffered several losses this season, and its performance is lagging behind. Hong Kong Football Club is originally a foreign team and does not have much to show, but it will never relax in every match against Chinese teams. Whether South China can win is unpredictable. Kwong Wah's players have been quite vigorous recently and do not dwell on winning or losing. This time, they may have a chance against the American team because the American team's good players, Watson and Corolla, have been recalled to their country, and their strength has been greatly reduced. Therefore, Kwong Wah can fight them. (South China)

### Alice Marble's Secrets to Tennis Success (3): Courtship

Another point to practice carefully is that when Barnes hits a forehand, his body must turn with the momentum, so his right rib, right shoulder, and right arm are all available for a completed shot. For a moment after the shot, he advances towards the net with the momentum. At first glance, it seems as if he is about to throw the racket at the ball. When he swings the racket with the aftereffect, the force seems very light. From this, we can know that the period when he grips the racket tightly is only for a moment when it comes into contact with the ball. Before and after touching the ball, he does not grip the racket with force.

Many people who play tennis face a difficult problem, which is sweaty hands during the game. Many people think that this is an incurable fatal flaw. However, from my experience, I think this point can be solved. That is, do not grip the racket tightly when not hitting the ball. Many people think that when playing a game, the racket must always be held tightly, but this is a huge mistake. You must know that the racket only needs to be gripped tightly for a moment when the racket and the ball come into contact. If you always hold the racket tightly when playing, it is a waste of energy. Even if you hold the racket tightly at the beginning of the swing, it will reduce the power of the racket when it comes into contact with the ball. This should be absolutely noted and improved.

Therefore, whether you use a backhand, a forehand, or even serve or smash, you should not grip the racket too tightly during the initial force or after the swing. Even when volleying in the air, you should not grip the racket tightly before and after touching the ball. However, when striking, the wrist should be tightened when preparing to strike. If you can improve according to this, you will not only avoid wasting energy, but also reduce hand sweat.

Regarding the backhand, I think it is better to use the Continental grip than to use the method of holding the back of the handle with your thumb, because with the latter method, you will have to touch the ball at a point farther away than your right foot. If you use the Continental grip, you can wait until the ball comes to the front of your left foot before hitting it. In this case, if you use the Continental grip to hit a backhand, your fingers holding the racket can be farther apart, and you can get more control over a longer reach.

Even when intercepting a ball deliberately hit by the opponent that flies past you at a long distance, I think it is best to use the Continental grip to save it. Because in this way, the position of your feet does not need to change, and you can still maintain a position parallel to the net. You only need to turn your body to return the ball straight to the baseline or sideline at will. When hitting this kind of ball, you only need to pay attention to hitting hard with the wrist and arm holding the racket. If the racket swings too much, the ball will only fly over the net and fly towards the opponent at a height that makes it difficult to hit. Of course, after hitting it slightly in front of your right foot, the aftereffect of the hit will naturally cause the racket to point towards the net, and the ball will have a slight spin and fly towards your right.

According to my careful observation, many female tennis players hit better backhands than forehands. The reason for this is that the footwork is not as complicated as when hitting a forehand. Especially when hitting a forehand, the movements of the upper body, shoulders, ribs, arms, wrists, and racket must be considered and become important issues. Moreover, the upper body must also rotate to the left with the right shoulder. This is something that ordinary female players often cannot do well.

### A Record of Welcoming the Team at Sea

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The night before last, I drank a large cup of coffee and stayed awake all night. However, I was also worried about an important matter in my heart, fearing that I would miss the departure time. Therefore, I used this stimulating drink to drive away the Sandman.

At 7:00 AM, I put on my clothes and went out, strolling to Queen's Pier. I saw white mist like smoke and light sails chasing shadows, a wonderful scene that did not resemble late winter. As for the people who came to welcome the South China team's return, besides me, there was also Brother Kak-ho. Because it was still early, many people had not arrived yet.

I paced back and forth, and every second was in harmony with the sound of our footsteps.

At 8:00 AM, Luk Cheuk-fung, Hung Yan-chau, Lo Hap-fu, Leung Yin-chan, Chan Yu-cheong, Mr. and Mrs. Yeung Wing, Mrs. King Cheung, Mrs. Lau Hing-choi, Miss Mok, and others arrived one after another and greeted each other with good morning.

'Uncle Luk' said: 'I have sent off and welcomed the South China football team many times.' He laughed as he spoke. This old man has a deep relationship with South China and is also an enthusiastic person.

At 8:30 AM, we got on a small launch. After another ten minutes, 'Uncle' Lo urged us to set sail. Ah Cheung said, 'I met Miss Yip (the girlfriend of Mak Shiu-hon) on the way, who said that she would come with 'Heavenly King' Tai -, so it is better to wait a little longer.' Uncle said that the Chinese should be punctual and would miss the time if they were late. So with a whistle, the launch set sail.

Just a hundred yards away from the pier, we saw Mrs. Heavenly King, Miss Yip, and another lady coming slowly, waving to us, obviously in a hurry. So we ordered the launch to approach the shore again to provide convenience. 'Uncle Chan' said, 'What's the matter with being late? Rouge always delays things.' Hearing this, I suddenly remembered the last two sentences of 'Resentment of Zhao Jun', 'If the emperor had the same appearance as this concubine, he would not say that it is not as good as in the palace.' Therefore, beauty is indeed precious to women.

After a short 20-minute voyage, we reached our destination. The 'Guangdong' ship had already anchored at 8:30 AM.

Uncle Luk raised his voice and shouted, 'Come on, South China!' 'Military Advisor' Mok stood on the deck and responded by waving his hat. Looking down, Kwok Ying-ki, Lau Wai-pui, and others were wearing 'French' style small hats and stood on the ship's railing. We could hardly recognize each other. A certain gentleman said, 'This is the only souvenir they brought back from the expedition.'

The welcoming party boarded the ship in an orderly manner, shaking hands and exchanging greetings, and asking about football matters.

After busily carrying 'luggage' for a while, we got off the small launch together to pick up the returning team.

Military Advisor Mok said to me, 'This southern tour was very impressive. I was very grateful for the warm hospitality of the Sai Gon and Yu Bian teams. As for the football skills of that country, they are very advanced, but our team lost three times because the players were too injured and tired, which had a great impact. Especially Li Tin-sang and Mak Shiu-hon were injured but still forced to play. Otherwise, we would not have lost the last two games.'

With laughter and conversation, the launch had already docked. Kak-ho and I said goodbye to the players and left. The record of the matches is as follows:

1st Match: Won 7-4 against the French team

2nd Match: Won 4-2 against the Xinlong team

3rd Match: Won 5-1 against the Police team

4th Match: Won 4-1 against the My Tho team

5th Match: Won 4-2 against the Southern First Division team

6th Match: Lost 1-3 to the Southern Second Division team

7th Match: Won 4-2 against the Police United team

8th Match: Won 5-2 against the Phnom Penh team

9th Match: Lost 1-2 to the Sai Gon team

10th Match: Lost 3-4 to the Hanoi team

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment...First Love

Love Finds Andy Hardy

Every film about Judge Hardy's family can give the audience a fresh interest. These films are full of authenticity and can reasonably express a lot of interesting life experiences. The depiction is so realistic that the audience can personally experience everything in the film and be moved by the family's joys and sorrows. The current "First Love", the fourth Judge Hardy film, has a very profound and realistic portrayal of the love psychology of young men and women. Andy (played by Mickey Rooney) is busy with love, juggling between three women, one is the one he truly loves, one is the one his friend asked him to take care of, and the other is a sincere and enthusiastic friend who gives him a lot of help. At the same time, the family is encountering an unfortunate event, Andy's grandmother is seriously ill and her life is uncertain. His mother leaves to serve her family. In this situation, they are preparing to spend a dull Christmas, but suddenly the mother comes back with good news, giving them a "joyful" gift, and the family spends a joyful Christmas.

Mickey Rooney is particularly energetic in this film and has achieved better results than in previous films. Lewis Stone, who plays a resolute and sincere elder, is the most outstanding character in this film. In addition to the original cast, a singing child star, Judy Garland, has been added. Her sincere and moving expression and clear and pleasant singing also occupy an important position in this film.

Queen's Peace Model Paris Conference

Artists and Models Abroad

Is the first comedy in 1939 with excellent sound and color, starring Jack Benny and Joan Bennett, with a lively and interesting theme, excellent and beautiful sound and color, and crazy and humorous acting, giving the audience unlimited relaxation and pleasure. Undoubtedly, this film is a delightful masterpiece.

Jack Benny leads a large group of American models who are trapped in Paris but have no money. Later, they meet the daughter of an American oil tycoon in a coffee shop, who is short of cash. They mistakenly believe that she is also a girl stranded in a foreign country like them, so they invite her to join their group. This wealthy lady, who is used to a luxurious life, agrees to find excitement and fun. So they live a life of no fixed place to stay, no fixed food to eat, and messing around everywhere. As a result, the lucky Jack Benny is loved by this rich lady.

The cast in this film is also quite complete, including the Yacht Quartet and a large group of beautiful actresses. The fashion show scene is extremely magnificent and can be called the most valuable advantage of this film.

Oriental...Spain Locked Up

Blockade

Is a film depicting the activities of traitors during the war, but on the one hand, it is to expose the sins and cruelty of war. This may be a point that the author pays special attention to.

Although there are no great war scenes inside, several scenes are vivid enough. The director uses very lively and powerful shots to reflect the traces of the war zone and the situation of the people in the blockade zone who are dying.

Henry Fonda and Madeleine Carroll also perform their duties.

Dahua...Car Front Detective

Tip-off Girls

Although it is a detective film, the performance is not tense enough, and the director has no skillful methods to make it lively and vivid, so the results are not very good.

This film tells the story of a detective who joins a gang of thieves to spy on secrets, thus capturing the thieves in one fell swoop and the lovers finally getting married. This kind of clichéd story is not easy to please the audience without exciting scenes. The main actors, such as Lloyd Nolan and Mary Carlisle, also have mediocre acting skills.

New World...The Real and Fake Wu Zetian

Cantonese film

A commodity that wants to use sexy and sensual elements as a gimmick is centered on a stage celebrity with a strange and obscene nature and uses her role as Wu Zetian on stage and her荒淫私生活 as a description material. The content is strange and unbelievable, but it may cater to low-level tastes. The so-called sexy and sensual scenes are not thorough enough, which only disappoints the 'fuzzy' audience. Ordinary audiences find it disgusting.

### 128 Memorial

— Yuan Shuipai

At that time, I was in a county town on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The flames of war in Zhabei caused this town to tremble immediately. In less than a week, the more than thirty miles of city walls had been built into strong fortifications, with winding and long trenches, newly repaired city walls, and dozens of miles of tunnels with complete electrical and telephone lines. Inside the city, student-led organizations had prepared for the invasion of Japanese warlords and were working hard separately.

The people in Zhabei, Miaohang, Wusong, and the three counties of Taijiabao did not know why the Japanese marines came to burn and kill. "Protecting overseas Chinese" was a worn-out excuse, and this time it was also to 'protect' 12,000 Japanese residents in Hongkou. The cannons on the warships were fired at Taicang and Jiading, which were hundreds of miles away. However, from then on, we saw the arrogant and brutal face of the imperialists more clearly. The 'term' of 'long-term resistance' had to be shortened. The tanks and machine guns of the invaders could only be answered with our flesh and blood and weapons.

January 28th of the Republic of China's 21st year is now seven years ago. A child born seven years ago should be grown up today. China has shown a leap forward and progress in these short years. The 128 Incident opened a new page in the history of the new China. It made the whole world recognize the heroic posture of the new China. She was no longer compromising, self-pitying, weak and able to be slaughtered at will. The new weapons boasted by the Japanese warlords, the crystallization of decades of preparation, began their first experiment, but it was also a damp experiment with the first cannon. The strong resistance of the 19th Route Army exposed all the corruption and weakness of the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps, and these 'long-lasting martial arts' imperial armies. 'Occupying Shanghai in four hours' became an 'immortal' joke in history.

The 128 Incident gave the people of the whole country a new belief. After the July 7th Incident and the re-emergence of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, we strengthened our will - the belief that the war of resistance will be won, which cannot be said to have not started from this. At the same time, the international view has also changed because of this glorious record, eliminating the psychology of despising the Chinese. The shadow of the big fat man with braids and drooping hair, which had been deeply ingrained, was brushed off their minds, replaced by the image of energetic, strong, and promising young people.

In the streets of Zhabei, in Wusong, Miaohang, Yanglin, and Sidian, should the heroic souls who died in these rivers and rice fields rest in peace today? Countless risers in China are striding forward, following their path, towards the goal of victory. They no longer have humiliating ceasefire agreements to chew on their beliefs. The appeasementists who lost their integrity halfway can only hold the epitaph of compromise and betrayal of the country to the grave. Apart from gaining the notoriety of a traitor, they will not get anything else and cannot hinder this solemn procession from running forward.

The tombs of the martyrs have once again fallen into the hands of × people, is the 19th Route Army monument under Baiyun Mountain unharmed? To commemorate them, we should speed up our steps.

### Seventh Anniversary

— Lin Ling

The "January 28th Incident" is a torch,

Scalding the blood of all Chinese sons and daughters,

Burning away all the stale,

Self-deprecating thoughts;

Illuminating the Chinese nation's

Limitless

Bright future—

The "January 28th Incident" is a trumpet, blowing out moving music,

Seeking survival,

Striving for freedom and liberation,

Only struggle!

Only resolute struggle!

The "January 28th Incident" is a song,

Singing out the Chinese nation's desire for survival,

Singing out that we are not lambs,

Singing out our

Great

Heroic

Sacrificial fighting spirit,

Like steel!

Look, the fire has been burning for seven years!

Listen, the trumpet has been blowing for seven years!

Listen, the song has been singing loudly for seven years!

Now, the facts declare to the world:

The fire—has become the beacon fire of resistance,

The trumpet—has become the bugle call of resistance,

The song! Sings the triumph of the national revolution

We firmly believe there will be such a day,

This fire will be hotter than the sun,

This trumpet sound will surpass thunder,

This song's melody will reverberate throughout the East and West!

At that time, our Chinese nation

Will compete with diamonds in steadfastness,

And contend with the sun and moon for longevity!

### Travel Notes from the March

— Li Huiying

Without a doubt, the teahouse owner, seeing our expressions, guessed that we had expended effort and kindly pointed it out to us, fearing we wouldn't understand:

"They are 'eating government rice,' bosses, understand?"

He said it very quietly, as if just hearing those fellows would cause him to suffer losses.

"Ah!"

We turned away, no longer watching, but took the opportunity to ask the kind owner.

"Is there no one to control this group of people?"

"Control?" He glanced around quietly, "Who dares to control them? People can't even avoid them fast enough."

"Then they are too harmful to the local area."

"Who says they aren't? There's nothing to be done, the countryside truly has its own suffering."

Just then, the quarreling group seemed to have reached a mutual understanding and dispersed peacefully, even exchanging friendly greetings as they parted:

"See you tomorrow, see you tomorrow."

"Bosses, the tea is hot!" The little girl brought up a pot of boiling hot tea.

5 On the Kongzi River

Walking mountain valley paths has a unique flavor. No matter how far you walk, you can't escape the embrace of the mountains. Following the winding path in the valley, that path continues to stretch forward. Woodcutters carry loads of pine branches, the pine branches red, looking from afar like carrying two big bundles, one after another walking down the mountain. When they meet our troops, even though burdened with heavy loads, they go far out of their way to the field ridges, staring with simple and surprised eyes.

"Fellow villager, how much does a load of firewood sell for?"

"Three or four dimes."

"The price of two rickshaw rides."

The value of labor in the countryside is cheap, just as firewood in the countryside is also cheap.

There are not many households in the valley, so you rarely see people, and because this is a small road, even fewer people travel on it.

Comrades raise their voices in song, the valley echoes with mixed sounds, wild sparrows are startled, flying around in the valley and on the mountaintops.

From afar, we see a village half-hidden behind the mountains, and from a cluster of tile-roofed houses, a red and white rooftop stands out, looking like a church steeple.

Opening the itinerary and looking it over, we know we are almost at the Kongzi River. Regarding this place name, it feels quite unusual—why is it called this name? Did it have some relationship with Confucius in the past? That's right, this place in Hubei is the old territory of the State of Chu? Perhaps our old master traveled around the kingdoms and passed through this place. (To be continued)

### "Inspire People's Ambition"

— Fei Bai

The primary purpose of our writing lies in expressing the truth we have grasped, to influence readers. Using positive truth to influence readers, that is "inspiring people's ambition." Right now, we should further emphasize this meaning, so as to unleash the combat power of the pen and reveal the weaponry of literature and art.

Based on this understanding, we must use real-life events as writing subjects, expanding the field of vision from the self to look out at the vast surroundings. Reality is varied and ever-changing, full of writable material. As long as we broaden our life's horizons, we will never feel a lack of material.

The phenomena of so-called "good enough" and "eight-legged essays of the war of resistance" are due to the author's lack of in-depth life experience, superficial and not reaching the core. The way to correct this is to observe reality more, study reality more, and live earnestly. We should not forget that art is nothing other than a reflection of life, and its life is truth.

In order to achieve the goal of "inspiring people's ambition," we must have the power to move people. Empty shouting, even with all one's might, has little effect. Only by realistically and vividly bringing reality to paper can we give people a deep and undiminished impression, so we are also opposed to slogan-style works. We are not rigidly recounting, but vividly depicting, which requires artistic processing, that is, to be figurative. As a famous person said, "A person's character is not only expressed in what he does, but also in how he does it." To express "typical characters in typical environments," then it can be like a morning drum and evening bell, inspiring profound reflection.

Know that there is no third way but either battle or humiliation. And if we do not write works that "inspire people's ambition," objectively, it will inevitably produce a negative and harmful effect, causing people to ignore the difficult reality. This is definitely not what every conscientious author wants to do. Therefore, with twelve thousand points of sincerity, I hope that every author can actively take on the task of combat, forging that pen as sharp as a dagger, a bayonet, dividing light from darkness, dignity from shamelessness. And the lighthearted singing should stop. We must shout out the voice of the era, and be a singer of the nation.

### Some Things About the Eighth Drama Troupe

— Wang Ping

Accompanying Training Class

Whenever we go to a place, as long as we start working, there are always many young comrades who ask to join our team, and they are so sincere: "I must join, I can endure hardship, and I will definitely abide by the discipline of the group, otherwise, I have no work to do, and I will be bored to death!"

Such things really make us not know what to do. To agree, in fact, is impossible. Not to agree, look at that enthusiastic face and heart. Later, we thought of a way: participation is possible, but first, there must be a trial period, and it must be organized.

In this way, we held two accompanying training classes.

The first time was with six cadres from the anti-enemy support association's propaganda team. Their goal was to learn acting and general propaganda skills.

Based on our conversations with them and a general explanation from the introducer, we learned about their intellectual level and political awareness, and then we formulated a training outline, roughly divided into theoretical and technical. The theoretical part particularly emphasized the unified front and the understanding and application of emerging drama; the technical part focused on the coordination of performance, singing and writing, oral painting, and team organization. At the same time, they participated in all our meetings, lived with us, worked together, and selected a few suitable scripts to rehearse with them, teaching them to sing.

During this period, we told them the importance and convenience of "people from their hometown doing work in their hometown," hoping that they would return to their hometown to carry out work, and thus overcome their idea of joining our team.

The second time was with several lower-level cadres from the anti-Japanese volunteer army. Their squadron leader had worked in the Red Army in the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei border area, and some of them had also been politically influenced in this way. They had a considerable understanding of hating Japan, and what they wanted to learn was the theory of guerrilla tactics and methods of educating soldiers. This really made it difficult for us to handle. Fortunately, among our team members, almost all of them had experience in national salvation work before the war of resistance. After the war of resistance, they also paid considerable attention to the general work techniques of strategy and tactics, so we agreed.

They also lived and worked with us. The training subjects were almost the same, but more suitable for soldiers, adding a course on guerrilla warfare research. We specially wrote a one-act play for them (with the guerrilla team as the central theme, which is now our widely performed "Dear Brothers"). In the training method, we paid attention to individual talks, and specially selected several team members to be specifically responsible for managing their lives and education. In this way, it was much more practical than completely focusing on meetings as before.

Now, we have also stipulated a method for "reserve team members." Our team members equally deduct a part of their living expenses to provide for young friends who want to join us and whom we also need, but not exceeding the quota set by the political department (30 people). When our old teammates leave for other work, we will select from them to fill the vacancy. Usually, they still work and live the same as the official teammates.

Instructor

Many organizations ask us to stay in their place for a longer period of time to help them with their work. This is of course impossible and unnecessary; therefore, the method of "instructor" was conceived; selecting team members with considerable work ability who may temporarily leave the team, and sending them to organizations that need help to assist them in their work. On the one hand, this can strengthen other organizations, and on the other hand, it can practice one's own leadership ability. - The person sent is called the "instructor" and returns to the team after a considerable period of time.

[Stakhanov] Style Script Production

"Script shortage" is rampant throughout the country, and we are naturally no exception, and external organizations and individuals often come to ask for scripts. - Especially in Tongcheng, we organized two children's drama troupes, but without scripts, the drama department launched a Stakhanov movement for writing scripts; the drama department announced the urgency of needing scripts, stipulated several topics, and sorted out outlines, introducing reference materials, and team members volunteered to choose topics, sign up to participate, and submit their papers within a limited period. After submission, the drama department convened a discussion meeting, first the author explained the structure, then other comrades read aloud, and then, the discussion began, until the revision.

Joining of a New Teammate

When working in Hengshan Nanyue in Hunan, Mr. Chen, who worked at China Travel Service, felt the significance of our work and his own need to abandon the empty life of amateur work, and asked to join our work. We felt that his life had always been quite privileged, and were afraid that it would not be suitable for our kind of life. At the same time, considering that it was a momentary impulse, and there was no correct understanding, we launched a discussion in the team; investigating his past, reviewing his life, and how his ideals were ... At the same time, we checked the strength of the group, whether it needed such a comrade, and whether it could be made healthy after he joined. We also sent comrades to have several individual talks with him, and put forward the necessary conditions for participating in the work, until we knew that he did have the determination to abandon the corrupt life of the petty bourgeoisie and devote his whole body and mind to the revolution of national liberation - and the team also needed such a general affairs person to make a decision on his participation. Almost every new comrade's participation has to go through these steps.
