### The Future of the Mutual Assistance Agreement Between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France

British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds presented a new proposal for a tripartite mutual assistance agreement to the Soviet Union the day before yesterday and held talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for more than an hour. In Moscow, it is generally believed that after an agreement is reached, the agreement will be signed in Moscow. French Chargé d'affaires Payart also went with Seeds and delivered a reply, the content of which is said to be the same as the British reply. Although the Soviet Union is still studying the replies from Britain and France, the general opinion in Moscow is optimistic about the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. Observers on the Soviet side believe that if the draft of this tripartite mutual assistance agreement is consistent with the original proposed meaning, the Soviet Union can naturally accept it.

Judging from the current situation, the alliance between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France is developing to a higher level. We have often analyzed the development of the European situation in the past, and it will inevitably objectively promote the realization of the alliance between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France; the formal conclusion of this alliance is only a matter of time. Perhaps some people see Chamberlain's hesitation and ambiguity and think that the future of the alliance between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France is very bleak. But we have always been optimistic. Our reasons are: First, the international situation has developed to the era of alliances on the eve of the World War, and the development of diplomatic relations between countries is increasingly concentrated on the aspect of alliances: Second, the coalition of the three aggressor countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, is ahead of the coalition of the anti-aggression group, which is a great threat to countries such as Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, and is a driving force for their alliance: Third, Japan, the aggressor in the East, has recently become even more reckless, ignoring international law and blockading the Chinese coast. London regards this action by Japan as a challenge to European and American powers, especially Britain, which makes it even more necessary for Britain and France to complete the anti-aggression front in Europe as soon as possible in order to take into account the Eastern issue.

From the perspective of the Far East, although Japan has not officially joined the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan on the surface, this is just a sinister diplomatic strategy of Japan. Their veteran group of senior officials, who are experienced and cunning, is strongly opposed to joining the German-Italian military alliance rashly now, which would only increase Japan's difficulties in the Far East. However, the international situation is developing, and the collusion of the three aggressors, Germany, Italy, and Japan, will eventually reach the point it should reach. Japan is now actually implementing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Italy, which has military significance, and it is inevitable that it will formally join the military alliance in the future. The recent stimuli given to Britain, France, and the United States by the Japanese army can no longer conceal the deception of Japanese diplomacy and the inevitable practices in the future. The alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is more likely to be realized soon, and it will naturally be related to the Far East.

Perhaps some people mechanically argue that the contradiction between the capitalist system and the socialist system outweighs the contradiction between the democratic countries' group and the fascist group, and therefore are pessimistic about the cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, or even say that the alliance between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France is impossible. But this commits a very serious conceptual error, because (1) the opposition between the two systems is, at this stage, an ideological opposition, while the opposition between Germany, Italy, and Britain and France is a practical opposition. The colonies that Germany and Italy first demand are pointed at Britain and France. Britain and France, even if they have ideological contradictions with the Soviet Union, are in a situation where their interests are consistent in reality. (2) The attack on the Soviet Union by Germany and Italy is still at the stage of looking for an excuse from the current point of view. They understand that it is easier to invade Britain and France, and difficult to attack the Soviet Union. Britain and France are relatively "fat" countries compared to the Soviet Union. Aggressors who are accustomed to avoiding the real and attacking the empty will never easily take the risk of not easily achieving their goals and attack the Soviet Union. The people of Britain and France are well aware of the reasons, so contacting the Soviet Union will inevitably become a national policy. This national policy cannot be changed by Chamberlain or others who are suffering from the errors of the times, and the British and French authorities can only move forward along this path. Therefore, cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France is an inevitable trend!

### Chinese Youth Marching Towards Unity

— Special Airmail from Xi'an

Where do we see the forward development of the youth united front? What facts can prove that the youth united front is moving forward!

The development of this united front is manifested in the extensive mobilization of young people for various unified and collective activities. As long as it is a group that does not violate the principles of the united front, a large number of young people participate, because they feel deeply that unity is strength. Those who participate in military organizations, those who participate in various military and political schools and training classes, are no longer hundreds or thousands, but tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.

Old youth groups are constantly transforming themselves to adapt to the new situation, constantly adding the content of national liberation and the united front.

The YMCA and the YWCA were originally religious organizations. Now they are leading a large number of young people to engage in the war of resistance. The achievements of Mr. Liu Liang leading the singing troupe and the military service department can be seen in all provinces of the country and have been praised by people in the accounting profession.

Many zealous young people are now also participating in war activities. In Xinyang, Henan, two thousand young people from the Red Spear Society, led by a college student, originally had a bad relationship with the officialdom. Later, after some youth groups promoted it, they completely integrated with the government and were reorganized by the government into an anti-Japanese guerrilla force.

Old groups are changing, and at the same time, new groups are being created. Since the war of resistance, youth groups have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. These groups are not only numerous, but also develop very rapidly. In Zhejiang, the smallest province in China, according to an incomplete statistic two months ago, 30 youth groups had more than 34,000 people. In North China, because it is completely in a war environment, the development history of youth groups is fast. Yamoto Yuncheng established a Youth National Salvation Association, which developed to more than 11,000 people in one month. The Youth National Salvation Association in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region developed to more than 50,000 members in less than two months.

The scope of youth organizations has been greatly expanded. Not only urban youth have organizations, but also youth in occupied areas have organizations, all the way to overseas Chinese youth. Labor youth, young women, and children are all being organized. Muslim educational youth have established national salvation groups in the Northwest, Central China, and South China. Youth organizations of the Hebei Buddhist Association have organized themselves to carry out guerrilla warfare. Young monks in Shanghai, young monks in Mount Wutai, and young lamas have also strongly participated in the war of resistance.

Not only in terms of composition, but also in terms of the nature of the organization, there are many varieties. There are military and political groups, as well as economic, martial arts, and entertainment organizations. This shows that young people demand unity in all aspects. It also shows that young people of different degrees of awareness all demand unity. The young people who have already united are completely different compared to before the war of resistance.

Most of the Chinese youth were originally unorganized. Therefore, the development of youth organizations shows the development of the youth united front. The rapid development of this organization is an unprecedented step forward in the movement history. Naturally, this still cannot meet the needs of the youth united front. Therefore, various youth groups are constantly carrying out various unified activities.

Youth first tend to unify in action.

The Student Anti-Japanese Support Branch in Xi'an, the National Liberation Vanguard, the Youth Anti-Japanese Association, the Women's Comfort Branch, the Literary Youth Association, and the New Script Promotion Association, in order to promote the establishment of the united front, signed the "Common Activity Program" of the six groups in November of the 26th year. In the winter of the 26th year, the students in Xi'an initiated the task of carrying the wounded soldiers for the government. At that time, the front line in southwestern Shanxi was in a critical situation, and thousands of wounded soldiers arrived at the railway station without anyone caring about them. The problem was very serious, so as soon as someone called for help, it immediately received the response of all the schools and all the students. Men and women worked together, not afraid of the blood of the wounded soldiers, and settled them down overnight. This action not only aroused the praise of all the soldiers and all walks of life, but also made the students in Xi'an fully realize the power of unity.

During the winter vacation, the student groups of various schools united to organize a return-to-hometown work group.

In the spring of the 27th year, the Student Branch, the YMCA, the YWCA, the Muslim Youth Association, the Women's Comfort Branch, the Anti-Japanese Association, the National Liberation Vanguard, the Northwest Youth National Salvation United Association, and more than a dozen other youth groups jointly launched a winter vacation collective march, which was later changed into a wheat-helping movement to help the families of anti-Japanese soldiers and ordinary farmers in the suburbs, and the results were also very satisfactory.

The youth groups in Guangzhou were very divided after the war of resistance. In the commemorative work of the second anniversary of December 9th, they produced a December 9th Commemoration Preparatory Committee centered on schools. However, on the day of December 9th, there were still three commemorative meetings, and each was held at different times and locations. The young people who participated in the meeting that started at 8 o'clock decided to participate in the 10 o'clock commemorative meeting as a whole. After the masses of the two commemorative meetings merged, they jointly decided to merge and hold the commemorative meeting that started at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. At this meeting, the organization of the City Student Anti-Japanese Federation was passed, and people responsible for the preparation were elected on the spot. After the meeting, a very grand parade and demonstration was held.

In April of the 27th year, the Guangzhou youth established the May Fourth Commemoration Joint Preparatory Committee, and the vast number of young people jointly carried out expanded publicity every day from May 1st to May 9th. Then they organized the joint office of the welcoming delegation of the World Student Union to China. When the representatives of the World Student Union arrived in Guangzhou and left Guangzhou to return to their country, they went to the station more than ten miles away from the city in a team to hold a very grand welcome and farewell.

The conference in Kaifeng to commemorate May Day and May Fourth included all the youth groups in Kaifeng; on the day of May Fourth, all the police and security teams also enthusiastically participated in the commemoration.

More than 30 youth groups in Nanchang held a large-scale Nanchang City Student Youth Joint Support War of Resistance and National Construction Propaganda Conference from May 31st to June 3rd of the 27th year. During the day, there were small-team propaganda, disguised speeches, and singing performances. In the evening, there were joint performances by various youth theater groups, and Cheng Shi, Yang Buping, Xiao Chunshi, Wang Zaoshi, Xu Deheng, Shu Yuyu, Sun Yucun, and other people from the upper echelons were invited to speak. There were 20,000 young people from the Association of Chinese and Foreign Relief. The declaration of the conference said:

"In order to save the nation from danger, we must unite like iron throughout China. In order to build a new China and win the war of resistance, we must unite like iron after victory!"

"Consolidate and expand the national war of resistance front, promote national construction work, and insist on resisting the war to the end!"

When the representatives of the World Student Union came to Nanchang, the young people of Nanchang held a mass meeting to welcome the World Student Union.

The Wenzhou Wartime Youth Service Corps, the Student Anti-Japanese United Association, the Cultural Circle Anti-Japanese Association, and other five groups established a friendship discussion group after the anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. They often cooperated in the work of the War of Resistance and jointly convened a grand meeting to comfort the families of the soldiers on the expedition. Later, all the youth groups in Wenzhou, and even the county party headquarters, the county government, the political department of the local garrison, and the local people's anti-Japanese self-defense committee, sent representatives to participate in their symposium.

The youth's tendency towards unity is more manifested in the organization.

The Congress of the Chinese Student National Salvation Federation held in Wuhan in March of the 27th year was attended by student unions from 14 major universities across the country, major student groups from 16 provinces, student groups from the guerilla areas behind the enemy lines, the Christian Student Federation, and student groups from overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places. At the opening ceremony, President Chiang Kai-shek personally sent a handwritten letter. Minister Chen Cheng of the Political Department of the Military Commission personally read it aloud; Chinese Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai and leaders of various parties and governments, military and political leaders of the National Government, and celebrities from all walks of life all attended the meeting, and all the newspapers published special issues. Since this conference, the unity of Chinese students in organization can be said to have laid the foundation.

The students in Guangzhou, after the December 9th Incident in the 26th year, established the City Student Federation after three weeks of effort. It then developed to include student unions from 32 schools. At the beginning of the 27th year, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, the City Student Federation and the Sun Yat-sen University Anti-Japanese Vanguard, the Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Middle School Anti-Japanese Vanguard, the Youth Group Society, the National Salvation Call Society, the Anti-Japanese Youth Avant-Garde Group, the Pingjin Alumni Association, the Liu Dong Alumni Association, and other youth groups jointly organized the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Avant-Garde. In half a year, the Youth Anti-Japanese Avant-Garde added 15 new units. At the end of July of the 27th year, the youth in Guangzhou established a Youth Group Work Coordination Association, which united all the youth groups in the city.

The Xi'an Student Branch in Shaanxi, the Shaanxi Branch of the Women's Comfort Association, the Northwest Youth Anti-Japanese Association, the Northwest Youth Anti-Japanese Avant-Garde, and other youth groups, under the guidance of the Shaanxi Party and government authorities, established the National Youth Anti-Japanese General Northwest Branch in mid-June of this year. Although it has not been able to unite all the major youth groups in the Northwest, it is still a progress in the unity of the Northwest sports. Its program stipulates: "Under the supreme principle of the Three People's Principles, based on the program of the War of Resistance and National Construction, unite all the youth in the Northwest, concentrate forces, eliminate frictions, and expand various anti-war work in a planned and systematic way." "The organization of this association adopts a democratic centralized system." "Under the premise of not violating the unified program and leadership principles, each member group has its independence: each member group can also formulate and implement various specific tasks based on its organizational characteristics and work style, according to the overall program." These provisions are completely correct.

The thirty or so youth groups in Henan, under the leadership of the commander of the First War Zone, also convened a representative conference in mid-June of the 27th year and produced a unified organization called the Henan Youth National Salvation Association. Its organization also adopts the principle of democratic centralism.

Although these organizations cannot be said to be without shortcomings, they unanimously express two facts, that is, Chinese youth are moving towards unification step by step in organization. However, the organizational unity required by Chinese youth cannot be satisfied by this. Chinese youth today urgently demand a nationwide organization that includes youth united front organizations from all parties and all strata.

Several groups have attempted to develop in this direction, but although the brewing of such organizations has already begun, no group has been able to succeed. The establishment of the Three People's Principles Youth League is also a manifestation of this kind of brewing.

The supreme leader of the Three People's Principles Youth League is President Chiang Kai-shek. In June of the 27th year, he said in a letter to the youth of the whole country for the establishment of the Three People's Principles Youth League: "The reason why Chinese youth are serving the country is that there is no other way than to be united with love and sincerity. Not only is it true for our youth; that is, for the members of the general leadership youth group, no matter what party or faction they belong to, those who truly think for the country and the nation must cherish the future of the youth, gather together under the organization of this league, work hard to educate the youth, and work hard to fulfill their destiny." He also said: "The great mission of the league to the country is to gather the youth of the whole country, vigorously implement the program of the War of Resistance and National Construction, and to unite outstanding revolutionary elements to enrich revolutionary vitality. If we can fulfill this great mission, the Three People's Principles will surely be realized, the foreign enemies will surely be cleared away, and an independent and free new China will surely be established." From this, it can be seen that his hope for the Three People's Principles Youth League is precisely to gather and unite outstanding youth from all parties and factions across the country and make it a kind of youth united front organization.

The ideal of the Three People's Principles Youth League to unite youth across the country is correct. We believe that because it originally had this correct ideal, and even more because the youth across the country and the situation of the War of Resistance urgently demand the realization of this correct ideal, it is very likely to carry out its existing mission. We, the youth of the whole country, stand for an organization that supports the youth united front of the whole country, that can practice democracy, and that can absorb and respect the talents and youth of all parties and factions. We believe that the groups and masses represented by the representatives present will certainly be willing to join.

In any case, Chinese youth always demand a nationwide youth united front organization that includes all parties, all factions, and all strata. This is two basic trends. The trend of the Chinese youth movement can only follow this trend and move forward. Even if some small countercurrents occur in China, this basic trend is supported by countless young people, is proven by countless facts, and is absolutely undeniable. (Speech by Feng Wenbin)

### Characteristics of Secondary Vocational Education in the United States - Report on the Content of "Vocational High School" in Omaha by He Qingru

(Shanghai Correspondence) He Qingru of the Chinese Vocational Education Society recently went to study and inspect in the United States and reported as follows. The boundary between secondary vocational education and general education in the United States is not clear. Most general middle schools and vocational schools are established together, and there are very few specialized vocational schools. However, most general middle schools offer vocational subjects to prepare students who cannot go to college for employment. Therefore, the practical trend is very strong. Omaha Vocational High School is the largest vocational subject in the local public middle school. There are about 3,600 students. There is no need to describe the magnificence of the buildings and the thoroughness of the equipment. Just list a few characteristics of its content, which may be a reference for vocational education in our country.

New Student Exploration

When students first enter middle school, it is difficult to determine their ambitions. If they must distinguish between general and vocational, it is inevitable to make mistakes. Moreover, there are many types of occupations. Even if they decide to seek employment, it is difficult to determine one type when they enter school. The curriculum of the first year of the school (most middle schools in the United States still have a four-year system) is mostly exploratory in nature. There is no need to select a subject, nor is there a need to distinguish between going to college and seeking employment. In addition to required subjects such as English, sociology, and physical education, there are many elective subjects, all of which are of a trial nature to determine personal interests. After one year of examination, various subjects can be selected according to personal interests and abilities. The guidance of the school can also be effective here. The courses that can be selected in the first year are as follows: algebra, food, clothing, European history, foundry, freehand drawing, elementary science, general factory work, French, Latin, mechanical drawing, printing, radio, sheet metal, Spanish, woodworking.

Numerous Subjects

There are many occupations available to middle school students, and students' interests are also very complex. Although schools cannot train for all occupations in society at the same time, it seems better to provide facilities for common needs than to provide only one or two subjects for students to choose from. Moreover, the basic training for many subjects is roughly the same, so it is more economical to provide facilities at the same time. The subjects offered by the school are divided into three groups. The subjects of each group are listed below: A. General and business group: art, bookkeeping and accounting, food service (cafeteria hotel), clothing, music, printing, retail art; B. College preparation group: nursing preparation, engineering, liberal arts, liberal arts and secretarial; C. Industrial group: automobile engine, cabinet making, woodworking, drawing, electrical, ironwork and model, machine factory work, radio, sheet metal.

Subject Flexibility

Students decide to enter a certain subject in the first year. Although there are required courses in each subject, such as those who study art must study freehand drawing, there is still room for elective courses. They can study courses in other subjects. Those who are preparing to go to college can also choose bookkeeping and typing in case they cannot go to college. It is not that once they enter school, they are fixed on a path and have no chance to change.

Thorough Guidance

Regarding students' career choices, subject selection, and life problems, in addition to the general counselors in the school who discuss and guide them at any time, every 30 students are guided by a homeroom teacher. The homeroom teachers advance with the students, so they have a very deep understanding of the students' situation over the years. In addition, there are one male and one female teacher for each grade who are responsible for guiding the curriculum problems of the grade. The principal also cares very much about the students and often talks to the students individually. The relationship between students and the school is like that between children and their families. Everything can be discussed. It is by no means a matter of relying on regulations to restrain them.

Use of Testing

At the end of the first year, before students decide on a subject, they undergo various tests, such as intelligence tests, interest tests, and aptitude tests. The guidance of the counselors and the self-examination of the students are all based on the results of the tests, so the guidance is very scientific and the effect is greatly increased.

Work-Study Cooperation

The advanced subjects of vocational subjects, such as woodworking and selling food, all adopt a work-study cooperation system. They attend classes in the morning and engage in practical work in the afternoon. Those who study woodworking are engaged in architectural societies, and those who sell food work in stores. This practical work is all arranged by the chief teachers in charge, who introduce each department's chief teacher and have scheduled times to contact relevant stores, institutions, etc., to understand the actual needs and to promote the school. At the same time, they can implement the connection between supply and demand, and the school and society become one. This method is very effective, and the teachers' responsibilities are also increased.

In short, secondary education in the United States recognizes individual differences and provides facilities that are very active, very flexible, very elastic, and full of the spirit of experimentation. For students, it respects individual personality, emphasizes self-determination, emphasizes discussion, and emphasizes counseling, without any mechanical tendency. Industrial education is a part of the entire education, not an independent department. The purpose of vocational education is to train the basic abilities of all industries so that students have the ability to start work. As for special and detailed training, it needs to be sought from practical experience.

### The Stalemate in Hunan-Hubei War Zone Is Tightening, With the Entire Frontline Showing Signs of Military Mobilizations and a Potential Shift in the Military Focus Towards Hunan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] After being defeated by our forces in their invasion of northern Hubei, the invading enemy forces scattered and fled in different directions. The remnants of the enemy's right flank at Tongbai are currently fleeing towards Xinyang and Yingshan. The enemy's left flank has been under three-sided encirclement by our forces since the 29th, with the focus on Zhongxiang. The enemy's morale is collapsing. After being defeated on the Sui-Zao front, the enemy in the center attempted to encircle and intercept the Dahong Mountains from both the north and south. However, our forces defended the area, preventing the enemy from advancing. A portion of the enemy has now retreated towards Anlu. The enemy's failure in this operation was severe, with heavy casualties among the main forces of their Fujita, Jiang, and Di Di Divisions, as well as Kojima's cavalry brigade. As of now, there are no enemy forces north of Sui-Zao. On the north bank of the Han River, after our attacking forces successively captured the Luohan Temple and Wamiaoji strongholds, they are now advancing north from Zhangjizhuang and Yuekou, joining forces with units crossing the river at [omitted]. Together, they launched an offensive on Tianmen. The enemy has redeployed forces retreating from Sui Zao to reinforce the area, but it has been unable to halt our advance. This defeat of the enemy in northern Hubei is of significant importance. In this operation, our forces adopted a new strategy, implementing an all-out battle. As a result, our forces attacked on all fronts, making it difficult for the enemy's forces deployed in various war zones to maneuver. Furthermore, they have no available units to redeploy from within the country. Therefore, in this encirclement and attack on northern Hubei, the enemy was no longer able to gather more forces, unlike the advance on Xuzhou and Wuhan in the initial stage of the war. This is also the reason for their attack on Xiangfan. This illustrates that the enemy's operations have transitioned from strong to weak, and from flourishing to decline. It can be said with certainty that future enemy offensives will face increasing difficulty. According to military observers, the period from the start of the war to the Battle of Wuhan was the enemy's peak. The retreat from northern Hubei signifies the beginning of their collapse.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 30th] According to Hua Rong telephone reports, on the 24th and 25th of this month, our forces engaged the enemy in fierce battles at Yu Li, Gui Jia Mountain, and Xinkaitang in Yueyang. Our forces achieved a major victory, capturing over 30 enemy light machine guns and killing over 800 enemy soldiers. Our casualties were also in the dozens.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 30th] On the 27th, starting at Chou hour (1-3 AM), our forces launched an attack on the enemy at Nanlinqiao in northern Hunan. After fierce fighting until noon, we recaptured Niupanshan. Subsequently, part of our forces advanced on Shentangpu, cutting off enemy communications. The main force then attacked Nanlinqiao. Simultaneously, a unit of our forces captured Tongpanling and advanced on Nanlinqiao and Baidianqiao, cutting off enemy communications. The main force then attacked Huanghuajian (2 kilometers northeast of Tongpandian).

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] According to reports from various fronts, the battlefield is unusually quiet. Only in the northern Hunan area have Japanese troops repeatedly attempted to cross the river and invade, but without success. Our forces are closely monitoring Japanese troop movements to prevent a sneak attack. However, the Chinese forces in the area are strong enough to counter any enemy scheme. Military observers say that the quiet on the front lines is a sign that the Japanese are planning another major offensive. The likely target is Hunan, as the Japanese have been continuously reinforcing Yueyang in recent days, with the number of troops being difficult to estimate. According to newspapers here, Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to land near Huarong on the northern shore of Dongting Lake but have been repelled. Japanese aircraft are actively operating over Yueyang, indiscriminately bombing nearby cities, towns, and villages every day. Such actions are often a prelude to a military advance. According to reports from Hubei Province, Japanese troops continue to retreat towards Jingshan. After achieving this victory, Chinese troops first consolidated their defenses before advancing eastward. Order has been fully restored in Fancheng and Xiangyang. Dispersed residents have returned home. Even Zaoyang and Suixian, which were recently recaptured but were completely destroyed by artillery fire, are gradually showing signs of life.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 30th] It is reported that the Japanese army's large-scale offensive against Xiangyang and Fancheng, which was launched four weeks ago, has completely collapsed. According to Chinese reports, after a fierce battle, the Japanese army lost 20,000 men and immediately began to retreat in an attempt to reorganize the remnants. The Chinese military attaches great importance to this victory, saying that it will further boost the morale of the front line. At the same time, after this heavy setback, the Japanese army has no ability to invade for the time being, and the Chinese army can at least have three months of quiet time to strengthen the army's strength.

[Our Newspaper, Shaoguan, 30th Special Dispatch] At around 2 PM on the 29th, over 200 enemy troops, including infantry and cavalry, raided the Dafen area of Daojiao in Wancheng. They were fiercely attacked by our Third Guerrilla Brigade during their withdrawal. After an hour of fighting, they retreated, leaving over a dozen corpses behind. We captured a large number of war trophies.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 28th] Enemy chieftain Major General Arakawa was killed by our forces in the recent battle of Jiangmen.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] Military news: On the morning of the 21st, over a thousand enemy troops from the northeast, armed with four mountain guns, arrived in Taikang, eastern Henan. On the same day, a unit of over two hundred enemy troops raided Zhangziying (9 li east of Chang [omitted]) and built fortifications. On the afternoon of the 22nd, they were ambushed by a unit of our forces, resulting in over 30 enemy casualties. On the evening of the 23rd, reinforcements of over seven hundred troops, armed with two guns, arrived. On the morning of the 24th, they advanced in two directions, occupying Fulecheng and Langchengpu, and raided Wuzili with a portion of their forces. They were subsequently attacked from both sides by our advancing forces and fled back along their original route.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 30th] Some commentators here claim that Japan's invasion war has failed due to economic difficulties, depleted financial resources, and strong resistance from Chinese guerrillas.

### Tense Border Situation With Frequent Conflicts

[Reuters, Tokyo, 20th] Today, the Japanese cabinet and the cabinet council held a joint meeting. The Minister of the Army and the Minister of Foreign Affairs attended and reported on the recent conflicts on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia border, saying that there were no more battles on the front line. The puppet "Manchukuo" government claimed that on the previous Sunday (28th), Soviet gunboats on the Ussuri River fired on the puppet [omitted], and they have protested to the League of Nations.

[This Port, 30th External News] According to Japanese sources from Changchun, the situation on the border between puppet Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia is extremely tense. Air battles between the two sides have intensified recently. The Japanese side claims that 59 Soviet aircraft have been shot down in the past nine days. According to Domei News Agency, "Manchukuo" troops and the Kwantung Army have now strengthened their defenses along the border.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] It is reported that regarding the recent border conflict, the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry has lodged a strong protest with the Outer Mongolian government and demanded that Mongolian troops immediately withdraw from the border area.

[Shanghai, 30th Foreign Wire] The Mongolian-Manchukuo border is extremely tense. In the past two days, air and land battles between the two sides have been very fierce. A Shanghai [omitted] spokesperson admitted that the incident was serious, exceeding the previous Zhang [omitted] incident. The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated on the 29th that the Japanese and puppet troops have consistently remained on the defensive, while the Outer Mongolian troops have continuously launched offensives. According to a reporter from the Asahi Shimbun, the Outer Mongolian authorities are very cautious about this matter. The reporter observed 500 Outer Mongolian cavalrymen, accompanied by three guns and 15 armored vehicles, stationed about 15 kilometers west of the Halaha River. At the same time, a large-scale mechanized force was also concentrated south of the river in case of emergency. The Japanese [omitted] considers the border situation serious and converted the consulate office in Chunlin to a consulate general on the 10th of this month. According to sources in puppet Manchukuo, since May 11, disputes have been constantly occurring on the western border, creating an extremely tense situation. The Japanese Kwantung Army will take this as an excuse to join Manchukuo in attacking Outer [omitted]. The fighting on the 29th was extremely fierce. At 11:40 a.m. that morning, Japanese troops and puppet Manchukuo troops launched an offensive against Outer Mongolian troops. Mongolian troops launched a counterattack, with all 1,000 cavalrymen, 10 tanks, 10 guns, and dozens of aircraft launching a swift and overwhelming attack on the Japanese and puppet forces. The Japanese and puppet forces could not withstand the attack and fled in disarray. The Mongolian troops took advantage of the situation to launch a counterattack, directly entering the territory of puppet Manchukuo before withdrawing. The Japanese and puppet forces suffered heavy casualties.

### National Government Orders

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The National Government issued the following orders on the 30th:

(1) Lieutenant Colonel Wu Tiezheng and Wang Longji of the Army Infantry are promoted to Colonel of the Army Infantry. This order.

### Puppet Leader Directs Anger at British Troops, Protests to British Consulate, Which Ignores It

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] News from Shanghai: The "Mayor of Dadao City" of Shanghai, Chuan Xiaoshan, believing that the British troops' landing at the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Pudong "infringed upon the sovereignty of Shanghai City," yesterday lodged a protest with the British Consulate, demanding respect for the "sovereignty" of Shanghai City and that similar incidents not occur again in the future. However, the British side stated that the British government did not recognize the "Dadao Municipal Government" and therefore could not accept any protests. It is reported that since Fu took office, he has lodged more than 12 protests with foreign consulates, but all have been rejected by the other side.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] News from Shanghai: After a labor dispute occurred at the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Pudong, Shanghai, which is owned by a British merchant, the puppet authorities made every effort to instigate it, causing the labor unrest to expand.

### Enemy Imposes Blockade on Our Coast, Effective Tomorrow, Protests Lodged With Various Countries

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 30th] According to a Japanese naval spokesman here yesterday, Japan's blockade of the Chinese coast only applies to Chinese ships. As for foreign ships, if their nationality is clearly marked on the ship and the cargo they carry is not "harmful to Japan", they will not be inspected. If any foreign ships are suspected of violating this or are flying foreign flags falsely, the Japanese military will intercept and search them. After the Japanese military issued the blockade declaration, the Jianghai Customs immediately announced the suspension of the issuance of customs papers for ships transporting goods to the nine ports in the coastal provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian that are still under the control of the Chinese government. This announcement is scheduled to take effect on the first of next month. After the announcement was issued, some people asked whether this was not the intention of a blockade, but the spokesman replied that this was only part of it and that this plan would be implemented by the Japanese Navy.

The ports to be blockaded include Haining in Zhejiang, Haimen and Qidong in Jiangsu, and Quanzhou and Funing in Fujian. The spokesman said that the blockade would be limited to ships departing from Shanghai. Customs offices in these ports will refuse to issue departure certificates for incoming ships to implement the blockade. Ships traveling from Hong Kong will not be restricted. He also said that these customs offices are acting in accordance with Japanese demands, which are based on military necessity.

### Foreign Reporters Inspect the Sui-Zao Frontline, The Ratio of Our Casualties to Enemy Casualties is 7:10, Civilians Calmly Assist Troops in Rescuing the Wounded

[Reuters, County Communication] According to a Chinese military officer at the front to the reporter: The harvest of the Japanese army's months of fierce fighting in Hubei Province is actually of no military value. The Japanese army attempted twice to cross the Han River north of [omitted] and cut off the Yichang-Xiangyang highway, but both attempts failed due to the strength of the Chinese army's defenses. The Japanese army had no choice but to advance north, aiming for [omitted] Yang, which is about 170 miles northwest of Hankou. The Chinese army's positions in the mountains around Sui County were eventually destroyed by the Japanese artillery, and the Japanese army also crossed the plains west of Sui County and reached Zaoyang. However, the Japanese army was exhausted at this point, and the Chinese army began a counter-offensive, recapturing Zaoyang and forcing the Japanese army to retreat eastward. Chinese sources estimate that Japanese casualties are over 20,000, which may be an exaggeration, but after observing the positions around Sui County, it feels that the Japanese casualties of several thousand are not impossible. Therefore, Japanese casualties are often between six thousand and ten thousand.

Xiangyang [omitted] For the activity of mechanized forces, it is [omitted] Although there are mountains to the north, there are few highlands that are good for defense all the way to Sui County. When the reporter arrived in Sui County, he took a car with [omitted] to a certain place outside Zaoyang. Beyond this, the highway has been destroyed. After the reporter stayed overnight at the local transportation headquarters, he took a supply horse to inspect the front line. Along the way, the reporter saw [omitted] people busy with [omitted] because the harvest season was approaching, and the women in the villages were preparing food for the passing troops. When the reporter approached the front line, he saw a group of wounded soldiers, and all the stretchers were carried by farmers. According to reports, this was done entirely voluntarily and without any coercion. When the reporter returned from the front line, he witnessed something that proved that the above statement was not false. At that time, two soldiers were sharing a stretcher. The one in front was small and tired from walking too much, so he stopped by the roadside and asked the farmers nearby for help. The man immediately agreed and carried the stretcher for two miles while the soldier walked behind him to rest.

That night, the reporter was near Sui County. [Omitted] Early the next morning, he rode into the city. The situation in the city was [omitted] rarely seen, because Sui County has been less than three miles from the front line for nearly six months, and shells have fallen from time to time. Moreover, due to repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft, the residents of the city have fled. Artillery fire was loud, and houses were shaken. After the Japanese army began its offensive against northern Hubei, it bombarded the Chinese army positions northeast of Sui County, and the sound of various calibers of artillery fire could be heard clearly. When the shells fired by the Japanese army's six-inch heavy guns landed and exploded, even though they were five miles away, the house where we were located shook. The reporter continued to advance to the front line and arrived at the brigade headquarters, where someone was sent to guide them to visit the front. It is reported that the Japanese army is now attacking the county seat from the northeast and southwest in an attempt to encircle it. Led by a regimental commander, the reporter passed through deep traffic trenches and connecting routes and reached the most advanced machine gun哨位, from which he could see the Japanese positions a hundred meters away. Because the defensive works on both sides of this front line are very strong, the war has been quiet for the past six months. The Chinese army's machine gun posts are well-built and not easily destroyed. Behind the position, there is a strong air-raid shelter for soldiers to hide from air raids and shells. In the ravines in the rear, farmers are engaged in farming. According to the commander of the army stationed there, the houses of these farmers were destroyed by artillery fire, but because we are here, they are all willing to stay. If the artillery fire is too heavy during the day, they will work at night. We have promised to notify them before withdrawing so that they can leave in time. The troops stationed here are all Guangxi troops. They are well-equipped with small arms, machine guns, and hand grenades. The mortars used are all made in China and are very effective. The morale of the Chinese army here is high. A long-time soldier told the reporter about the nightly raids on Japanese positions [omitted] after the battle. According to reports, the Japanese army was forced to adopt this strategy, but they were ultimately not as good at it as the Chinese army. According to various officers (including some senior ones), the average ratio of Chinese army casualties to Japanese army casualties is about 7 to 10, that is, for every 7 Chinese soldiers killed, 10 Japanese soldiers are killed. That night, when I arrived at the division headquarters, I learned that 600 Chinese soldiers had been killed in action during the day, and the Japanese army had lost about 1,000 people. Although we could roughly see the area being bombarded from where we stood, I was fortunate to decline to go to the area in person, so I was spared from disaster.

Near the front line, I saw about twenty orphans being escorted out of the war zone, led by a soldier and followed by a Chinese woman serving in the position. The orphans all walked along the winding road, some holding hands and some singing, but running under the scorching sun. [Omitted] they showed signs of exhaustion.

### My ××× Donations for Expansion of New Air Force: One Aircraft Purchased for US$50,000; Chairman Chiang's Telegram ××××

[Hong Kong News] Chairman Chiang of the China Aviation Construction Association is now launching the expansion of the air force construction to strive for final victory. He has recently instructed various ×× branch offices and organizations to strive to raise funds. The instruction is recorded below:

It is hereby notified that the Guangdong People's Anti-Japanese Fundraising Committee has now concluded its work. All matters that the committee should handle and all unfinished matters will be transferred to this association for continued handling, as ordered. Since its establishment, the committee has relied on the fervent patriotism and love for their hometown of ×××× and has actively contributed, achieving considerable success. The construction of an air force is originally the most urgent task for a modern nation. Without air defense, there is no national defense. All countries regard it as the primary defense. Especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, enemy aircraft have wreaked havoc, bombing indiscriminately everywhere. The entire nation deeply feels that without sufficient air defense, national defense is insufficient. Since its establishment, this association has made significant achievements in promoting association affairs and collecting donations. Since the second phase of the War of Resistance, although the southeastern provinces of our country have successively fallen, thanks to the enthusiastic donations of ××××, the work of this association has been further advanced compared to before the war. This time, the National Political Council unanimously resolved to expand the construction of the air force, which is indeed an urgent matter. This association, being responsible for its duties, should promptly raise funds widely. In addition to issuing a general order to all provincial branches and all directly affiliated branches of this association to intensify fundraising, we urge all organizations to redouble their efforts and actively raise funds. From now on, any organization or individual who donates the equivalent of US$50,000 will purchase one fighter aircraft; those who donate the equivalent of US$100,000 will purchase one bomber aircraft or two fighter aircraft. The name of the donating organization or the individual's name will be added to the aircraft's name. All outstanding remittances and newly received donations from overseas Chinese organizations must be remitted in foreign currency to the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China and deposited into the association's donation account to facilitate the pooling of funds for aircraft purchases and the expansion of air force construction, which is truly reliant upon it before the War of Resistance. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is hereby urgently ordered to comply with this order without fail. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

### Our Military Strategy and Tactics Achieve Unprecedented Success; Enemy's May Offensive Completely Defeated; Military Affairs Commission Announces Battle Situation of the Past Week

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 30th] A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that in the past week, the enemy troops launched fierce offensives on all fronts in the north and south. Through the continuous and skillful mobile attacks of our entire army and the unexpected success of our strategy and tactics, the enemy's arrogant attempt to launch a so-called "May Offensive" has been declared a final failure. The significant battle results are roughly as follows:

Hubei Front

In this battle, over 20,000 enemy troops were killed, and countless more were wounded. The enemy's main forces, including the Fujita, Fujie, Ogizhou Divisions, and the Kojima Cavalry Brigade, suffered more than half of their strength. Their treacherous plan to encircle from both flanks was completely shattered by us. Since we captured Xinyang, Tanghe, and Tongbai in southern Henan, and Zaoyang and Suixian in northern Hubei, as well as Duobaowan, Luohansi, Yuxinhe, Wazi Village, Yanmenkou, and Yuekou on the east bank of the Xiang River, the remaining enemy troops mostly fled to the vicinity of Zhongxiang, stubbornly entrenched in fortifications, attempting to struggle. Our army, with the posture of a tiger pouncing on a rabbit, continued to pursue the defeated enemy. By the 29th, the situation of encircling Zhongxiang and the nation had been formed. At dawn, the battle to attack the city began. The enemy troops desperately attempted to break through and flee to Wuhan. The battle situation was tragic. In one day and night, over a thousand remaining enemy troops were killed. This last stronghold of the enemy in central Hubei is on the verge of collapse. The enemy in Wuhan is gradually coming under our control.

Northern Jiangxi Front

The battle situation along the Nanchang line has not changed significantly. In the areas of Gaoan, Fengxin, Anyi, and Jing'an, our army has been advancing towards Nanchang on multiple routes for days, achieving great success. Gaoyou City, northeast of Gaoan, has been occupied by the enemy since last week, but the surrounding important strongholds are still in our hands. On the morning of the 29th, our elite troops launched a large-scale offensive, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy in the northwestern area of the city. The enemy's corpses piled up like mountains. We recaptured Lion Mountain and once charged into the city, burning all the enemy's military supplies and warehouses. Another unit of our troops ambushed the enemy in the western mountains of Wanshou Palace, encircling and fiercely attacking a large force of enemy troops, killing over 1,200 remaining enemy troops. Important bridges such as Doumu Bridge, Gancun Bridge, and Shui Bridge have been thoroughly destroyed, cutting off transportation from Fuchang to Dacheng. Currently, the two units are taking advantage of the situation to mop up the defeated enemy, echoing the main force on the southern line, continuing to advance towards Nanchang, and fierce battles will resume.

Shanxi Front

A unit of our army attacking Xiangyuan Mountain in southern Shanxi has been fiercely attacking over a thousand enemy troops in Guankiao Village near the county seat since last week, completely annihilating them. They are now pressing under the city and intensifying the siege. Two to three thousand enemy troops from Quwo in southern Shanxi, with combined infantry and artillery, have been launching offensives towards the Yicheng urban area for days under the cover of aerial bombardment. After luring the enemy deep, we launched a four-sided attack, killing over a thousand enemy troops. The remaining enemy troops fled back to Quwo, unable to attack again. The enemy troops in the Wutai area of northern Shanxi have been reinforced repeatedly since the beginning of this month, with large-scale movements, attempting to open up transportation from Wutai to Fufeng and from Wuhe to Daying. Our army has repeatedly defeated the enemy troops on various routes in the areas north of Taihuai and Dalong, killing over a thousand enemy troops and capturing three artillery pieces, over forty light and heavy machine guns, over three hundred rifles, over a hundred horses, and two military vehicles. After the enemy's setbacks, there are currently no further actions.

Guangdong Front

Since our army successively captured important locations such as Huaxian, Conghua, Zengcheng, and Jiangmen, the battle situation between us and the enemy has entered a stalemate. On the 24th and 25th, over a thousand enemy troops from Xinhui, with three tanks, launched offensives towards Fenshui River on multiple routes under the cover of intense artillery fire. Our army lined up to wait, luring the enemy into the pre-set position, encircling and fiercely attacking them, causing them to abandon over three hundred corpses and flee. Subsequently, the enemy launched reinforcements from the highlands east of Lühu Ping and from Guifeng, but they were again repelled and have already collapsed. On the morning of the 25th, several hundred enemy troops with infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Jiangcun sailed from Jinshui towards Wuhua and Changling, where our army launched a head-on attack. The enemy could not resist and fled by noon. On the same day at 2 PM, several hundred enemy troops with infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Longkou launched an offensive towards Xiniu Gu Ling in Huaxian. After our brave counterattack, the enemy troops fled south, and we ambushed them along the way, killing over two hundred of them. The pursuit is still ongoing.

Other Fronts

After clearing the remaining enemy troops in the counties of Shucheng and Tongcheng in northern Anhui, we advanced to encircle Hefei. In Hebei Province, we captured Wanxian and approached Wenxian. We killed Watanabe, the commander of the enemy's anti-bandit forces, and Ata, the captain of the artillery regiment. Over three hundred puppet troops from An Guichang's unit in Jia Zhuang defected. In Shandong Province, one unit charged into Jinan and besieged Dezhou, controlling the area east of the Jinpu Railway. The above are the important battle results that are worth reporting.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacked on the 25th; Joint Newspaper Edition in Bombed Areas of Chongqing Suspended for Two Days; One Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

[Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, Evening of the 25th] On the 25th of this month, enemy aircraft bombed the urban area of Chongqing, with the affected areas reaching fourteen locations. The details are as follows:

On the 25th, enemy aircraft took advantage of the dusk, with forty-seven bombers, attacking Chongqing in batches from Badong, Wushan, Wuxi, Chengkou, Wanyuan, Jiangkou, Yingshan, Yuechi, and Hechuan. We issued an air raid alert at 6 PM. An emergency alert was issued one hour later. The first and second batches of enemy aircraft, totaling twenty-seven, invaded the airspace of the city at 7:20 PM. Our brave air force engaged in fierce combat with them. The enemy aircraft bombed indiscriminately, dropping a total of two to three hundred bombs in the urban and banking areas. A large fire broke out in the First Model Market. Xin Street, Shaanxi Fourth Street, Xiaoshizi, Datie Street, Datong Street, Zuanying Street, Daliangzi, Yamenkou, Commercial Square, West Fourth Street, and Central Park were all hit by bombs. The third batch of enemy aircraft continued to arrive and dropped bombs in Guangyuan and the Danzishi and Mudong training grounds in Jiangnan. Three enemy aircraft were shot down by us, one crashed in Guangyuan Dam, and two are being investigated. The fourth batch flew to Fuling but dared not advance and immediately turned back. This indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft resulted in three to four hundred casualties. Central Park in the city was the worst affected, with a total of fifteen bombs dropped. Houses were leveled, and trees were uprooted. The scattered corpses of men, women, the elderly, and children were lying in pools of blood everywhere, numbering no less than a hundred. The tragedy was extremely horrific. At the South Gate, when the alarm was issued, the city gate was narrow, causing extreme congestion. Countless people were pushed and trampled to the ground, among which eight were trampled to death and over twenty were seriously injured. Fortunately, the city's fire brigade, protection corps, police force, public security bureau, Red Cross, rescue brigade, stretcher team, health bureau, and various service organizations quickly mobilized and risked their lives to rescue, finally extinguishing the fire. The injured were sent to the municipal hospital and other public and private hospitals for treatment. The joint newspaper edition will be suspended for two days starting today due to the nearby bombing and the断 wires, which cut the electricity supply.

### UK, France and Soviet Union Reached Agreement; Axis Powers Rumor Building in Order to Drive Wedge Between UK and Soviet Union Relationship

[London, 30th] Foreign News: The Daily Telegraph wrote today, discussing foreign politics, with a focus on UK-Soviet negotiations, stating that the UK-Soviet negotiations have reached the final stage. Although the exact nature of the proposals of both parties has not been disclosed, it is believed that the opinions of both the UK and the Soviet Union have become consistent. An agreement has been reached in principle on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 30th] Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, returned here from Geneva last night and will meet with the UK government's chief diplomatic adviser, Sir Robert Vansittart, today.

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 30th] As of last night, the Soviet government has not yet responded to the joint UK-French proposal on the conclusion of a trilateral mutual assistance agreement. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will deliver a speech on the day of the month, and it is expected that he will discuss this matter.

[Haitong News Agency, Beijing, 30th] According to the Polish Daily today, the Soviet government is not aware of the fact that the Soviet Military Commissar Voroshilov is participating in the British Army's autumn maneuvers. However, on Monday, the Polish newspapers published in large print that the UK had invited the Soviet Union to participate in the exercise.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 29th] The Chairman of the People's Committee and Foreign Minister, Molotov, has recently agreed to report on foreign policy to the joint session of the Council of Nationalities and Council of the Union of the Supreme Soviet at 7 PM on the 30th of this month at the request of the majority of the members of the Supreme Soviet. The draft of the UK-French-Soviet trilateral mutual assistance agreement proposed by the UK and France will also be involved at that time.

[London, 30th] Foreign News: It is widely believed here that the UK, French, and Soviet trilateral mutual assistance agreement will be established within a few days. Officials denied the rumor that a four-power peace conference between the UK, France, Germany, and Italy would be convened. The news was spread by Italy, and it is believed here that the purpose of this statement is to hinder the smooth progress of the UK-Soviet negotiations and cause the Soviet Union to be suspicious. London specifically pointed out that it is necessary to complete the UK-Soviet negotiations as soon as possible. At the same time, the claim that Japan shot down more than forty Soviet military aircraft was dismissed as unfounded. It is said that this move is a tactic of Japan's, intended to make the UK believe that the Soviet Union's military assistance is not reliable.

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] Regarding the draft of the UK, French, and Soviet trilateral mutual assistance agreement proposed by the UK and France, it is believed here by one person that the Soviet Union can accept it in principle. There may be several points in between, and the Soviet Union will put forward its opinions. At the same time, regarding the implementation of the agreement, it will be proposed that it should have greater flexibility. It is especially valuable that at a time when the Axis countries are obstructing in various ways, it is most advisable to establish the trilateral agreement as soon as possible. The Italian side recently reported that the UK is planning to convene a four-power conference between the UK, Germany, France, and Italy, with the intention of driving a wedge between the UK and the Soviet Union, prompting the Soviet Union to be suspicious of the UK's attitude. However, those close to the British government have recently denied this. It is said that the government authorities have no such intention and must wait until the UK, French, and Soviet trilateral agreement is established and the security chain is completed before considering negotiations with the Axis countries. As for the fact that the British Ambassador, Sir Ronald Campbell, visited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today, he did not involve the four-power conference. The British-Italian relationship has not changed because of this conversation. In addition, after Italy and Germany formed an alliance treaty, it is a sign that Italy's foreign policy remains independent. As for the Anglo-Italian Agreement (established on April 28, 1936), although the German side reported that Italy might abolish it, the facts are not accurate.

### Soviet-Turkish Relations Growing Closer; Turkish President Speaks in Praise; Foreign Minister Will Visit the Soviet Union to Enhance Relations

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 30th] The Fifth Congress of the Turkish Republican People's Party opened here yesterday. President Ismet attended and delivered a speech, saying that we will never recognize the right of those powerful allied countries to eliminate smaller countries. All countries enjoy independent sovereignty. The reason why we established the Balkan Entente is also for this reason. Turkey has been fully awakened. Turkey not only wants to ensure its own security but also wants to contribute to world peace. If war breaks out, Turkey will fulfill its responsibility without fear. The UK-Turkish agreement does not have any aggressive purpose but rather aims to protect humanitarianism. Today, Turkey's relationship with the Soviet Union is closer than before. As for the relationship between Turkey and France, the two countries have agreed in principle to conclude a mutual assistance agreement. Turkey's national defense measures are becoming increasingly important. Because the international crisis still exists, we have no other way to ensure security other than to take national defense measures. The threatening situation of last month will not last. In the future, if the countries do not drive their ignorant people to fight each other, then reason will come out to establish true peace.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 29th] Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu will come here for a return visit in the near future. According to reports, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin recently visited Turkey, and the friendship between the two countries has greatly improved.

### Turkish Military Mission to Visit London

[Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 29th] Local newspapers reported that a Turkish military delegation will go to London soon. The delegation will be led by General Aubie.

### Albanian Army Ends; Italy Announces Merger

[Reuters, Tirana, 29th] Officials announced today that the Cabinet had previously passed a bill to merge the Albanian army (including the gendarmerie and border defense forces) into the Italian army.

### Gayda Writes Again; Self-Praise; Negotiates with UK and France; Wants Some "Living Space"

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 30th] The editor of "Italian Daily," i.e. Gayda, who is generally regarded as Mussolini's "mouthpiece," published an editorial yesterday, stating that "the encirclement policy orchestrated by the UK and France is clearly aimed at war. I can list three basic principles to prove that those who call themselves democratic countries have no reasonable defense: (1) The UK and France already have huge and astonishing colonies, and the Treaty of Versailles gave the two countries other colonies, creating an absolute advantage. The policy of Germany and Italy is not to establish their own power, but only to correct the UK and French advantages created by the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles stripped Germany of its colonies, while France increased its colonies by 922,000 square kilometers, with a population of 4,325,000. The UK increased by 2,620,000 square kilometers, with a population of 9,335,000. As for Italy, it only obtained 90,000 square kilometers of barren desert, with a population of 100,000. As a result, all raw materials and other products that can be exported to other countries are monopolized by the UK and France, and the maritime passages in the Mediterranean are controlled by the UK. (2) In order to meet their survival needs and seek more "living space" and raw material supply, Germany and Italy have negotiated with the UK and France, asking them to abandon their surplus colonies. This kind of request is very legitimate, but it has been rejected, which is not the way of neighbors, and it is also greatly contrary to the principles of world justice and international freedom. (3) The UK and France's refusal to give Germany and Italy land and population is clear evidence of their determination to challenge. I don't know if a war breaks out, will it be the most crazy and risky action in human history? And it is also a fatal blow to European culture. Isn't it strange that the UK and France are willing to sacrifice the lives of four or five million people and spend endless energy to defend a few thousand square kilometers of sparsely populated colonies, making it impossible for Germany and Italy to touch them?"

### Spain; World of Terror; Franco's Troops Go Against the Tide; Massive Arrests, Nine Out of Ten Houses Empty; Italian Troops Begin to Withdraw

[Associated Press, Hyde, 29th] According to news from authoritative sources here, the current Spanish government is intensifying its efforts to curb public sentiment and seek violent rule in major cities. This kind of tyrannical fact is particularly severe in the city of Madrid. After Franco's troops occupied the city of Madrid, they immediately formed a military court to deal with cases more than 400 times a day, of which nearly 40% were sentenced to death, and most of them were executed immediately. Other sentences are mostly life imprisonment or short-term imprisonment in concentration camps. The police station and the court have information cards, a total of 1 million, which secretly contain various arrest and interrogation information of suspects. The scope of the arrests is extremely wide, and almost no one can escape. The mayor of Valencia ordered the owners of companies and stores to dismiss employees who were dissatisfied with the actions of the National Army. National and public officials must first clarify their views on the internal war and condemn the crimes of the Republican Army before they can continue to hold office. The National Army authorities in Catalonia arbitrarily arrest people, and the number is impossible to count. All prisons are full. The former headquarters of the Republican Army has also been converted into a temporary prison. Even many clergy have been arrested quickly. Recently, there are 66 clergy in various prisons, of which 3 have been executed, 9 have been sentenced to life imprisonment, 3 have been sentenced to 30 years, 5 have been sentenced to 20 years, 2 have been sentenced to 16 years, 11 have been sentenced to 12 years, 1 have been sentenced to 10 years, 3 have been sentenced to 8 years, and 20 have been sentenced to 6 years. Among them, there are many senior clergy members who have committed crimes.

[Central News Agency, Madrid, 29th] Italian volunteers recently began to board ships in Cadiz, southern Spain, and are scheduled to leave for home on June 1. Since June 2, there will be no foreign soldiers in Spain.

### Soviet Budget; Revenue and Expenditure Offset

[Central News Agency, Moscow, Prefecture, Day] The Soviet Union's budget for this year, including national defense expenditures, totals 154,570,000,000 rubles, and the tax revenue budget is 155,607,000,000 rubles. Therefore, after offsetting revenue and expenditure, there is still a surplus of 650 million rubles. The military expenditure in this year's budget is 40,885,000,000 rubles, while last year it was only 270 million rubles.

### Chen Cheng Discusses the War Situation: The Enemy is on the Verge of Collapse, Certain Victory is Approaching Daily

[Central News Agency, Chongqing Air Dispatch] Minister Chen of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, in a reception for foreign journalists on the 22nd, delivered a speech giving a brief report on the general situation of the recent war and the prospects for certain victory in the War of Resistance. His words were as follows:

As the War of Resistance approaches its second anniversary, the situation of certain victory is becoming increasingly apparent. Having recently returned from the front lines, I will now describe to you the general situation of the war and the prospects for certain victory in the War of Resistance. First, regarding the No. x War Zone, after the x army captured Nanchang, it suffered serious blows from our army in the Gao'an and Wuning areas and was unable to continue its advance. Taking advantage of the x army's defeat, our army decided to launch a counterattack on Nanchang on the 22nd of last month. At that time, the battle situation was extremely fierce, and our army did indeed break into the suburbs of Nanchang twice. However, due to terrain conditions, we were unable to hold our ground. But in terms of the overall war situation, our army has indeed achieved a great victory. In particular, supporting the No. x War Zone and containing a large part of the x army's forces, preventing them from transferring troops to northern Hubei and achieving their goal of capturing Xiangfan, is an even more significant war achievement.

This time, the x army's capture of Nanchang, apart from occupying a dead city, can be said to have gained nothing. Most of our army, during the counterattack, successively captured Lehua, Zhanggongdu, and other places, controlling the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, making it completely unusable by the x people. Currently, the only transportation line for the x people is limited to Poyang Lake. Conversely, after the evacuation of Nanchang, although our Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway traffic was cut off, there are still two highways south of Nanchang, and in reality, the connection between Zhejiang and Jiangxi was not interrupted because of this. The x people, however, due to the extension of the defense line, feel even more insufficient in troop strength, are trapped in a passive position everywhere, and are constantly subjected to ambushes. Our army, on the other hand, can take the offensive as a defense, advance as a retreat, actively strive for the initiative, and gallop freely, attacking and defending with ease, advancing to capture important towns and recovering lost territory.

In the Hunan-Hubei area, since our army launched a fierce counterattack and occupied Tongshan, most of the troops have approached Yangxin and Daye, as well as Tongcheng, and have been gaining hundreds or dozens of enemy kills daily. The 6th and 9th Divisions of the x army in that area are already struggling to cope and are caught in a heavy siege.

In central and northern Hubei, the x people attempted to concentrate their forces in early May to attack our main force x and attempt to capture Xiangfan. However, also due to insufficient troop strength, they were unable to form an encirclement. After five days and nights of bloody battle, our army severely struck them north of Suizao; the x army's siege of Jintuguan completely failed. Moreover, the flanks and rear of the x army were still threatened by our large force. Therefore, the x people in that area are trapped in a dilemma, unable to advance further.

The war situation in the above-mentioned areas is actually the focus of the current war situation. The x army has already shown signs of fatigue and distress everywhere, and its strength is exhausted. Its inevitable path to defeat can be foreseen. According to reports, the total strength of the x army currently in China is 31 divisions and three cavalry brigades. To cope with the current war situation, they already feel insufficient in troop strength. It is even more impossible to transfer troops from their home country to attack. In order to cover up its signs of defeat and alleviate the anti-war sentiment of its military and civilians, the x warlords have no choice but to put on a false show of strength and try to maintain their position. However, after 22 months of fighting, the x country has no diplomatic path, its economy is in distress, and its finances are exhausted. A quick victory is impossible, and long-term persistence is not allowed by its strength. Therefore, the x people are currently苟延喘息(trying to prolong their breath), merely making a final struggle before their total collapse.

Recently, in light of its military failures, the x people have attempted to salvage their fate with political and economic aggression schemes. They are also touting the so-called "long-term construction war," attempting to use Chinese to control Chinese, that is, to use Chinese materials to fight China. This is a ridiculous and contradictory delusion, and its ultimate failure is undoubtedly certain. Any construction, at least, must have four conditions: capital, time, labor, and social peace. For example, Germany implemented a four-year plan, investing 120 billion marks in the first year and 160 billion marks in the second year. The Soviet Union's first five-year plan invested 60 billion rubles, and the second five-year plan invested 133 billion rubles. And it is impossible not to mobilize the country's human and material resources to carry out construction calmly in a peaceful environment. See if the x people have any of these? It can be said that they have none.

First, the military expenses of Japan have been close to one hundred trillion yuan, and the gold reserves in the country are almost exhausted. According to expert statistics, Japan's gold reserves are no more than 100 billion yuan. Since the start of the war, 80 billion yuan have been shipped to the United States, and 15 billion yuan have been shipped to the United Kingdom. Recently, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has plummeted from 1 shilling and 2 pence to 6 pence. From this, it can be concluded that the Japanese x absolutely do not have the ability to invest in the occupied areas.

Second, even if given three or five years, they will not be able to gain anything. The x people have spent decades in the Northeast, scheming to plunder resources. To this day, they have not been able to recover their costs. In North China and Central China, there is no foundation, and the difficulties are self-evident.

Third, labor is even more impossible to solve. Our compatriots in the war zone have been massacred and harmed by the Japanese x people, forging a great and irreconcilable hatred. They are eager for revenge, fearing that it will not be far off. How can they bear to sweat and shed blood for the x people to achieve their陰滕　華(nefarious plot to destroy China)? As for those who are受漢奸　從利用者(used and followed by traitors), they are only a very small minority.

Fourth, the x people hope for peace and order, unless they kill all of our 450 million compatriots and eliminate all of our national armed forces. Otherwise, at any time and in any place, the x people can be made to feel uneasy, and any "construction" by the x people will inevitably be destroyed without exception.

In short, no matter what kind of enslavement policy the x people adopt in the war zone, nor what kind of appeasement scheme they implement, they cannot gain a foothold and stabilize their criminal rule. The Japanese x people, having penetrated deeply and deployed troops for a long time, have exhausted their strength and resources and are surrounded by enemies on all sides. Even if they do not want to be defeated, they cannot prevent it.

From the above analysis, we can see that the enemy's power is waning. We only need to redouble our efforts, be more persevering, not hesitate to make any sacrifices, uphold the spirit of great wisdom, great benevolence, and great fortitude, destroy the enemy's rear, strengthen our hatred for the enemy, and at the same time, work hard to relocate the resources of the war zone and actively build the rear in the Southwest. Then the front line will fight harder and the rear will be more stable. After two or three years of hard struggle, we will eventually be able to drive out the enemy x and achieve the final victory. ×××××, like a frog in a well, knows nothing of the greatness of China. Although they may croak for a while, their strength will be exhausted, and they will inevitably burst and die. The Japanese x boast of "certain victory in every battle, certain success in every attack." But why do they have to increase their troops every day, still奔命(running around), the living coming and the dead going, never-ending? This is a difficult question that the Japanese x cannot answer or understand forever. As for our army, in the future, we will continue to adhere to the established strategic policy, carry out a protracted war of attrition with the x people, implement a flexible defense, a mobile offense,坚韧前拖(firmly delaying the front), 　活的轉(flexible conversion) and penetrate deeply into the x people's rear, turning the x people's rear into our front, accumulating daily small victories into big victories. All our compatriots must 　淸(clearly understand) "military affairs first" and strive to build a "victory first" goal, then the final victory will not be far away. [Central News Agency]

### Palestine Issue: The United States Expresses Agreement with the British Approach, Riots Continue in Jerusalem

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The State Department has sent letters to members of Congress explaining the U.S. attitude towards the Palestine issue. The letter stated that the U.S. attitude has not changed since Secretary of State Hull's declaration last October. The U.S. government cannot insist that Palestine should be a Jewish homeland for the establishment of a Jewish home. U.S. interests are still protected, and the U.S. government does not need to file a formal protest.

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 29th] A bomb exploded in a movie theater run by an Arab in the central district of this city today, killing four people and injuring 21, including two British police officers. According to the Haitong News Agency, the incident was committed by the Jewish Revisionist Party. Many terrorist acts have occurred in the past 24 hours, and the衆信(massacre) was also launched by this Jewish organization. The激烈的猶太人(radical Jews) have begun terrorist acts. It is expected that riots will occur again in the future.

[Haitong News Agency, Jerusalem, 30th] The British military authorities here issued an order last night that all Jewish-owned theaters must be closed to avoid riots. They will be reopened when the situation improves. Jewish-owned small hotels are not allowed to operate after 8 p.m.

[Haitong News Agency, Jerusalem, 30th] Palestine has experienced repeated riots during the holiday period, with 13 deaths and more injuries. An official communique stated that British troops and Arab irregulars clashed on Sunday, with three Arabs killed and one captured. It is reported that one of the dead was the secretary of a certain Arab leader. Two British soldiers were also injured. Yesterday, near Abala, British troops clashed with Arab irregulars again, with five Arabs killed, one injured, and seven captured.

### British King and Queen Arrive in Victoria, Unprecedented Enthusiasm from Citizens

[Reuters, Victoria, 30th] After a seven-hour stay in Vancouver, the British King and Queen traveled by car to Victoria, arriving on Monday evening (29th). The journey took four hours. Those waiting to greet them at the station included Lieutenant Governor Eric Hamber. Their Majesties plan to reside in the Government House for two days. To show their welcome, the citizens lit large bonfires along the seaside, the flames blazing, the buildings reflected in the water, the轮郑　然(ships moving/gathering), and the whistles of various ships in the harbor sounded loudly and deafeningly.

[Reuters, Vancouver, 29th] The British King and Queen, having spent more than ten days touring various cities in eastern and western Canada, covering a distance of three thousand miles, arrived in Vancouver at 10 a.m. today (local time). The welcoming crowd numbered 500,000, including thousands of Americans from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. The enthusiasm of the welcome was unprecedented. The crowds also held up emblems to indicate where they came from, including flags from Yorkshire, East Anglia, and Lancashire. In Vancouver's "Chinatown," Chinese and British flags intertwined, signifying goodwill. Vancouver is an important center for the British Royal Air Force in the Pacific, so the King also wore the uniform of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Royal Air Force. The leaders of the Socialist Party met at the City Hall to welcome the King and Queen. After the ceremony, they rode in cars around the city, greeting the cheering crowds. Some of the crowds had been standing for 　旦(days).

[Reuters, Ottawa, 30th] Before the British King and Queen left here, Canadian Postmaster General Mulach, presented the King with a small booklet of postage stamps containing all the postage stamps since the establishment of Canada, which is very precious. Mr. Ma also presented the Queen with a silver dish, on which were carved various special postage stamps commemorating this trip of the Royal Family, and also sent a smaller silver to 　沙白(Elizabeth) and 　　　　　　(Margret).

### U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to Discuss Neutrality Act, Most Support Hull's Proposal, Isolationists Remain Stubborn

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, said today that he would submit a new Neutrality Act to Congress and would convene the House Foreign Affairs Committee tomorrow to discuss Hull's proposal. He said that the content of the new Neutrality Act he wanted to propose was exactly the same as what Hull advocated, so he hoped that the Foreign Affairs Committee could pass the new bill within a week.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] Chairman Pittman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee predicted that a majority of the committee members would support the government's Neutrality Act. After Secretary of State Hull expressed his views on the Neutrality Act a few days ago, Congress would have a 朋决议(resolution) on this matter. Pittman also said that he also agreed with Hull's proposal, because Hull's proposal was actually the same as his. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow, and the isolationists have indicated that if 　尔氏(Hull's) proposal is submitted to the Senate for discussion, they will definitely oppose it.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, White Bloom, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently proposed an 革案(amendment) to the House of Representatives, the content of which is completely the same as the government's views. It roughly states that once the President declares that a state of war exists between a certain country and endangers American citizens, the President may issue a declaration, specifying the warring countries. At that time, American citizens may not board any of the ships of those countries, nor may they lend to those countries by means of loans or credit, nor may they raise funds within American territory for those countries and provide assistance. As for the scope of dangerous areas, it shall be designated by the President, and American ships shall be prohibited from entering such areas. The President may also restrict the ships of the warring countries that are anchored in American ports. In addition, if war breaks out in the countries of North and South America, the U.S. government shall retain the freedom to not be restricted by this amendment.

Current Commentary

### The Mongol Puppet War

In the past two days, newspapers have once again been publishing mandatory advertisements for the Japanese military, titled "The Mongol Puppet War." Perhaps because it can scare people at this time and has "news value," some newspapers have even published it in special characters in an important position!

What exactly is going on?

The news is all coming from Japan and its illegitimate child, the puppet state of Manchuria. We are not saying that the news coming from these two sources is unreliable, but based on past experience, we can know that the news released by Japan must at least be treated with caution, because often after a few days, the facts will prove to be exactly the opposite of this news. Even the Japanese themselves will come to correct or deny it.

However, do we not believe this news? That is not the case, because since the Japanese are promoting this news so loudly, it will not be without purpose. Where is their purpose in spreading 　　(false) news? First, the negotiations on the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement have reached the stage of success. The 反侵略(anti-aggression) 　　(force) extending to the Far East will be an inevitable fact. It is just that the attitudes of Britain and France are not firm enough, giving the × people an opening. Therefore, the Japanese x, while declaring that they will not participate in the German-Italian military alliance, are taking the opportunity to actually launch a provocation against Outer Mongolia in an attempt to 　亂(confuse) international public opinion, shake the anti-aggression intentions of Britain and France, and reduce the international pressure Japan is currently under. Second, the joint Anglo-French-American plan against Japan has begun to be implemented, and Japan's creation of this news will naturally have a disruptive effect. Third, the Japanese invasion of China is encountering new difficulties, especially the setbacks in the Hubei-Hunan war, and the anti-war sentiment in the country is increasing. The Japanese x are using the news of provocation against Outer Mongolia to alleviate and 　移(shift) this anti-war sentiment. Finally, the Japanese x are changing their strategy towards China, mainly using politics and supplemented by military affairs. Therefore, launching a provocation against Outer Mongolia can strengthen the anti-communist movement of the Japanese x and Chinese traitors, in order to split and shake China's War of Resistance front and to 　助(help) the development and strengthening of the ruling power of the puppet governments in the occupied areas.

The reason for the Japanese puppet army's provocation against Outer Mongolia lies here—the reason why the Japanese puppet side exaggerates and even shamelessly exaggerates the shooting down of a large number of Soviet aircraft, etc., also lies here!

We must 　加警惕(be more vigilant), especially to strengthen our own war of resistance 震　(front)—all conspiracies and 　言(rumors) 　有(can only) be shattered in our strong团

### Where will ×× Ultimately Go?

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] According to reliable information, regarding Hitler's declaration that the Anglo-German Naval Agreement had been annulled a few days ago, the British Foreign Office and the Admiralty will submit an important note to Germany within days. Although its wording is unknown, it seems to indicate that Britain hopes to resolve outstanding issues with Germany. According to speculation in diplomatic circles, Britain may even propose to conclude an anti-aggression agreement with Germany. As for the time when the note will be sent, it will generally be after the signing of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement.

### Yongxiang Gold Shop in Yau Ma Tei Robbed by Armed Bandits, Police Detectives Arrest Bandits in a Fierce Gunfight, Dozens of Police Detectives Surround and Shoot, Three Thieves Arrested, Two Flee, Passing Woman Tragically Killed by Stray Bullet, Chinese Police Officer Also Shot and Wounded

Banditry is rampant and becoming increasingly violent. Yesterday afternoon, the Yongxiang Gold Shop on Shanghai Street was again robbed in broad daylight by five bandits who opened fire. After succeeding, they fled with the loot. Afterward, the police detectives mobilized to協　(assist) track the bandits. A fierce gunfight broke out with the bandits near the train bridge. As a result, three bandits were arrested on the spot, and the remaining two bandits fled towards North Point. They encountered a Chinese police officer, and a械鬥(brawl) occurred between the two sides. As a result, a woman was killed by a stray bullet that hit a vital point. The Chinese police officer was also shot and wounded in the left hand by the bandits. In this battle, three bandits were arrested, two escaped, one woman was killed, and one Chinese detective was injured. The information obtained by the reporter's investigation is recorded below:

Five Bandits 　进鸣枪(Enter and Open Fire) to Rob

The Yongxiang Gold Shop at 449 Shanghai Street, Yau Ma Tei, is a shop in front and a residence in the back. The proprietor's name is Liang Haidong. Liang, because banditry has been rampant in recent years, installed a police alarm, directly connected to the Yau Ma Tei Police Station, for the purpose of preventing theft and calling the police. Yesterday at 11:45 a.m., the partners were gathering outside the shop. When the five bandits broke in, there were no customers in the shop. After the five bandits broke in, they immediately drew their guns and fired a shot into the air as a demonstration, and pointed at the three people sitting at the counter, telling them not to make a sound, or they would be killed. Everyone saw that the bandits were all holding曲尺左輪手槍(large-caliber revolvers), were extremely fierce, fearing that they would be calculated by the bandits, so they蛰伏不动(remained silent), letting the bandits do as they pleased. The bandits then used the butt of their guns to smash the glass cabinet, wantonly searching and looting. They 　刼(robbed) for about fifteen minutes before fleeing with the loot. When the bandits left, they also　 向空鸣枪(fired into the air) three times. It is estimated that the gold and silver jewelry that was robbed included fifty gold rings, seven gold bangles, five gold chain bangles, three pairs of gold 　范鈪(bangle types), about seven necklace watches, seven pairs of gold earrings, and twelve gold coins, worth more than two thousand yuan in total.

Large Group of Police Detectives Closely Pursue

Those who were threatened, seeing that the bandits had left, immediately pressed the police alarm to report the incident. At the same time, a woman named Zhong Bao Wang, who was working at the shop, also鳴警笛(sounded the alarm) at the back door. After receiving the report, the Yau 　地(Ma Tei) Police Station immediately dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western police detectives, including Gary, Shi Dui, Wu Si, Deputy Superintendent Shuffton Bidao, etc., to the scene to apprehend the bandits. After succeeding, the bandits immediately fled to the right on Dundas Street. Liang Rong, a partner of the shop, was unwilling to give up and pursued the bandits closely. Seeing that someone was closely following, the bandits turned to Portland Street, then Gascoigne Road, and turned to Nathan Road. Seeing that Liang Rong was still not giving up the pursuit, the bandits fired a shot at Liang Rong, fortunately without hitting him. Liang Rong still置之弗恤(paid no attention to it). The bandits then fired two more shots at Liang Rong, but fortunately, he was not hit. When the bandits reached Nathan Road and Argyle Street, two Chinese police officers and four Indian police officers happened to be rushing to the scene to assist in the arrest. They chased directly to the hillside near the train bridge in Ho Man Tin and Pui Ching School, where they engaged the bandits in 　战(fighting).

Stray Bullet Ruthlessly Harms a Woman

Before long, dozens of police detectives, including Police Detective Assistant Gary, Shi Zhun, Wu Si, Deputy Superintendent Shuffton Bidao, etc., arrived by car one after another, distributing a包围线(perimeter),協同捕匪(assisting in the capture of the bandits). In order to save their lives, the bandits continued to fire their guns to resist stubbornly. For a time, gunshots rang out continuously, dense as a string of beads, dozens of shots in a row, reverberating far and wide. Nearby residents were all extremely panicked. Unexpectedly, under the chaos of gunfire, a woman could not escape in time and was shot in a vital point. The bullet entered from her waist. The woman was still able to勉强(barely) walk, but soon倒地毙命(fell to the ground and died). It was found that the deceased's name was Ouyang Yanhuan, who was employed at 134 Flower Garden Street on the second floor. Afterward, the police station immediately called a hearse to the scene and sent it to the morgue for an autopsy.

Fierce Battle Results in Three Bandits Captured

As a result of the fierce battle, three bandits were arrested on the spot. The remaining two bandits took the opportunity to flee and fled to the vicinity of Mong Kok. Coincidentally, Chinese 　 Officer Deng Jia of No. 109 was passing by, escorting a criminal, so he　 勇向前兜截(bravely stepped forward to intercept them). Seeing that there was no way to escape, the two bandits fired their guns at Deng Jia. Deng was unable to dodge in time and was shot in the left hand. It was also found that when police detective Chang captured the three bandits, a large number of bullets were found on the bandits' bodies, and a revolver and a large number of bullets were also found on the mountain near the Baocui College. According to police station sources, the above items were abandoned by the bandits along the way when they were being pursued, hoping to洗脫(wash away) their robbery evidence. The police station will　返警署存案(return to the police station for record), preparing to use them as evidence when filing the case during the day.

### Hong Kong University Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday; Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote Conferred Degrees; Hong Kong University Cooperates with Various Chinese Universities; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sent a Letter Supporting Everything

Hong Kong University held a degree conferral ceremony at 9:30 last evening. It was presided over by the University's Vice-Chancellor, Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor Mr. Schroth. Many professors from various faculties, as well as prominent figures from both Chinese and Western communities, were present. The ceremony began with an opening address by Vice-Chancellor Northcote, followed by Professor Liddell requesting the Vice-Chancellor to confer the Doctor of Laws degree upon the former Engineering Professor, Mr. Smith. Subsequently, the deans of the Faculties of Medicine, Engineering, and Arts successively requested the Vice-Chancellor to confer degrees upon the graduates of their respective faculties. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor then presented prizes to the university's students. Among the graduates, there were twelve Bachelors of Medicine, twenty-eight Bachelors of Engineering, and twenty Bachelors of Arts (names already published in newspapers a few days ago).

Hong Kong University's Current Goals

In his address, Vice-Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Northcote stated that the recommendations of the Hong Kong University Reorganization Committee, appointed by the former Governor, Sir William Peel, have been largely adopted by the University. The three issues of public health, teacher training, and female dormitories are considered to be of utmost importance to Hong Kong and China. To ensure that the public understands the basic principles of public health, the University is currently engaged in promoting this movement. Regarding the second issue, a teacher training college will be established in Hong Kong in September. Regarding the lack of dormitory accommodation, it is hoped that enthusiastic individuals will assist in resolving this issue. Hong Kong University is currently planning to construct a "Physics and Biology" laboratory and to expand the Fung Ping Shan Library. The collection primarily consists of Chinese books. The number of library users has increased in recent years, resulting in insufficient space. It is hoped that enthusiastic individuals will donate a library.

Chairman Chiang Supports University Cooperation

Regarding the issue of cooperation between Hong Kong University and various universities in China, progress has been very smooth. I have received a letter from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressing his support for the objectives and plans of the cooperation. I am deeply grateful. Currently, the activities of Hong Kong University and mainland China are becoming closer. Hong Kong University is now serving various universities in China. The British International Student Service has donated books to various Chinese universities for the purpose of rebuilding libraries destroyed in the war. These are currently being received and stored by Hong Kong University. Hong Kong University is also preparing to provide other similar assistance to various Chinese universities.

### Tragic Murder Case at Man Hing Rice Store in Wan Chai; Parents and Children Found Dead in Pools of Blood; Three Store Employees and a Maid Suddenly Disappear

A shocking murder occurred yesterday morning at Man Hing Lung Rice Store, No. 30 Cross Street, Wan Chai. The store owner, Wong Tak-tin (34 years old), his wife, and their children were found dead in pools of blood. A baby girl, only ten days old, was abandoned among the corpses, crying loudly. The scene was indescribably tragic. The details are as follows:

Broken Limbs, Gruesome Sight

Due to the only survivor being a baby girl, the details of the tragedy are unknown. No one knew what had happened until around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, when the store was still closed. Neighbors, noticing something unusual, investigated and, along with two or three others, knocked on the door, but there was no response. They then informed a relative of Wong's on Hollywood Road, who arrived with them. They pushed the door open, and it easily swung open, as it was not bolted. They discovered the store in extreme disarray. Wong and his wife were found dead on the bed in a pool of blood, with broken limbs. Their son, Wong Ping-mui, 12 years old, and daughter, Wai-chu, only 7 years old, were also crushed under sacks of rice, with knife wounds all over their bodies. Only the ten-day-old baby girl was crying loudly. Everyone was shocked and immediately went outside to report the incident to the police. The Wan Chai Police Station dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They photographed the scene for records and sent the bodies to the mortuary for examination.

### "Diao Chan" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," Two Famous Dramas, to be Performed Tomorrow Night at Tai Ping Theatre; Ladies and Celebrities Perform for Charity for Four Consecutive Nights; Plot is Delightful and Filled with Patriotic Thoughts

The sensational Cantonese operas "Diao Chan" and "Dream of the Red Chamber" will be officially performed tomorrow night at the Tai Ping Theatre. Compatriots have been eagerly awaiting this event for a long time.

Everyone knows that these two great Cantonese operas are being performed by the "Ladies and Celebrities Charity Troupe." Their preparation work has been extremely meticulous, and they have not been careless in any aspect of the rehearsals. The plot, lyrics, music, costumes, and scenery have been carefully revised and arranged, and they have invited many advanced figures from the cultural and theatrical circles to provide guidance. After five months of training, their artistry has made amazing progress. During the preview performances, they invited people from all walks of life to watch, and everyone praised them unanimously.

The ladies and celebrities are sacrificing their valuable time, putting on makeup, singing beautifully, and performing famous patriotic plays that are both delightful and cautionary. On the surface, they seem to be happily forgetting the cries of parents and children scattered by the marauding enemy at the front, but in their hearts, they are constantly thinking about the passion to rescue the wounded and rebuild the country. In other words, they are using their loud or delicate voices to desperately appeal for the disaster-stricken soldiers and refugees.

Compatriots who are enthusiastically buying tickets are also driven by patriotism. Since they have such sympathy, they should even more enthusiastically support the famous historical drama "Diao Chan," which deeply embodies the spirit of our nation above all else, in order to strive for our final victory.

In order to explore the preparation process, the reporter specially visited Ms. Liu Qingxuan, the chairwoman of the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, who is in charge of organizing the event. She was always very busy. After waiting for half an hour, she gave a brief reply. "As long as the invaders don't stop their aggression, our work to save the country should be even more diligent. It is only when we have reached the stage of national revival that we can consider ourselves to have slightly fulfilled our duty. Seeing the vastness of the disaster area, we cannot slacken in our relief efforts. Therefore, we have overcome all difficulties to stage the two Cantonese operas "Diao Chan" and "Dream of the Red Chamber" in the hope of raising more funds so that the disaster-stricken soldiers and refugees can receive more benefits. At the same time, we want to awaken the masses and encourage everyone to do their best to save the country. The ticket sales have been very good, which shows the enthusiasm of our compatriots. Advance tickets are available at Hong Hing Hong on Des Voeux Road Central, and tickets can be purchased on the performance day at the Tai Ping Theatre. However, those who have already purchased tickets should first go to the China Emporium or the Tai Ping Theatre to exchange their ticket stubs for admission tickets."

Although her words were simple, they were full of patriotic emotions, which were touching. Let us not forget to save the country while singing and dancing. Compatriots, please do not miss this opportunity!

### "Birth" in Hong Kong

—

In the eyes of foreigners, the three things that Chinese people are most willing to spend money on are: birth, marriage, and death. In fact, this is something we cannot deny.

Birth, marriage, and death in Hong Kong naturally cannot escape the realm of spending money. But the money is spent, so how is it spent? - This is what we want to talk about here.

Birth is very vigorous in Hong Kong. You see, every street, every building has so many children.

Midwifery in Hong Kong has reached a considerable degree of advancement. In addition to the maternity wards of public and private hospitals and private lying-in hospitals, there are almost every thirty to forty houses with a midwife practicing with a sign. They all seem to have a customary practice, everyone uses the word "Gu" to call them, such as "X Da Gu", "X Er Gu" ...... the signs are not far apart. The cost of midwifery is not fixed. Hospitals and maternity wards have different prices, the high ones can be as high as twenty or thirty dollars for two days, the low ones can be as low as five cents a day. There are also free ones. If you hire a practicing midwife to assist in childbirth, the remuneration is also not fixed, ten dollars, five dollars, two or three dollars are also acceptable, generally poor families can be flexible.

When the child is born, the midwife habitually reports the parents' names, addresses, and occupations to the Birth and Death Registration Office in the Hygiene Department on the second floor of the General Post Office. They will then send a letter asking you to vaccinate the baby within a week. At the same time, you can ask the office for the baby's birth certificate - commonly known as "birth paper".

The above mentioned are all proper matters and involve spending money. Now we start talking about it -

When a child is born, everyone considers it a happy event, and a happy event needs to be celebrated. If it is a boy, then everyone is even happier and the celebration is doubled.

On the third day after the child is born, commonly known as "Three Days", it is customary to report the good news to the mother's family. Of course, the reporting of good news will not be done "simply", but also add some relevant gifts; usually it is "chicken wine" and ginger vinegar.

"Chicken wine" is a "specialized" term, it is made of chicken, pork liver, pork genitals, etc., and cooked with wine.

Ginger vinegar is ginger, pork knuckles, and vinegar.

When the mother's family receives the good news, the grandmother will prepare a small teapot, lampstand, etc. ... and send it to set up the "Bedside Goddess" - enshrined at the foot of the bed to protect the baby god - and also send some small clothes, hats, ornaments to the newborn baby.

After the "Three Days" pass, another eight days is the "Twelve Days". On this day, the family of the child's birth will give ginger vinegar as gifts to relatives and friends.

The grandmother sends a batch of clothes, ornaments, and this gift, of course, varies in wealth, usually it is usually small cloth clothes, jade bracelets... Some families want silk, satin, brocade, jewelry, jade hats, gold Eight Immortals, jade Buddha Buddha, ...... everything.

Closer relatives of the mother's family, such as aunts and uncles, also send some gifts of condolence.

After the "Twelve Days" pass, "Full Month" is approaching. Before the "Full Month", relatives and friends gradually send gifts.

The range of gifts is of course very wide, silk robes, gold bracelets, gold and jade hats, foreign-made children's clothes, scarves, strollers, cradles... In simple cases, it is also acceptable to use a red envelope with one or two dollars written on it as "Respect for the Full Month".

The degree of favor depends on the relationship, if you are a bank manager, they are bank employees, clerks, if you encounter your little darling, "Full Month Celebration", they will naturally not give you a thin dollar, "Respect for the Full Month". If you are a purchasing agent, they are businessmen, they will naturally give you a thick ...

On the day of the full moon, the grandmother will again dispatch family members to send a large batch of goods, long robes, etc., inevitably, because Chinese people like to dress up five-month-old children like fifty-year-old grandfathers, other clothes, hats, ornaments are all sent as much as possible.

The day the child turns one month old is the time to distribute red eggs! The red eggs are dyed with red pigment and distributed to relatives and friends, the number of which is also proportional to the friendship and the thickness of the gifts.

If you receive a lot of gifts, you must thank your relatives and friends on the day of the full moon. "Courtesy demands reciprocity". The way to thank is to invite to wine. A large number of "ginger invitation cards" fly out. Whether it is "at home" or "at XX restaurant", in short, make it so that friends are full of seats, the dishes are delicious, everyone drinks heartily, "Next year it's your turn to invite ginger wine!" "Next year you invite again!" After everyone drinks a round, the dishes are in a mess, and everyone takes two red eggs back home. It is said to be good intentions before dispersing.

The one-month process of birth in Hong Kong is roughly as above: of course, "One custom per village." Hong Kong, which is located in all directions, naturally has many different customs; to save type, it is not convenient to list them all here. In short, the above is the common, most popular, and almost the same as Guangzhou customs (the following two chapters, marriage and death, will follow the same example)

Speaking of how much money is spent? I'm sorry I can't tell you; the amount of money spent on birth, marriage, and death is so much because it is impossible to estimate; even if you are a PhD in economics, an accounting expert cannot estimate it.

(Tomorrow: Marriage in Hong Kong)

### After Replenishment, the Japanese Invaded Tunchang; The Fighting Was Fierce; We Resisted Heroically, and the Enemy Made No Progress; The Japanese Troops in Jiashi Retreated in Separate Routes After Our Fierce Attacks.

[Express News from the Southern Route] After a month of respite and replenishment, the Japanese troops in Qionghai have recently invaded our positions again, attempting to penetrate deep into the central part of Qionghai, in order to achieve their dream of controlling the entire Qiongya. However, our brave soldiers and civilians, under the command of the commanders, have resisted heroically and launched counterattacks on all lines to contain the Japanese invasion. The battle situation obtained here is as follows:

Fierce Fighting Unfolds in the Mountains of Tunchang

The Japanese troops in Chengmai and Ding'an, attempting to expand their power, have repeatedly sent troops to invade in recent days. On the 23rd, the Japanese sent more than 300 troops to attack Tunchang. The security regiment of Wang Yi's troops stationed there immediately joined forces with the local natives to bravely meet the enemy. The area near Tunchang is full of overlapping mountain peaks, and our soldiers and civilians are familiar with the terrain, so they launched a mountain guerrilla war and dealt with the Japanese troops. Although the Japanese army used its fierce artillery fire to attack us, our army was able to take advantage of the terrain and stand still. On the 24th, the Japanese sent three aircraft as a prelude, covering hundreds of infantry to attack again. The fierce fighting was fierce. The Japanese aircraft dropped bombs wildly on our positions. Villages in the vicinity of Tunchang were tragically bombed by the Japanese army and razed to the ground. In the end, our troops resisted heroically, and the Japanese made no progress. The battle is still in progress. Wang Yi, the garrison commander of Qiongya, has sent a security team to the area of Longtang and Xichang in Tunchang to form a strong position to block the Japanese invasion.

Our Army Counterattacks and Fiercely Attacks Jiashi

Since Jiashi City in eastern Qiong was occupied by the Japanese, our security regiment and guerrilla teams have retreated and ambushed near the suburbs, repeatedly attacking the Japanese. There are currently about 1,000 Japanese troops in Jiashi City, who have been forcing villagers to build a highway to Wenqu in recent days. Yang Yongren, commander of the Eastern District, reported that he had launched a counterattack on Jiashi with a certain security regiment and a certain guerrilla team of several hundred men on the 22nd. The Japanese army relied on superior artillery fire to defend strongly. Our troops were not afraid of death and rushed into the Japanese positions. From midnight until dawn the next day, the battle was not over. Dozens of Japanese troops were killed. At dawn, the mission was completed and they returned to their original defenses. In this battle, many of the Japanese military's construction lines and telegraph poles were destroyed, and two Japanese flags were captured. Therefore, the Japanese army is building defenses on a large scale in the suburbs of Jiashi, and they are extremely busy preventing our army from attacking again. However, according to the latest news, the Japanese troops in the area have now retreated to Haikou in separate routes and have automatically blown up bridges. Our army is intercepting them on the way.

### The Japanese Attempt to Invade the Southern Part of Xinhui and Resort to Dishonest Means; They Fled After Being Intercepted by Us

(Zhongshan Express News) The remaining Japanese troops in Xin are now confined to a corner. Our counter-attacking troops are focusing on the Xinhe Road area to win a favorable position and have moved to the Duruan defense line, between Mu and Mowu. There are many remaining Japanese troops. The Jiangfo Road is still held by our troops and the Japanese troops are still holding each other. Between the villages of Shuanglong, the Japanese troops on the Xin Kai Road are trapped in Huicheng. The Japanese troops are now planning to invade the southern part of Xinhui with ulterior motives, and are secretly planning to cut off our inland sea transportation line from the Four Counties. The Japanese troops invaded the Ji Jing Hang near Lile a few days ago, and were intercepted by our local troops along the way. They have returned to the area of Du Hui and Jiang Zui.

### Guangdong Province Builds a Strong Economic Barrier; Eradicates the Import of Enemy Goods and Strictly Prevents National Resources from Assisting the Enemy; Export Inspection Measures to be Implemented Starting Tomorrow

(Shaoguan Express News) The Provincial Government recently received an order from the Central Government to actively strengthen economic defense, eradicate the import of enemy goods, and strictly prevent National Resources from assisting the enemy. It immediately consulted the Eradication of Enemy Goods Committee of the General Mobilization Committee to comply with the order and expedite the formulation of measures for implementation. The Committee has now started to work on registration and inspection. In terms of registration, it is planned that all those who purchase or transport goods from outside the province must apply for registration. The contents of the application form are planned to include: (1) the name and type of the goods purchased or transported; (2) the name and address of the producer; (3) the trademark; (4) the quantity purchased or transported; (5) the unit price and total price of the goods; (6) the destination and origin of the goods. The goods may not be distributed until they have been registered and inspected. All registration measures have also been formulated. If the origin or destination of the goods is in a guerrilla area, registration may be refused, except for special permits. If the goods transported are consumables that are not necessary for people's livelihood, the registered quantity may be reduced according to the circumstances, and registration may be completely refused if necessary. If the goods transported are enemy goods, the transportation is absolutely prohibited. In short, only goods imported that are not enemy goods and are needed by the province will be allowed to be purchased and imported. This measure can be implemented after consultation with the Provincial Government for review and approval. In terms of export goods inspection, the Eradication of Enemy Goods Committee has also formulated measures. In addition to legal registration, personnel must be sent to conduct actual inspections. Only goods that are clearly free of assisting the enemy or fraud will be allowed to be exported. If the goods are exported by sea, an application for inspection should be made to the Customs House with the permit and bill of lading before the goods arrive at the Customs Warehouse and are extracted. Only goods that are found to be consistent with the contents of the permit and are free of enemy assistance or fraud will be allowed to be shipped. If the goods purchased are mailed, the permit must be brought to the inspection office for inspection before sealing and mailing, and the goods must be stamped piece by piece before they can be transported for sale. If the goods inspected do not match the contents of the permit, or there is suspicion of assisting the enemy, the inspector may detain them for verification. If the goods are found to be enemy assistance items, they shall be sent to the local government by the inspection office and handled in accordance with the Regulations on the Prohibition of Enemy Goods or the Regulations on the Prohibition of Transporting Enemy Assistance Items. The above inspection measures have been approved by the Provincial Government and will be implemented next month.

### × Airplane Bombs Sixth District of Xinhui

More Than Twenty Killed or Wounded (Zhongshan Express) Recently, the Jiang-Hui × army has been repeatedly and fiercely attacked by our army, its military strength has been greatly depleted, and it is waiting to be besieged. However, it constantly sends planes to bomb the various villages of Xinhui, which are suffering greatly. On the 27th, at around 10:00 AM, an × airplane attacked Dianbei, the sixth district. That day happened to be a market day, and there were many visitors. The × airplane dropped a bomb on the market, killing and wounding more than twenty people. It also dropped a bomb on the Xiaomiao temple in Lukou, killing and wounding four people, it is said.

### Naval Vessels Harass Southern Coastal Areas—Pursuing Fishing Boats Off Xuwen

(Southern Route Express) The × situation in the southern coastal areas has not changed significantly, but the × naval vessels' harassing actions seem more intense, likely intended for intimidation and disturbance. Coastal defense forces are on high alert, with thorough defense preparations already in place. Even if the × forces invade, it won't be easy for them to succeed. Recent nonsensical actions of the × army are recorded below.

Xuwen

In recent days, × naval vessels have shuttled back and forth off the coast of Xuwen, but all are transiting and there have been no harassing actions. On the 26th, two × motorboats, each carrying more than twenty × soldiers, suddenly sailed from the mouth of Leizhou into Xuwen's Boxia Port, cruising and spying about 5,000 meters from the shore, and firing machine guns at the shore for thirty to forty minutes. Seeing that we paid no attention, they then sailed away. In recent days, dense cannon fire has been heard frequently off the coast of Xuwen, coming from the direction of Hainan Island, presumably our army on Hainan Island counterattacking the ×.

Pursuing Fishing Boats

Furthermore, in the Beihai sea area, although × naval vessels have been harassing recently, fishermen are forced to venture out to sea to work for food and clothing. On the 25th, five fishing boats were fishing off Guantou Ridge. While they were working, three × motorboats suddenly arrived and chased the fishing boats. Two of them were unable to escape and were seized by the ×. The other two escaped quickly, fortunately avoiding disaster, but one fisherman, Huang Shun, was killed. Now, fishermen in Beihai and other places, seeing the ferocity of the × army, mostly dare not go out to sea.

Coastal Vessels Seek Shelter from Wind in Wanshan Islands

[Zhongshan Express] The × naval vessels off the coast of Zhongshan are gradually withdrawing. Some time ago, × airplanes狂襲 the coastal areas of the fifth and sixth districts of Zhongshan, and villagers scattered in droves. Now order has gradually been restored, and villagers are returning to their homes one after another. Currently, because × naval vessels from the coastal areas of Tangjiawan, Xiangzhou, Yaikou, and Sanzao Island have sailed to the Wanshan Islands to seek shelter from the wind, they have disappeared for the past two days. Fishing boats have also resumed fishing.

Movement of Vessels on the Lower Reaches of the West River

(Zhongshan Express) According to reports, three shallow-water gunboats, Nos. 63, 61, and 50, are docked near the Shakou Wharf in the Jiujiang and Heqing areas on the lower reaches of the West River. Two shallow-water gunboats are docked across from the Heqing Xinglou on the Hexi side, one of which appears to be the flagship of the × army commander. There are also more than twenty steamships, armored vessels, and landing craft. The armored vessels are converted fishing boats, with two machine guns mounted in the center and six machine guns on the sides. In recent days, × naval vessels have been transporting × soldiers back and forth between Jiujiang and the river mouth, seemingly for troop rotation. On the 28th, two × armored vessels snuck to Zhutou Mountain and transported 300 × soldiers to reinforce defenses.

### Our Troops on the Bo-Zeng Line Storm Zengcheng, Bombing Encampments, Enemy Threatens Large-Scale Sweep

(Dongjiang Express) There have been no major battles on the Zengcheng-Conghua and Zengcheng-Bolo lines, nor in the Luofu Mountain area, in recent days. The × army in Zengcheng is using strong fortifications and superior firepower to hold Zengjiang and defend the city. However, our guerrillas are still very active.

Our Regiment Storms Zengcheng

The Xi Zhiyang unit of the Third Battalion of the Third Guerrilla Column, active on the Bo-Zeng Highway, coordinated with the daredevil squad of Chen's Regiment, gathering more than a hundred men at 4:00 AM on the 26th, and stormed into Zengcheng from the south, attacking the × army entrenched in the county middle school. They breached the back gate of the county middle school. At the time, all the × soldiers had gone out, with only a dozen or so left to guard. Our army group then densely threw hand grenades, completely resolving the situation on the spot, and bombed part of the × camp before safely withdrawing.

Enemy Threatens Large-Scale Sweep

The × army in Zengcheng, having been repeatedly attacked by our army groups, has declared that it will launch a large-scale sweep of our units within the week. The people in the villages near Zengcheng are once again in great panic, and the masses are fleeing in an endless stream. It has been discovered that the number of × soldiers stationed in Zengcheng has slightly increased, and many machine gun and artillery emplacements have been built along the Zengjiang River. They are constantly and aimlessly firing at the villages of Sujiaocun, and many local houses have been bombed. It is speculated that their intention is to suppress military morale. Film.

### Famous Hollywood Composer to Study Chinese Drama Music
— Kun

To Produce Chinese Musical Film Titled "Hong Kong Singing Girl"

J.K. Frimsom, the famous Hollywood drama song producer of "Rosemarie" and "Blue Kitten," has, for the sake of studying Chinese drama music, made a special long journey, and arrived in Hong Kong by Clipper ship from the United States some days ago, a journey of over 10,000 miles. According to Mr. Frimsom, American music is too "black," and needs a change in style. He believes that the best substitute is Chinese music.

He also said that although Chinese music is still old-fashioned, with a little thought, it can be remade and become much more moving. And it must be done this way in order to bring out "the righteous tones of China."

Mr. Frimsom is preparing to make a Chinese musical film, titled "Hong Kong Singing Girl" (Sfng Kong Girl). He has already completed part of the script, and the plot starts in Hong Kong, then moves to New York, with the aim of harmonizing Chinese and American music.

He also plans to lead a film crew to China to film Hong Kong scenery. He said, "We could arrange Chinese sets in Hollywood, but I don't want to do that, because that would lose the authentic Chinese flavor."

He also wants to find a beautiful Chinese girl in Hong Kong who is fluent in English to play the lead role in the film.

Mr. Frimsom is a lover of Chinese drama. When Dr. Mei Lanfang went to the United States to perform, Mr. Frimsom did a lot of work to introduce him. He learned a section of "Drunkenness" from Dr. Mei, and his costume was featured in several American newspapers, "calling him our Yang Guifei."

### China's Child Star, Hao Xiaoyun

Speaking of Hao Xiaoyun, some people may ask, thinking she is a newly emerging child star. In fact, she started acting as far back as five years ago, with early performances in "Big Family," "Good Fortune," and "Zi Yan Girl," etc. However, she didn't occupy important roles, sometimes barely showing her face, without even a chance to speak, causing her to be overlooked by the audience. Her original name was Genyun, and she started acting at the age of eight, so people in the film circle call her Hao Baobao. She is eleven years old this year and studies at Shangxian Hall Primary School. Her father is from Beiping and knows how to act. She received her father's influence, giving her fluent Mandarin. She can sing, dance, and also understands Peking Opera, singing well. It is said that "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao" is her specialty. Her face is like a butterfly, but without dimples, she can't shake off the childishness of her childhood. A certain film magazine once published her photo, calling her the Shirley Temple of China. In terms of appearance, she can be considered one of the more beautiful child stars in China.

### Special Figures in Hollywood, Chaplin is the Richest

Among Hollywood stars, the richest is Chaplin. The income tax he pays annually is already several million US dollars. However, he is unlucky in marriage. After divorcing Ge Tede, whom he had been married to for less than a year, he fell in love with a Swedish girl. The woman undoubtedly loves money. His new film "The Great Dictator" will undoubtedly earn him hundreds of thousands of dollars. Norma Shearer is the cleverest

The cleverest in Hollywood is Norma Shearer, with an air of grace and a sensitive style, as charming as "Marie Antoinette." Her private life is also like this. Her companions call her "Angel." The most charming is Claudette Colbert

The most charming is Claudette Colbert. From "It Happened One Night" to "Midnight," every film she appears in is enchanting. Her face is not more beautiful than others, but she has "It," that is, the "charm" that is worth a lot in Hollywood. She has more of this than others.

Carole Lombard is the Most Speculative

The most speculative is Carole Lombard. She is known for playing "smart alecks," and often uses articles or conversations to create an air of admiration. She has a famous saying: "Since others cannot feel beauty in me, why not make them feel a kind of awkwardness?" Her business acumen really started from this.

Film Novel

### Drama School. Produced by MGM. Starring: Louise Rainer, Allan Marshal, Pauline Goddard

Louise said: "Every night I-" then she suddenly stopped talking. They certainly wondered about her. Although they were hypocritical and secretly looked down on her, she still managed to capture their imagination. She made them feel she was a mysterious person – which was indeed a good act. "Do you want to know?" she ended softly.

At work she told Annie about Nana's behavior. "I can't blame Nana, I sympathize with her, she is very miserable, that's why her attitude is like that. Maybe it's to make the things that make her miserable seem ordinary to me, so she hates me. She needs love, but that young man doesn't pay any attention to her at all. She just-"

"So she is suffering from a broken heart, isn't she?" Annie interjected. "That's very normal, a young person has desires. Did you have such an experience?"

Louise's bird-black eyes said dreamily: "I have already obtained a lot! For example, today, I was Marie Antoinette – walking to the guillotine – they cut off my head. Tomorrow I will become Juliet again, with Romeo as my lover. Isn't that enough?" In fact, it wasn't. An eighteen-year-old girl can't never dream of trying some sweet love. A woman with an active imagination and a lifetime of acting in the illusion of reality can't never be in danger of falling in love.

The incident happened that night in the factory. A group of slum inspectors came before twelve o'clock. As Anna said, to see "how the other half lives."

Qina, the star of the cabaret troupe, was also there, along with several band leaders. Also Marquis Antret, the richest handsome man in Paris. It is said that he was in love with Qina at this time, preparing to hold a new performance for her. They entered the dark, dirty workplace. Nana said, "It's really a great insight to come here to observe! It's so meaningful to use life here as the background for the performance! I'll play a female worker, sitting next to the machine all night—"

She was standing next to Louise. "Please teach me, dear, how do you use your hands? Every time I play a role, I always carefully experience it." Louise looked up and saw that Qina was dressed very gorgeously, she was the focus of everyone's eyes in the nightclub. But she was not really an actress, just a cabaret girl who was being promoted. Louise did not feel that she was enviable or jealous at all in her heart.

"Of course," Qina continued, "my posture when moving still needs to be improved."

### South China Soccer Team to Depart Today Because Guangdong Steamer Temporarily Rescheduled to Depart Today

(Special Report) "A cup of parting wine, a century of thoughts on the river; I wish you farewell from now on, often seeing white hair." South China Soccer Friends, set off on your journey, I gather this sentence to give you.

The team was originally scheduled to start its first leg yesterday. I don't know why it was temporarily postponed. After lunch, I went to the Queen's Pier, only to see smoke and rain filling the river, and waves rising and falling, giving a feeling of sorrow at parting on the riverbank in the wind. I hoped, but around the pier, I didn't see a single shadow of a South China player. I thought I had arrived too early.

At 2:15, Lin Zhonghao, Chen Rong, and other friends also arrived. Meeting each other, we discussed the upcoming southern expedition. After a while, the scheduled departure time had arrived, but there was still no movement. We then guessed that there must be a change in this. We immediately called the club to inquire and learned that the Guangdong Steamer had been rescheduled to depart at 4:00 PM today. Thus, the team's itinerary was delayed by another twenty-four hours. Leader Mo was certainly delighted, saying, "This is exactly what I wanted."

The team includes (goalkeepers) Bao Jiaping, Zhang Rongcai, (fullbacks) Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Mai Shaohan, (halfbacks) Guo Yingqi, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai, Yang Genbao, (forwards) Li Shuoyou, Luo Douwen, Zhuo Shijin, Li Zhaorong, Chen Deduo, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Liu Songsheng, Deng Guangsen, Yang Shuiyi, leader Mo Qing, secretary Zhou Runnian.

However, Li Huitang was unable to depart with the main force today due to a problem with his leave. He will catch up with the team when they arrive in the Dutch East Indies, as the Dutch East Indies had an agreement with South China that Huitang must participate in the expedition before they would allow them entry.

Mai Shaohan's foot injury has not fully recovered, and he will also not be able to accompany the team. However, he is a fixed member, and may travel to Singapore to join them later.

Li Shuoyou is still serving a suspension, so whether he will be able to go is questionable. If he gets approval from the Football Association, he may also travel to Singapore with Shaohan to join the team.

Zhuo Shijin gained Leader Mo's favor and asked the Kowloon Electricity Company for leave. He was only approved at 1:00 PM yesterday, and can now set off happily. It is unknown what Tan Zhenhui, Ye Beihua, and others will think of this.

All players, club members, relatives, and friends should gather at the Queen's Pier at 2:00 PM this afternoon and take a lighter to the Guangdong Steamer. "Do not let your intentions go with the flowing water; come back in the cool autumn of September." I wish you all a healthy journey and frequent reports of victory.

### Student Relief Society Holds Sea Bath

The Hong Kong Student Relief Society has been very active in its work since its third election. In addition to stepping up various fundraising campaigns, the Society is also making unremitting efforts to unite students from various schools. Recently, as the summer approaches and the weather turns hot, students from various schools are fond of sea bathing. The Society, in order to seize this opportunity to unite students through recreational activities, has specifically scheduled a sea bath at Clear Water Bay on June 11th. It is said that the Society will charter a boat to transport the students on that day, and there will be music, singing, collective games, and other programs along the way to add to the fun. If possible, there will also be brief topical discussions. The Society originally wanted to charge only four dimes for this sea bath, but later, due to the limited seats on the boat and the high cost, it was changed to five dimes per person. It is said that the Society started selling tickets yesterday, and students from various schools are enthusiastically buying them. In order to facilitate the participation of students from various schools, the Society has specifically stipulated that tickets will be sold at the Society every day from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM and from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, it is said.

### Twenty Secrets of Gymnastics

Gymnastics is an exercise that should be done in the overall war of resistance. I have written an article in this newspaper about it. However, whether gymnastics is effective for our physical training, and whether the effectiveness is rapid, depends on whether the selection of materials is appropriate and whether the training method is appropriate. I have compiled twenty points of attention based on my experience in teaching gymnastics, and named them "Twenty Secrets of Gymnastics." Although many of them are commonplaces, they can also be used as an aid for those who aspire to physical training and are willing to use gymnastics methods. Zou Fa

(1) The ability of gymnastics to be effective depends on the correct posture of the movements, which is the most important thing. The so-called correct posture means that the movement can meet the appropriate requirements. If the movement cannot meet the appropriate requirements, not only will the muscles of part A not be able to contract appropriately to complete the movement mission of that part, but it will also affect part B. Misunderstandings will be confused and lead to abnormal development.

(2) Warm-up exercises are to speed up blood circulation and gradually increase the relatively low body temperature at rest, so that the movements can be flexible and without stagnation when continuing to exercise. It is an indispensable task before performing any exercise, and gymnastics is no exception. Common warm-up exercises are mostly based on lower limb exercises – stepping, walking, running, etc., but gymnastics does not use this kind of warm-up exercise, but mostly uses limb exercises instead, which is also possible.

(3) Gymnastics should focus on trunk exercises and secondary on limb exercises, because in daily work, limbs have more or less opportunities for exercise, while the trunk has very few, and all the main organs are hidden in the trunk. The continuation of life depends entirely on the master. Strengthening the trunk can indirectly strengthen the internal organs, so that we can obtain the true health of a full vitality. It is enough to practice gymnastics. It is acceptable to do less limb exercise, but it is not acceptable to do less trunk exercise.

(4) Trunk exercises should focus on chest and abdominal/waist exercises, and secondary on shoulder and back exercises, because performing chest exercises can affect the back, and performing upper limb exercises can affect the shoulders, while the respiratory organs are located in the chest, and the digestive organs are located in the abdomen and waist. It is difficult to achieve direct strengthening effects without the stimulation of chest and abdominal/waist exercises. Therefore, when performing trunk exercises, it is acceptable to do less back exercise, but it is not acceptable to do less chest and abdominal exercise.

(5) The method of chest exercise must be performed with the three movements of "shrinking chest," "contracting abdomen," and "retracting both shoulders" simultaneously to achieve the purpose of straightening the chest. If one of these three movements cannot be done, even if any limb exercises are added to help, it will be difficult to fully achieve the purpose of straightening the chest.

(6) When doing trunk twisting abdominal/waist exercises, the lower limbs must not move their direction with the body. When doing upper body forward bending abdominal exercises, the lower limbs must not be bent. When doing squatting body bending abdominal exercises, the lower limbs should be bent deeply, otherwise it will become a lower limb exercise, not an abdominal/waist exercise.

(7) When doing trunk exercises and using limb movements to help, the focus should be on simplicity and effectiveness, and there is no need to specialize in fancy and complicated movements. Simple movements can be done without thinking, and the posture is also easy to be correct. Complex movements must be considered, and those who are not confident in training will inevitably take care of this and lose that, which is contrary to the purpose of regulating brain power and achieving concrete results.

(8) Gymnastic movements must be lively and natural. The movements must be continuous and rhythmic. The tension and relaxation of the muscles must be appropriately adjusted. Do not make movements that last too long, causing the muscles to contract too much, or do not allow the muscles to have a chance to relax from beginning to end, causing the muscles to be stiff and unable to cope with unusual environments.

(9) Gymnastic movements must have active and passive parts. The exercise goal only needs to pay attention to the active part. For example, if the upper limbs help straighten the chest, then straightening the chest is active and the upper limbs are passive. When exercising, you only need to pay attention to making the muscles of the chest contract as much as possible, while the upper limbs can be natural and relaxed as much as possible.

(10) Gymnastics must enable the whole body to achieve even development. One gymnastics exercise should not be biased towards a few parts, and one section of gymnastics should not employ local muscles. The movements on the left and right sides must be equal as much as possible. Do not do the left side and neglect the right side, or do the right side and neglect the left side. (11)

### Truth About Postponement of Shenbao Cup Charity Match - Due to Unsuccessful Venue Application - Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow Night - Competition Schedule to be Re-Edited

...The Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Match, originally scheduled to begin last night (29th), had to be postponed due to the renovation of the YMCA gymnasium, causing the audience who came with enthusiasm to return disappointed.

...The Basketball Association Committee had already decided to hold the charity match last night, with the first game between Zhixing and Southwest. However, the renovation of the gymnasium led to the postponement. According to the Association, there was no clear explanation for the reason, and the originally scheduled order of the charity match will need to be re-edited. The Association will hold a meeting on Thursday night to discuss all matters.

...According to another source, the Association did not send a letter to the YMCA to borrow the venue 48 hours in advance (the YMCA only received the Association's venue request letter at 10:00 AM on the 29th). Therefore, the YMCA stated that the procedures were not followed, and at the same time, the gymnasium was under renovation and could not be borrowed. As a result, the charity match was postponed. The future competition date will be decided after the Association holds a meeting to discuss it.

...Reporter's Note: The Shenbao Cup Women's Charity Match is purely for the purpose of appealing for refugees, which is a righteous act and should not be delayed. In my opinion, the Association's actions are inappropriate, but there is still room for flexibility. It is hoped that the righteous act will be realized as soon as possible without unnecessary complications.

### Fourteen Types of Tennis Strokes

American professional tennis expert Charles, based on his experience in tennis, published an article "Fourteen Types of Tennis Strokes" in a tennis magazine. The theory is simple and easy to follow. It has been published in the book "Tennis Rules" and is specially reprinted here for those who like this sport to study. Po Jun

(1) Throw the ball into the air, about five feet high, and hit the ball from above with the racket, while moving the body forward and sweeping forcefully - this is the first step of the American-style topspin serve.

(2) All the weight of the body should be on the left foot, with the legs crossed in a cross shape, forming a balanced posture - this is the posture at the end of the serve.

(3) At the moment when the racket and the ball come into contact, the eyes must be directly on the tennis ball, and the left arm should be rotated with this movement to form a balanced posture. At that time, the weight of the whole body is also shifted from the left foot to the right foot - this is the most important point of the serve.

(4) When hitting the ball, the weight of the whole body moves from the left foot to the right foot. Pay attention to how to use the left arm to successfully achieve a balanced posture - this is the posture of hitting the ball in front of the body.

(5) When hitting a backhand, this low backhand position is very useful for defense. Pay attention to the crossing of the arms and the position of the racket touching the ball on the left side of the body - this is the position of the racket when hitting a backhand.

(6) The racket only needs to move a short distance, not too fast, but the face of the racket should be facing up - this is the posture at the end of hitting a backhand.

(7) When the racket is about to touch the ball, the weight of the body is on the left foot, and the degree of rotation should be very short. At the same time, hit the ball with the face of the racket to make the ball fly into the air - this is the method of hitting a low ball in front of the body.

(8) Hit the sliced ​​ball with the forearm in a short downward motion, which is best suited for a fast serve, but this hitting method can be used in any area of ​​the court, especially when the ball is parallel to the shoulder - this is the method of hitting a sliced ​​ball with the forearm.

(9) Pay attention to how to make the racket meet the ball rising from the ground. At this time, the task of the left hand is the most important, and a balanced posture can be maintained - this is the initial method of driving the ball with the forearm.

(10) If you hit the ball with your forearm before it lands, then you must hold the racket tightly like a sliced ​​ball, and lean your body forward to have a clear target for the ball. At that time, the weight of the body is also on the left foot, and the crossing of the arms also forms a cross shape - this is the method of hitting the ball with the forearm before it lands.

(11) With the arms crossed and the weight on the right foot, if you are driving the ball, then the actual weight should be shifted from the right foot to the left foot - this is the initial method of hitting the ball with a backhand.

(12) The backhand volley is one of the most difficult types of shots to hit. All the weight of the body is focused on the right foot, but after hitting the ball, the weight is shifted from the right foot to the left foot - this is the backhand volley.

(13) A low backhand chip shot is mostly used for defense. The distance the racket moves when hitting the ball should be short, so that the ball is intercepted clearly at a point very close to the ground - this is the method of hitting a low backhand.

(14) When hitting and chipping the ball with the forearm, pay attention to how to use the left arm to maintain a balanced posture, and how to make the weight fall on the left foot, and how to lean the body towards the ball. This posture is rarely seen in tennis stars being able to apply it to serves and returns - this is the method of hitting and chipping the ball with the forearm.

### Unprecedented in Decades - Sharp Fall in Japanese Yen - Japanese Banking Sector Appears to Not Support It

[Shanghai Special Dispatch] Since the Ministry of Finance announced the new monetary policy, with banks nationalized to prevent speculation, money exchange businesses have been greatly affected. Since the outbreak of the war and the serious situation in Shanghai, holders have been vying to exchange foreign currencies, and the industry has been thriving. Also, because Shanghai adopts a remittance bill system, money exchange shops also operate remittance discounting, making considerable profits. In addition, as inland transportation gradually recovers, travelers need Japanese yen for transportation, and the industry's buying and selling of Japanese yen has also become busy. Therefore, Shanghai investors, seeing the development of the industry, have been raising funds to open more and more money exchange shops. The money exchange shops along Sichuan Road are densely distributed, which can be said to be the golden age of the money exchange industry. Each shop has made substantial profits. Recently, the largest transaction in each money exchange shop is the buying and selling of Japanese yen bills. The daily trading of Japanese yen in the money exchange shops along Sichuan Road is always more than three million yuan. However, the price of the Japanese yen has fallen sharply, only worth about 90% of Chinese legal tender. It is said that the main reason for the sharp fall is that someone is selling Japanese yen in bulk. At the same time, it is heard that someone is buying a large amount of Chinese legal tender to be used as the issuance reserve of a certain bank, and some are trying to buy Chinese legal tender with Japanese yen. As for "Huaxing notes, it is heard that they have been found in Hongkou. The price is unknown. However, because foreign banks refuse to accept them, money exchange shops have also decided to refuse to exchange them.

### Demand for Japanese Yen Has Decreased

The English-language Great America Evening Post said that today (the 23rd) the Japanese yen reached a new low, with its value plummeting to 88 cents in legal tender. It is said to be the lowest price of the Japanese yen in decades. At 10:30 this morning, money exchange shops on Sichuan Road bought Japanese yen at 88 cents in legal tender and sold it at 88.4 cents. However, this exchange rate slightly improved in the afternoon, with the buying rate being 89 cents and the selling rate being 89.4 cents. In other words, this afternoon, 89.4 yuan in legal tender could buy 100 Japanese yen. The continuous decline of the Japanese yen here is due to the reduced demand for Japanese yen in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The low demand for Japanese yen is proportional to the increasing difficulty in collecting these banknotes when taking back Japanese goods.

### Payment for Japanese and Manchurian Goods in Foreign Currency

In recent weeks, the Japanese authorities have placed greater obstacles for foreign tourists and Japanese people to carry Japanese yen back to Japan from Shanghai and Hong Kong. Also, the payment for Japanese and "Manchurian" goods transported to Shanghai in Japanese yen has mostly been stopped. For example, for "Manchurian" soybeans shipped to Shanghai, some of the payments were made in Japanese yen for several months. However, since the beginning of last month, the export of "Manchurian" soybeans has been controlled by the "government," and Dalian exporters have had to insist on payment in foreign currency. These recent developments have forced the Japanese yen to fall below legal tender in the open market in Shanghai. However, the market price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai, which is often 30% lower than the face value, has been almost a year. As early as July last year, it was possible to buy 100 Japanese bank notes for 100 to 110 yuan in legal tender here.

### Two Important Factors

The depreciation of the Japanese yen is in principle determined by two factors: (1) One yen of the Bank of Japan is equal to one shilling and two pence. Due to the increase in the amount of paper money in circulation, the sharp rise in domestic prices in Japan, and the reduction in the reserve of the Bank of Japan, the ratio is indeed too high. (2) Even if a huge amount of Japanese yen is not circulating in Central China, the price of Japanese yen banknotes in Shanghai is bound to be lower than in Japan. Now, in fact, the amount of Japanese yen in Central China is very large, and adding pressure to the local market price of Japanese yen is inevitable.

### Connections

— Geng Zhi

With "face," and being skilled in "eloquence" and "tactics," it seems that one has exhausted all the abilities to live in this world, and can do whatever one wants and be invincible. However, I always feel that the "trilogy" is not as good as the "tetralogy," and there is always one more part to add. Only then will it be complete, auspicious, and profitable. Therefore, I dare to risk the repetition of "shortcut" in "certainly" and "C-line" and "pulling strings" in "learning to pull strings," and add this most basic "connections."

The reason for calling it the most basic is that I am inspired by "solid foundation, step-by-step operation": I am also inspired by the fact that buildings cannot be built in the sky, but must be based on the ground. Therefore, connections are a necessary prerequisite for anyone who wants to achieve something, establish something, exert influence, or even just earn a living. With connections, even if you have a skill, whether it is in speech or action, it can be greatly promoted. Flowers will bloom and fruits will be borne on this "strength." Even if you are completely incapable, you won't have to break your rice bowl. Otherwise, it's hard to say. No matter how great your ability is, who will see it? Confucius had no connections, so he had to work as a "farm clerk" (cheng tian) and a "warehouse manager" (wei li). When he had no other options, he was even willing to be a "night watchman" or a "gatekeeper."

"Don't become an official if you have no one in court" has become an eternal truth. Assuming that you have no "people" in "court," but you still manage to become an "official," then be sure that you will encounter many troubles, be blamed for everything, and inevitably end up packing your bags. If you have "people," then "officials protect each other," and you can definitely smooth things out, turn big problems into small ones, turn small problems into nothing, and be safe and sound until the end of your life. "Mentioning his background is huge," who would dare to offend him? Connections to this point can be preserved, not to mention eloquence or tactics, and even face can be preserved.

It is said that in the past, lawsuits were just a race of connections. Whoever had connections to run and ran fast won the lawsuit. Otherwise, they would lose the lawsuit, and the right and wrong of the accident were not considered or asked. Even to be a thief, you must first look at the connections. Otherwise, you will not be able to enter the door and can only sigh with regret: or even if you have entered the door and entered the room, you will return empty-handed from the treasure mountain and vent your anger with bad behavior. Unfortunately, you will be like falling into the Eight Trigrams Formation, unable to get out of the door, and be captured. Alas, how lovely are connections! Alas, how terrifying are connections!

However, the importance of connections is indeed known to everyone, but where to find connections has become a difficult problem: as for knowing clearly that it is a connection, how to use it is even more difficult. We still need to discuss it in detail.

The ancients said, "There is fragrant grass everywhere under the sky"; I say, "There are connections everywhere under the sky." Therefore, the difficulty of the problem lies not in whether there are connections, but in whether they can be found. Zhang Junrui was able to understand "transferring his thoughts" with just a glance at her "feet," which is to be good at finding connections. I think with this careful attention and intention in everything, the solution to this problem is half solved.

With connections, how to use them? It is said that there are many ways to use them, and the key is diligence. Diligence has been a long-standing principle. If it is to pay respects, it is okay to pay respects repeatedly: if it is to give gifts, it is okay to give gifts repeatedly. Inquiring, asking for advice, flattering, and even eating, drinking tea, playing cards, and playing with prostitutes with them... It is also okay to do it repeatedly... Once familiar, then twice, until they scold you as a bastard and wave you out of the door. Then there is hope of success. This is what Li Hongzhang's confidant told us. Because "Jiang Yuan stepped in the footsteps of a great man and gave birth to Li Yi," occasional walking still has some effect, let alone diligence. Therefore, diligently applying the "must-walk" principle, everything in the world will be settled!

If you are not happy to walk on other people's connections and want others to walk on your connections, of course I also agree very much. As long as you are rich, "there are distant relatives in deep mountains"; as long as you have beauty, "peach and plum trees do not speak, but a path is formed below them." As long as you have great talent, Zhou Wen will naturally walk to the Wei River, and Liu Xuan will naturally visit the thatched cottage three times. As long as you are pure and noble, someone will naturally walk to your "fishing platform" that is higher than the "Yuntai"...

However, I am a little worried for you: Nowadays, the trend of kidnapping and robbery is rampant. Being rich in deep mountains is ultimately not safe. Nowadays, after entering the palace, I am afraid that "those who cannot be seen" are more than "thirty-six years," let alone you "living in seclusion in a deep valley." Nowadays, "yellow bells are destroyed and discarded, and earthenware pots thunder." If you don't come out, who cares? Please fish for a lifetime and sleep soundly for eternity. Nowadays, everyone already only likes to go to "Yaotai," "storm shelters," and even "debt platforms." Even "Yuntai" is not high enough, who is willing to go to the "hook platform"!...

Forget it, since you are a human being, you have to do your best. If you don't want to starve to death, go walk on other people's connections and ask for help!

### A Small Note on the Aurora Museum

— Lan Yan

Most of the intellectual class in Shanghai, buried in a sensual atmosphere, rarely go to places like museums that study academics. To put it bluntly, how many people can often go to the library to smell the fragrance of books?

Someone said that Chinese science is not progressing. I say, at the very least, the living environment of Shanghai people must be changed.

Regarding museums, I know that there are two in the Shanghai concession, one is the museum on Museum Road, and the other is the museum attached to Aurora University.

Before the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Municipal Government spent a lot of money to build a museum and held an exhibition of historical buildings, with very detailed explanations and introductions to the greatness of ancient buildings.

Now, this museum is buried in smoke and rubble, which does make people feel infinitely vicissitudes.

Regarding the Aurora Museum, I had made an exception to visit it once before it was opened to the public. They held a 70th anniversary celebration a few days ago, and the various specimens collected were especially rich.

Now, I will record some materials that are not recorded in the newspapers:

From the Aurora Museum, which has a history of 70 years, we can see that religious scholars have indeed spent amazing energy in China. Starting from the founder Father Zi Zhong, and then Father Lei Mingyuan, Father Bo Duo, Father Bai Ziming, Father Song Yongqing, to the current person in charge, Father Zheng Xiangqian, they have been constantly and tirelessly going through hardships and struggles to collect so many valuable specimens.

These many priests all specialize in collecting one or two kinds of specimens. For example, the deer specimens collected by Father Lei Mingyuan are the most abundant in the Far East (now there are a total of 3,675 kinds): the founder Father Han Duli almost circled the earth seven times in order to collect various specimens: now he has left China with many valuable "Chinese Natural History" works. These works have contributed so much to Chinese natural science research. There is also Father Bai Ziming, who specializes in studying plants, and Father Song Yongqing, who specializes in collecting insects.

The entire museum has three floors. The bottom floor is antiques and bronzes. I had visited this floor before. The second floor is plant specimens and animal specimens. The third floor has insect, shell, and bird specimens.

Among the insect specimens, there are many various kinds of insects and ants that you have never seen before. How they live and how they hatch. For example, a small bamboo tube is a small but perfect hatching place; a piece of soil is the best home for another kind of insect. These specimens are all vividly marked out step by step with their nests and changes.

Especially many colorful butterfly specimens are really beautiful. These insect species representing the colors of nature are worth cherishing.

Among the birds, there are also many exquisite specimens, such as how a very small bird sets up their nest in a tree branch and bamboo tube, and how they incubate their eggs.

After visiting the Aurora Museum, which includes hundreds of thousands of specimens of animals, plants, and insects, it makes people feel the greatness and beauty of nature even more.

### Local Accent

— Tie

The homeland I bid farewell to due to national crisis – Liaoning. As time stretches on, the feeling of longing only intensifies!

Two years ago, we secretly exchanged letters, not daring to openly mention each other's situations, but deep down, we both knew we were safe.

Since the July 7th Incident, communication has been cut off. Although I've sent letters inquiring several times, I haven't received a single reply.

Suddenly, one day, I received a letter that had already been inspected – a letter from "that place." From the stamp style, I could tell it was a "Manchukuo" stamp. Ah, something I haven't seen for over two years, suddenly appearing today, made my blood rush, and my heart pound like a startled deer! I almost dared not open it, fearing it might bring some ominous sign.

"Brother Si: I am leaving for Tianjin today, via Hong Kong, and then transferring to Chongqing. I've entrusted someone to purchase a ticket for me. Please inquire about the sailing schedule nearby and assist with arrangements. Deeply grateful! Your sister, Zhen."

Reading this letter filled me with excitement. Not only did it not contain bad news, but I might soon see my sister Zhen, whom I haven't seen in over seven years, and perhaps get some reliable news from home.

From that day on, I started paying close attention to the ship arrival announcements in the newspapers, something I had never done before. I even became familiar with them. Sometimes, I feared the newspaper might have printed errors, and I would call the China Travel Service to double-check. I caused the telephone operators so much trouble because of this!

Finally, she arrived. I took her to a small house I had rented in advance as a temporary lodging.

On her first day, she was too exhausted from the long journey and taking care of her two young children. I had to postpone hearing the news I was so eager to know for a few hours so she could rest.

That night was the most sleepless I've ever had. I remembered the joys of childhood, the gunfire of the September 18th Incident, and my grandmother's last words before fleeing to Beiping: "Ya! I initially didn't want you to study, and you vehemently opposed me. Now, look at all the people killed by those [Japanese], aren't they all educated people? It's gotten so bad that you can't stay at home anymore. Even though you're not the only child, your younger brother was adopted by your uncle, wasn't he? Your parents are getting old, and in my twilight years, I see you separated from your wife and children. It breaks my heart, but I won't keep you here, because if you stay, we won't sleep peacefully! I might not live to see..." Her voice choked with sobs. "Go seek your own future!" Ah! Grandmother was already eighty-four years old. This truly saddened the old woman. Were we to be separated like this? Yes. In the late autumn of my fourth year away from home, the old lady truly returned to the Western Paradise, fulfilling the prophecy "I might not live to see..." Thinking of the past seven years, my footsteps have traversed north, south, east, and west, tasting all the bitterness, spiciness, sourness, and saltiness of life! But the national crisis and family grievances grow deeper every day. When will we be able to cleanse them with our blood?

"Brother Si, whatever you do, don't write home!" This was Zhen's first sentence the next morning: "If people in the Northeast receive a letter from the interior, it's practically sending them a written indictment and a death sentence!"

"Why?" I retorted.

### To Aspiring Young Literary Talents

— Shangqing

When advising young people who are fond of classical literature, my first sentence is: it's best if you don't indulge in a fondness for literature. Now, when advising young people who are fond of new literature, the first sentence I want to say is still: it's best if you don't indulge in a fondness for literature. The reasons have been explained before, so I won't elaborate now.

Unfortunately, there are quite a few young people who are fond of classical literature, and even more who are fond of new literature. In that case, as a last resort, I can only, with my sincere wishes, tell young people who are fond of new literature a few words:

If you are indeed fond of new literature and want to engage in appreciation, research, or creation but don't know where to start, I advise you to start with Western literature. The establishment of our new literature can be said to be entirely influenced by Western literature. Almost all prominent new literature writers are proficient in Western literature. They started with Western literature, which laid the foundation for our new literature today. However, our new literature today is still far from being developed and expanded to the point where it can enlighten future generations. We still need to work hard on the same path. The most fundamental approach is still to understand Western literature first.

To understand Western literature, it is best to be able to communicate in a Western language and read directly. Otherwise, reading many translations is also a viable option. Translations that are good in both writing and content are, of course, the most suitable for us. Even if the writing is somewhat lacking, as long as the content is not bad, we can still focus on the essence and extract its core.

After you have read a considerable amount of Western literature, understood the spirit of new literature, the differences between new literature and classical literature, and grasped the key technical points, you will naturally want to engage in writing. Perhaps at this time, you will have another question: what kind of writing should I use to write well? Or, to what extent should I write to be considered good?

The level of "good" has a great deal of flexibility, so I cannot set a standard or define what is considered good. However, I can at least say what the minimum level of "good" is: it must be coherent. The sentences should not have grammatical errors, the paragraphs should not have unclear flaws, the structure should not be too rigid or too chaotic, and the intention should not be too shallow. These are all essential for coherence.

Being coherent is, of course, what everyone desires, but how can one achieve coherence? Perhaps this is a question that will inevitably arise.

To solve this problem: first, you must study Western literature; second, you must study advanced new literature works. Western literature is generally coherent, but since the language is different, it cannot directly help our writing. Therefore, we still have to study the advanced literature we already have. It is difficult to point out all of these "advanced" works, but generally speaking, the new literature books published by The Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, and Kaiming Bookstore can be considered advanced. Of course, other bookstores also publish some advanced new literature books, but there are also inevitably mediocre ones, so you must choose carefully.

I do not approve of the idea that in order to create new literature, one must study classical literature. It seems that reviewing the old can indeed help one understand the new. I would rather see poorly used Westernized sentences than fluent classical literary clichés, because the former is easier to correct, while the latter is deeply ingrained and almost incurable. Of course, modern new literature writers did not succeed simply by studying Western literature and completely abandoning classical literature. Classical literature can indeed help new literature, but I believe that studying classical literature is often more detrimental than beneficial. To avoid misleading people, it is better to consult with experts in classical literature.

I dare not say that the writing in the current newspaper supplements and various magazines has reached a good level, so we don't need to imitate them. However, incoherent literature does appear in supplements or magazines; this is a fact. Because supplements and magazines have time constraints, they inevitably have oversights, unlike published collections, which can be carefully polished to strive for excellence. Therefore, I hope that if you want to study literature from supplements and magazines to improve your new literature writing, you must be very careful. As for some texts with ulterior motives and superficial writing, I think you should especially avoid learning from them.

Once you have a complete understanding of the content and form of new literature, you can naturally start creating freely. But when you are creating, I still want to tell you two things:

Do not use your talent to engage in destructive work. Sometimes, it is necessary to write about people and satirize them, but you cannot think that this is the sole purpose of a writer. The garden of literature is vast, and the flowers and fruits within are not just about scolding or satirizing people. As for scolding wrongly or criticizing unreasonably, that is especially undesirable. Why have writers always been looked down upon, called "frivolous"? This kind of infighting and exclusion of dissent is also a major reason! Similarly, boasting, mutual praise, and self-promotion are also undesirable. Their only effect is to destroy literature and misuse your talent. I hope you can avoid them.

Do not write articles solely for yourself, especially in the current times. Articles advocating art for art's sake may be acceptable in times of peace and prosperity, but now, if you have the talent to write, you should only dedicate it to the nation and the people. At the very least, even if you want to lament your suffering or complain, you should look at those who are more unfortunate than you and lament their suffering or complain on their behalf. Because you have a pen and don't have to worry about opportunities, while they have nothing, if you don't help them, no one will. Therefore, I hope you write less about personal matters and start with broader topics.

The above words are what I have to say to young literary talents who are fond of new literature. Of course, this is just my personal opinion, and there are many points that should be supplemented or discussed further. Due to space limitations, I will have to leave it at that for now.
