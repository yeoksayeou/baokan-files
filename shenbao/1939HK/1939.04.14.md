### Expanding the Relief for Child Refugees Campaign

Currently, providing relief to child refugees is not merely a simple act of humanitarian aid; it is a crucial component of the Chinese nation's liberation movement and the grand undertaking of national reconstruction during the war. It is, in essence, the primary task of cultivating a large number of capable individuals to build a new China and a new society. However, in the more than twenty months since the start of the war, our work in aiding child refugees has been severely inadequate. Now, as the war transitions from a disadvantageous situation to one of potential victory, every person concerned with the future destiny of the nation and its people must pay special attention to the issue of children, and particularly the issue of aiding child refugees.

The national organizations dedicated to aiding child refugees include the Central Relief Commission under the government, as well as societal organizations such as the Child Welfare Association, the China Wartime Child Relief Association, the China Children's Welfare Association, and the Children's Education Committee, among others. According to a report published yesterday by Mr. Situ De, a director of the China Wartime Child Relief Association, these groups have collectively taken in over 20,000 child refugees since the start of the war, housing and educating them in various educational and care institutions. This means that, in effect, these organizations have preserved more than 20,000 future leaders for the construction of a new China. Their efforts and achievements deserve the respect of the entire nation! However, in the more than twenty months since the start of the war, the number of provinces directly affected by the war and indirectly affected by aerial bombing, massacre, looting, and pillaging is no less than twenty. The number of children suffering and urgently in need of relief, shelter, and education is likely ten to a hundred times greater than 20,000! If we search our consciences, can we honestly say that what we have done in the past is worthy of our future generations? I fear that no one can answer with certainty in the affirmative. Therefore, we not only hope that the responsible organizations will continue their efforts but also urge the entire nation, and especially our overseas compatriots, to provide more substantial assistance. Furthermore, the overseas Chinese media and education sectors should immediately launch extensive campaigns to promote the cause of aiding Chinese child refugees and raise funds from overseas Chinese communities and friendly nations. Under the bombing, massacre, looting, and pillaging of the Japanese invaders, the sacrifices of our nation's outstanding soldiers and the men and women of the battle zones have already exceeded one million in the past, and the future is still unimaginable. Sacrificing for the future independence, freedom, and happiness of our nation is, of course, a matter of "unwavering dedication" and "no regrets"; however, if we fail to promptly aid the vast number of suffering children at present, then our sacrifices and struggles today will completely lose their great significance!

Even putting it mildly, regarding the 20,000 child refugees who are fortunate enough to be sheltered, the general situation is that there is a prevalent phenomenon of "one caregiver for every hundred children". "The lack of medicines and treatment equipment is particularly alarming" (These words are quoted from Mr. Situ De's original statement). Even if we are "unable to do everything we want to", we must not allow these 20,000 fortunate child refugees to suffer unimaginable hardship again! Reverend Sanders, an American who is the chairman of the Shaoguan International Relief Committee, has already appealed to people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, hoping for more donations of medicines such as Lian Jiu, Shan Yuan Nian, brandy, gauze, and cotton. We believe that people from friendly nations have issued this appeal for our country's child refugees, and all sectors of Hong Kong society should respond appropriately. The first step is to expand various promotional efforts to aid child refugees, and to expand various mass movements to solicit medical supplies. Those with specialized knowledge and skills in pediatric medicine, as well as those with nursing knowledge and experience, are encouraged to volunteer their services to the cause of aiding child refugees with the spirit of "serving the country and the people, and enlisting in the army with generosity." This is the work that all sectors of the Hong Kong community must implement immediately, and we must strive to expand this work and make it sustainable until the War of Resistance achieves final victory and the grand undertaking of national reconstruction enters a stage of success.

In addition to passive relief, the work of aiding child refugees should also pay special attention to active organization and education, so that thousands upon thousands of boys and girls can escape from the bombing, massacre, looting, and humiliation of the *people, and grow up strong under the threat of *people's planes, cannons, and other cruel and vicious political, economic, and cultural aggressions, learning all the knowledge to fight against the *people and eliminate the old and establish the new, and strive for the future construction of a new China. To achieve this ideal, we must first rely on the successful cultivation of a large number of teachers and instructors. We earnestly hope that the government will respond to this urgent need by establishing or strengthening training institutions for such cadres, from the central level to the local level, and quickly cultivate a large number of cadres to provide relief and education for child refugees. At the same time, we also hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life at home and abroad will either encourage specialists to volunteer their services or generously donate money, medicines, and other tools necessary for relief and education of children. Furthermore, we hope that all sectors can assist our government with social collective power to establish thousands and thousands of institutions in the safer areas of the rear to protect children, educate children, and cultivate talents for child care and education.

The final victory of the War of Resistance still depends on the replenishment and support of vast new forces to be fully realized; even when the War of Resistance is completely victorious, the great cause of building a new China will no longer rest on our shoulders but will belong to our children. Therefore, aiding and educating children is indeed the most important and urgent task for the entire nation in the future. It is a sacred cause to establish an unshakable foundation for the nation and the state for all ages and to guarantee its eternal independence, freedom, and happiness. We must do everything in our power to promote its development and strive for its success.

### General Li Pinxian Residing at the Front Lines

(Correspondent from a Certain Place) There has not been a fierce battle on the ×× front for a full three months. However, the ×people have recently been busy mobilizing, and they are "eager to make trouble" as long as there is an opportunity. Therefore, the reporter decided to go to the front lines to observe the war, and before going to the front lines, the first thing that came to mind was to go to the war zone headquarters to see Deputy Commander Li Pinxian.

The car drove to ×× and then sped along winding country roads. It wasn't until we crossed a bridge made of two wooden planks that we saw a familiar-looking guard. So, we asked this guard to deliver a message. The morning in the countryside is when people in the city are still fast asleep, but General Li was as full of vigor as the morning sun as he came out to greet us.

The reporter first explained the purpose of this trip to the front lines and asked for convenience in all aspects. Then, I thought about asking this general, who is stationed on the front lines, how the front lines are progressing rapidly in the second phase of the War of Resistance.

"Because of the War of Resistance, all aspects of China are progressing rapidly," General Li began to speak. "What is most obvious at the moment is that morale is becoming increasingly strong in the second phase of the War of Resistance. In the past, although we said we were not afraid of the *people's planes and cannons, there was indeed some fear in our hearts. According to our statistics on the front lines, only 7% of our soldiers were injured or killed by the power of the *people's cannons, and 3% were injured or killed by aerial bombing. Adding them together, the power of the *people's planes and cannons can only injure or kill one-tenth of our soldiers. This is a fact in front of our soldiers, which makes our soldiers feel that planes and cannons are not very powerful, and naturally the fear of planes and cannons is completely eliminated. On the ×× front, there are only wounded soldiers and no lost territory. Many soldiers are injured but refuse to rest, and they crawl to fight against the *people. There are many examples of this, and this spirit is truly admirable.

"Yes, there are too many commendable and moving things on the front lines. However, in this way, are there no difficulties in our combat?" the reporter asked.

"Of course, there are difficulties. Because the enemy sees that our morale is strong and they always lose battles, they use the most cruel method of killing—releasing poison gas. Therefore, gas masks are extremely needed on the front lines. At present, the number sent from the rear is indeed too small. In addition, transportation feels too difficult. Many urgently needed things cannot be transported because of the lack of transportation. There is also a lack of cultural food. The need for cultural food on the front lines may be more urgent than in the rear, but what we have is far from what is needed. The delay of mail is also one of the difficulties felt on the front lines."

"Then, how do you estimate the future of the War of Resistance?"

"Victory in the War of Resistance is not a problem," General Li replied firmly. "Every one of our soldiers knows that we must overcome all difficulties to win the final victory. No war is without difficulties. The victory of war lies in being able to endure difficulties and solve difficulties. In a two-sided battle, if any side's difficulties increase day by day and cannot be solved, and finally cannot support the difficulties and cannot fight, then it is defeated. Conversely, it is victorious. At present, the *people's difficulties are increasing day by day and cannot be solved, while our difficulties are decreasing day by day. At the same time, we are doing our best to overcome all difficulties. Because of this, we say that victory in the War of Resistance is not a problem."

Talking about the "situation" on the front lines, General Li said that at present, we are accumulating small victories into major victories, and it is already entirely possible for local guerrillas to cooperate with regular troops in combat. Although we are not yet in the period of counter-offensive, we have already succeeded in disturbing the *people and making them exhausted. Talking about the fact that politics is more important than military affairs in the second phase of the War of Resistance, General Li said that a military advisor from a certain country once said that some of China's strongholds were lost, but there is one stronghold that will never be lost. This stronghold is the fundamental strength of China's War of Resistance. What is this stronghold? It is the hearts of the 450 million Chinese people. Therefore, he believes that in the first phase of the War of Resistance, we defended Great Xuzhou and Great Wuhan, and what we are now proposing is to defend the hearts of the people that we will never lose. Protecting the hearts of the people is our important task at present.

The reporter couldn't help but smile. I repeated the military phrase, "Protect the hearts of the people, protect the hearts of the people, protect the hearts of the 450 million people!"

The sun had already reached the sky, and General Li insisted on keeping me for lunch. Urgent to get on the road, I hastily bid farewell to General Li Pinxian, bought a few pancakes from the common people, and jumped into the car to head straight for the front lines. (Northern Europe)

### Happy and Joyful Soviet Children

— Long Qian

"Here, children are the nation; children are kings!"

Seeing the enthusiastic scene of Soviet children paying tribute to the Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, that harmonious relationship between leaders and children, I couldn't help but be deeply moved. Now, as Children's Day is approaching, I am returning from my emotion and admiration to a wish for the children of the Soviet Union.

In the era of Imperial Russia, children suffered as much as adults, with no happiness to speak of. After the October Revolution, due to the need to break through the encirclement of imperialism externally and to defend against revolutionary rebellions internally, the lives of children were not yet perfect. However, the Soviet government paid special attention to children, and older people held unlimited hope and affection for their children. For example, when the Soviet Union suffered food difficulties in 1929-1931, all milk could only be preserved for the elderly, the sick, and children to eat, but the elderly said, "Let our milk be given to the children to eat, so that they grow up more beautiful and stronger. This is our joy, and the dawn of our life is coming soon." With the success of the two five-year plans, the dawn of life has not only arrived but is also history gloriously. Children have indeed grown up more beautiful and stronger. We have already reached the point where "Here, children are the nation; children are kings!"

Compared to the era of Imperial Russia, this is simply one being "heaven" and the other being "hell."

Look: In 1913, there were only nine maternity hospitals in all of Russia, while in 1937, there were already 4,175. The number of beds in maternity hospitals increased from only 7,000 in 1913 to 81,500 in 1937. In the summer of 1938, nurseries in collective and state-owned farms cared for more than 3 million infants, and thousands upon thousands of new nurseries, nursing homes, and pharmacies were opened. (According to the TASS news agency in January of this year.) Even maternity benefits increased from 376 million rubles in 1936 to 991.5 million rubles in 1938.

Children receive the care of the Soviet state while still in the womb, and they enjoy the protection of love even more when they are born. From two months to three years of age, they can be admitted to nurseries, where they receive excellent care from the government, and mothers have the right to leave work to breastfeed their children.

From the age of three, when they leave the nursery, to the age of seven, they can go to beautiful and spacious gardens to play the games they love. If it is discovered that they have a certain talent, they are immediately sent to a place suitable for developing their talent to study. For example, Odessa has always been a region that produces musicians, and the Soviet Union has paid special attention to that place, where it has discovered many musical geniuses. Therefore, it is not surprising to see children aged five or six in Soviet music academies. Because of the Soviet Union's attention to the development of children's talents, it has also cultivated many world-class children. For example, the first prize was won at the Brussels International Violin Competition, the third prize was won at the Warsaw Competition, and each participant received an award upon returning. Several of the youngest were only about ten years old. In the 1937 shooting competition between Soviet and American children's organizations, the Soviet Union won first place again. What is most amazing is Rosa, the female pianist who won the second prize in the Warsaw International Piano Competition. Listen to her mother's words: "Rosa's musical talent was discovered when she was only six years old. Although she was not qualified to enter the Kiev Conservatory of Music a year later because she was too young, the professors, because they were concerned about her talent, still allowed her to enter the school — when I heard that the Moscow Conservatory had a special class for children, I brought my daughter to Ensk in 1936, requesting that my child be transferred from the Kiev Conservatory to the Moscow Conservatory. The government encouraged her talent with all kinds of rewards according to my intentions..." From the above, it can be seen that Rosa's achievements, even if she had talent, would not have been realized if she had not lived in the Soviet Union's social system. Therefore, what Rosa's mother said at the end was not without reason: "Can another country in the world say this: the government helped me discover the talent of my Rosa and gave her everything possible to develop it? She is a little daughter of the working class and is now a seventeen-year-old winner of an international music competition!" This is not without reason.

The right of children to enjoy free primary education is enshrined in the Soviet Constitution. In 1937, 30 million people enjoyed primary education in 53,000 schools, while in 1914, during the Tsarist era, there were only 7.8 million children studying in the entire country. If these numbers are compared, it is a vivid contrast between the two eras!

According to Molotov's report at this Congress of the All-Union Communist Party: "The third five-year plan also includes a huge new development plan. This plan proposes to focus on promoting universal secondary education in cities, conducting it in rural areas, and completing the promotion of universal primary education in all ethnic republics. The number of students in primary and secondary schools in cities and worker areas will increase from 8.6 million to 12.4 million, and in rural areas, it will increase from 20.8 million to 27.7 million. In this way, by the end of the third five-year plan, there will be 40 million students in primary and secondary schools in our country, while pre-revolutionary Russia had only 8 million." According to this report, when the third five-year plan is completed, the elimination of illiteracy among Soviet children will not only be in cities but will be universal in rural areas throughout the country; not only in Soviet Russia but will be universal in all ethnic republics.

What a beautiful society, "Here, children are the nation; children are kings!" It is filled with a happy and joyful life. Children are sincerely loved from birth to adulthood, and they are nurtured by the government with all its might. Not a single child is without the right to enjoy education, and not a single child is without the opportunity to develop his or her talents. It is truly a "paradise for children!"

In two stages, shouldn't we make efforts again to recreate our sincerity? —" Soviet socialism is moving towards a higher stage, and children will also recreate their sincerity at a higher stage, completing a great progress in human history.

In short, the life of Soviet children has realized what Lenin said to Gorky when he was stroking some children in Gorky Park: "They will have a happier life than us in the future. They will not experience as much as we have suffered, and there will not be as much cruelty in their lives."

Soviet children live happy, joyful, and fulfilling lives. And what about our Chinese children? They are living in an extremely cruel era and are also suffering from the massacres and looting of Japanese fascist warlords. They have been driven out of their lovely homes and the warm embrace of their mothers by the Japanese devils and are drifting and displaced everywhere. However, it is precisely because of this cruel lesson that children have been drawn into the torrent of the War of Resistance and are also taking on various tasks that they can do, such as rooting out traitors in guerrilla areas and conducting propaganda, fundraising, and comforting efforts in the rear. The New Life Travel Group and the Children's Drama Troupe, which are engaged in national salvation work during tens of thousands of miles of travel, have demonstrated the amazing power of children. Under the leadership of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the National Children's Welfare Association has rescued many child refugees. The children's work carried out by other progressive women will train thousands upon thousands of small national heroes to take on the great task of being "masters of the future." On this Children's Day, do not forget General Chen Cheng's instructions: "Always remember the tragic history of the Japanese devils massacring Chinese children and looting Chinese children. It is the responsibility of our generations to avenge the shame of our young friends who have fled the chaos." Arise, children, although "the cruelty inevitably caused by our living conditions" is a reality, "our generation must accomplish amazing things in history."

### Overview of Child Welfare Undertakings in Shanghai

— Zheng Fan

(1) Shanghai Municipal Council Child Protection Section

The Shanghai Municipal Council Child Protection Section was established in December 1938, and is managed by Ms. Eleanor M. Hfnder. The assistants are Ji Zhiting and other social service personnel who have rich experience in social investigation and case handling. The purpose of establishing this section is to provide appropriate and rapid protection for children and adolescents who are adopted by non-lineal relatives and are abused and exploited. In addition to protecting general children, the section chief pays the utmost attention to protecting the problem of maids. The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council has passed two principles of protection: (1) The Bureau should, in accordance with the gradually developing concepts in other places, not recognize the identity of maids, or any status similar to slavery. (This principle contains the meaning that maids should be registered separately). (2) The Bureau should, as other places do, pay close attention to children and adolescents who are transferred, and use all possible methods to report the transfer to the Bureau's competent personnel, and try to protect the transferred person, so as to show the Bureau's sense of responsibility.

The Child Protection Section is related to all child welfare organizations in Shanghai and maintains close contact. For children issued by the court to various child welfare organizations, the child welfare organizations should fill out a report every month and send it to the Child Protection Section for reference. Unless discussed with the Child Protection Section and obtained its consent, no child welfare organization may send children issued by the court to factories, or allow others to adopt them, or arrange marriages for them, or otherwise deal with them.

(2) Shanghai Office of the China Children's Welfare Association

The China Children's Welfare Association aims to promote children's welfare throughout the country. After the outbreak of the all-out War of Resistance, in order to facilitate the handling of relief work, the General Association moved to Chongqing, and the Shanghai office was established in Shanghai (address: Room 208, China Exchange Building, Edward Road). The persons in charge of the office are Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Weide, etc. All its affairs are divided into relief, protection, health, and education. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the office rescued a total of 1,857 children; in addition to those who were placed, there were 895 children remaining, who are still being continuously taken in. In addition, the office handles cases of children awaiting treatment, diagnoses children's diseases, and holds health competitions.

There are many child welfare organizations in Shanghai, and they lack recognition and contact opportunities with each other. As far as the author knows, the Shanghai Office of the Children's Welfare Association has sent personnel to study the issue, hoping to find the most appropriate solution.

(3) Shanghai Children's Welfare Association

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association was established on June 6 of the 27th year of the Republic of China. The directors are Chen Heqin, Chen Jicheng, Huang Dinghui, etc., and the persons in charge are Wu Zhiqian, Zhao Yibei, Shao Wujiu, etc. The purpose: "Adopt the most economical, fastest, and most durable methods to strive to protect children and cultivate healthy citizens of the Republic of China." All work is divided into five categories: (1) Researching children's welfare undertakings, (2) Undertaking children's welfare undertakings, (3) Contacting or assisting children's welfare organizations, (4) Cultivating children's welfare talents, (5) Editing children's welfare materials.

Since its establishment, the Children's Welfare Association has established 14 newsboy schools, educating more than 600 newsboys in total. According to reports, ten more newsboy schools will be established to allow all newsboys in the city to enjoy educational opportunities. In addition, it is also preparing to organize a child labor education and protection committee to assist factories in improving the lives of child laborers, promote child labor education, and establish a beggar child education and shelter, to accommodate beggar children in the city and provide them with educational opportunities and production training.

### Shaoguan, Known as "Little Guangzhou": A Friend of China in China (7)

— Ye Juesun

Following behind the porters, the road led out of the station platform, across the stone bridge spanning the Qu River, and into the urban area of Shaoguan. The Qu River has long been respectfully called Little Guangzhou. Since the fall of Guangzhou, it has become the de facto center of Guangdong Province in terms of military affairs, politics, and transportation – in all aspects. Located on the upper reaches of the North River, in addition to the Yuehan Railway passing through, the highway can directly reach Changsha, Hengyang, and Leiyangzhou areas of Hunan Province to the north. To the east, it goes through Nanxiong into Jiangxi Province, reaching Ganzhou, and then transfers to Ji'an and can reach Nanchang. Southward it goes to Wengyuan, and westward it goes directly to Lianxian. Shaoguan gave us the first impression of being "bombed," and bombed all over. People living in wartime feel that the bombing of rear cities is no longer a new thing. No matter how miserable the situation is, it is difficult to have a significant reaction in the heart. This abnormal emotion shows how hatred has paralyzed all superficial emotions. There is no emotionally exciting movement here, only deep resentment and determination for revenge! However, Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng were different. The dilapidated walls and desolate bombed ruins on both sides deeply stimulated their spirits, causing them to feel the universal righteous indignation of pure human hearts. Li Meng often whistled long and tremulously, amazed that the skills of Japanese planes bombing civilian houses were even better here than in Guilin. He couldn't help but blurt out, "The majesty of the Imperial Army is nothing more than this!" After walking more than a mile, we gradually discovered lights and occasional pedestrians coming and going. Only near the Datong Inn did it feel, as Ms. Guo Shimei said, "This is the beginning of life!" Entering the Datong Inn, the waiter told us that it was already full. Since the North River Inn was bombed and several other smaller inns were moved to the countryside due to the threat of enemy planes, the Datong Inn has become the only and better hotel in Qujiang. According to common sense, scarcity makes things valuable. Since he could raise his thumb as soon as he opened his mouth, he always shook his leg and showed a little nonchalant attitude towards general matters. This waiter concretely manifested this philosophy of life. After repeated negotiations and appeals to the difficulty of finding other places at this time, we were finally led into the room for the sake of "international friendship." This was a large room combined from two rooms; the outer room was a reception room, and the inner room had two beds. The couple occupied the larger one, and I slept on a small single bed by the window, which was still suitable. After solving the problem of accommodation, Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng were anxious to find Mr. Zhang Xianghua. At this time, I didn't know the location of General Zhang Fakui's headquarters, so I had to indirectly visit the office of the Fourth Route Army's representative in Shaoguan first, because I had been there when I first came to Guangdong. I rushed to the Fourth Route Army office, and it was almost ten o'clock. Except for a majestic guard standing at the door, the house was quiet and silent. This was a large house that survived the bombing. From the gate to the reception, it took two minutes to walk. Pushing open the door of the reception room, both guards were already in bed. One of them stuck his head out from the curtain and asked us what we wanted. I said, is your director in? No, he replied, with a rather unhappy tone. Then I want to ask something, I still kept asking, is there an officer on duty, is there an officer on duty! He was even more impatient. I exited the guard room and entered another door, and finally found the office of the officer on duty. The lights in the room were still on. I gently knocked on the door. The door opened. A gust of the aroma of wine and meat wafted in, which made me think of myself not having eaten yet. The officer on duty seemed a little drunk, his face flushed. After I explained my purpose, he immediately agreed to ask the guard to accompany us. As a result, it caused a fierce quarrel between the guard and the officer on duty. We sat aside and listened for more than forty minutes. After the struggle ended, we followed the guard, who was at a disadvantage in the war zone, to the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters. After walking tortuously for more than ten minutes, we finally reached our destination. But Commander Zhang had already returned to his official residence! We left a card, which seemed to have a reporting meaning.

After returning to the hotel, we planned the work schedule for tomorrow. Indeed, Shaoguan is the head of Guangdong Province. Not only are there organs and responsible persons of various party, government, and military departments here, but also many national salvation organizations and wartime working teams for the people. Enemy planes are constantly bombing Shaoguan, but new forces and indestructible strong organizations have grown on the ruins of the bombing! We are preparing to launch a visit in this newly reborn capital of resistance against Japan in Guangdong.

### Gan× Two Routes Peep at Hunan; Jin River Sees Days of Bloody Battles; Wu Ning× Military Westward Offense Unsuccessful; We Hold the Advantage East of the Gan River

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing

Special Dispatch] The Gan war situation has become a stalemate. ×Originally planned to invade Hunan from the west via Wu Ning and Gaoan, but because Wu Ning was severely attacked by us and unable to advance, it is now reinforcing Gaoan. Including the previous troops, there are more than 5,000 people, with 20 artillery pieces and tanks each, fiercely attacking us. We are still fighting bloody battles with them in the Jin River area near Gaoan. The Gan River east is holding at Liangxiang, with × increasing to more than 2,000. We are still besieging.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 13th] On the 12th, our army launched a fierce attack on ×, which was entrenched at Zhupopo Bridge and Wangcun, 20 li north of Gaoan. × The wooden support retreated eastward, and we immediately recovered the two places.

[Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 13th] About 400 or 500 × north of Liangjiadu launched a fierce attack on our Huangmagang positions on the east bank of Liangjiadu at 3:00 am on the 9th. Our army fought bravely and defeated ×. In the afternoon, more than 100 × tried to cross the river forcibly from Luoshe. We immediately blocked them, killing × many people and capturing several alive. The remnants fled back.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] It is reported that the Chinese army has already recovered Gaoan several days ago, but now, for military reasons, it is making an orderly retreat, fighting with the Japanese army in the suburbs of Gaoan. Western news is very slow, and the actual battle situation is unclear. It is heard that only the vanguard is engaged in small-scale battles. In Hubei Province, the battles on the Hanshui River are still in stalemate. Also, the Chinese army on the Longhai Railway in Henan is active on a large scale, attacking Kaifeng in several routes. On the morning of Tuesday, it recovered the station and entered the city from the south gate. Furthermore, the Chinese guerrillas in North China are attacking the Japanese army everywhere. In most areas, the Japanese army does not dare to go deep. Therefore, in the occupied areas, the Japanese army has gained nothing and feels it is extremely difficult to deal with the Chinese plainclothes teams.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th, Special Dispatch] The offensive against southern Shandong × was repelled, and the situation has stabilized.

[Reuters, Peiping, 13th] Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in southern Shanxi and southern Shandong. According to Japanese reports, a part of the Eighth Route Army, about 2,000 people, attacked the Japanese garrison several miles northeast of Taierzhuang yesterday, engaging in fierce fighting for ten hours. Both sides charged with bayonets 30 times, refusing to give in to each other, and casualties were heavy.

We Are Fiercely Attacking Zengcheng; Recovering Nearby Strongholds

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th, Special Dispatch] Strongholds near Zengcheng in southern Guangdong have been recovered; the county seat will be captured.

[Wengyuan Special Dispatch] On the left flank of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, a certain division of our 12th Army Group recovered strongholds such as Qiaotou, Zhuguling, and Shetouling on the morning of the 12th, seizing many prisoners and cutting off the highway between Zhongxin and Zengcheng. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Zhongxin Zhucun area.

[Wengyuan Special Dispatch] A certain unit of our army and local teams on the north bank of the Dongjiang River have approached Shitan and are fiercely attacking ×.

[Wengyuan Special Dispatch] On the 11th, a certain regiment of our 12th Army Group captured more than ten × officers and soldiers in the battle of Changgangling. According to the prisoners, because they were forced to come to China to fight, × people in the country and in the army extremely hate the acts of the warlords, so there is a strong anti-war sentiment, and suicides and sabotaging military plans often occur. They are extremely grateful for the lenient treatment by our officers and soldiers.

Our Army and Air Force Cooperate; Sweeping Away the Japanese Army in Zhongtiao Mountain

[Reuters, Chongqing, 13th] Shanxi Chinese army news, the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese army's Jixia Gang positions in southern Shanxi at dawn on the 10th of this month.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 13th] Our air force cooperated with the counter-offensive troops in Zhongtiao Mountain. At 10:00 am on the 8th, two echelons flew over Houma in formation, dropping dozens of bombs, killing and wounding 150 ×, and thoroughly destroying many × military facilities.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 13th] In the southeastern Shanxi war, the northern route is still in stalemate in the Wanghe Wangtao (east of Jiexiu) area. × is building fortifications and rushing to repair the highway to Jiexiu. More than ten × in Qixian, with a dozen artillery pieces, are moving southeast, attempting to attack the Baijin Highway. On the southern route, about 800 × harassed the Qilanche (south of Jincheng), Pengyao, Dakou, and Dongxi Xianfang areas from Boai on the 7th. They have been repelled by our electric strikes. In Bobi (west of Huixian), there are about 1,000 ×. They invaded Lingchuan to the north on the 9th and contacted us. On the eastern route, there are several hundred × each in Loulou, west of Linxian, Qiuqiu, west of Tangyin, and Wu'an, and they all have a westward moving pattern. In the northern route, in the Heshun area, more than a thousand × are also gathered. In recent days, × planes have been unusually active in various parts of southeastern Shanxi.

### Japan Unable to Sustain the War; Military Discipline Corrupted, Economy Exhausted: Witness Account by Australian MP Grant

[Our Hong Kong News] Grant, a Labor MP from New South Wales, Australia, recently visited Japan, Korea, the three northeastern provinces, and various parts of North China. On his way back, he arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Grant suffered all kinds of harassment and harsh treatment during his journey, and his impressions were very deep. However, his observation of the Far East issue led to a conclusion that the United Kingdom and the United States should take swift and practical steps to deal with the situation in the Far East; otherwise, they should turn a blind eye and let others do it.

Harsh Treatment of Foreigners

According to Mr. Grant's account to reporters about his journey, he suffered severe interrogation as soon as he stepped into Japan and had to fill out many forms. Traveling in Japan required going through more than fifty interrogations, of which only two or three times he heard the word "please" during the interrogation. The most severe interrogation he suffered during this trip was on a train near Andong, in the middle of the night when the train passengers were already asleep in bed. Japanese soldiers boarded the train for inspection, especially strict for foreigners, rummaging through their luggage, and the clothes and pajamas also had to be taken off and thrown on the ground. The attitude during the interrogation was aggressive and embarrassing.

Japanese People Are Tired of War

Mr. Grant continued to talk about Japan's economic panic and anti-war sentiment, saying that no one in Japan dared to talk about state affairs. When he traveled to Moji, he saw a team of young soldiers being transported from the countryside to prepare to go to war. Locals were not interested in the military's departure. Although he heard that the situation of welcoming soldiers to the expedition was very enthusiastic in the past. In Japan, the value of leather, rubber, gasoline, and other goods is extremely high, and food prices are soaring. Due to the lack of gasoline, every three gallons of gasoline are mixed with two gallons of alcohol. Because the use of gasoline is restricted, taxis stop operating at 10:00 pm.

Collective Security

The democracies can assist Russia so that it can supply a large number of aircraft and arms to China, and they can use economic power to smash the secret conspiracy of the Japanese in North China. The Pacific countries should have a collective security and mutual non-aggression pact. Australia's foreign policy is to urge the United Kingdom to form an alliance with the United States in the Pacific. If Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, China, Japan, and Russia need to participate, they can be invited to join. Regarding China's war of resistance, Mr. Grant said that China is the first line of defense for Australia, and some politicians in Australia advocate strict neutrality on the Sino-Japanese war, which can be described as shallow.

What I Saw and Heard in North China

Mr. Grant continued to describe what he saw in North China, saying that there were Japanese soldiers everywhere in North China, dressed in tatters, and the discipline was very corrupted. He originally wanted to go to the Great Wall, but was dissuaded by an American friend. It is said that he had visited the Great Wall, and the permission he held was torn up by a Japanese soldier for no reason. The arbitrariness of the Japanese army can be seen. He also said that the Japanese are now implementing a paper currency conspiracy in North China. If Britain, France, and the United States can unite and implement economic power to restrict the import of goods from North China, and the banks of Britain, the United States, and France follow the orders, this conspiracy can be crushed.

Chaotic Monetary System

Now in North China, people carrying Chinese currency are confiscated. Foreigners are not allowed to use other currencies except counterfeit coins. The situation is extremely chaotic. In Shanghai, one pound sterling can be exchanged for 30 Japanese yen, while in Japan, it can only be exchanged for 20 Japanese yen. When he was in Shanghai, he exchanged 25 pounds for 750 Japanese yen. After arriving in Japan, a part was converted into pounds sterling, and after traveling in Japan and arriving in North China, he sold the pounds sterling again (each pound was worth 30 Japanese yen). By exchanging money in and out, he earned the cost of his trip to Japan.

Mr. Grant finally talked about his impression of Japan, saying that the Japanese have no goodwill towards the British and interrogate travelers a lot. Their discrimination against Australians is particularly obvious. Mr. Grant will stay in Hong Kong for a few days and take the British ship Cheungte on Monday to return to Australia.

### The Puppet Army in Kaifeng Uprising; Traitors Swept Away; Responding Internally and Externally to Overcome the County Seat

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Shanghai News, according to reliable news, when the "Pacification Committee" organized by the Japanese was holding a meeting in Kaifeng on the 9th, many strong men suddenly rushed into the venue and killed all six members of the committee, including Hu Yukun, Fu Shuangying, etc. Only one member was spared because he did not attend the meeting. After the strong men assassinated, they left in a hurry.

Although the Japanese official report did not mention the news of the revolt, it did not deny it either. The Japanese spokesperson only said, "There must be something going on." According to unconfirmed reports from the Chinese side, Kaifeng is now in the hands of the Chinese army.

### My Assassination Squad Active - Jinan Traitors Terrified - Assassination of Two Newly Appointed Officials Brings Great Satisfaction - Pseudo-Police, Moved by Righteous Indignation, Release Assassins

[Special Chongqing Air Dispatch] A wireless report from a certain location in Shandong on the 9th states that on February 10th, our assassination squad successfully eliminated the pseudo-Education Commissioner Hao Shuxuan and the pseudo-High Court President Zhang Chaoji in Jinan, causing traitors to lose heart and the enemy to be extremely shocked. The following is a detailed account of the events: On the morning of February 10th at 8:00 AM, a person in charge of our assassination squad led two members, each on bicycles, to the private residence of the traitor Zhang Chaoji, the pseudo-High Court President, on Zhijin City Street in Jinan, under the guise of delivering gifts. One person first aimed a gun at the guard in front of the gate to monitor him, while the other two, carrying gifts, passed through two courtyards and went straight to Zhang's bedroom. They woke Zhang from his sleep and immediately informed him that they had come to eliminate him. As Zhang was panicking, someone stabbed Zhang in the chest with a sharp knife, and Zhang fell to the ground and died instantly. After completing their mission, they closed the bedroom door and called their companion at the gatehouse, and they rode away on their bikes. Their demeanor was extremely relaxed. At the same time, another person in charge, accompanied by two squad members, drove to the private residence of the traitor Hao, the medical officer on Guanpo Street. They claimed to be delivering gifts. Hao's guard said, "The Commissioner is about to go to the office, so there is no need to deliver gifts." Shortly after, Hao came out. One of them said to Hao that he used to be a teacher at Jinan Zhengyi Middle School, so they claimed to be students from Zhengyi Middle School, and they came to deliver gifts. Hao then led them to the living room. After sitting down, one person talked to Hao, while the other pierced Hao from behind with a sharp knife. Blood gushed out, splattering on his clothes. Unfortunately, the location was slightly off, not fatal. Hao shouted and ran. In a moment of urgency, someone fired a shot, hitting Hao in the waist, and he fell to the ground. At that time, the other person had already fled. Hao's guard heard the sound and rushed over, firing at him, hitting him in the hand. He fought back while escaping out the door, and reached the east wall. He encountered more than a dozen pseudo-security corps and enemy soldiers. He turned west to Huamei Hospital Alley, and encountered dozens of pseudo-police officers. As his path was cut off, he loudly proclaimed, "Are you all Chinese? If you are Chinese, you should not block my path. If anyone blocks me, they are a traitor. I will kill them first!" He aimed his gun at the police officers, who, moved by righteousness, quickly evaded into the alley. He then charged through Xindong Gate. He encountered four or five groups of pseudo-police in the city, but he lectured them with righteousness and passed through safely. After reaching a remote street, he quickly took a rickshaw and fled. After this incident, the enemy troops conducted a large-scale search and arrested and killed many patriotic youths. Jinan remains under tight security. (He Bingru, 10th)

### Second Local (Continued from the Japanese Version on the 12th) - Proceedings of the Financial Conference

(8) Provincial banks or local banks should actively promote thrift for exportable goods, reduce domestic sales, transport them abroad as much as possible, and exchange them for foreign currency. (9) Provincial banks or local banks should investigate the production costs and past prices of products. If there is any deliberate attempt to raise prices, or hoarding and speculation, measures should be taken to ban them. (10) If provincial banks or local banks lack transportation and storage tools, they may consult with entrusted procurement agencies to jointly equip them, or apply to local governments or war zone commanders to rent them from the people at a price, and the entrusted agencies should submit a request to the Ministry of Finance, which will then forward it to the Military Affairs Commission, to exempt the requisition of transportation tools for purchasing products. (11) The insurance issue during the storage of procured products should be referred to the Ministry of Finance to negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau to handle it. (12) Inter-provincial trade should be closely linked by the provincial banks and local banks of each province, and they should report to each other on the supply and demand of goods to facilitate trade. The specific methods should be determined based on the circumstances of each province. (13) For the convenience of transporting local products, provincial banks or local banks of each province should establish transportation stations in important locations, and connecting stations should be established between provinces A and B to facilitate operations. (14) The laborers used for transportation should be exempted from military service by the military authorities.

(E) Regarding the proposal on how to stabilize the rise and fall of commodity prices: (1) Active aspects: (Zi) For products that are the main local products and are necessary for people's daily life, when the prices of these products are excessively low, the provincial banks and local banks should purchase as much as possible, or facilitate the financing as much as possible. If there is insufficient funding, they may request rediscounting or re-mortgaging from the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China), or collect their taxes, or facilitate their transportation, in order to maintain their original price index. However, if the price rises due to purchase, price stabilization measures should also be implemented. (Chou) For products that are the main local products but not necessary for daily life, when the prices of these products are excessively low, provincial banks and local banks should provide loans at low interest rates, and investigate the situation of sales obstruction or transportation difficulties. If necessary, they may ask the provincial banks to assist in contacting sales channels, or transferring mortgages and transportation. When the price is excessively high, the reasons should be investigated. For the raw materials needed by agriculture, industry, and handicrafts, a request should be made to the local government to stabilize the prices with government power. (Yin) For products that are daily necessities but not produced locally, the prices of these products are generally high during this period. Provincial banks and local banks should find ways to purchase and transport them widely from the production areas, or coordinate with local existing institutions to allocate funds and facilitate their transportation, so that they can fully purchase and transport them from areas with abundant production. However, at the same time, the cost should be planned and fair prices should be set to make them available. (2) Passive aspects: Provincial banks and local banks should be responsible for compiling and checking the local products and price indices of daily necessities. When commodity prices fluctuate excessively, they may request the local government to stabilize them. At the same time, they should contact local chambers of commerce and trade association representatives to establish a price balance committee, which should be attended and chaired by representatives of the provincial and county-level administrative organs, banks, and local bank branches. Those who hoard and speculate, or refuse to sell at a reasonable price, should be reported by the balancing committee to the local military police and administrative organs, who will order them to sell at a reasonable price or search them.

(F) Regarding the proposal on how to provide relief or food needs: (1) The provincial banks or local banks of each province should report to the central government and the competent authorities of the province and neighboring provinces (such as the Agricultural and Commercial Bank) on the main food production, consumption, transportation, and distribution situations in the province at any time for reference in planning and regulation. (2) Provincial banks or local banks should cooperate with the competent production authorities to lend funds to certain foods that the province cannot supply on its own, or that it has surpluses but are needed by other provinces, and pay special attention to lending funds for essential production elements such as seeds, farm tools, and ploughing cattle to help them improve and produce. (3) Provincial banks or local banks should assist food management agencies in purchasing and selling or operating on their own to regulate food supply when the food supply cannot meet demand and prices fluctuate excessively. (4) Provincial banks or local banks should build warehouses in food distribution markets and locations with convenient transportation to conduct storage operations to regulate supply and demand. (5) Regarding food transportation, use wooden boats, handcarts, and livestock that are relatively inexpensive as much as possible so that the cost does not become too high. If necessary, the provincial bank or local bank may organize its own transportation teams, and local military and police agencies should provide effective protection. (6) When storing food, attention should be paid to its quality to ensure it can be stored for a long time, and regular inspections and sun-drying should be carried out to prevent spoilage. Every year, efforts should be made to convert old grains to new grains to prevent decay. (7) The location of grain storage should be coordinated with the local military and political authorities. Special planning and increased reserves should be given to areas with low production but future military importance and population concentration, such as western Hunan, western Hubei, southern Jiangxi, eastern Guangdong, western Guangxi, southern Yunnan, and eastern Guizhou, to provide relief. (8) The regional food production, sales, and salt affairs agencies have unified methods. Provincial banks or local banks should provide sufficient loans to manufacturers and traders. If necessary, they may contact the institutions in various places to arrange transportation and promote sales to the inland areas to supply people's food. For places where transportation is inconvenient, efforts should be made to facilitate remittances or transport funds on their behalf to facilitate sales.

In summary, the content of the above cases is extremely detailed and thorough, so that the financial industry can be supervised by the Ministry of Finance and implemented effectively, which will surely make more contributions to the future of the war of resistance and national construction. [End]

### Talking About the Confidence in Winning the War of Resistance with Foreign Military Experts

— Lin Huanping

[Jinsui Fourth Air Dispatch] A foreign military expert, his translator, and the reporter walked out of a low, narrow, and dark cave dwelling and sat on a stone bench in a small open space in front of the door. This is a valley, with mountain peaks towering into the blue sky on both sides. Numerous cave dwellings are dug under the valley, which is one of the anti-Japanese base areas of the North China Military Region, but it is also home to many ordinary people. It is a magnificent, yet very elegant place.

"Germany has destroyed Czechoslovakia. How will it treat the Soviet Union?"

The reporter knew that Mr. X had been away from his motherland for half a year. Under the extreme seriousness of the current European crisis, he must be very concerned about his motherland, so after sitting down, the reporter asked him this question.

"Only Hitler himself knows." He smiled happily. He was originally forty-two years old, wearing nearsighted glasses, and his face was covered with quite a few wrinkles, but his smile made his face flush and made him look much younger. He continued firmly, "As the saying goes, a dog that bites does not bark. In my observation, Hitler will not attack the Soviet Union at present. Because first, he still needs time to digest Czechoslovakia; second, he may need to solve Romania and the Netherlands first; third, Hitler knows very well that the Soviet Union's national defense power is inviolable."

"Then," the reporter asked, "Under Hitler's aggressive outlook, is it possible for the representatives of the four countries, Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, to hold a meeting in London?"

"Hitler's aggression has taught the democratic countries such as Britain and France too severely. It is a natural trend for them to actively approach the Soviet Union. As for whether the four countries will hold a meeting in London, it depends on the changes in the international situation."

"In the midst of such a serious crisis in Europe, what is the future of the Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations?"

He rubbed his hands and laughed again, saying:

"If Japan were not fighting on the Chinese mainland, then the question would be discussed differently. At the moment when the Japanese are deeply mired in the quagmire of the Chinese mainland and cannot extricate themselves, what way can they go except to make concessions to the Soviet Union? Will Germany help it? This is quite unimaginable. If the Japanese really want to act like blind idiots, then the Soviet Union will also be rude and give them an even more severe lesson and blow than the Zhanggufeng Incident!"

As we talked about this, many political and military training comrades who were receiving training here! These were all strong and healthy national heroes wearing gray cloth military uniforms. They all stood up one after another, tightly surrounding us, listening to our conversation. Coincidentally, our topic had also shifted to the Sino-Japanese War, so the reporter started from this aspect, trying to make the other party express his outstanding views:

"Since Your Excellency believes that the Japanese have been deeply trapped in the quagmire of the Chinese mainland and cannot extricate themselves, what do you think of the current situation of China's resistance and the prospects for victory?"

The red glow on his face became even more dazzling. He clenched his fist more excitedly and said:

"First of all, I must say that the Japanese have completely failed. They have occupied many points and lines in China and publicized internationally that they have conquered China. This is really a ridiculous trick of deceiving oneself. I have been a veteran for more than twenty years, but I have never seen anyone fight such a stupid battle. According to statistics, the Japanese now occupy a line in China. For the force of each division, at least 150 kilometers must be stationed, that is, more than 300 Chinese. Once we counterattacked, the crisis of its collapse can be imagined. The Japanese army is very thin. In the past battles, when fighting on one front, it was necessary to mobilize the forces of other fronts to participate in the war. , it will inevitably mobilize the forces of other fronts to participate in the war. In other areas, it will take a relatively defensive posture. But this situation has completely changed now. I have been in your country for half a year. I have walked through Chongqing, Guilin and other places, and I have personally seen that your country's new forces are growing by leaps and bounds. Your country's air force is the same, and it has developed greatly in terms of quality. The two most important tasks for your country at present are: First, how to develop vast resources, and how to mobilize a wider range of people to participate in the war of resistance; Second, how to use these developed resources and how to exert the power of these mobilized masses, the Japanese have only two destinies: First, mobilize the remaining troops in the country again and move deeply into the Chinese mainland. As a result, the Chinese launched a full-scale counterattack, and the Japanese lost sight of each other and eventually perished on the Chinese mainland; Second, quickly retreat from all occupied territories in China and prolong their lives..."

He expressed his great opinions like a torrent, and at this point, he was interrupted by a young comrade who was about sixteen or seventeen years old and received political training. …

"Then when can we counterattack?" He jumped up excitedly, pulled the comrade closer with one hand, leaned against his thigh, and his conversation was diverted to another direction by the excited mood:

"Comrades! Although I am a forty-two-year-old veteran, I feel like I am twenty years younger when I am among you! You will be the best organizers when you finish your training soon. China has such lovely young people, how can the war of resistance fail to achieve final victory—?…"

Like a loving father, he stroked the young comrade's face with both hands and said:

"The sun is shining on our heads, and our future is bright and vast!"

He was completely moved by his passion. The forty or fifty comrades standing around were also moved by this exchange of passion. Your eyes looked into my eyes, and my eyes looked into your eyes, speechless. The reporter then prompted him:

"Your Excellency! Just now this comrade asked you, when can China launch a full-scale counterattack!"

"Ah! Yes, comrades!" He shouted as if he had just woken up from a dream, "It depends on our subjective efforts. This may be the question that China's military leaders are considering. However, I cannot discuss this issue with you comrades here, because the Japanese spy network is too tight, but I can say with certainty that if all the battlefields in the country can do as well as the Second War Zone, then the special period for this full-scale counterattack will not be far away. China is now producing heroes of the world, and there are many such heroes here. That is Commander Yan and everyone!"

Everyone's hearts and feelings were mingled at the intersection of love, light, and victory, and their hearts and feelings felt infinite joy. The reporter thought that the conversation had been detailed, so he shook hands with him to thank him and said goodbye. (Minge Society)

### The World Awaits - British and French Issue Declarations - Clarifying Determination to Maintain the Mediterranean - European Situation Chaotic, Geneva May Unfold

[Associated Press, London, 13th] Chamberlain will make an important statement on British Mediterranean policy in the Lower House today, declaring that any threat to the territorial integrity of Turkey and Greece will be jointly resisted by Britain and France with military force. Mr. Chamberlain will also state that Britain has quickly provided assurances to Greece in response to the threat caused by Italy's invasion of Albania. Mr. Chamberlain also expressed that Britain is very concerned about Italy's delayed withdrawal of Spanish volunteers. The British Cabinet will meet at 11 a.m. to finalize the declaration. The Lower House will open at 2:45 p.m. (10:45 p.m. Hong Kong time).

[Associated Press, London, 13th] The French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, visited the Foreign Office at 10:50 a.m. today to conduct final discussions at the British Cabinet meeting.

[Associated Press, London, 13th] When going to Downing Street for the Cabinet meeting this morning, Kingslay arrived first, followed by Halifax. The Foreign Minister did not even have time to put on his coat and hat, and went straight into the Prime Minister's residence across the street. Other Cabinet members also arrived one after another.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Britain and France will issue a declaration simultaneously on the 13th, declaring protection for Greece and Turkey. The original text of the declaration will be sent to the US government for reference through diplomatic channels. It is reported that when French Prime Minister Daladier issued the declaration, he will firmly state that if anyone attempts to undermine the status quo in the Mediterranean, France will resolutely deal with them by force.

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The declaration of French Prime Minister Daladier will be announced tomorrow at the same time as the statement by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the Lower House. The intention is to make it clear to all centralized countries that any further acts of aggression, whether against Romania, Poland, Greece, or Turkey, will drag Britain and France into a whirlpool of war. Recently, the new Spanish ambassador made a statement to foreign reporters that has caused concern in various French quarters. According to the Spanish ambassador, if France wants to restore normal relations with Spain, it depends on whether France can faithfully fulfill the Berard Agreement and withdraw Italian volunteers from Spain.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] According to the emergency decree, French President Lebrun held a cabinet meeting yesterday and passed a new national defense measure, and approved the French Prime Minister's declaration on government policy today. The content of the military measures was not announced, but it was reported that France has ordered the national army, navy, and air force to prepare for emergencies. The French Prime Minister also attended the meeting to report on the general situation, and said that it is necessary for France to have military preparations. It is also reported that the French Prime Minister's declaration today will warn Germany and Italy that if they have any further attempts to invade the Mediterranean that damage French interests, they will inevitably encounter French military resistance. Britain and France, in view of Mussolini's failure to guarantee the withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain, have decided to issue a warning.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Political papers from various factions expressed their appreciation for the extremely important declarations of Chamberlain and Daladier. Britain's position in the Mediterranean, often referred to as the "bloodline of the Empire," will be immediately clarified, which is highly valued by all parties. There are various reports on how the Italian side will deal with its troops in Spain. While all newspapers advocate Chamberlain's strong and precise declaration, it is clearly limited. Some newspapers expressed praise for the change in US policy, stating that "since US President Roosevelt's speech, declaring 'fait accompli' and the promises of the Axis countries, some small countries will be threatened and split, and Hitler will have new actions." The "Petit Parisien" newspaper believes that the relations between Britain and France have been relaxed, and the international situation will become clearer day by day.

### It is Reported that Germany has Made Demands to Poland, with a Total of Four Conditions

[Associated Press, London, 12th] According to the "Daily Telegraph," the Polish ambassador to Germany is now on his way back to Warsaw, carrying Germany's demands to Poland, which were handed to him by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop this morning. The contents of the requirements are as follows: (1) Transfer Danzig to Germany; (2) Grant Germany the convenience of building a highway connecting Germany and East Prussia through the Polish Corridor; (3) Cede the eastern part of Silesia and the Polish territory of Upper Silesia; (4) Guarantee autonomy for the German minority in other places. According to the newspaper's Warsaw correspondent, large units of German troops are now gathering on the German-Polish border, and it is believed that the differences between the two countries will be resolved through negotiations, but Germany is determined to use force as a backing.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 12th] Well-informed sources in political circles here recently stated that when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with the Polish Ambassador on the 7th of this month, he explained Germany's views on the mutual assistance agreement agreed upon by Britain and Poland. According to German sources here, the German Foreign Minister told the Polish Ambassador that Britain's guarantee to Poland is contrary to the spirit of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact last year. Once the oral agreement agreed upon by Britain and Poland becomes a written agreement, the German government will have to re-examine the entire situation. As for the military measures taken by the Polish government, Germany cannot but regard them as "unfriendly" actions.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] According to a Warsaw dispatch, the purpose of the Polish Ambassador to Germany's return to Poland from Germany this time is to ask the government authorities for instructions. The rumor that he carried with him the German side's conditions for mediating the German-Polish dispute is not consistent with the facts.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 13th] The Polish West Province Federation is currently organizing various demonstrations, which will be held throughout Poland from the 15th to the 22nd of this month, attempting to awaken the Polish people and pay attention to the political situation in western Poland. It is found that the honorary members of the association are representatives of the Polish national society, government army, and overseas associations.

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 13th] The official here announced that some German Nazi Party members have been arrested for anti-Polish actions and insulting Polish soldiers.

[Associated Press, Danzig, 13th] The municipal government here recently lodged a protest with the Polish representatives, stating that a large number of leaflets filled with anti-German songs were dragged out of the Polish-Danzig corridor, and claimed that the leaflets stated that Danzig was Poland and should belong to Poland.

### Democratic Nations' Efforts: Diplomatic Activities Actively Led by Britain and France

[Reuters, London, 12th] Today, the High Commissioners of Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand visited the Dominions Office and met with the Minister for Dominion Affairs, Mr. Inskip. This afternoon, a key figure in the Conservative Party, Winston Churchill, went to 10 Downing Street to meet with the Prime Minister. He was cheered by the crowd as he entered Downing Street. When he left an hour later, he was again cheered by the crowd.

[Associated Press, London, 12th] British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax told the Soviet Ambassador yesterday that he believed the situation in Romania was extremely serious and asked what action the Soviet Union would take if Romania were invaded. The Soviet Ambassador replied that the Soviet Union did not intend to initiate assistance to Romania but would give sympathetic consideration to any proposal to defend Romania and other victims of aggression.

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Downing Street No. 10, the Prime Minister's residence, and the Foreign Office were constantly visited by dignitaries yesterday. Conservative right-wing leader Winston Churchill, Labour leader Clement Attlee, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield, and other cabinet members and senior officials held meetings with the Prime Minister yesterday. The ambassadors of France, Poland, and Turkey, as well as the American Chargé d'Affaires and the Danish Minister, also visited the Foreign Office.

[Haitong Agency, London, 13th] When various political figures visited the Foreign Office yesterday to meet with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, former Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden was also present. However, this news was only revealed this morning.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] It is reported that Premier Daladier reported on the general international situation at the cabinet meeting yesterday morning and explained the military steps taken by the government. The nature of these steps is being kept strictly secret by officials. Foreign Minister Bonnet had to go to Dieppe to preside over the unveiling ceremony of the statue of Queen Victoria, so he was unable to attend the meeting to present his report. British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps decided to remain in Paris and not attend the ceremony in Dieppe.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with the Romanian Ambassador today. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax also met with the Romanian Ambassador to Britain. The ambassadors immediately explained the results of the talks between their foreign minister and the Turkish Foreign Minister. Whether the British government will provide security guarantees to Romania depends on the outcome of the negotiations between Poland and Romania on mutual guarantees. In addition, the British Foreign Office is also in contact with Turkey and Greece. The negotiations between Britain and France and the Soviet Union are extremely important. Whether Poland and Romania can establish a defense agreement to resist Germany and whether Turkey can accept definite constraints depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union.

### Countries Continue Military Preparations: Soviet Fleet Enters the Mediterranean

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] Although the exact nature of the important army and navy measures passed at today's important cabinet meeting has not been revealed, it is rumored that the main purpose of these measures is to realize the close cooperation between the British and French fleets, especially the Mediterranean fleet.

[Haitong Agency, Istanbul, 12th] It was widely rumored here last night that twelve Soviet warships passed through the Bosphorus at night, heading for the Mediterranean. It is reported that the squadron is equipped with light and heavy cruisers and destroyers and belongs to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, but the names of the ships are unknown.

[Associated Press, Istanbul, 12th] According to naval sources, four Soviet destroyers and four submarines will pass through the Dardanelles tomorrow and Saturday at dawn. It is said that the purpose of this Soviet move is to strengthen its Far East Fleet. Britain and France are making extensive military preparations (including 160 warships) as a last-ditch effort to achieve peace. Since the weekend, military activity in Europe has increased significantly. In addition to Italy's new mobilization of one million troops, other countries are also carrying out military measures, briefly described as follows: (1) Poland: Conscripting the fourth level of reserves and reinforcing border defenses; (2) Yugoslavia: Conscripting the third level of reserves and concentrating troops on the border; (3) Hungary: Concentrating 300,000 troops on the Romanian border; (4) Netherlands: Canceling military leave and taking precautionary steps on the Dutch-German border; (5) France: Army and Navy officers are not allowed to take leave, and coastal defense, air defense, and the Maginot Line have been fully prepared; (6) Britain: Transferring 2,500 troops from Palestine to Egypt and concentrating a large number of warships in Malta and the Mediterranean area; (7) Belgium: In addition to reinforcing border defenses, orders have been issued to take defensive steps. Fascist sources reported that Mussolini had issued a statement, stating that unless special circumstances arise, Italy will no longer mobilize. Military sources believe that this statement is a warning to Britain and France. If Britain and France do not comply, Italy will implement general mobilization. According to the "Daily Mail," British and French reservists were ordered on Tuesday to prepare to return to their countries within two hours. It is also reported that French and Italian troops are now facing each other on the Moroccan border, and Franco has ordered the reinforcement of troops in Spanish Morocco on Italian orders. Athens received a report today that Mussolini is stepping up the fortification of the Adriatic coast.

[Associated Press, Beijing, 12th] It is reported that although the government has denied rumors that it has called up the fourth level of reserves, calling it premature, it has in fact decided to take action.

[Reuters, Beijing, 13th] Belgium has recently taken military steps, recalling about 5,000 officers, including demolition experts, anti-aircraft artillery units, the Namur and Liège fort artillery units, and reserve officers.

### U.S. Senators Denounce Japanese Atrocities, Advocate Aiding China's Resistance, and Defending Commercial Interests in China

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Senator Hiram Johnson, a Democrat from California, today advocated an embargo on arms to countries that indiscriminately bomb civilians with aircraft. Discussing the rampant Japanese actions in China, some senators advocated that such restrictions be applied solely to Japan. When asked about his opinion on taking action solely against Japan, Johnson said that he advocated that such measures should be universally applied to all countries that disregard the rule of law and bomb civilians, and not just to Japan. If the United States had not considered its commercial relations, an arms embargo against Japan would have been implemented long ago. Senator Fadess expressed opposition to the current Neutrality Act, believing that it only helps Japan invade China and causes China even more suffering. Although the neutrality regulations have not yet been invoked, American businessmen are unsure when war will break out and are afraid to trade with China because they fear that contracts may be canceled at any time. Senator Thomas said that the United States should defend its global interests and maintain the Open Door Policy in Asia. If it believes that American interests in China are threatened, it should immediately rise up and resist. "I express extreme sympathy for China. Although we have not invoked the Neutrality Act, we have constantly aided China." He strongly supports the fortification of Guam, "because Japan will never be able to pass this fortress and prevent them from going beyond the eastern seas." The current Neutrality Act and American loans to aid China have strengthened China's resistance. He further advocated continuing to sell the goods China needs to China. If the United States believes that it can provide loans, it should also provide loans to belligerent countries. Senator Pittman stated in the Senate that he believed that the retaliatory methods proposed for aggressor countries should be considered separately from the general Neutrality Act, but he did not want to suggest, as rumored, enacting separate legislation authorizing the president to declare a trade embargo against Japan.

Discussion on Amending the Neutrality Act

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] At today's meeting of the Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Affairs, there was a divergence of opinions on whether the Philippine Economic Act should be completed given the increasingly tense international situation. Senator King told the Associated Press that, in view of Japanese activities in the Far East and the Axis powers' alignment with them, differences in opinion among members of Congress have become more acute. King also mentioned the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, saying that some members of Congress believe that the world situation will undergo major changes. Therefore, they advocate that the Quinn Act be temporarily shelved until the overall situation becomes clear. However, some people believe that the United States should immediately find ways to alleviate the economic situation in the Philippines. King also said that some members of Congress believe that Japan has already divided spheres of influence with Germany and Italy and regards the Far East as its own.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Representative Bloom reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that he hoped to invite Colonel Lindbergh to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee as a witness to discuss the Neutrality Act, and that Lindbergh had agreed to contact him as soon as he arrived in Washington. It is reported that the Foreign Affairs Committee has three proposals: (1) The world powers swear to abide by the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (2) Abolish all constitutionally stipulated neutrality acts; (3) Strengthen the power of the administrative authorities to exercise neutrality laws. Representative Maas said that the United States should move its defense lines to wherever they are threatened, whether it is the Rhine or the center of the Soviet Union.

Brief Commentary

### Madam Soong Mei-ling's Encouragement to Hong Kong Women

Yesterday, Madam Soong Mei-ling summoned the staff of the Hong Kong Comfort Association and the Children's Welfare Association, praising the efforts of Hong Kong's women leaders in the work of national salvation. Since the start of the War of Resistance, Madam Soong, in addition to assisting Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the nation's highest leader, in political and diplomatic affairs, has also stood firm in the position of women's leader, dedicating herself from the front lines to the rear, and promoting the national liberation movement. Practicing what she preaches, enduring hardships and difficulties, and fighting more bravely as she fights, she is truly a model for women leaders across the country. Her encouragement to Hong Kong's women leaders is naturally very different from the "routine" encouragement of ordinary leaders. I believe that our women leaders will be able to deeply understand this, and that everyone will take Madam Soong's spirit of sacrifice and struggle as a model. This will not only make a significant contribution to the nation and the people but also pave the way for a bright and brilliant future for the women's liberation movement.

Since the full-scale War of Resistance began, the women of Hong Kong have made great efforts in publicity, fundraising, relief for refugees and children, and even frontline service. However, compared to the heroic struggles of women warriors in the country who are fighting hard under the bombing, slaughter, and looting of the enemy, there is still a long way to go. What is particularly serious is that the vast majority of lower-class women and housewives are still far from the work of national reconstruction and are engaged in the waste of mental and material resources. Although the main reason for this is due to the special environment of Hong Kong, the weakness of women's organizations themselves is also an important reason. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the women of Hong Kong should unite more firmly, abandon prejudices, overcome all difficulties, and smash the provocations and dissensions of enemy agents. Under the major premise of supporting the government in completing the national reconstruction undertaking, they should quickly form a united front of women, striving for national liberation from resolutely participating in the work of national salvation, and laying the foundation for women's equal political and social status in the actual struggle for national liberation. As for the current urgent tasks of the women's community, the previous article in this newspaper, "Intensify the Mobilization of Overseas Chinese Women," made some suggestions. We hope that everyone will pay attention to it, and we also hope that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong will work together to promote the consolidation and expansion of the united front of women in Hong Kong, as a model for the expanded mobilization of overseas Chinese women.

### Madam Chiang Kai-shek Soong Mei-ling Summoned Hong Kong Women Leaders Yesterday; Encouraged Overseas Chinese to Continue Their Efforts to Assist the Motherland; Will Intensify the Training of Women's Frontline Service Teams

Madam Soong Mei-ling, wife of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, rarely received guests during her stay in Hong Kong for medical treatment. However, yesterday she temporarily summoned leaders of the Hong Kong women's community, the Women's Comfort Association, and senior staff of the Children's Welfare Association. She inquired in detail about the work of the two associations. The Comfort Association and the Children's Welfare Association each gave detailed reports. Madam Chiang deeply praised the work of the two associations and encouraged everyone to work harder in the future, based on the determination that final victory will belong to us. She also instructed the Women's Comfort Association to convey to overseas Chinese at home and abroad, please continue to assist the motherland in the War of Resistance, and said that our government is currently in the period of the War of Resistance, and although it is extremely gratified for the enthusiasm and efforts of overseas Chinese in assisting the War of Resistance, it has no time to express anything until the war is finally won. After reaching the bright goal, the government will definitely give appropriate commendations. She then mentioned the enthusiastic situation of women's work in the country. According to her, the New Life Movement's fifth anniversary donation in Chongqing originally budgeted only 500,000 yuan this year. However, because housewives also mobilized to participate, the result was more than 2.5 million yuan. The women's side alone accounted for more than 600,000 yuan, which shows that the determination to resist the war in the family and the country has penetrated the hearts of the people at all levels. Even housewives are willing to do their best to participate in the work of national salvation. According to reports, when our army withdrew from Hankou, the New Life Women's Wartime Service Team trained by Madam Chiang ignored the danger under the sound of artillery and bullets and ran all over the city to persuade compatriots to flee as soon as possible, carrying luggage and holding children for them, etc. Also, when the service team arrived at a certain place, the enemy received a secret report from a traitor and sent planes to bomb it. As a result, three people were killed and three were injured. However, the team members were not afraid of danger and continued to work as usual. After learning about the bombing, Madam Chiang personally walked more than 30 li to the scene to express her condolences. The team members were very comforted to see that Madam Chiang was in high spirits and no less energetic than usual. A team member whose feet had been blown off and whose blood was all over her body shouted loudly at the time of her death, "Is our work just beginning and we are dying?" It can be seen that she did not forget her work at the time of her death. The team members work on the front line, serve the wounded, and strive to promote the meaning of cooperation between the army and the people. Now, Madam Chiang still intends to intensify the organization of training classes so that they can be assigned to frontline service, and continue to recruit frontline service team members' regular expenses (400 yuan per month per family). At that time, the Women's Comfort Association immediately donated the regular expenses of two teams, first paying six months of expenses. If the ability is sufficient, it will be considered to increase it. Finally, the two associations raised questions, and Madam Chiang gave detailed instructions and promised to do her best to help. The talks lasted for two hours before the meeting ended happily.

### Enemy Lacks Raw Materials for Shells; Searches for Cotton Cloth Scraps in Hong Kong; Agents Purchase Thousands of Pounds Daily; Factories Have Already Converted Them into Fuel to Replace Firewood

The weaving industry in Hong Kong has developed greatly in recent years. These weaving factories weave either high-priced knitted shirts or low-priced cotton shirts, underwear, towels, bath towels, etc. The value of those transported for export and sold in Hong Kong each year reaches several million dollars. There are no less than 300 large and small weaving factories in Hong Kong. Each day, each factory cuts large pieces of cotton cloth (this cotton cloth refers specifically to those used to make knitted shirts and underwear, which are different from the cloth used to make outerwear) to make knitted shirts and cotton woven underwear. The remaining cotton cloth scraps (called "chicken intestines" by people in the weaving industry because they are mostly curled up in the shape of chicken intestines) are numerous. On average, each factory has about 8,000 pounds of these "chicken intestines" per day. This "chicken intestines" is one of the raw materials for making explosives. Therefore, countries that are exhausted from war are very welcome to them, and their value is also very low, about 2 cents per pound in Hong Kong dollars. Since the enemy recklessly disturbed the Asian continent, it has repeatedly bombed undefended rear cities and towns, resulting in huge consumption. Therefore, it is also very short of this kind of explosive raw material and is constantly searching for "chicken intestines" in Hong Kong to replenish it. Those who run errands are merchants who have always specialized in buying this kind of cotton cloth scraps, buying them from manufacturers at low prices and reselling them to the enemy. This has not been interrupted until today. Among them, the manufacturers once refused to sell these cotton cloth scraps to the enemy. However, for some smaller weaving factories, the income from selling "chicken intestines" is a special income. If they refuse to sell them, they will be abandoned. If they accumulate over time, the losses will naturally be unbearable. In this kind of helpless situation, they can only let it take its course and sell the "chicken intestines," and they will not ask whether the purchasing merchants resell them to the enemy. However, recently, due to the war in South China, firewood prices in Hong Kong have been high. It is easy for general manufacturers to start a fire with "chicken intestines," and the firepower is also good. Therefore, they are used to replace part of the firewood to save fuel costs. It is estimated that the majority of these thousands of pounds of remaining cotton cloth scraps will not fall into the hands of the enemy. As for the purchasing merchants, their business situation is very much at its end.

### Rioters Rampage; Unable to Force People to Join the Association; Ganged Up to Assault People; Negotiations Break Down and Disputes Arise; Mechanic Mok Nam Seriously Injured in Assault

Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, in the Tai Koon Tea House in Yau Ma Tei, a sudden dispute broke out among many tea guests, with a surging momentum and a threat of violence. The owner of the building, Chen, and his partners joined forces to resolve the dispute and persuade them to stop fighting. The tea guests had no choice but to settle the bill and go downstairs. Unexpectedly, a fight broke out as soon as they went out into the street, and they punched and kicked each other. Before long, one person was injured and fell to the ground, losing all consciousness. The perpetrators, fearing legal repercussions, fled without a trace. Suddenly, police sirens blared, and police officers on duty nearby rushed to investigate after hearing the news. Seeing that the injured person was spitting blood and was in a serious condition, they called the police station to send a Red Cross ambulance to take him back to the police station to file a report and then to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. After the injured person regained consciousness, he was said to be named Mok Nam, a mechanic. Yesterday, he was forced to pay a fee to join the association by people from a certain triad, who extorted him. He was unwilling to lose money and refused to join. Yesterday, he and his friends went to the tea house to meet people from the triad to negotiate. A conflict broke out between the two sides. Unexpectedly, after they went downstairs, more than a dozen thugs from the triad who had been waiting in advance rushed forward to attack them.

### The Wu Yi Chamber of Commerce purchases and transports foreign rice to the interior for disaster relief, requests the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Gongbei Customs to execute tax exemption, and various overseas Chinese groups begin transporting relief rice to Macau.

The Enping, Kaiping, Taishan, Heshan, and Xinhui Wu Yi Chamber of Commerce has recently been actively involved in rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees due to the war in Jiangmen. It is particularly concerned about the food panic in the region. For days, it has been sending personnel to Macau and Gongbei Customs to negotiate for the continuation of the Ministry of Finance's order to exempt import duties so that it can purchase rice and quickly transport it for relief. However, as of now, the Gongbei Customs has not received a formal order from the Ministry of Finance and is unable to allow passage, which has caused various obstacles. It is reported that the Heshan Chamber of Commerce has decided to transport a large quantity of rice to Macau for transfer on Monday and has sent a letter to the Relief Federation and the Ancestral Rescue requesting the allocation of more than one hundred bags of remaining relief rice from Shenzhen to be used for distributing relief to refugees in the region. Furthermore, the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce has already started purchasing rice and will transport it to Macau for distribution in the interior once the Ministry of Finance replies, confirming that the Gongbei Customs will implement tax exemption.

### The weather remains extremely dry, and water reserves in Hong Kong and Kowloon are decreasing daily. The Hong Kong reservoirs hold 735.12 million gallons of water, while the Kowloon reservoirs still have 1.1 billion gallons.

Since the second half of last year, the weather in Hong Kong has been extremely dry. Rainfall has remained scarce this year. Although this is the rainy season in Hong Kong, according to the Observatory's report, the rainfall received this year has only reached a little over five inches, which is almost two inches less than the average of over seven inches. As for the water reserves in the reservoirs, they are also low due to the lack of rainfall. Yesterday, the Water Authority reported that the total water reserves in Hong Kong's reservoirs at the end of March were only 735,120,000 gallons. In the same month last year, the reserves reached 1,116,793,000 gallons, a difference of over 400 million gallons. As for the Kowloon reservoirs, the water reserves at the end of March this year are also more than 100 million gallons less than last year. The extent of the drought is evident here. If it does not rain, we overseas Chinese in Hong Kong will lament having food but no water. In March, Hong Kong residents used a total of 34,525,000 gallons of drinking water (including 14,275,000 gallons transported from Kowloon via submarine pipelines). With a population of 550,000 in Hong Kong, each person used 20.02 gallons of water per day. In the same month, Kowloon used a total of 24,398,000 gallons of drinking water. With a population of 500,000, each person used 15.7 gallons of water per day. In March this year, residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon have been very frugal with water. According to statistics for March last year, each person in Hong Kong used 29.7 gallons of water per day, which is more than 9 gallons more than this year. In March last year, each person in Kowloon used 22.7 gallons of water per day, compared to 15.7 gallons in March this year, a saving of 7 gallons. Last March, Hong Kong and Kowloon had a full-day water supply, but this year, the supply is only for eight hours.

### The Situation in Europe is Increasingly Tense, The New Territories are Being Armed, Military Installations Can Be Seen Everywhere in the Lok Ma Chau Area

The morning mist still shrouded the earth, and the air was filled with a damp atmosphere. The spring breeze blew in gusts, as if with boundless spring intentions. It seemed to say, "Spring has arrived in the world!"

After breakfast, the three of us drove our special car through the misty haze and headed towards the New Territories along Tai Po Road. After driving for less than thirty minutes, a colleague told me that "Amah Rock" was in sight. Indeed, from afar, it looked like a kind mother holding her son. The mountain was neither high nor low, only a few hundred feet away from the mainland. At the foot of the mountain, patches of green grass surrounded the natural scenery. The natural beauty was, after all, captivating.

At around ten o'clock, we arrived at our destination. We got out of the car and walked along the winding stone path into Lok Ma Chau. In the distance, we saw twenty or thirty simple and dense farmhouses. Driven by curiosity, I walked towards them. It turned out to be a village with a population of less than five hundred. Two or three farmers were engaged in their hard-working daily work, carrying iron hoes and bamboo baskets, coming and going, showing the "joy of rural life!"

In the afternoon, the scorching sun shone brightly in the sky. It was so hot that the moisture in our bodies evaporated, and we were drenched in sweat. Feeling thirsty, we had to buy some water from a roadside snack vendor to relieve the discomfort. Following a few small village children, we entered a heavily guarded place. The little village children said that this was the most important place in the New Territories. Sure enough, several Indian soldiers were guarding it closely, building small sandbags. It was said that there were dozens of them, presumably for defensive purposes. However, the surrounding area was full of mountains, with natural hazards. Even without sandbags, it was already very well-defended.

The guarding Indian soldiers looked at me strangely and asked what I was doing there. I was afraid that they suspected me of being a "spy," so I had to say something unrelated to military affairs to satisfy them. But they said that strangers were not allowed to enter, and if there was any suspicion, they would be detained without leniency. I lingered there for about ten minutes before leaving for another place. Everywhere we looked, we saw military installations. The arming of the New Territories was probably influenced by the arrogance of the Eastern invaders!

When we left Lok Ma Chau, it was just past three o'clock in the afternoon. We changed cars and went to Shatin and Tap Mun. First, we went to a vegetarian temple called "Tao Rong Yuan." The abbot there, Master Wenxiu, warmly welcomed us. He then sent a child to guide us to visit nearby scenic spots. After walking for forty minutes, we arrived at "Che Kung Temple." We saw men and women going to touch and worship, like a constant stream of traffic. The temple keeper used the spirits to deceive superstitious believers and make a fortune. There were several "swindlers" in the temple who specialized in using misfortune to scare ignorant women and extort money.

To the right of "Che Kung Temple" was a betel palm tree. Although it was less than twenty feet tall, its leaves were very lush. Many ignorant women silently prayed to it, murmuring something that no one knew. The military structures outside the temple were very strict. The newly installed barbed wire stretched for miles, like a long serpent.

A piece of land in the New Territories was purchased by a monk. Because the world situation is becoming more dangerous every day, he has specially designated a piece of land to build an air-raid shelter. Work has already begun. His plan is to build the shelter with large granite stones, about twenty feet high, thirty feet long, and ten feet wide, which can accommodate dozens of people. He said that when it is completed, he will plant several large trees on the surface of the shelter so that people will not panic during air raids. On the way back, I thought that if the claws of the invaders reached Hong Kong, the armed New Territories might give them a very stern lesson! (New)

### A Little Girl Touches the Flying General, Students from the Children's Academy Comfort Wounded Air Force Pilots, Li Binqiong Gives All She Has, Three Dollars, to the Air Force

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, teachers and dozens of student representatives from the Kowloon Children's Academy visited Huang Changlin, Xu Hanling, Wei Tang, and three wounded Air Force pilots at the hospital. When the reporter visited again to offer condolences, Commander Huang happened to be lecturing the visitors on the experience of the air combat, which was very inspiring to the listeners. When the student representatives bowed and presented various comfort items, suddenly an eight- or nine-year-old girl, Li Binqiong, took out three Hong Kong dollars from her pocket and presented them to Commander Huang, saying, "I'm giving you these three dollars to buy what you like." The teachers of the school were surprised that there was no such preparation in the school, how could she be so intelligent and generous? Commander Huang was so moved that he couldn't speak, and repeatedly declined, insisting that he couldn't accept the child's money, but the child also insisted that she would not take it back. After much persuasion from everyone, Commander Huang said, "Okay, I'll take it for now, I have a way." The soldiers Wei Tang were also so moved that they spoke to the children again, saying that when we recover, we will work harder to fight the Japanese planes to thank you for your kindness.

### Hong Kong Cultural Groups Welcome the Philippine Student Delegation, Report on the True Meaning of Our War of Resistance and the Relationship Between China and the Philippines, the Head of the Philippine Delegation Expresses Deep Sympathy for Our War of Resistance

This Philippine student delegation, a group of thirty-five men and women, traveled mightily from the peaceful island nation of the Philippines, under the protection of a democratic country, to a country about to bloom with blood-red cherry blossoms, invited to attend a "Third Philippine-Japan Student Conference," a grand gathering to promote Fascist culture. According to the itinerary, Hong Kong Island was a necessary stop. This group, said to be workers connecting international culture, arrived at the smoggy Kowloon Wharf on the "Empress of Canada" on a quiet afternoon the day before yesterday.

Hong Kong, the beautiful island that deserves the name "Little London," easily put together a welcoming party in an instant. The Hong Kong Young Journalists Association, the Xue Zhen Hui, the Men's and Women's Youth Association, and several women's groups fulfilled their responsibilities as hosts, and hosted this group of young people at the "Ying King" Restaurant in the mixed Chinese and Western district of Wan Chai. The meeting time was at noon yesterday.

In addition to the group's male advisor, Mabillan Gen, female advisor, Malena, chairman, Launa, and most of the members, representatives from the local groups, Professor Xu Dihui of the University of Hong Kong, Chairman Li Zhengyao of the Xue Zhen Hui, Chen Pishi, son of the iron-fisted diplomat Chen Youren, Chairman Wen Huanrong of the welcoming party, and comrades from the Men's and Women's Youth Association, and more than fifty reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended.

Amid enthusiastic applause, Mr. Wen stood up and told the young people of the friendly nation in an emphatic tone, solemn voice, and affirmative expression that our country's war of resistance this time is for world peace and for human justice, and is acting as a pioneer. He hoped that when the student delegation arrives in the island nation, they should open their eyes and ears and not be blinded by the propaganda of the puppet regime. Mr. Wen concluded by hoping that the student delegation would turn around and look to Eastern Europe, deeply recognize the story of Czechoslovakia's bloodless demise, and come to a subjective conclusion as soon as possible, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past.

Following the applause was Professor Xu Dihui's speech. Among the crowd of "Sha Tu Jing" in Western suits, his national dress and long gown stood out even more for its elegance. The speech process never lost the demeanor of a scholar, indicating how confident our country is in the future of the war of resistance, and the conflict between the ruling authorities and the public sentiment of neighboring countries, which was thorough and clear. Chen Pishi's speech was humorous and full of profound meaning, with smiles often hanging on people's lips. Finally, the chairman of the student delegation, Launa, gave a reply to conclude the gathering. Launa spoke as if with some unspeakable happiness. After straightening her glasses, she said that this time, attending the "Third Philippine-Japan Student Conference" in Japan was passive, and after the investigation, she would return to the Philippines and make a concrete report, with no other intention. She expressed deep sympathy for China's war of self-defense and wished our country final victory. She continued to say that the Chinese and Philippine peoples have close relations in terms of blood, history, society, and geography, and that the culture of the Philippines also comes from China. Finally, she advocated the establishment of a China-Philippines Student Association to connect the feelings of students from the two countries.

The delegation is scheduled to conduct an investigation in Japan for one month and return to the Philippines on May 15. The group of thirty-eight people will take the French postal ship Zhan Lapo to Japan today.

### The Japanese Attempt to Invade Siyi Has Not Been Suppressed, Fierce Battles Occurred in Daze Siqian, The Japanese Army Fled in Retreat Towards Huicheng, Danshui Estuary Was Once Tense But Fortunately Remained Safe, Food Shortage in Shaping, Heshan Awaits Relief

[Zhongshan Express] After the Japanese army suffered a major defeat in Jiangmen and Huicheng, they are now busy replenishing and reinforcing. Our Western Route military authorities believe that it is appropriate to take advantage of the opportunity to launch an attack while the Japanese are waiting for a breather, so our military teams have launched an offensive in recent days, pressing towards Jiangmen and Huicheng. However, in order to break free from our pressure and contain our counterattack on Tingmen, the Japanese invaded Daze Siqian on the 12th. Fortunately, our army and teams were brave and managed to defeat the invading stubborn Japanese. The details of the battle are recorded below:

Three Reinforcements, Re-Invasion of Daze

In the previous battle of the Japanese army's invasion of Daze, hundreds of soldiers were lost. However, the Japanese side's attempt to invade Siyi has not been slightly suppressed. In recent days, Japanese warships have gathered in the area of ​​North Street and Waihai, transporting a batch of reinforcements. On the morning of the 12th, after the Japanese reinforcements arrived in Huicheng, they used a large number of mechanized troops as the vanguard, and also coordinated with 12 aircraft to fiercely bomb our military positions in the area of ​​Niuwan and Daze, lasting for more than 30 minutes, dropping hundreds of bombs. Afterwards, they used a mixed force of about 5,000 infantrymen to fiercely attack our Niuwan along the Ningyang Railway, coming with great momentum. At that time, our army stationed there, because the fortifications were all destroyed, transferred their positions, and Daze was once occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese then continued to attack Siqian fiercely, gradually intending to directly attack Danshui Estuary. Our Daze retreated troops, together with the originally stationed troops, used the inherent superior positions to bravely counterattack. The Japanese army was suddenly ambushed, and the formation was in chaos. Our army advanced rapidly, forcing a close-quarters battle. After fighting until 3:00 PM, they fled in retreat towards Huicheng. Our army took advantage of the victory and recovered Daze. The current crisis was thus resolved, and Danshui Estuary was also turned from danger to safety. It was found that when Daze was occupied, the Japanese once rushed to a place about five miles away from Danshui Estuary, so the situation at that time was very tense. As a result of this fierce battle, more than 300 Japanese puppet soldiers were killed by our army, more than 20 warhorses, and countless military equipment and supplies were captured.

Taishan People Send Telegrams to Congratulate the Victory

The people from all walks of life in Taishan County were extremely pleased that the Japanese army's invasion of Daze Siqian was resisted by our military officers and soldiers, who bravely counterattacked and greatly frustrated the fierce attack. They decided to send representatives of the people to offer condolences and express their respect. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to congratulate. The telegram said, "To the rear office of the Seventh Security Regiment, to the officers and soldiers who are fighting against the Japanese on the front line, the Japanese are wreaking havoc and invading our Siyi. Wherever the Japanese go, the houses are reduced to ruins. This hatred is irreconcilable. Fortunately, the generals have taken up their majestic power and worked hard to kill the thieves, destroying the Japanese. The good news has spread, and everyone is rejoicing. We are about to see the Yellow Dragon being directly attacked and our territory restored. We hereby send a telegram to offer condolences. We are extremely impressed. The Taishan people from all walks of life armed to defend the Taishan demonstration movement assembly." The Kaiping people's anti-Japanese support group also sent a similar telegram.

Deng Longguang Inspects the Front Line in Heshan

Also, since Shaping, Heshan, was taken over by our army, our army strengthened the front-line force in Gulao Po Mountain, preparing to cross the river and counterattack. Commander Deng Longguang of the XX Army, in order to encourage morale, inspected the front line on the 10th and gave instructions on the counterattack plan. The reporter met Commander Deng on Shagu Road and asked him about his feelings about the recovery of Shaping. He said that the front line in Heshan is very consolidated, and the Japanese will not be able to succeed. The enthusiasm of the people in Heshan for resisting the war is rarely seen by me since I fought in the north and south of the Yangtze River. When our army counterattacked Shaping, there was a shortage of military food, and the local people were able to automatically transport rice and grain to the Yuqiao front line. Also, a certain village, at a time of food shortage, used taro and sweet potatoes to comfort the soldiers. It was even more commendable that some people slaughtered pigs and chickens. I am deeply moved. Food here is indeed facing difficulties, with only about three catties of rice that can be bought per dollar. I believe the authorities will have appropriate relief for this.

### Great Victory in Dongjiang, Our Army Encircled Zengcheng on Three Sides, Yesterday We Recaptured Zhuguling and Wentouling, The Traffic of Japanese Troops in Shitan Was Intercepted by Us

[Boluo Express] The Dongjiang Wu Army, together with the Second Army Group, which is pushing forward step by step, is fiercely attacking the Japanese, and good news is frequently reported. The people here are deeply excited. On the morning of the 11th, our military authorities announced the recapture of key points near Zengcheng. The Japanese, who are stubbornly defending Zengcheng, are being besieged by us on three sides. Our guerrillas also attacked Shitan once, which made the people of the entire county applaud with joy.

Our Army Recaptured Zhuguling and Other Places

The Huibo Army attacked in multiple directions on the 2nd of this month. After Tan Zhengguo eliminated hundreds of Japanese troops, the Japanese continued to reinforce and stubbornly defend. In order to preserve strength, our army monitored the Japanese and waited for the various armies to advance to their designated locations before launching an attack on Jiujiang. After our army recaptured Huaxian, our left-wing army continued to carry out its active war and approached Qiaotou, Zhuguling, Wentouling, and other places on the evening of the 11th. The Japanese army responded in a hurry, but in the face of our mighty army, the momentum was like a broken bamboo. At that time, we recaptured various places and seized a great deal.

Encircled on Three Sides, Zengcheng Can Be Taken

After our army recaptured the ridges near Zengcheng, we cut off the highway connecting Zengcheng and Zhongxin. The Japanese army then retreated to the suburbs of Zengcheng and the Ling Mountain, echoing the Japanese army in Luofu Mountain and linking up with the Japanese army on the railway line in an attempt to hold on stubbornly. Our military authorities ordered the three armies to launch a fierce attack on Zengcheng in multiple directions.

Cut off the Rear Route of the Japanese Army and Attack Shitan

In order to cut off the rear route of the Japanese army, in addition to ordering the security regiments stationed in Wentang and Liaobu, and the units of Yuan Huazhao to push forward step by step, at the same time, our army in Xiancun coordinated with the guerrillas to attack. A part of the army moved towards Shitan, destroying the traffic line in Shitan and intercepting small groups of Japanese troops. Once our army arrives, they will attack Shitan.

### Invading Qiong × Relieving the Vacancy, Our Army Takes the Opportunity to Counterattack, Four District Teams Advance Simultaneously, Fierce Battles Have Occurred

[Southern Route Express] After the invading Qiong × army launched offensives on all fronts in the east, west, north, and south, ×, due to insufficient strength, recently transferred a unit of the × army stationed in Qiong back to Guangdong to supplement the northwest lines. Therefore, the number of × army has sharply decreased in recent days, and its strength is empty. Our army teams, in order to sweep away the × bandits and recover lost ground, launched a full-scale offensive on the 29th and 30th, conducting encirclement and annihilation attacks on × army at various points. The news obtained is recorded below:

Qiongdong × Army Relieves the Vacancy

According to a telegram received here yesterday from Qiongdao, the number of invading Qiong × army has sharply decreased recently. In counties such as Wenchang, Qiongshan, Ding'an, Yaxian, and Chengmai, the number is only about three to four thousand, and most of them are Korean. The × army, seeing the weakness of its forces, has been instigating puppet traitors to organize pseudo-self-defense forces and pseudo-police forces in the aforementioned areas, luring local ruffians and traitors to participate. At the same time, they have been going to various villages to arrest villagers and drive them to the front lines to fill vacancies and defend against counterattacks by our army. On the one hand, they are building various defensive fortifications, hoping to hold on to the death. In the past week, they have been taking a defensive stance and dare not come out to disturb.

Our Army Takes the Opportunity to Launch a Full-Scale Counterattack

Wang Yi, the garrison commander of Qiongya, after leading his troops to retreat to a certain place, has been actively replenishing his troops, mobilizing the people to arm themselves, and promoting widespread guerrilla warfare. Therefore, the war on Qiongdao has been silent for half a month. Now that most of the invading Qiong × army has been transferred back to the province to fight on various lines, the interior is empty and the strength is weak. Taking the opportunity to counterattack will surely achieve the effect of pointing to the arm. He specifically ordered the four guerrilla teams under his command to start a counterattack. After receiving the order, the commanders of each district, including Yang Yonghua, the guerrilla commander of the eastern district, have led their troops to attack Wenchang, Qiongdong, Donghui, and Wanning counties. Luo Lianfeng, the guerrilla commander of the southern district and deputy security commander, led the security teams to advance into Baoting, Yaxian, Ledong, and Ganen. Long Ju, the guerrilla commander of the western district and commander of the ×th regiment of the security corps, is also preparing to attack × in Baisha and Changjiang counties. Feng Baiju and Liu Qiuju, the guerrilla commanders of the northern district, are commanding more than 6,000 guerrillas to directly attack Qiongshan, Anding, Chengmai, and Linggao counties. Fierce battles have broken out on the 29th and 30th, and there have been considerable gains, it is said.

### Our Three Routes Launched a Major Counterattack, Guangzhou's × Being Depleted, × Army Panicked, More Residents Leaving the City Daily

The Foshan Wheel of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Steamboat Company returned to Hong Kong from the province yesterday. The wheel carried a total of 1,154 Chinese and Western passengers, mostly women and children. According to passengers, the armies of the east, west, and north have launched major counterattacks simultaneously in the past ten days. Especially the military progress of the North River is the fastest and has achieved great victories. It once approached the suburbs of the city, and the provincial capital also heard the sound of artillery fire repeatedly. People's hearts were abnormally shaken, and most of them left with their families. The × army, in order to cope with the military situation on three sides, is in a situation of being stretched thin. In recent days, military transportation has been unusually busy. In the city, such as Hanmin Road, Taiping Road, and Changdi, × army can be seen departing to reinforce the front. Whenever departing, martial law is enforced, prohibiting pedestrians from coming and going until the transportation is completed before the martial law is lifted. The departing × army is in an abnormally decadent state and the military's morale is war-weary. It can be seen that the × army originally stationed in the city is not many. After being transferred in recent days, it has become extremely empty. The bandits took the opportunity to steal and rob homes, even more than before. The × army, in order to prevent night attacks by our brave air force and the activities of guerrilla teams, extinguished all the lights in the city every day at 8:00 PM. Traffic on the water was cut off at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. The × army dispatched in the urban area also completely returned to the team. Therefore, every night, there were no pedestrians in the city, as if it were a dead city. The terrifying situation is difficult to describe. At this moment, × is less strict in restricting residents from leaving the city than before. It is estimated that they already know that Guangzhou cannot be held for long. In the near future, it may be reduced to a war zone. Therefore, residents are allowed to leave the city, and residents are only afraid of not leaving quickly enough. In recent days, our air force has not flown to Guangzhou to bomb, but × aircraft continue to take off, circling and reconnaissance, to prevent our aircraft from covering up. The sound of the machine is rumbling all day, and the vigilance is very strict, probably because of the heavy damage suffered during the bombing by our aircraft a few days ago. On the way back to Hong Kong, the Foshan Wheel heard very loud artillery fire when passing through Xinzhao. It is thought that the East River military affairs are developing fiercely. When leaving Humen, several × ships were seen patrolling back and forth.

### Guangdong Province Was Ordered to Organize Relief for Unemployed Laborers, Transporting the Laborers to Various Southwestern Provinces, All Engaged in Small Industrial Production

[Shaoguan Express] When the War of Resistance broke out, the industry and commerce wherever the × army went were destroyed. There were many distressed laborers everywhere. The Central Government, remembering the many unemployed disaster victims, specifically instructed the National Relief Committee to cooperate with the China Industrial Cooperative Association to transport refugees to the various southwestern provinces to engage in small industrial production. Formulating cooperative measures, ordering all provinces to work together to organize, the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association has already received this order from the Central Government yesterday, and is now preparing to handle it. The content of the relief small industrial laborers cooperative measures are recorded below: (1) The China Industrial Cooperative Association will formulate detailed plans and addresses for opening factories, and notify the Relief Committee in advance so that refugee stations in various places can find ways to transport laborers to various places. (2) If the China Industrial Cooperative Association already has a factory organization in a certain place, or will have a factory open, it should be requested to notify the Relief Committee of the type of workers needed, the number of people, and the treatment conditions, so as to assist in handling registration. (3) If the handicraftsmen and their direct family members who have been investigated and registered by the China Industrial Cooperative Association or the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office move to the interior, the Relief Committee may transport them according to the refugee transportation measures, issue refugee certificates and vehicle and ship certificates. (4) The Relief Committee may, according to the needs of the situation, establish a district office in the China Industrial Cooperative Association, specially set up collection stations for laborers who have not yet formed cooperatives and their families. Those who do not belong to the scope of the Relief Committee will be approved by the Relief Committee to be established in each relief area. (5) The Relief Committee will provide two months of living expenses in accordance with the relief refugee measures to handicraftsmen who have been reviewed and registered by the Industrial Cooperative Association or the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office before resuming work if they need to receive living expenses. (6) If there are small-scale factories and their workers registered and moved to the interior to resume work, the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office should handle the transportation of small machines in accordance with the transportation of machinery measures if there are difficulties in transportation, and the Relief Committee should handle the transportation of workers and workers' scrolls if there are difficulties. (7) If workers and their families who have been reviewed and registered need to be concentrated and organized to be sent to the interior, the management matters should be handled by the New Transport Association and the Women and Children Association in accordance with the measures for compiling and sending female workers.

### Guangdong Military and Political Authorities Strictly Ordered Their Subordinates to Abide by the Law and Be Public-Spirited

[Shaoguan Express] The Guangdong Provincial Military and Political Authorities received instructions from the National Government yesterday, strictly ordering their subordinates to uphold integrity. After receiving the order, Commander-in-Chief Zhang of the Fourth War Zone and Chairman Li of Guangdong Province have strictly ordered their subordinates to abide by it. The original order said, "The failure of the country is ultimately due to corrupt officials. Without punishing corruption, how can we plan for governance? Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the government has planned to defend against foreign aggression by first reforming internal affairs. Practicing integrity and rectifying discipline are the most urgent tasks. Temporary regulations for punishing poverty and corruption have been formulated and promulgated, and all heads of institutions have been ordered to strictly prevent and earnestly report. The integrity of officials is closely related to political prosperity and the well-being of the people. At this critical moment of national crisis, all officials should reflect on the difficulties of the times and be more vigilant. If there is any slight negligence in expenditure, the people will have more doubts. If there is any slight encroachment on public funds, there is no hope for the revitalization of all affairs. Furthermore, today, the situation of the War of Resistance is becoming favorable, and political construction should progress simultaneously with military affairs. There is even less tolerance for unscrupulous officials to be corrupt and derelict in their duties, increasing the suffering of the people and hindering the implementation of national policies. This special order reiterates the previous order, strictly warning all public officials to respect military law and discipline, uphold integrity, and not to think that taking advantage is harmless, or that enriching oneself is a good plan. They must know that the people's words are fearful and the national law is inescapable. Those who commit fraud and seek personal gain will be exposed one day. If they dare to try again and bring punishment upon themselves, the government will definitely enforce the law. Each head official has the responsibility to supervise and correct subordinates, and should set an example by preventing problems before they arise. For those subordinates who are greedy for money and whose integrity is not credible, they must be reported and eradicated at any time, so as to eliminate corruption and achieve the ultimate goal of rectifying officialdom and creating a new official governance, in order to live up to the government's intention to rectify officialdom and create a new official governance. This is the order."

### × Invaded Guanghai Again Yesterday, Was Repelled by Our Garrison and More Than Twenty Were Killed

[Taishan Express] Since the coastal × ships gathered in the waters around Shangchuan and Xiachuan Guanghai, they have repeatedly sent speedboats to patrol the waters around Shadi and Haiyan to spy and intercept fishing boats and cargo boats. The authorities, for the sake of careful prevention, ordered the coastal garrison to be on strict alert. On the morning of the 11th, dozens of × soldiers in the eighth district of Guanghai took speedboats to land on Longwei, Xiachuan Island, and wandered around spying. Around 8:00 AM, the × ships berthed on the Shadi, Shangchuan Island fired artillery shells at the Guanghai coast. Then eight or nine speedboats with more than a hundred soldiers rushed ashore, and two water planes were dispatched to fly low along the coast and strafe machine guns. Our army, in order to lure × to land and annihilate them, retreated slightly. After the × soldiers arrived at the predetermined location, they densely strafed them with machine guns. The × soldiers repeatedly approached the defense line but were repelled. After about two hours of fierce fighting, × was unable to support and fell into the sea to escape. It is said that × was killed by our army with more than twenty people, and several members of our team also sacrificed. It was also found that the × soldiers who landed on Longwei, Xiachuan Island, did not retreat from invading Guanghai, and also fled to the ship in embarrassment one after another, it is said.

### Laurel Buries Wife Seeks Divorce

[AP Hollywood, December 12] Comedian Laurel was sued by his wife today for divorce, demanding division of property and alimony of $1,000 per month. Laurel's wife cited reasons that Laurel had attempted to bury her alive in the backyard and had been beaten and hospitalized for many days.

### Film Novel Two A Night of Joy (1)

Original Name Idiots Delight Produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Starring Norma Shearer

Edward Arnold

The curtain on the stage fell again. Harry Van, sitting in front of the makeup table stained with greasepaint, mechanically washed the makeup off his face. However, tonight, he felt even more tired and weary of this mechanical action. All his troubles were because Ms. Shirelle could not fulfill her duties.

This great Ms. Shirelle is Harry's opponent on stage. He can recite the play like flipping through a book. However, this fluency is limited to outside the stage. Now, on stage, what she shows is no different from a drunk person.

The situation tonight is not much worse than usual, because someone apparently knew her problem and reminded her from the side of the stage. This method, of course, prevented her from making mistakes again. However, almost all the audience sitting in the first few rows heard it. Tomorrow, of course, Ms. Shirelle will swear to God that this will never happen again and that she will never need anyone's help again. But, when "Little Pebble" is staged next week, she will immediately feel like she has a cold and fever. Thus, the same story will always be repeated like this.

A vague, boring smile flashed across Harry's lips.

"There will always be such a day," he said to himself, "Harry Van is free."

He has said this sentence countless times in these few months since he returned from France. He used to wear a military uniform, hold a gun, and have a confused heroic heart to join the war. When he returned to the streets of New York with a group of people, welcomed by the surging women and flying confetti, what he brought back was still a confused heart, an injured arm, and a soul broken by the war.

### Xu Weipei Displays the Majesty of the Alliance Leader, Defeating His Powerful Enemy, Xiao Linzhen. Xu's Initial Abnormal State Led to a Situation of Losing First and Winning Later. Today, Lin Tiande's Battle with Da Linzhen Is Expected to Be Fierce.

The Hong Kong Open Grass Court Tennis Tournament took place yesterday afternoon, with last year's champion, Xu Weipei, facing off against last year's runner-up, Xiao Linzhen. Da Xu has made considerable progress over the years, and his skills have improved significantly. Xiao Linzhen's tennis skills are also exquisite, surpassing his brother Da Linzhen. Therefore, Chinese and Western women knew that this match would be a fierce battle, and they flocked to watch the two compete, taking the joy of their skills, the lively situation being the only one since the start of the tournament. Those who arrived late had to stand outside. Who said that Hong Kong people only know about football?

At the beginning of the match, Da Xu showed errors. Looking at his expression, there seemed to be another stimulus, causing his actions to be at a loss, losing his control ability, and losing points easily. Some viewers said that he underestimated his opponent, but this was not the case, but rather a momentary carelessness. Fortunately, his chess skills were higher and he was able to catch up quickly. He finally used his intelligence to make Xiao Linzhen tired of running, and thus completed the final victory. After passing this hurdle, the road ahead became brighter, and winning the championship again was an expected event. However, there are still many strong enemies, and he still needs to work hard.

First Set

Xiao Linzhen had great ambitions and did his best to exert his power. He won the first game first. Then, using fierce serves and fast shots, he was smooth sailing and led by four to one. Da Xu worked hard to catch up and won back a game, but in an instant, Xiao Linzhen made a desperate situation of five to two. Da Xu knew that the overall situation of this set was gone, so he changed his style and maintained his strength, and finally lost first with three to six. In this set, Da Xu completely lost his normal state. His performance of tennis skills was far from his original level. He missed twice in almost every game. Backhand shots were even more insignificant. Xu's fans sighed at the sight.

Second Set

Da Xu calmed down and proceeded step by step, winning the first game first. After eating a reassuring pill, he then threw the ball left and right, with sharp angles and slanting landing points, showing the recovery of his normal state. The situation improved. Xiao Linzhen ran with the ball, struggling hard, and would not let go even a bit of a ball. Therefore, his vitality was greatly damaged, and his fierce shots gradually became weak. Therefore, Da Xu launched a fierce attack, forming a situation of one to five. In order to steadily win, Da Xu maintained his strength on the one hand, and used soft and hard balls to lure his opponent on the other hand, causing him to run around. Although he was still chased back two games, Xiao Linzhen was already exhausted at this time. Afterwards, Da Xu went from soft to hard again, and was invincible. He then won back the second set with six to three, forming a one-to-one tie.

Third Set

At this decisive moment, Xiao Linzhen's vigor had been frustrated. He did not play vigorously. There were many balls falling into the net and out of bounds. At the same time, Da Xu used spin balls with dangerous landing points, either in front of the net or on the sidelines, making Xiao Linzhen unable to figure it out. He achieved it in one go, taking the lead with four to zero, and his basis for turning defeat into victory was determined. Moreover, under Xiao Linzhen's response, his path had been exhausted, and his spirit seemed to be lost, and his strength was no longer able to keep up. He was powerless and the situation collapsed. The balls he shot often lost direction, so with one to six, he was again harvested by Da Xu.

He Jialiu's match against Liang Shihua was not very spectacular. Liang's tennis skills were not mediocre, but his performance yesterday was insignificant and his strength was weak. He suffered a major defeat. He's strength was not abundant either, but his ball skills were skilled and his experience was rich. He would shoot and flick from time to time, and short shots were handy. Therefore, he won two sets in a row, winning with six to two and six to one.

Yesterday's Results

Xu Weipei won Xiao Linzhen with Three to Six Six to Three Six to One

He Jialiu won Liang Shihua with Six to Two Six to One

Today's Order

One singles and doubles game will be held today. The battle between Da Linzhen and Lin Tiande in the singles game is the most eye-catching, and there will definitely be a fierce dispute. Da Linzhen is an old hand in the game. People know how his ball skills are. Lin Tiande is a famous general who returned from Nanyang. Last week, he defeated Fencha, giving the audience a good impression. The people of Xianxu think that this son is a tennis genius, but his experience is still new. Today, he is fighting against Da Linzhen. One is young and strong, and the other is skilled in tennis. Under the encounter, there will definitely be more wonderful performances, and the winner is unpredictable. In the doubles, the cooperation between He Jialiu and Li Rurong is very good, and they may be able to win.

### The Eastern Football Team's Southern Expedition Shakes Hanoi with Thunderous Applause; The First Two Matches Result in Great Victories

[Hanoi Dispatch] The Eastern Football Team, a group of seventeen, departed from Hong Kong on the "Qingyuan" ship on April 2nd. After five days and nights of sailing, they arrived at Haiphong. At 10 AM on the 7th, they disembarked. After passport inspection, they departed at 2 PM, taking a bus to Hanoi. The chairman of the Hanoi Football Association, Mr. Cudo, greeted them at the bridge dam entering Hanoi.

First Battle: The Eastern Team Achieves Instant Success

He also requested an immediate match at the stadium. The bus arrived in Hanoi at 4:45 PM. The Eastern team, considering the difficult situation and seeing that the team members were young and strong, readily agreed. However, due to the late hour, the match was shortened to thirty-five minutes, with Silva as the referee. The result was a 4-1 victory, truly instant success.

Over two thousand spectators surrounded the field. The Eastern team, wearing pure red jerseys, lined up in front of the grandstand. Compatriots cheered thunderously. After paying respects to local officials, they briefly warmed up. At the whistle, the Eastern team's lineup was as follows:

Liu Xianhan, Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Wu Qixiang, Cao Qiuting, Zhang Jinhai, Li Deqi, Xu Wenkui, Chen Bingshi

The opposing team, Junlian, was a combined team of four military units. They were tall and strong, but their ball control was slightly lacking. The team consisted of Dalila, Lopayehov, Wen Maisong, Nanjie Songlab, Lunik, Colamari, Cai Libei, Dalu Fuke, Laxi Chai, and Tuo.

The home team showed courtesy. The Eastern team immediately took the offensive, moving the ball around. However, due to the fatigue of travel and unfamiliarity with the field (hard, small, and slightly uneven), they didn't perform at their best. At fifteen minutes, left-winger Cao Qiuting got the ball and intended to cross. Seeing the goalkeeper facing elsewhere, he shot, the ball spinning and touching the goalkeeper's leg before entering the net, opening the scoring.

Junlian counterattacked with great force, but Liu Xianhan kept the door shut, putting on a brilliant performance that earned praise from a French journalist in the stands, who considered him "better than Zhang Rongcai." By the end of the first half, the Eastern team had a slight advantage of 1-0.

After the change of ends, the Eastern team's players gradually became more familiar with the field. The coordination between Wenkui and Jinhai especially earned the audience's praise. In a flash, Chen Bingshi crossed, Deqi leaped, and Jinhai followed up with a kick, the net resounding. This clear goal was met with applause from all around.

At this point, Junlian became enraged, barging straight in. Miao Huaguo cleared with a long kick. Junlian switched to the left wing to attack. Zhongyun was out of position, and Qixiang couldn't hold them off alone, allowing the left-winger to score a goal. 2-1, the situation became tense for a time. At this point, the Eastern team's forwards showed better coordination. Light passes and fierce shots were all well-executed. Cao Qiuting and Li Deqi then scored successively, both tapping the ball into the net in front of the goal. The credit for the passes mainly went to Xu Wenkui, whose agile movements, upward kicks, and low passes were all perfectly timed.

When the whistle blew, the sky was already dim.

In this match, the Eastern team's players should be assessed as follows:

In attack, Qiuting and Wenkui had the best ball control. Jinhai performed better in the second half than the first. Li put in a lot of effort and was dangerous. Bingshi was not very satisfactory.

In defense, Qixiang was the best, but he was slightly responsible for the conceded goal (passing inward instead of outward, allowing the opposing forwards to show off in front of the goal). Jingcheng and Weiquan were both able to supply the front line in the second half. Huaguo was better than Zhongzhen. Xianhan made many saves and was particularly commendable for his calm head.

After the match, the entire team went to the Xinhua Hotel to rest. Everyone was exhausted and fell asleep early. Eastern team leader Zeng Peifu waited for the ship in Haiphong and accompanied them to Hanoi, taking care of them all the way, which was very appreciated.

Second Battle: A Great Victory Over Hanoi's Second Team

At 4 PM on the 8th, at the Hanoi Military Entertainment Club stadium, the Eastern team showed their skills again, defeating the Hanoi All-Stars Second Team 3-0.

In this match, each half lasted forty-five minutes, with Silva as the referee again (at the invitation of the Hanoi Referee Committee), which was well-received by the local audience.

The Eastern team's lineup was the same as yesterday, except that Li Deqi had to leave twenty minutes into the match due to stomach pain, and Yu Qiaoxing replaced him on the right inside-forward. Xu Wenkui moved to center-forward. Wu Qixiang left in the second half due to a foot injury and was replaced by Xu Buyun. The lineup was as follows:

Liu Xianhan, Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Wu Qixiang, Xu Buyun, Cao Qiuting, Zhang Jinhai, Li Deqi, Xu Wenkui, Yu Qiaoxing, Chen Bingshi

Hanoi All-Stars Second Team:

Pell Gore, Obeiqi, Mi Shi, Ning Shi, Er Bei Shi, Feng Shi, Zhu Shi, Hai Shi, Daniel Chai, La Cai, Fang Shi

The most obvious point of this match was that the Eastern team's players were getting into better form. The running ability and control of each player showed progress. Although the opposing team was stronger than in the first match, the entire match was even more one-sided. In the second half, the ball rarely crossed midfield. Being able to control the ball in the opponent's half on a small field (about 85 yards long) was a point worth special mention.

However, the Eastern team's forwards had very bad luck with their shots, and the Hanoi team's goalkeeper was exceptionally brave, often diving and saving, even five or six yards out, regardless of anything else.

In the first half, Li Deqi opened the scoring. This goal was a free-kick taken one yard outside the penalty area, a strange shot that went in. It was indeed fast and tricky. After the match, when asked about it, Li himself didn't know how it was so miraculous. Then, Li left the field, and Qiaoxing joined in. The forward line was still very active. Then Xu Wenkui scored a goal with a backheel, earning applause from the entire stadium. This goal was a cross from Qiuting from the goal line. The ball went over the heads of the two inside-backs to Bingshi, who gently passed it, and Wenkui backheeled it in.

After the change of ends, the entire Eastern team attacked, with Luo Weiquan and Xu Jingcheng controlling the midfield, almost preventing the ball from crossing the halfway line. The three defenders stood side by side, all able to immediately kick away the Hanoi team's long passes.

Twenty minutes in, Luo Weiquan took a penalty. He kicked it well, but the goalkeeper guessed the angle. When Luo kicked it into the right corner, it was saved. Ten minutes later, Cao Qiuting curled a shot from the left wing into the left corner with his right foot. The goalkeeper couldn't dive in time, sealing the 3-0 victory.

Zhang Jinhai left five minutes before the end due to a hamstring injury. The Eastern team continued to dominate with ten men.

Because the Xinhua Hotel was a newly opened hotel and not fully equipped, the Eastern team moved to the Southwest Hotel. The owner, Mr. Cai, treated them warmly, and the players felt refreshed. They rested on the 9th. That evening, Mr. Li Zucai, a local compatriot, hosted a banquet, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves. They prepared for the final match against the Hanoi All-Stars First Team on the 10th.

The Hanoi First Team had defeated the South China team 4-2 and recently defeated the Haiphong team 5-1. It was said that their forward line was exceptionally strong, and their goalkeeper's skills were particularly solid. This was the Eastern team's touchstone on their expedition.

### The Eastern Football Team Adds Two More Strong Players; The Team's Southern Tour Will Return on Schedule

The Eastern Football Team's Southern Expedition has left Hanoi and will arrive in Hue (the old capital of Annam) today, where they will play a match. After the match, they will proceed to Saigon and are expected to arrive in Zhen on the 16th, where they are scheduled to play three matches. On the 22nd, they will take the Italian mail ship "Felice Rosso" back to Hong Kong, arriving around the 26th. Pu Shihui, the director of the Eastern Football Club's football department, received news of the Southern Expedition and, in addition to announcing the itinerary, also had further suggestions for the Southern Expedition. Mr. Shi believes that the Eastern team has a chance to compete for the runner-up position in the Hong Kong First Division League (if South China beats the Navy), and at the same time, they must comply with the Football Association's instructions and return to Hong Kong in time for the matches. Therefore, he has telegraphed ahead, instructing the team to return to Hong Kong at the original scheduled time. In addition, Zhong Yongsen, a talented footballer from Shanghai, has rushed from Yunnan to Hanoi to join the Eastern team, further strengthening their strength. Jiang Shanqing, a veteran from Shanghai, also known as "Living Zhang Fei," is good at playing as a defender and is exceptionally tough. He works for the Chinese Customs. When Jiangmen fell, he escaped to Macau. He came to Hong Kong the day before yesterday and returned last night. He will represent the Macau Interport team against the Hong Kong team on the 16th of this month. In the future, when the Eastern team has a chance to compete for the runner-up position, Mr. Jiang will help the Eastern team.

### Italian Fascist Forces Control Tennis; International Players Must Wear Uniforms

Handshakes Banned

[Reuters, London] According to news from Rome, the Italian Lawn Tennis Association has made new important decisions. From now on, Italian tennis players attending international competitions must wear uniforms. At the same time, they are prohibited from shaking hands with opponents after the game to avoid this long-standing custom of friendship on the tennis court. The association has also selected a number of official referees to serve as referees for domestic and international competitions. All of these referees are members of the Fascist Party.

Tennis Democratized

The Lawn Tennis Association is also cooperating with the Fascist Youth League to make tennis matches popular and democratized, eliminating the idea that tennis is an enjoyment for the aristocratic class. All 1,500 tennis courts in the country, including private and hotel courts, must be made available to the association. In order to train promising talents, a large number of coaches will be hired. Many people have applied to be trainers in this new plan. The entire organization and training plan has been assigned to Mr. Paimili to oversee everything. Mr. Pai is a famous player who once became a professional player and then regained his amateur status. Now he is a professional player again.

### Diary of the Eastern Football Team's Expedition

The Eastern Athletic Association's expedition football team sent in a diary entry yesterday, written by "Sang Yu." The original text is published below:

April 2nd, boarded the Qingyuan ship at 3 PM, 17 people, half from the north and half from the south, but harmonious and cheerful, just like a family. Set sail at 4 PM. Most of the companions had never sailed before, and they were nervous and afraid. Dinner at 5 PM, 17 people at two tables, all eating more than usual, happy with each other. Discussed the itinerary with Silva and others. Guangzhou arrived at noon, sailing at night. Beihai arrived in the morning, departing in the evening. Haiphong could be reached on the morning of the 6th. It was planned to have one game in Haiphong and two in Hanoi. If there was a trip to Saigon, we would take the French mail ship back on the 21st or 22nd. Everyone swore to beat the Navy and win the runner-up honor. Happy, we went to sleep.

April 3rd, 15 people had breakfast at the morning meal. Xu Wenkui and Zhang Jinhai were already suffering from seasickness, and their appetites were drastically reduced. At noon, we entered Guangzhou Bay. After lunch, we went ashore to meet old friend Wu Guolin and his wife and played bridge at their residence, followed by a dinner party. We returned to the ship at 10 PM, and the 17 people were very excited, discussing the battle formation and how to fight—avoiding being demanding after winning three goals. The most important point was to avoid injuries, as the most fearsome thing for an expedition team was for team members to get injured, making it impossible to continue.

April 4th: The ship sailed at 3 AM. From Guangzhou to Haikou, we encountered headwinds and swirling waves, and the ship was rocking violently. Only 11 people came to the table for breakfast, and they only ate a few bites before going back to bed. Those who vomited included Wenkui, Jinhai, Qiaoxing, Jingcheng, Bingshi, Deqi, and six others. No one got up all morning. Dinner was at one table, and then we went to bed early. Wenkui didn't eat a single grain all day, only one biscuit.

April 5th, when passing Haikou, the ship stopped for an hour, but no Japanese people boarded the ship to inspect it. We entered Beihai around 10 AM, and everyone recovered. We originally planned to go ashore to warm up a bit, but people on the ship said that the shore was heavily guarded. If more than a dozen people wearing uniforms went ashore, they would be shot. An aircraft circled for half an hour, so we were all more vigilant and decided not to go ashore. Alas, having been away from the country for more than a year, now there was an opportunity to set foot on our homeland again, but it didn't work out. The ball had been inflated, so we kicked it a few times on the deck with rubber shoes, enjoying it and training our muscles.

Only in the evening did we learn that the ship would not depart that night due to cargo reasons (not enough ships to unload the cargo), and the plan to arrive in Vietnam on the 6th was completely shattered.

April 6th—The ship was still moored in Beihai Harbor. We were on the deck, watching the sea and fishing, and even had several photos taken to commemorate it. At noon, we learned that the ship would definitely depart, and we happily played cards to pass the long day and quiet night. At this point, the expected match dates were the 8th, 9th, and 12th, 13th, as it was necessary to rest for a day after arriving on the 7th.

At 10 AM on April 7th, we arrived in Haiphong. Only Zeng Peifu came to pick us up. No representatives from the Hanoi Football Association arrived. Later, we learned that Guan Rongguang, a Cantonese compatriot representative, was taking care of things, but he was not a legal person, and checking in felt troublesome. We had a brief Chinese meal at the Haiphong Xinhua Hotel. We departed at 2 PM. After a two-hour drive, we arrived in Hanoi, and the local football association president insisted on playing immediately. Considering the spirit of sports and to avoid disappointing our compatriots, and with the excitement of the team members, we went straight to the football field, changed clothes, and took the field. The opponent was Junlian, with more courage than strategy. Our team won 4-1. The goalscorers for our side were (1) Cao Qiuting, (2) Zhang Jinhai, (3) Cao Qiuting, (4) Li Deqi. Hanoi Football Association Secretary Holly said that the Eastern team was faster than South China, and the goalkeeper's calm head was particularly admirable, and that with such a performance in the midst of travel fatigue, a complete victory over Hanoi could be predicted. I was secretly delighted.

April 8th, went to the field at 4 PM to play against the All-Stars Second Team. The nature of this team was equivalent to an interport team like Hong Kong vs. Macau. Our team won again 3-0. The goalscorers were (1) Li Deqi, (2) Xu Wenkui, (3) Cao Qiuting, and everyone's performance was better than the day before. Looking at the matches over the past two days, the Hanoi football team used a basketball tactic of "man-to-man" marking in defense, with wingers guarding wingers, inside backs guarding inside forwards, and the center back in the center back position. The attack lacked cooperative skills and was purely one-on-one, and they lacked goal-scoring ability. What was commendable was their courageous fighting spirit. The goalkeeper's skills were higher than his peers, and his footwork was not bad. If they had another three or four years, they would be impressive, as the players have talent but lack training.

In the evening, I met Deputy Consul Ding at a dinner and made an appointment to visit the consulate on Tuesday.

April 9th—Today is a rest day. Huaguo's stomach injury relapsed. The doctor searched for a solution everywhere, but the pharmacies were closed due to Sunday (according to the information, only one was open, on a weekly rotation, and it was impossible for me to find it when I first arrived here). I told him to rest first. In the afternoon, I got medicine for his injury and applied it to his wound. He slept well, hoping he would recover and take to the field tomorrow.

Saigon and Hue sent telegrams inviting us to play. I will reply by telegram. We should be able to agree on a match date in the next day or two. (1)

### New Widows' Street

— Zhuang Ruiyuan

I sit deeply in an old-fashioned chair, an antique piece of furniture from my father's time. The sky gradually darkens, and the louvered blinds, responding to the twilight, open, a bit of dim, somber wind entering my room.

Like a neurotic patient, I stare blankly at the twilight outside the window, spreading my fingers, yellowed by the fading sunlight. Yes, I haven't had a dream in a very, very long time; I haven't even fallen asleep in a very, very long time. In my childhood, I would fall asleep and have sweet dreams. In my dreams, amidst the dust swirling among the rosy clouds, fairy maidens with swallow-colored wings would travel together; or in a dense forest, a night train would inexplicably plunge into a deep valley. And on nights when golden stars flew chaotically across the sky, my tears would fall like countless meteorites onto my pillow... But in all these years, I haven't had a dream, haven't even fallen asleep. My childhood is too distant and long gone.

The old clock continues to whisper tick-tock, like an old friend I've just met. I'm delighted and drift away in thought.

That street...

In the past, we would imagine and long for the mysterious lands of Southern Europe, slender Carmens, wearing veils, slowly walking along Widows' Street, dragging their skirts, that street narrow and dim.

But we have entered a new dark age. We are being slaughtered, our homes burned, so we flee with our wives, scattering in all four directions. History records great battles, heroes in armor, holding long spears, galloping on warhorses, all world-renowned heroes, but they cannot forget their weak wives. That day, when flames engulfed our rooftops, we turned back during our escape and saw the arsonist's tears.

A bit of dim, somber wind enters my room. I drift off in thought again, that street...

Silent, the world seems to be without a sound. The center of the street appears vast in the dim twilight. The wooden houses along the street are arranged and piled up like silver toys. On the doorstep of one house, two women bow deeply, an annoying politeness. The sound of "Sayonara" floats forlornly in the vast street center.

Perhaps running upstairs, you'd see the room is empty, no one on the mat, no one by the tea table. People aren't gone, they've just shrunk, become eight inches tall, framed and hung on the wall; even smaller, become four inches, tucked in a pocket, placed in a book, and then they meet the face in the mirror, covered in too much powder, as if seeing the faint wrinkles of longing again. That terrible veil-like shadow!

Imagine she is the mother of two children, the wife of a soldier on the front lines, with a terrible, insidious mother-in-law at home. Then she must worry about the family's daily life, making do with small amounts of money, gradually becoming despicable and miserly.

That street...

A newly arrived, beautifully printed pictorial magazine is unfolded in my hands. A photo of a modern home decorated with sweet williams is printed in the top corner of the magazine. A servant girl kneels on the threshold, the tea set placed beside her on the floor. I arrange my thoughts in this top corner of the magazine.

This is a noblewoman's desolate boudoir. A red flower falls silently from her loosened temple onto the floor, crushed by someone's heel, the petals scattered. Seeing the pitiful, ravaged flower, she wants to shout, she wants to curse the servant girl who left. But in the end, she raises her hand to her forehead and collapses blankly onto the bed.

From the copper, newlywed bed, the copper springs emit a creaking sound. This sound becomes the only vibration in the silence, and her eyes blur, as if countless strips of youthful paper are being cut, cut, and she sees those scattered, messy paper strips, and her eyes blur.

She stands up, still wanting to see her spring-like room. In the room, all the new furniture always seems to be covered in a layer of dust. Although it is wiped twice a day, the resentful dust in the deep boudoir cannot be wiped away. How quickly the days pass, since her loved one left, a large number of days that ten fingers cannot count. In these long days, she still sleeps in that bed, but the wrinkles in the bed sheet are always so monotonous—the wrinkles in the smoothly spread bed sheet caused by two people rolling around in bed are now unimaginable.

### Erroneous Retreat

— Latte

At this critical and urgent juncture of the war, our nation is enduring numerous disasters amidst a whirlpool of extreme suffering. Naturally, our nation is also, through these many disasters, raising its steely head to discover the throne of rebirth. We, this group of fighters, this band resisting the war, should not be distressed by some pains and difficulties in our material lives. Yes, we need food, we need clothing, we need pocket money, but to demand perfect solutions for everything, to be able to satisfy all our desires, is almost like being overly demanding and extravagant, not the desires that we, who are fighting, should hold at this time.

Among the warriors participating in the resistance war, many have sacrificed everything and are treading the thorny path, seeking glorious solace by following trails of dripping blood. However, there are also some workers who overemphasize their private lives, unable to withstand the ravages of war, unable to bear the painful sting of a crude material life, and even more unable to tolerate the desolate and bleak scenes of ruined towns. Consequently, some have voluntarily retreated from the front lines of battle and returned to the cities to measure a mundane life. Although this phenomenon is not widespread, it cannot be said that it does not exist. And we need to overcome it. A few days ago, I met a young friend who had returned from the inland. I was surprised and asked him why he had returned so quickly. Had some problem arisen that made him unhappy?

He wore a bitter expression and said, "The situation in the inland is completely contrary to what I imagined. Everything is chaotic, scattered, and lacking. Sometimes, I can't even find a bowl of red bean porridge or a piece of dry biscuit to eat." When he said this, I couldn't help but laugh, so I said, "What does that matter? You're not a child, do you have to have red bean porridge and biscuits to taste? Such a retreat is too wrong."

He then tried to offer even bigger reasons, explaining why he had run back: "You don't know, it's not just a lack of material food, but also a lack of spiritual food. Books and newspapers about resistance and national salvation are generally not available for purchase. Most bookstores sell ancient books, and you can't see newspapers or magazines, which makes people feel depressed. I can't get used to this kind of life, I had to run back."

I said, "You should admit that this is your mistake. You have retreated from the battlefield simply because of the temporary difficulties of some problems that could be solved. This erroneous behavior lies in the fact that you only have the enthusiasm for national salvation, but not the determination for national salvation, and not a firm grasp of the overall situation. Why can't you unite everyone to start a 'transport spiritual food' movement? What reason is there not to solve problems that need to be solved?"

He finally said, "Looking at the situation, I still want to go again. Because now that I've come back, I feel very uncomfortable."

I said, "Don't look at the situation anymore. If there are any problems or difficulties, try to overcome them. Not trying to overcome them and only knowing how to retreat will harm the resistance war. This erroneous retreat will hinder the development of work in the inland.

He seemed to be savoring my words, needing to express something, but I knew that this enthusiastic worker, struggling in the exchange of contradictions, still needed to deeply overcome his weak and uncertain state of mind. I only tell enthusiastic workers to pay close attention to young friends like him at all times, so that they can be revived.

### From Music to Cantonese Opera

Music holds the highest peak of art. Even a few simple notes can control people's emotions of sorrow and joy. Some people say: Chinese composition uses emotion, Western composition uses art. Is this true or false? I dare not be dogmatic, but in fact, Chinese and Western music are certainly different.

A bugle call will invigorate your spirit, a lullaby will make you drowsy, the intoxication of jazz, the grief of eighteen beats, the Lotus Fall makes me think of the pity of beggars, the church bells will make you feel the solemn sanctity of religion. Furthermore, the spring breeze, autumn insects, cuckoos, and nightingales, their voices can all capture people's emotions. These are all the effects of "sound," and sound has "timbre."

Because sound can move people's emotions and thoughts, there are "cheerleading squads" at ball games to cheer on the teams, and armies have bugle calls and war drums when marching.

A "Drizzle" has intoxicated many people? A "March" has encouraged many people? Who doesn't praise the French Marseillaise as great, able to control the ambition of countless soldiers, bravely active on the front lines.

"National Defense Music," these four words have been proposed for a long time. Many famous songs have been produced after the Anti-Japanese War. However, why hasn't Cantonese opera produced great compositions yet? Is it always "... Ya ya! ... Month month flower flower ... I love you!"? Are the composers of Cantonese opera still sound asleep in the flower and moon thicket?

It's not that there isn't Cantonese opera with new content relevant to the Anti-Japanese War, a few have appeared; but it is still "Xipi," "Erhuang," "Gunhua," medium, slow, boards, and other old tunes, which don't sound majestic or passionate at all, still melodious sounds.

The reason is purely that the composers haven't put in hard work on phonology, otherwise they could create new tunes and compose majestic new sounds, so that Cantonese opera can also have a beneficial effect on the Anti-Japanese War.

Come on! Cantonese opera composers, come on! Work hard and compose majestic songs! The beacon fire is being raised on the peaks of East and West Qiao. Let the songs of the South drive out the enemy like a wild wind sweeping away yellow leaves.

Music is enough to capture people's emotions. Let our songs be like the surging of waves, in the grasslands of southern China.

Anti-Japanese music is a tactic to boost morale!

### Night Watch

— Wu Jun

On the shore,

all human habitation has ceased.

(They all carry heavy packages,

to escape to distant villages;

some have already died with crippled limbs!)

The magnificent streets

have become desolate ruins;

on the ruins, there still gently burns

a crimson flame.

(Like wild ghosts with red hair,

grinning with their long tongues out.)

Let the reeking wind carrying the smell of gunpowder,

touch the uncollapsed corners of walls, and wander!

A chilling ghost atmosphere,

covers this ruined city!

On that side,

is the black, vast shadow of the embankment.

No lights,

no boatmen,

and you can't hear the distant barking of dogs

Only, in the blue sky, twinkling

cold star eyes.

Loneliness raises its black wings of terror,

and slowly flies over this river.

Comrades are all sound asleep.

(In their tired dreams,

they seek the warmth of home,

but their home is destroyed in the flames of war!)

Let the heavy dew,

moisten their thin blankets.

The autumn river wind,

(like the cold hand of a grandmother)

gently strokes their messy hair.

I tightly grip a short gun,

sitting guard on this cold bow.

Surrounded only by this

lonely boat,)

gazing at the vast and black river water.

(The soft sound of water lapping at the side of the boat,

and the occasional leaping of fish,)

That tragic red light on the shore,

dyes a corner of the horizon.

We are a group of passionate warriors,

but today we are struggling in exile,

exiled to this riverside in the dark night!

No city sounds, no traces of people,

only the reeking red light,

reflects this jet-black water shadow!

Will a burst of stray bullets fly over?

Or, will a group of treacherous

wolves

devour us?

The hardships of the journey float up,

...sorrow, grief, and terror

...netting my heart,

shaking every upright hair tip!

The night is getting darker and blacker.

The river wind is even more biting,

blowing against the single clothing of the traveler,

the empty cold air is like the iron claws of a ghost's hand

climbing and grabbing at my joints.

Tightly biting my trembling purple lips,

scooping up my drooping, tired eyes,

holding the gun head even tighter,

I am a night watchman,

I want to guard this group of distressed comrades!

Watching until dawn!

× month

The night by the riverside in the flames of war,

as if water ghosts are singing a mournful song.

That is a short song of the suffering,

floating up dreams of home and parents,

tears dripping onto the vast black river...

Written on March 20th

Recollection in Heyuan

Note: After the fall of Guangzhou, we made a short expedition of two thousand eight hundred miles from the West River to the North River, to the East River, along the way eating wind and dew; mountains, streams everywhere became our campsites. This poem is written about the scene of us mooring on the riverbank of Qingyuan City at night, and I am keeping watch on that lonely boat.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

"That..."

This was the decision she revealed: to obtain redemption money with her corpse—he told her frankly. Finally, he said:

"Please forgive me!"

"If I can forgive you, can you forgive yourself?"

"If I can't forgive myself..."

"What will you do?"

"I... I will commit suicide... Paying for death with death is acceptable, right?"

When he was moved by emotion, his words were so stubborn. Within the stubbornness, there was a seductive magic that compelled submission. This magic, if accepted, could sway tyrants in the past, and conquer traitors today; let alone that she belonged to neither, but was merely an innocent person? So when she came into contact with this magic, she cried. These tears were not those of the weak. Even the strong have a moment of weeping—due to the emotion of joy and sorrow, especially when drunk or mentally disturbed—these tears are instinctive and involuntary. She cried like this, crying and asking:

"Why am I dying at your hands?"

"Please forgive me;" he repeated: Please... forgive... forgive..." He paused to take a breath, then said: "...me!" (36)
