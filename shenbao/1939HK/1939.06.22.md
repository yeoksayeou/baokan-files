### The Japanese Aggressors' New Offensive

Following the Tianjin incident, which evolved from a local issue into a general one, and the increasingly intense anti-British movement across occupied territories, the Japanese, again, launched a large-scale landing at Shantou yesterday at dawn. Simultaneously, the Japanese navy dispatched troops to invade Dayu Island, a small island near Langyu Island, engaging in mutual fire with the Chinese garrison on the opposite shore. This indeed demonstrates a new military offensive recently undertaken by the Japanese aggressors.

Having realized that military aggression alone cannot achieve the goal of conquering China due to the prolonged military stalemate, some of the more experienced individuals are eager to end the Sino-Japanese war. Consequently, two factions have emerged within Japan. The elder statesmen faction hopes to conclude the war in the autumn, aiming to utilize political and economic tactics in addition to military means. The younger officers faction, helpless in the face of military stagnation, on one hand, allows the elder statesmen faction to use Wang Jingwei; on the other hand, it launches incidents from other angles to threaten third countries. As a result, these actions may serve to hasten the end of the war. There might be a temporary alignment in Japan's pragmatic diplomacy from now on, but the contradictions will grow increasingly due to the impossibility of this illusion.

In the Tianjin incident, what the Japanese side demanded was that Britain fundamentally change its Far East policy, helping Japan establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia," effectively abandoning its support for China and instead oppressing China, so that Japan can force us into a "treaty of surrender" in the near future. The intensification of anti-British sentiment in various occupied areas is further fueling this threat. The Japanese army's landing in Shantou has an even more complex purpose, but it is still nothing more than a further step in this new offensive. First, it aims to more strictly blockade an important Chinese seaport, making communication between the mainland and overseas more difficult and increasing panic among the people who are resisting the war. Second, it further disrupts a residential area for British expatriates, giving the British people one more reason to desire peace. Third, it extends the disturbance to third countries such as the United States and France, creating another obstacle, or even a complete cut-off, in the routes between these countries and China. The Japanese army might even carry out further disturbances, bombings, and occupations at other coastal strongholds, such as in various parts of Fujian, to intensify the new posture of military aggression.

However, the new Japanese military offensive has a smaller impact on China and a greater impact on Britain, the United States, and France. Our supreme military authorities anticipated a strict blockade of the entire coast long before the war began. We are prepared to retreat into the interior to wage a protracted war with the Japanese. The Japanese cannot force us to surrender simply by blockading the coast, and they themselves understand this. The main reason remains to disturb the vision and hearing of third countries, to trouble the people of third countries, and especially to further surround Hong Kong, so that third country governments, especially Britain, feel the need to step forward to mediate. However, Japan is still testing, seeing what Britain's attitude is and what conditions it might offer to mediate. Regarding this kind of testing, what is important is that the attitude of Britain, France, and the United States in supporting China can continue to be maintained. On one hand, ignore Japan's instigation and temptation; on the other hand, actively prepare for military confrontation, such as the military cooperation between Britain and France in the Far East, which is very important. This cooperation should be expanded to invite the United States, Siam, and the Netherlands, and other related countries to participate. If Britain can deal with it firmly, the Japanese paper tiger will not be difficult to expose further.

### Political Education Work of a Model Division

— Xiang Rong

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) In the 23 months of the War of Resistance, although we have accumulated a lot of experience that can be described regarding political work in the army, I would like to briefly describe the political education work carried out by the ××× Division, which has the reputation of being a model division, to explain the educational policy it adopted, the core content of the education, the principles of implementation, and the system of political education, etc., which may provide some reference for various resistance units.

I. The General Policy of Political Education

What is the policy of political education in the army? This is very clear. The common goal of the entire nation's struggle is to resist the war, strive for the final victory of the resistance, and complete the nation-building under the Three Principles of the People. The policy of political education in the army is, of course, also for the sake of resistance, to improve the combat effectiveness of the troops, to strive for greater victories in combat, and to achieve the goal of "inevitable victory in resistance and inevitable success in nation-building."

"This war of resistance cannot be completed in a year or two. It must go through extreme hardship and difficulty before the final victory can be obtained (Chiang Kai-shek, Public Announcement in 1937). Therefore, the most basic issue facing the national army resisting the war is how to improve the national consciousness, national unity, and national confidence of every soldier, to encourage their courage and determination to kill the enemy; to cultivate their spirit of sacrifice and the consciousness of hard struggle; to strengthen their spirit of not being arrogant in victory, not being discouraged in failure, and being indomitable in the face of all dangers; to firmly establish their belief that "inevitable victory in resistance and inevitable success in nation-building"; and to allow them to shed the last drop of blood for the cause of national independence, freedom, and liberation under the Supreme Commander's policy of adhering to a protracted war of resistance.

Political education in the army is to arm the minds of every anti-Japanese warrior with the basic policy mentioned above so that every warrior can become a conscious national hero.

II. The Central Content of Political Education

According to the current general policy of political education, and also taking into account the need to cultivate soldiers into cadres and lower-level cadres into middle and upper-level cadres, we are conducting the central content of political education in the army according to the following points:

First, our entire Chinese nation is now unanimously engaged in a sacred war of national self-defense. Therefore, we must conduct education on national liberation.

Indeed, the demon king ×××× Hitler is also vigorously advocating the nationalism of the Greater Germanic nation, but our nationalism is different from Hitler's nationalism. "There is the patriotism of the Japanese invaders and Hitler, and there is our patriotism." Fascism is national aggression; our nationalism seeks the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Chinese nation.

What content should be included in the education on national liberation?

1.  National consciousness: We start by explaining what kind of country China is, what kind of country Japan is, the reasons and processes for Japan's historical aggression against China, and the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan's attempt to destroy our country with a large-scale invasion of China, in order to improve the national consciousness and national hatred of every soldier (of course, only hate the Japanese fascist warlords, not the Japanese working masses), to strengthen every soldier's courage to kill the enemy and determination to fight.

2.  National unity: Based on Chiang Kai-shek's message to the nation, "External enemies are not to be feared; only internal unity is needed," we explain the principle that the entire nation, regardless of class, party, old feuds, or personal grievances, should unite to resist Japan, the relationship between the military and the people, the relationship between friendly forces, and the relationship between the Chinese people and the Japanese working masses; we explain the relationship between the Three Principles of the People and various ideologies, the basic national policy of the Outline for Resistance and Nation-Building; and at the same time, we explain that we must strictly guard against the Japanese and their running dogs, traitors, and other factions' conspiracies to split and undermine the unity of our entire nation.

3.  National confidence: From the comparison of national strength between China and Japan and the nature of the Sino-Japanese War, we explain that the final victory of the resistance must belong to us; we explain the protracted nature of the Sino-Japanese War and the three stages of the protracted war; we explain the strategic policy that our country should adopt; we explain that we will have great difficulties in the long war process, that we must go through a very painful period, that we must endure this difficulty, overcome this difficulty, and only then can we strive for the final victory; and we explain that "once the war has started, there is only the principle of risking the lives of the entire nation and sacrificing to the end, and there is no reason to stop or compromise halfway" (Chiang Kai-shek's Lushan Talk), resolutely opposing all attempts and actions of surrender and compromise.

Second, we are an army, an army that shoulders the important responsibility of resisting Japan and saving the country today. Therefore, we must conduct education related to army life.

What are the issues related to army life?

1.  Why join the army, and why fight? Based on the principles of "every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country," "being a soldier is the sacred duty of every citizen," "joining the anti-Japanese army, fighting Japan to save China, is our most glorious cause," and "we cannot survive without fighting Japan," we explain why we join the army. We also explain, based on what Chiang Kai-shek said in his message to the nation: "This war of resistance is a necessary process in the National Revolution and is a war for the independence and survival of the invaded nation against the invaders," that our war of resistance is for survival, that only resistance can avoid the tragedy of national subjugation, and that we expose the traitorous theory that "resistance will surely lead to national destruction" and "another war will surely lead to national destruction."

2.  Why should we abide by discipline and obey orders? We explain that striving for victory in war depends on consistency between superiors and subordinates, consistency of the whole, coordinated action, and that abiding by discipline and obeying orders is obeying the command of unified action. At the same time, we explain that discipline is for the benefit of resistance and for the benefit of the entire nation, so we must consciously abide by discipline.

3.  Why should we be brave in combat and endure hardship? Being brave in killing the enemy on the battlefield and enduring hardship in life are qualities that every anti-Japanese soldier should possess. Without these qualities, we cannot fight a cruel war with the fierce enemy, let alone eliminate the enemy and defeat the enemy.

4.  Why should we diligently study military affairs, politics, and culture? Improving military technology is to strive for greater victories with the least sacrifice; improving political standards is to arm our minds and strengthen our belief in struggle; improving cultural standards is to open our eyes to see the world, and at the same time, improving cultural standards also helps the study of military affairs and politics. All of this should also point to a goal, which is to cultivate oneself into a cadre or a more responsible cadre.

5.  Why should we unite and love each other? The thousands of people in the army, although some come from the South and some come from the North, some have a long history of struggle, and some have recently joined the army, each has a different face; but for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country, everyone has one heart. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the unity and love between comrades, not to beat or scold each other, not to quarrel, to share weal and woe, to support each other in times of illness, and to advise each other in times of mistakes.

6.  Why should we become one with the residents? The army is the armed force of the people and serves the people. At the same time, to defeat the enemy, it is necessary for the military and the people to unite closely and mobilize the people to fight together. Therefore, the army must be close to the people, help the people, and not disturb or harm the people.

7.  Why should we win over the enemy army and treat the enemy prisoners of war kindly? Because the soldiers of the Japanese army, as well as most of the officers and soldiers in the puppet army, were forced to invade China; their interests are necessarily opposed to those of the Japanese warlords. Therefore, we must win over the lower-ranking officers and soldiers in the puppet army, make them realize their position of overthrowing the Japanese warlords, and cooperate with the Chinese people hand in hand. In addition to general political propaganda, treating puppet prisoners of war kindly is a good way to win over the puppet army.

Third, our resistance is not only to drive the Japanese out of China but also for the bright future of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we must provide theoretical education on the Three Principles of the People and education on advanced scientific thought.

What are some specific contents? In addition to what has already been said above, we also have education on the Three Principles of the People, education on the history of China's modern revolutionary movement, and education on common sense of social science, education on political economy and new philosophy, and so on.

Fourth, because the cultural level in the army is relatively low, and because cultural knowledge is closely related to military and political education, we need to conduct cultural education.

In the past, there have been incomplete understandings that cultural education is only literacy education, and there have also been improper views that cultural education is linked to entertainment work, called cultural and entertainment work, so cultural education is also regarded as something similar to entertainment work, and the importance of cultural education is underestimated, treating it as a kind of auxiliary education. We have given these views corrections.

What content does cultural education include? We believe that literacy education naturally occupies a major position in cultural education, but it cannot include all of cultural education. In addition, there is education on natural science, education on geography and history, education on arithmetic, and so on.

Fifth, the above basic education cannot include some temporary current affairs issues. Therefore, we need education on current affairs.

What are some temporary current affairs issues? Such as:

1.  Political mobilization for major battles;

2.  Analysis of the war situation in various parts of the country;

3.  The significance of commemorative days;

4.  And the correction of certain bad tendencies that occur temporarily in the army, etc.

The explanation and education of these issues are promoted based on the general education policy. However, it is not included, nor can it be included, in the teaching materials of basic education, so it is listed within the education of current affairs issues.

III. Requirements for Implementing Political Education

With a general policy of political education and a core content of political education, the next question is the requirements for implementing political education, which is also the question of the principles for implementing political education. Our principles are the following four.

First, Less but Finer

What is meant by less? Does it mean that we only simply require understanding one or a few basic questions? No. We require that the questions we need to understand are quite numerous, including military, political, cultural, and basic theories. (To be continued)

### Battle of Shantou Unfolds. Enemy Ships Break Through Blockade and Land by Force. Street Fighting Ensues Yesterday Afternoon, Our Forces Counterattack.

[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Shantou, 21st, 10:30 AM] Ten enemy planes raided Shantou City suddenly at 5:00 AM on the 21st. At 5:30 AM, more than 30 enemy warships and dozens of speedboats gathered outside Mayu port and invaded Shantou City. A cannon battle immediately broke out with our coastal defense forces. Under the cover of artillery fire, enemy speedboats broke through the blockade line at 10:09 AM. Simultaneously, hundreds of enemy soldiers forcibly landed on the east coast of Dahao Island, west of Mayu port. Our defending forces bravely resisted and are still in fierce battle.

[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Chao'an, 21st, 12:00 PM] After breaking through the Mayu port blockade line at around 10:00 AM on the 21st, enemy warships and speedboats continued to invade Shantou City. Our defending forces calmly responded, waiting for the enemy speedboats to approach before launching a sudden barrage, sinking more than ten enemy speedboats. Under the cover of warship artillery fire and aircraft, the enemy still forcibly landed, and street fighting ensued at 12:00 PM. As of the time of this dispatch, our forces are still engaged in fierce battle.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese military personnel here believe that the occupation of Shantou is quite important because, since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has replaced Hong Kong as the port for China to import military supplies and export local products. Shantou's foreign trade is quite prosperous, second only to Shanghai and Tianjin. Recently, all military supplies transported to the Chinese mainland have been transshipped from Hong Kong to Shantou and Hanoi.

[Reuters, Shantou, 21st] There are currently seven Japanese destroyers in Shantou port. Mayu was occupied at 7:00 AM this morning. Multiple Japanese planes bombed the city and strafed with machine guns. Shantou is still in the hands of Chinese forces. All foreigners are safe.

[External News from This Port] The Japanese army launched a large-scale landing in Shantou at dawn this morning. The landing was confirmed by the Japanese military. The military claimed that it was jointly conducted by naval and land forces, and fierce fighting is currently underway. Although the "Danat" is the only British warship stationed in Shantou, the British side has not yet decided whether it is necessary to send an additional warship to Shantou. According to the latest news, the Japanese army landed in two locations a few miles outside Shantou and is advancing inland. According to Japanese sources at 11:00 AM this morning, they admit to encountering strong resistance from the Chinese side, with heavy casualties on both sides. In addition to the British warship "Danat" near Shantou, there is also an American destroyer. Most of the foreigners in Shantou are British, with about 40 to 50 Americans.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] According to a naval communiqué issued by the Imperial Headquarters, multiple Japanese warships sailed within two miles of Shantou at 1:50 AM this morning and are now clearing the sea of obstacles and advancing forward. According to Hong Kong telegraphs, about 300 to 500 Japanese troops first attempted to land near Shantou. Despite strong resistance from the Chinese army, they were ultimately successful. The vanguard forces are advancing inland, apparently with the aim of encircling Shantou and cutting off the Chaoshan Railway (Chaozhou is 27 miles from Shantou). The communiqué also stated that transport ships also participated in assisting the navy in landing. A spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy stated that the Japanese navy's landing in Shantou is sufficient to strengthen the blockade of the Chinese coast, from which General Chiang Kai-shek is still obtaining foreign military supplies. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Japan's policy of respecting the rights and interests of third countries remains unchanged.

The Japanese Army's Landing Process

[Express News from This Port, Shantou] The day before yesterday at noon, seven Japanese planes flew to Chaoshan to bomb, but the local people had already been evacuated, so the losses were light. The general public had long known that this was a precursor to a Japanese invasion. That evening, more than sixty Japanese cruisers, destroyers, and speedboats patrolled the sea off Nan'ao, and the situation was tense. Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, Mayor Luo Xianxiang, Administrative Commissioner He Chunfan, Brigade Commander Wu Luxin, County Magistrates Chen Youyun, Bian Zhishan, Cai Fenchu, and others held a meeting and immediately issued an emergency martial law order and decided on strategies for defending the territory. Yesterday at dawn, when the sky was still dim and rain threatened to fall, Japanese fleet commander Shiozawa directed more than a thousand naval marines to board more than twenty speedboats and attack the North and South ports (22 li from Shantou City) in Cheng District. When they approached the coast, they were discovered by our defending forces, and a fierce battle broke out. We were in an advantageous position, so we threatened the enemy, causing more than a hundred casualties and then retreating in defeat. Before six o'clock, Japanese warships had fiercely bombarded our North and South ports, as well as Beigang outside Mentou Township. For a time, there were continuous loud noises, and the sound shook the heavens and the earth. Soon, 5,000 Japanese troops landed in separate locations. Our army, because the coastal defenses were completely destroyed, then rose up to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Local military and political officials all arrived at the front line to command, so morale was a hundredfold. In this battle, casualties were very heavy on both sides. After a fierce battle, our army retreated to a new position and bravely held on. When the Japanese army landed in the North and South ports, a portion of the Japanese marines landed at Dahao, across from Shantou City, and have now advanced towards ××× Stone. This place is the residential area of British, American, and French people residing in Shantou. As of about 2:00 PM, the Japanese army at the North and South ports could only advance four Chinese miles due to our army's strong resistance, threatening the east side of Shantou City, with the aim of encircling the north side of Shantou and launching a pincer attack with the Japanese at Dahao. The Shantou City police and anti-Japanese self-defense forces have all been ordered to gather in preparation for battle. The Japanese landing in Beigang has not made much progress. It is estimated that they intend to directly approach Chao'an and cut off our main highway line in eastern Guangdong. At 1:00 PM, multiple Japanese speedboats sailed into the Tuo River, so the situation in Shantou City has completely entered a state of war. A small portion of merchants and residents were ordered to evacuate yesterday morning. Shops were closed, and the city was silent. Foreign merchants were also advised by our authorities not to risk entering the city. All preparations for street fighting have been completed. If necessary, a scorched earth policy will be implemented.

### Strict Alert in the British Concession of Tianjin. Volunteer Business Corps Mobilized. Increased Street Posts.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 21st] The British Concession's Public Works Bureau here is currently organizing an emergency corps, entirely composed of British citizens, unarmed, and wearing distinctive military uniforms. These personnel will specialize in handling various important tasks. The chairman of the Public Works Bureau told Reuters that although 700 Chinese police officers received warnings from the Japanese authorities, only one resigned. According to an unofficial Japanese report, vegetable vendors have now decided to boycott the British Concession. The market situation in the blocked area is already very bleak. The British authorities are now doing everything possible to promote commerce.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 20th] The Tianjin British Concession Volunteer Business Corps has been ordered to prepare to be mobilized at any time. Two British warships docked here, the "Sandwich I" arrived yesterday afternoon, while the "Rostov" was scheduled to leave Tianjin today, but this trip has now been cancelled. A British military truck, under the protection of British soldiers, carried a large batch of vegetables to the British Concession yesterday. This is the first move by the British side to break through the blockade restrictions and transport food. The Japanese soldiers guarding the blockade line witnessed the truck passing through without inspection. As for the rumor that seven trucks passed through the blockade line on Sunday, it is inaccurate. The Japanese are still constantly inciting anti-British sentiment. Chinese hotels have been forced to issue notices advising the British Concession to yield, offering half-price rent to those who leave the British Concession to reside in the hotels. The food shortage problem in the concession is still very serious. The Japanese side has completely prohibited milk from being sent into the concession, and coal is also in short supply. Last night, the blockade restrictions were slightly relaxed, perhaps because tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival. However, British people have not shown any optimism.

[Haitong News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] The British Concession authorities refused to sell a portion of the three million bags of flour that they intended to transport to the Chinese mainland. Furthermore, "Chinese merchants" outside the concession severed commercial relations with the concession yesterday, implementing a cessation of trade with merchants within the concession. Currently, the volunteer army in the British Concession is fully mobilized, with a total of about 1,000 armed personnel. Armored vehicles guard important streets, and sentries are stationed. According to a spokesman for the Japanese military authorities here yesterday, the Japanese army's blockade of the Tianjin Concession is to directly deal with the British who are "disrupting order in North China and hindering economic development." If Britain implements economic retaliation, Japan will no longer respect British rights and interests in China.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] According to external news from Beiping, the anti-British movement in North China has spread even wider as a result of incitement by the Japanese side and the puppet government of North China controlled by the Japanese side. It is said that an anti-British mass sports meeting is scheduled to be held here on the 23rd, and "Japanese reserve soldiers" will also participate. Newspapers have been continuously attacking the British side on a large scale in recent days. Whether they are major or minor, all matters involving the British are under attack.

### The Northern Front Situation Tense: A Major Battle at Zhongtiao Mountain About to Re-Erupt; We Intensify the Struggle for [Area illegible in original]

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 20th] The Jin [region illegible in original] has increased by approximately 10,000 troops, and we are also fully prepared.

We have recovered many counties, villages, and towns in southern Hebei, and the overall situation is stable. It is heard that the [enemy illegible in original] is paying special attention to North China, and troops are being transferred northward from South China from time to time.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xi'an, 20th] Military news: A certain unit of ours in southern Hebei pursued the [enemy illegible in original] forces retreating towards Renxian, making rapid progress. The main forces of two [enemy illegible in original] regiments, including the Morimoto regiment, have lost more than half of their strength. The remaining approximately 2,000 men are still retreating northward.

[Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 21st] During a press gathering yesterday, a certain military authority spokesperson declared that the Japanese army's position on the Guangdong front is gradually becoming unstable. After reorganization, Chinese guerrillas have been very active, repeatedly repelling landing Japanese troops and annihilating small units. Furthermore, in the Hubei area, the Japanese army's four-division attempted invasion of Changsha was thwarted, as their plans were disrupted due to the continuous interception by Chinese army guerrillas, depleting their strength. In addition, the area east of the Xinchuhai River estuary on the southern bank of the Yellow River has been flooded, forcing the Japanese army to rush to build military roads in an attempt to maintain communication lines, but these efforts are frequently attacked by guerrillas, ultimately leading to the failure of the Japanese plan.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 21st] Several hundred [enemy illegible in original] soldiers in the Shanyidian area of northern Henan have been completely eliminated after days of mopping-up operations by our troops. On the 14th, our troops fiercely attacked Neihuang, clashing again and entering the city. The [enemy illegible in original] morale collapsed, and they fled northward in a panic. Neihuang was immediately recovered.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Place in Southern Shandong, 21st] Since the beginning of this month, the [enemy illegible in original] in Shandong Province have gathered 20-30,000 [enemy illegible in original] troops to launch a fierce attack on southern Shandong. Our army has adopted mobile warfare tactics, annihilating countless [enemy illegible in original]. Currently, the [enemy illegible in original] offensive has been thwarted, and we are launching a fierce counterattack. Laiyang City in Jiaodong has been retaken by our troops, with over 300 [enemy illegible in original] soldiers killed and over 100 guns captured.

### The National Government Officially Orders the Arrest of Wang [Jingwei]; Overseas Chinese Unanimously Applaud

They immediately began to extinguish the fire, which was put out in about half an hour. Over a hundred bales of cotton were destroyed, with losses of approximately 5,000 [unit illegible]. It was previously rumored that someone was secretly active at the wharf, so this strange fire is considered suspicious. The wharf authorities have decided to thoroughly investigate.

### Special Correspondence from Our Newspaper: Luofu Journal (8)

— [Pseudonym - Liuying]

At eight o'clock in the morning, the sound of artillery erupted from Duling'ao, followed by the sound of machine guns like a string of firecrackers from our side. Battalion Commander Liang personally came to Su Lao Guan and said to us, "The [enemy illegible in original] have fallen into our trap. We have discovered a total of over 2,000 [enemy illegible in original] infantry and artillery troops on the front lines. What about us? To be honest, there is only one company of our men here, but we can resist until twelve o'clock. Please go towards Henghe." We folded our clothes and left Su Lao Guan. The peaceful atmosphere of the Taoist temple was shattered by the sound of artillery, and they also became nervous. Along the way, there were processions of civilians, with three or five people carrying their belongings, followed by a rifle, each concerned with their own escape. This is highly inappropriate. If these armed people were organized, I believe the [enemy illegible in original] would not dare to come here.

We advanced along the mountain road. The sound of artillery drew nearer. Several shells flew over our heads and exploded in the fields not far away. The clattering of machine guns roared at the enemy.

A sudden rainstorm shielded our departure from the front line. At twelve noon, we arrived at Henghe. Looking back at the northern side of Mount Luofu, black smoke billowed up, and the invaders' fire was spreading again. The next day, we received news that over eighty houses in Su Lao Village had been burned. Our troops and civilians suffered no losses.

The One Who Tied the Bell Must Untie It

Having received this lesson from the [enemy illegible in original] and having seen many things in many places, I feel that our strength for resistance has not yet been fully developed, and the coordination between the military and the people is not sufficient to strike the [enemy illegible in original] effectively—painful things are also unavoidable. To avoid "friction" in writing, I can only swallow it down into my stomach. However, one thing that moves and excites me the most is "the greatness of the people's power." From Changning to Futian, from Huzhen back to Boluo City, the highways along the way have been destroyed quite successfully, with some becoming potholes, some turning into paddy fields, and some having dozens or hundreds of people working on them. They do not resent themselves but actively wield their hoes. In addition to carrying hoes, shovels, and other weapons, they also carry rain gear and cooking pots, making temporary kitchens in the shade of trees. Their stoves are dug temporarily in the ground. The rain wets the stove fires for cooking, but they continue to rekindle them and make the dishes hot. Their spirit of perseverance should be admired by everyone.

"You've worked hard, brothers!" Comrade Chen comforted them.

"No, sir, this is what we should do. We will not allow the [enemy illegible in original] to come again, so that the [enemy illegible in original] have no road to walk. Digging up the road is a good thing," a peasant brother replied, stopping his hoe. "Please ask the Allied Forces to block the devils, and we will destroy the highways in the rear, to see how the [enemy illegible in original] will step into our Boluo?"

What a moving voice! They used to build the uneven ground into long, flat highways, helping the country's construction. Now, they have to destroy them, and they will still be responsible for building them in the future. How great is their power!

### The Rapidly Advancing Mining and Metallurgical Industries in the Southwest; The Government Revises Regulations to Encourage Foreign Investment; The Resources Commission Mobilizes All Parties to Vigorously Promote Development

Among China's mineral resources, in addition to coal and iron, antimony, tin, tungsten, and lead are also important. Unfortunately, the main mining areas for coal and iron are all in occupied territories. Only the production areas for antimony, tin, tungsten, and copper are located in the southwest, hence the name "special metals of the South." Since the start of the war of resistance, people from all walks of life have realized that developing the southwest is an important task for national construction during the war of resistance. Therefore, no effort has been spared in the construction of the mining and metallurgical industries. The following is a brief overview of the current state of development:

Revision of Mining Laws and Regulations

In order to develop the mining industry in the southwest, the government first revised the mining laws and regulations, allowing foreign investment, and formulated regulations for the management of state-owned mining areas, and established mining and metallurgical research institutes. (A) The mining and metallurgical research institute has the following groups: (1) Procurement group: researching mining engineering technology, and investigating mineral products and mines; (2) Mineral processing group: researching mineral processing and coal washing technology; (3) Smelting group: researching the smelting technology of copper, iron, or metal non-metals; development and utilization of fuel; and investigation of smelting plants; (4) Testing group: testing and researching various mineral and metallurgical products and their accessories. Each group has a director in charge. (B) The management methods of state-owned mining areas are divided into the following categories: (1) directly managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (2) entrusted to other central government agencies; (3) lease of state-owned mining areas, which can be jointly operated with the provincial government; however, the capital occupied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs or other central government agencies shall not be less than 50%. If foreigners are allowed to invest according to the Mining Law, the capital occupied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs or other central government agencies shall not be less than 34%; (4) Mining tax payment methods: If there are normal reasons for not starting construction within two years, the tax may be exempted. (C) Allowing foreign investment: The Mining Law stipulates that foreigners are allowed to invest in and jointly form limited liability companies to operate mining, but it shall be approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and subject to the following restrictions: (1) Over half of the total shares of the company shall be owned by Chinese citizens; (2) Over half of the company's directors shall be Chinese citizens; (3) The chairman of the board and general manager of the company shall be Chinese citizens, but the mining rights shall not be transferred to foreigners. If construction does not start within two years after registration, or if construction is suspended for more than one year, the mining rights shall be revoked immediately.

Current Status of Mining and Smelting

Since the promulgation of the Mining Law, the Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial governments have actively carried out the work. The current status of mining and smelting of various minerals is recorded as follows: (A) Tungsten ore sand can be used for steelmaking and for making steel wires in light bulbs, and it is also a necessary product for military equipment manufacturing. The world's output is very small, but China is uniquely blessed. Since the National Government implemented centralized management and control, the total export volume has gradually increased. The places where tungsten is produced are Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces, especially Jiangxi, which is the most abundant, often accounting for more than 95% of the country's total output and 36% of the world's [illegible] output. At present, tungsten industry management offices have been established in various tungsten producing provinces. The market price is announced by the management office, the export is unified, and smuggling is strictly prohibited. Before the war, each [Dan unit] was about 50 national currency units, and after the war, the tungsten industry abroad rose sharply, and the purchase price rose to 100 yuan. The purchase price of foreign firms in Hong Kong was more than 200 yuan. The export value of tungsten sand was only 6,315,349 yuan in the Republic of China years 21-23, and in the 26th year [of the Republic] it rose to 40,758,592 yuan; in the first eight months of the 27th year, it also reached 38,518,808 yuan. Germany ranked first in the countries to which it was exported, the United States ranked second, and the United Kingdom ranked third. After the war, the National Government gave the right to export tungsten products to the Fu Company. Recently, the Resources Commission decided to adopt the principle of self-mining, self-selling, and self-use, and established technical groups in the management offices of various producing areas to seek rationalization and economization of production, and planned to set up tungsten processing plants. (B) Iron is the main raw material for industry. Although China is rich in iron production, due to the lack of high-temperature smelting furnaces, the production of wrought iron has not been able to supply it universally. Before the fall of Hankou, most of the pig iron needed in various places was supplied by the Liuhegou Pig Iron Company in Hankou. After the abandonment of Wuhan, the source of pig iron was suddenly lacking, so the price of iron soared, from more than 300 yuan per ton to more than 700 yuan. The Adjustment Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established an iron smelting plant in Sichuan, purchasing a high-temperature melting furnace with a melting force of ten [Unit illegible] per day. Before the abandonment of Wuhan, more than 1,000 tons of pig iron were transported out, and at the same time, new [mines illegible] were actively planned for development. According to expert measurements, the iron deposits in Lugu, which belongs to Mianning County, Xikang, amount to 80 million tons. In addition, the iron storage in Tianquan Rongjing can produce 4500 tons per month from January of this year. In the future, Luding will expand production in the whole area, and produce tens of thousands of tons of iron every year. The remaining iron ore reserves in the southwestern provinces are approximately 39,616,000 tons. Therefore, the wrought iron needed by the people in the future can be gradually self-sufficient. (C) In order to support the development of tin, the government plans to set up a complete company by the Resources Commission to engage in mining, washing, and refining, with a total capital of 6 million yuan. At the same time, the Yunnan Provincial Government and the Fudian New Bank jointly established a trade association to handle the export of old tin [smelting product unclear]. In the future, it will be exported directly from Mengzi and will no longer be re-smelted in Hong Kong before being exported. The production areas of tin in China are almost entirely in the southwestern provinces; Yunnan ranks first, with an annual output of about 9,000 tons, accounting for 88% of the country's total output. Guangxi ranks second, with an annual output of about 300 tons; Hunan ranks third, with an annual output of about 90 tons; Guangdong has only 50 tons. The total tin production in the four provinces is about 9,400 tons. Most of this product is [Shi illegible] shipped abroad; in recent years, there has been a rapid surge, and its export value is often more than 30 million yuan in national currency, ranking seventh among the country's foreign exports. As for the nation's [illegible Shi illegible] production of tin, it ranks fifth among the world's tin producing countries. (D) Copper is the most important material in the electrical industry, and its applications are extremely wide. Pure copper can be used to make transmission lines for trams, telephones, and telegraphs, as well as machinery for other industries. The alloy of copper and zinc is called brass, which is used to manufacture screws, round rods, watch parts, and bullet casings. The national copper mining areas are in Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces, with a total area of 47.6 million acres. The Dongchuan copper mine in Yunnan is the area with the most copper production in our country. Now, the Yunnan Provincial Resources Commission and the Yunnan Provincial Government jointly operate the Dianbei [illegible] Affairs Bureau to handle the Nuo mines in the northern part of the province, and all assets in Dongchuan will be used as part of the government investment. The Pengxian copper mine in Sichuan is the second largest copper mine in China, and the Resources Commission has sent Chang Kai to start construction. According to estimates by the [Hua illegible] Geological Survey Institute, the mine reserves are approximately 100,000 tons. (E) Antimony is a rich mineral resource in [illegible] South Province, accounting for 99% of the country. The total output of the province is 17,753 tons, accounting for more than 87% of the world's output. Xinhua tin mine, Yiyang Banxi and other places are the most prosperous for mining, followed by Anhua Shao [illegible], Yuanling Xinwei and other places, followed by Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou and other provinces. Recently, Mingxin Minsheng and other companies in Sanhe County, Guizhou, have been mining [illegible], but the output is not large, and the Guizhou Mining Bureau is in progress.

### After the British Attitude Softens, Japan Becomes More Rigid: The Foreign Ministry Denies Mistreating British Nationals; Japanese Troops in Tianjin Insist on a Thorough Resolution

[Reuter's Tokyo, 21st] According to Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita informed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, yesterday afternoon that the Japanese government could not agree to the British request to cease searching British nationals in Tianjin and inspecting food in the area.

[Reuter's Tokyo, 21st] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry denied that British nationals in Tianjin were being treated unfairly by the Japanese side, stating that, according to official information received, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have not shown any preferential treatment to nationals of the United States, Germany, or Italy. The Japanese authorities have not taken any violent actions against British nationals. Rumors that three British men were stripped naked and that one British woman was violated are untrue and are purely "malicious anti-Japanese propaganda," as women and children are all searched by female police officers. As for the entry of vegetables and food into the concession, the Japanese side has not obstructed it.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 21st] Recent reports regarding the Far East situation still lack concrete details. Reports from Tokyo state that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita held talks with British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie for over an hour. It is said that Arita expressed his willingness to handle the Tianjin dispute as a local incident. According to the "Every Evening Telegraph," the British Ambassador proposed a plan to resolve the Tianjin dispute locally. It is said that the Japanese government has agreed to negotiate based on this principle. However, the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin firmly believe that if the dispute is to be resolved, the entire issue of the British concession in Tianjin and British concessions in China must be addressed simultaneously, making it a difficult issue.

[Reuter's London, 21st] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today in response to questions, "The blockade of Tianjin and the searching actions by the Japanese continue to exist. Four British nationals have been stripped and searched. However, according to a recent telegram from the Consul-General in Tianjin, such incidents have not occurred again. As for the food issue, there is still a large quantity of rice and wheat, and it appears that the entry of food into the concession from outside is not prohibited, but it is still subject to Japanese searches. Shipping has also seen significant progress, and British ships are not being prevented from sailing. Ambassador Craigie has raised several incidents that have occurred since the blockade of Tianjin with the Japanese Foreign Minister, who has agreed to investigate them in detail. The position of the Japanese government has not yet been clearly stated, and it is expected that there will be a new report tomorrow. The majority of the British garrison in North China is now concentrated in Tianjin."

[Reuter's London, 20th] Foreign Secretary Halifax, in his first report to the House of Lords this afternoon on the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, expressed a glimmer of hope for the current Anglo-Japanese government negotiations. Halifax, when mentioning that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, had issued a "strong protest" to the Japanese authorities, said that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had taken note of this and was investigating the matter. Craigie is currently working hard to clarify the situation. At the same time, Halifax himself had discussed the matter with the Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu on Sunday. The Foreign Secretary continued, "The British government believes that the Japanese government, like the British government, does not wish to expand the scope of the dispute or further complicate the current extremely difficult situation. At the same time, we are deeply aware of the repercussions of this dispute on other British concessions and the public sphere in China." Halifax then repeatedly and solemnly stated that Britain maintains the closest contact with the US and French governments. After explaining the causes of the dispute, Halifax said that the British military authorities have taken all possible defensive measures to ensure security. Due to the strict inspection at the entrance of the concession, the import of perishable food into the concession is intermittent. It is said that the market near the French concession is still functioning normally.

[Reuter's London, 20th] Conservative MP Moore will launch a debate on the China situation in the government's Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday, with a special focus on the Tianjin issue.

(Reuter's London, 20th) British government legal advisor Sir Arthur Onslow condemned in Laverstock today, saying that it would be absurd to pretend that the current blockade of Tianjin is not a direct threat to the heart of Britain. This threat may have been conspired by those who feel that Britain is a major obstacle in their path to dominating the world. Arthur Onslow further stated that they never forget their compatriots who are suffering insults and difficulties in Tianjin. The Conservative Party's tradition of solidarity can strengthen the Party members' conviction that Britain, in the past or in the future, will never succumb to the current threats, no matter the generation.

[Reuter's London, 21st] The "Daily Mail" commented on the Tianjin incident today, saying, "Economic retaliation by Britain will surely be effective. Japan's provocative actions in Tianjin are equivalent to their tactics of abusing submarines, poison gas, and breaking contracts in an attempt to salvage their war losses. We must not compromise on this provocation and must respond with the most resolute and clear means."

[Reuter's London, 21st] The Times said in an editorial today, "The Japanese military authorities in North China are attempting to transform the local Tianjin incident into a broad issue concerning general policies. Therefore, the current situation in Tianjin remains chaotic. Before the purpose and means of Japan's China policy are determined, we can only speculate on the future development of the Tianjin dispute. The recent declaration by US Secretary of State Hull shows that although the US government is not directly involved in the Tianjin incident, it cannot ignore the widespread expansion of the incident. The initiation of the Tianjin incident is clearly directly related to Britain and Japan, but after its expansion, it is in fact opposed to all foreign concessions and treaty rights in China. This move will intensify the opposition of various countries to Japan's policies, and the degree of opposition may not be known by the Japanese military."

### US Congressmen Advocate Thorough Investigation of Submarine Incidents: Whether Due to Espionage Activities; France Prepares to Rebuild the Phoenix

[Reuter's Washington, 20th] Senator Barbour introduced a proposal to the Senate today requesting the appointment of a congressional committee to investigate whether the sinking of the American submarine "Squalus," the British submarine "Thetis," and the French submarine "Phoenix" were due to terrorist activities. The proposal also requested that the congressional committee investigate the activities of foreign spies in the United States.

[Reuter's Paris, 20th] French Leader Daladier declared in the Senate today that the French government has decided to rebuild a submarine similar to the "Phoenix," which was lost off the coast of Vietnam last week, and will still name it "Phoenix."

### British Shipping Tycoon Sir Owen Philipps Dies

[Reuter's London, 21st] Shipping magnate Sir Owen Philipps died here today at the age of forty-nine.

### Poland Denies Papal Envoy Offered a Plan to Mediate Danzig

(Reuter's Vatican City, 20th) According to official reports, the special envoy sent by the Vatican to Warsaw, Monsignor Cortesi, spoke today with the Secretary of State of the Vatican. His trip to Rome was specifically about the ordination of seven new bishops of Poland. According to other reports, Cortesi had received a response regarding the Pope's recent suggestion to resolve the Danzig and German-Polish problems peacefully, but Poland strongly denied that Cortesi was carrying any plans from Polish Foreign Minister Beck.

### Poland, the Sea, and Northern Europe: An Analysis of the Stumbling Block in Anglo-Soviet Negotiations (Part 1)

— Dong Ping

One

Since April, Anglo-Soviet negotiations have become major news in the newspapers. However, day after day, stopping and starting, talking and retalking, three months have passed, and the Soviet Union has made two proposals, and Britain has sent three plans - recently, it is rumored that Britain sent a new plan, which would make it four. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also unfortunately lost his official position - but the phrase "Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been completed" still cannot be seen in the newspapers.

The day before yesterday, Chamberlain said in the House of Commons in response to questions: "There are still several focuses in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Among these focuses, the most important and the most noteworthy is naturally the guarantee issue of the Baltic countries. The Soviet Union is insistent on guaranteeing these small countries repeatedly, while Britain has expressed that it is not necessary for those small countries themselves, but those small countries themselves are shouting up: "We will maintain our neutrality on our own and don't you need to guarantee us".

Why is the Baltic issue so messy? Here, let's offer a little bit of fact-breaking information.

Two

First, let's see why the Soviet Union must volunteer to guarantee the Baltic countries.

This is fundamentally not a political or diplomatic issue, but entirely a military technical issue.

Now, let's open a map of Europe and look at the Baltic Sea and Northern Europe.

We all know that the Soviet Union is a complete continental country. For hundreds of years, she has been working hard on opening up seaports. However, up to now, there are only two usable military ports, Vladivostok in Asia and the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea. And the Baltic port is especially important. The Soviet European fleet is concentrated there.

However, if we really analyze it, the Baltic Sea is really a dead sea. It only has one outlet - the North Sea. Therefore, its fate is in fact controlled by the powers in the North Sea.

This fact was already revealed in the last World War. Therefore, during the peace conference, it was stipulated that the German territory along the Baltic coast should remove military equipment, and the Kiel Canal between Germany and Denmark, and the Øresund Strait between Denmark and Sweden, should be open to international navigation and prohibited from being fortified.

However, after Hitler came to power, the peace treaty became a piece of waste paper. Cannons were already installed on the German territory along the Baltic coast. The Kiel Canal is also being actively expanded and raised bridges to allow the largest German cruisers to pass through. And Heligoland Island, which is located in the North Sea and controls the western entrance of the Kiel Canal, which was also demilitarized after the war, has now become a German naval base again.

Denmark and Germany are only separated by a canal, and the Nazi poisonous knife cannot be resisted. Therefore, not only has the management right of the Kiel Canal completely fallen into the hands of Germany, but also the western border of Denmark, facing Britain, has been forced to install German cannons. The meaning of this is: British Navy, please don't come over.

Not only that, but Germany's expansion in the Baltic Sea and Northern Europe is becoming more and more fierce. He asked the four Nordic countries to sign non-aggression treaties. Although he was rebuffed, he will not stop. Now he is encouraging Denmark to fortify the Øresund Strait between Sweden and Denmark. Sweden is naturally doing its best to oppose this. However, although Sweden is a country that works hard to oppose the Nazis, she is still a small country. If there is no strength of others to back it up, it will sooner or later succumb to the swastika flag. If Sweden unfortunately succumbs and the Øresund Strait is fortified, becoming Germany's world, then the Soviet fleet in the Baltic Sea will be suffocated inside.

Further east is Memel. Overnight, Hitler made his envoy to take it back. It is a good deep-water port; Germany is preparing to establish a submarine base there, which is a great threat to the Soviet fleet staying in the Baltic Sea.

From Memel, further north is the Åland Islands, another important place. This island is located between Sweden and Finland. In 1921, the two sides agreed that the island would be neutral forever and not fortified. However, in January of this year, forced by the situation, the two countries also decided to set up fortifications there.

This action is naturally a resistance to Germany's activities in Memel. However, Hitler didn't care and instead publicized it in the newspapers. The meaning of this is: you set up the fortifications first, and in two days, I'll take them for my use.

Undoubtedly, in the next war, the Åland Islands will be a must-have place for Germany and the Soviet Union. And whoever seizes it has the hope of dominating the Baltic Sea.

These changes in the Baltic Sea are all things that make the Soviet Union very headache. But the Soviet Union will never sit still and wait for death. She also has her methods.

### Anglo-French Military Conference to Be Held in Singapore Starting Today

High-ranking officials from both countries gather in the Far East to discuss cooperation between land, sea, and air forces

[Reuter's Singapore, 21st] The Anglo-French military cooperation conference in the Far East will be held here tomorrow. The British representatives include Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the China Station; Air Vice-Marshal J. E. A. Baldwin, Air Officer Commanding British Air Forces in India; Air Vice-Marshal Sir P. H. L. Playfair, Air Officer Commanding British Air Forces Far East; General Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Commander of British Land Forces in China; and senior military officers and staff from India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, and Hong Kong. The French representatives include General Martin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in the Far East; Admiral Doughty, Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy; and Colonel Duvic. A total of sixty British and French officers will participate in this important conference. The conference has long been planned and it has a special significance that its held at a time of recent developments. The United States and the Netherlands are not represented at this conference, but given their interests in the Pacific, the United States and the Netherlands must maintain close contact with the views of Britain and France. This Anglo-French military conference in the Far East will last for at least one week. It is heard that the main discussions will be on the docking of French warships and warships of other friendly countries at the Singapore naval base, and the wartime cooperation of British and French materials.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 21st] British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Sir Percy Noble, arrived in Singapore yesterday. The Commander of the French Army in French Vietnam can also arrive today. As for the British Army Commander in China, and naval and army staff, they have already arrived in Singapore. It is said that the main issue of the conference is the wartime cooperation plan between the British and French troops stationed in the Far East.

### Polish People Boycott Italian Goods

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 21st] Polish public organizations promote a boycott of Italian goods in cities and towns throughout the country, prevent people from going to Italy, and implement economic sanctions against Italian expatriates. It is said that this is in retaliation for the insults to the Polish people in Italian newspapers.

### Shoe King Establishes New Factory in Germany

[Haitong News Agency, Pukhet, 21st] The world-famous shoe company Bata has recently purchased a large piece of land near Seymour Weiri to build a new shoe factory. Currently, two large factories and thirty-five workers' residences have been completed. Two workshops and fifty residences, and offices are still under construction. All projects are expected to be completed this year. In the future, the new factory will employ more than 2,000 workers and be named the "Buheihe" factory.

### Roosevelt Supports Revising the Neutrality Act:

Revoking the order to embargo arms and increase the contribution to peace

[Reuter's Washington, 20th] President Roosevelt said in a meeting with journalists today that Congress would adjourn only after passing the Neutrality Act. He believes that the most important provision of the Act is to rescind the order to embargo arms to belligerent nations, which will enhance America's strength for peace. He said that the reason why he did not want to delay this step was very clear. If a war breaks out after Congress adjourns, it would be difficult for the United States to adopt a neutrality law that would not be considered to favor one side.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations May Make Progress Within Days: No Meetings This Week; British Representative Awaiting New Instructions

[Reuter's Moscow, 20th] British Special Envoy Strang and the British and French Ambassadors continued to discuss the Tripartite Agreement today, but they have not yet met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this week and are still awaiting new instructions from London.

[Reuter's London, 20th] According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, informed sources are now more optimistic about the progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. The recent Soviet memorandum is being studied, and the views of both sides are gradually converging. It is believed that the next meeting of the British and French Ambassadors and Strang with Molotov, if no other unexpected events occur, will be the best opportunity in principle to clarify different points of view. Once agreement is reached, they will immediately proceed to draft the text of the agreement, which may take some time, but according to informed sources, the future is extremely optimistic.

[Reuter's Moscow, 20th] Tass has officially denied the German claim that the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement has been delayed due to the Soviet Union's insistence on providing guarantees for the Soviet Far Eastern border, stating that the news is unfounded and fabricated.

### Shiratori Returns to Italy; Rumors of Promotion in His Home Country

[Reuter's Berlin, 20th] Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and embassy staff and military attachés left Germany today after a week of meetings here and returned to his post. According to Japanese sources here, Shiratori will soon be transferred back to Japan to take on an important position, so he is only making a temporary stay in Rome.

### US Protest to Japan to Be Published in Full: More Than 150 Cases Since the Outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War

[Reuter's Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today confirming that the US Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, following instructions from the State Department, visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry again on Monday. The first visit concerned the situation on Gulangyu, and the second concerned the continued bombing by Japanese aircraft of American property in China. In addition to protesting the bombing incident, the US Chargé d'Affaires also requested the Japanese government to agree to publish the full text of the protests made by the United States regarding this issue. Hull added that, to his knowledge, the US Chargé d'Affaires had not yet mentioned the Tianjin issue to the Japanese government.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The full text of the protests made by the United States to Japan regarding the bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft will be published by the State Department in the coming days. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there have been more than 150 cases of American property in China being threatened or damaged by Japanese aircraft bombings, including more than 24 cases since June 1 of this year.

Short Commentary

### US Mediation of Tianjin Case

The Tianjin incident is a planned anti-British movement by Japan, as well as a planned act of intimidation against Britain. Therefore, in this action, it seeks to avoid any involvement with the United States and does not hesitate to send frequent veiled flirtations.

However, the fact is that whether Britain adopts a compromise or a resistance policy, the outcome of the incident cannot but affect the United States, France, and other countries, which cannot be denied. To be more specific, Japan's attack on the Tianjin concession actually includes the role of American power in the Far East. Although there are some contradictions in the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East, since the arrogance of Japanese aggression has risen, and even after the Japanese forces are tolerated in the future, the interests of Britain and the United States have largely converged, that is, they are inevitably forced to withdraw from the Far East together due to the development of Japanese power.

Currently, Britain's foreign policy, not only in the Far East, but throughout the world, is ××××××, while the United States' policy, on the contrary, is increasingly acquiring a decisive significance. Therefore, we do not want to be surprised that the British government has adopted a "pacification" policy, but we should pay attention to how the United States has sent out the message of "mediating the Tianjin case"! We believe that the United States will not fall into Japan's conspiracy, but we hope even more that the United States' active attitude will certainly promote and help the British people to promote their government to become actively together!

Spring and Autumn

### No Retreat

— Hui Zhaojun

That night of March 15th, the artillery fire was extremely fierce. The newly full moon was shaken and quivering incessantly. The forests of Dawu Mountain rustled in response, and the spring leaves on the tree trunks looked as if they were stained with fresh red blood.

At the foot of the mountain, a pillbox torn apart by bombs lay prone. Inside and around the pillbox, sandbags were piled up, leaning against each other. The heads of the soldiers that peeked out resembled the faces of clean-shaven Han men.

A heavy machine gun, swinging its heavy head, squinted at the × people. Was it laughing mockingly?

"Ah yo!" A sharp bullet, like a shooting star, pierced through the back of the machine gunner. With a miserable cry, he fell to the side, but another brave warrior immediately and nimbly crawled over to take the place of the fallen.

"Comrade, how are you?" the platoon leader asked in a low voice, using his hand to press tightly on the wounded man's wound, stopping the gushing and beautiful blood.

"It's nothing! Quickly, point the gun at the × people! We must meet again, 'death' is commonplace." The dying man had a smile on the corner of his mouth.

The upper lip of the pillbox slantedly revealed the mouth of a small cannon. Hanging from the muzzle was a tuft of lush green leaves, like a beard. Because the × people's planes were too crazy, the brothers had converted it into an anti-aircraft gun. The gunner's entire body was covered in earth, and under the shadow of his polished helmet, he was holding a very thick book, his cheeks moving as he recited.

The heavy sound of the engine gradually approached. The boundless sky was inlaid with three moving red lights, flying diagonally and quickly in a 品 shape. The gunner threw away the book in his hand, and the thing followed by firing. It was truly a good thing, as a burst of red light smashed the dark and heavy air. The three red lights immediately went out, with lovely sparks rippling in the middle. The sound of the engine gradually faded away, and the thick book returned heavily to the shadow of the gunner's helmet, as he continued reciting!

The ridge of Dawu Mountain was extremely steep, and covered with moss, very much like a large green top hat. A tank patrolling at the foot of the mountain seemed to see × people ambushing halfway up the mountain, and so it bumped and struggled upwards. Looking closer, it turned out to be a row of straw men. The tank paused, greatly angered. Just as it hesitated, a burst of laughter suddenly came from the top of the mountain.

"Stupid thing, come up and play!" At a distance of one hundred yards from the tank, a sentry in a grey cloth uniform stood straight. His left arm had been injured, but the joy of "resisting the war" made him forget what wounds and pain were. He was laughing and shouting.

The tank chased after him, and our sentry ran around the mountain path, sometimes using a fallen tree to block the way, causing "it" to flip over on its back, and sometimes firing two shots at "their" rear end. The tank's machine gun roared angrily, but only struck down protruding rocks and verdant trees.

After supporting for more than two hours, the sentry's legs were a little sore. He jumped off the slope and lay on his back to rest, but the "stupid thing" was still constantly spinning around in circles. Its huge heart was thinking, "The × people have been eliminated, I must have a good time."

This was a battalion of loyal and brave soldiers, who, in an inferior situation, were dealing with the robbers by resisting the invasion. Although their numbers had been reduced from more than three hundred to over one hundred, their indomitable spirit became greater day by day. Although the road behind had been cut off, if they were willing to put down their guns, they could detour and retreat into the border region, but they were unwilling. They said, "The gun is the life of a soldier! The life of the country! The life of four hundred and fifty million compatriots!"

"Brothers," the battalion commander stood up and said to everyone that night of March 15th, "Tonight, we suddenly received an order from above, asking us to retreat – retreat into the border region, disarm, and receive protection! What are everyone's opinions? Are you willing? Or unwilling?"

"Unwilling! We will fight on!" A burst of majestic roar!

"So many of our brothers have already died, let us all die here together!" Another huge chorus.

"Brothers! Since everyone's opinion is 'unwilling to retreat,' then we must continue to fight! Fight! Fight! Dawu Mountain is 'ours'! The pillbox is 'ours'!" The battalion commander raised his left hand and shouted excitedly.

The moon of March 15th gradually bid farewell to the world again. The sky was still the same red as blood, and the war continued to unfold vigorously.

### Falling Behind Life

— Jie Ru

Literature stands at the forefront of social life. "Falling behind life" is undoubtedly a major shortcoming in a specific literary movement or in the creative practice of a specific writer. In many forms of literary movements throughout history, literature has participated in the development and struggle of the entire society as a portrayal of life and a reflection of life. If there is a work, or a writer, that cannot move forward with the changes and development of social life, but falls far behind life, then it will be alienated from the entire literary movement and social movement, becoming the dregs of literature.

A writer who is most capable of depicting the living struggles in society does not merely peek in the dark or investigate the aspects of social life from the sidelines. He must, primarily, throw himself into the entire social life, participate in all the battles of the masses, and from this discover the inner layers of life and grasp the truth of life. Therefore, a great literary work must be created by a writer who is deeply immersed in the source of life. If a writer loses the nourishment of life, that is, if he is confined to a narrow range of life, cannot discuss life, and is unwilling to participate in life, so that he falls behind life, then it will be impossible for his own work to reflect a broad picture of reality and write about numerous characters. Even if he has excellent literary skills and astonishing talent and imagination, he will at most be able to create some works that have only formal beauty but no actual content.

In our country today, there are many such writers. They themselves are falling behind life. The actual objective reality is at a very distant distance from them. The themes of their creations have become very weak due to the poverty of their own lives. Their writing brushes cannot but be limited to a certain field, and their vision cannot but remain on a certain range. Their writing activities cannot but constantly seek help from the trivial matters and details around them. These people, who only draw writing water from their own past lives and present personal lives, are indeed bound to fall into the predicament of creative poverty in the face of the current national revolutionary reality of our country. What is extracted from this predicament of life cannot only fail to be consistent with the development of the entire national revolutionary movement, but even greatly hinders the progress of this movement and becomes a superfluous burden. This is undeniable, it is the defect of our literary movement today, and it requires all our writers to deeply reflect on it, recognize it, and correct it.

Within our motherland today, all aspects of social life have undoubtedly undergone immeasurable changes. The flames of the Anti-Japanese War overflowing across the vast land of the country have turned millions of people into heroic fighters and countless towns and villages into revolutionary battlefields. The enemy's invasion and humiliation on our country's land has caused countless fathers, sons, brothers, spouses, and friends to be separated and lost, and has caused millions of peaceful people to leave their homes and become refugees, leading to countless famines and countless deaths. This enormous change in life is precisely the richest treasure for our literature. Writers can grasp the most moving themes from here and write the most excellent works from here. However, as the Soviet Gilbordin said, "Life has changed, and to tell the truth of life, artists must not fall behind life. They should see the pace of life in flesh and concreteness, know the state of the newly formed typical, and know the new typical people. Then, we can accurately depict all aspects of life in our country today, which is undergoing drastic changes, and reflect the entire picture of our country's life."

In order to create great and moving art, in front of a life of upheaval, artists must never fall behind life. He must adopt a deep and passionate attitude towards life, throwing himself into the revolutionary life of the war of resistance. Only in this way can his artistic practice keep pace with the objective life of the war of resistance, strengthen the moving power of his artistic works, and enable the combat function of his literature to be infinitely deepened and expanded. We must know that being outside the upheaval of life and treating one's own objects of description with a lack of passion is the first thing that causes artists to fail!

Life has changed, let us delve into the core of this change, and throw ourselves into the torrent of this change. As for "driving behind life," let it become an old saying!

### "China Travel" Cantonese Troupe's First Shot: "Five Rams City" to be Performed Tonight

— Qi Zhuo

At the Queen's Theatre, Fundraising for Lingnan University Student Union Disaster Relief

"It's good, but we don't understand what they're saying!" - This is the unanimous sigh of many Cantonese-speaking overseas Chinese in Hong Kong after watching Mandarin dramas. Although it is much better than the phenomenon of "dramas are worthless" in the past, it is still a pity that it has not penetrated the broad masses.

After the reconstruction of "China Travel," they are actively struggling, eager to carry on the past and forge ahead, and do something grand. Therefore, in addition to enriching the original lineup, they have also established a Cantonese troupe, which is on par with the Mandarin troupe. This kind of attitude is quite interesting.

Originally, it is not without shortcomings for dramas to be performed in local dialects; however, in the enlightenment movement of dramas, and in the current stage of winning over audiences as targets for national salvation propaganda, using Cantonese to deeply reach the broad masses as a tool to improve the audience's level may not be a transitional method that should be adopted at this time and place.

A few days ago, when "China Travel" participated in the public performance of "Before Dawn" at the Lee Theatre, the play "Atonement" used both Mandarin and Cantonese simultaneously, which aroused the interest of the audience. Tonight, the public performance of "Five Rams City" at the Queen's Theatre is entirely in Cantonese, which is the first shot of the "China Travel" Cantonese troupe.

This first shot was released after their painstaking rehearsals. They are performing for the Lingnan University Student Union to raise funds for disaster relief, and their spirit of actively serving the public is also worthy of our praise.

The script of "Five Rams City" is a national defense script that has been slightly changed in location from "Our Hometown," which was collectively created by Xia Yan, Hong Shen, Zhang Min, etc. The content is tense, vivid, and addresses the needs of this time and place. It tells us that returning to the provincial capital to be obedient citizens is not something that spirited nationals do, unless they have the ability and determination to go back and take on great tasks.

A few days ago, when "China Travel" was having its final rehearsal, the reporter had the opportunity to preview it. The spirit of serious work of all their members showed the bright future of "China Travel." What is especially inspiring is the members who are working hard, like workers, to make props and scenery; Mr. Zhang Xuefeng, who not only designs the stage sets, but also directs the play; and Tang Huaiqiu, who plays the factory accountant and speaks very beautiful Cantonese. This rare role will surely win the audience's favor tonight.

The development of the plot of "Five Rams City" is roughly like this:

Wang Zuzhang is a wealthy household in Guangzhou. After Guangzhou fell, the whole family fled to Hong Kong. However, he and his eldest son Jinwen and eldest daughter-in-law Li Baozhen are not used to life in Hong Kong. They always feel that Hong Kong is meaningless and always want to return to their fallen hometown. However, Jinwen is afraid that his younger brother Zhongwen will cause trouble if he goes back, so he asked Zuzhang and Zhongwen to agree on three conditions: first, he cannot go to school; second, he is not allowed to stay in Guangzhou and must go to the countryside; and third, he is not allowed to associate with "undesirable" people. Zhongwen is a patriotic and passionate young man. He originally wanted to return to his hometown to do some work to save the country, so even though the conditions were so harsh, he agreed.

Wang Zuzhang and his family returned to their occupied home, but the situation there disappointed them very much. It had completely become a world of × people and traitors. The × people occupied one of their factories and asked a traitor named Yin Jiaming to force them to sell the factory at a low price. The × people also forcibly occupied their ancestral graves and built an airport, so Wang Zuzhang could not transport his wife, who died in Hong Kong, to the provincial capital for burial. Wang Zuzhang became ill from anger because of this. Wang Jinwen could only drown his sorrows with wine at home every day. Only Zhongwen recognized clearly that being an obedient citizen was not something that spirited people did. Therefore, he resolutely joined the guerrillas and contacted many puppet soldiers and police to prepare for an uprising to recover the provincial capital.

Yin Jiaming repeatedly forced Wang Jinwen to secretly sell the factory behind Wang Zuzin's back, but Jinwen procrastinated and never dared to agree to him. On the last day, Gu Jiaming came to urge Jinwen again, and happened to meet Wang Zhongwen, who had returned home to be the inside support for the guerrillas' attack on the city that day. Yin Jiaming had long wanted to capture Zhongwen and go to claim credit, so he suddenly took out a pistol, disarmed Zhongwen, and prepared to escort him out. Fortunately, another guerrilla, Liu Qian Sheng, came with Zhongwen, and he subdued Yin Jiaming with a bizarre method and tied him up. At this time, Liu Qian Sheng, a guerrilla posing as a fake secret agent, came and helped Zhongwen to get rid of Gu Jiaming and helped Zhongwen to launch an uprising.

When they were about to launch the uprising, the soldiers had already been prepared. They resisted the danger. Wang Zuzhang thought of the hatred that the × people had given him, grabbed a gun and rushed out, was seriously injured, and died. Wang Jinwen also sacrificed heroically at the same time. Zhongwen and Baozhen finally fought out and saw the guerrillas recover their hometown.

— This story is exactly what the Cantonese-speaking overseas Chinese dream of pursuing; it is also the new fate of Guangzhou in the near future. The actors are very skilled, and the lineup is as follows:

### Health Authorities Call on Residents to Participate in the Eradication of Tuberculosis Campaign, Approximately 5,000 People Died from Tuberculosis Last Year, Anyone is Susceptible to Infection

Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease. In this bustling city, where people are densely populated and the air is not fresh, it is particularly susceptible to infection. Therefore, the mortality rate is increasing day by day. For the sake of the health of the citizens, the health authorities are constantly urging residents to be careful about their diet and take precautions to protect public health. Now, they have issued an article entitled "Tuberculosis" to call on residents to cooperate.

Tuberculosis

In 1938, nearly 5,000 people died in Hong Kong from tuberculosis or pulmonary tuberculosis.

Its scourge affects both men and women, young and old, equally.

This disease infects people in all stages. All people, regardless of race or class, can be infected by this disease. However, most of the dead are unemployed or low-income Chinese.

There are thousands upon thousands of patients. According to this estimate, for every death, there are always five or six, or eight, or even ten patients who are still alive but are also suffering from the pain of this disease.

Tuberculosis is actually caused by germs or toxins invading the human body. Germs or toxins are sometimes scattered in the air or in food. All people can inhale them into their bodies through breathing and eating. In addition, there are other ways to contract the disease, but those who contract it are relatively few.

In Hong Kong, the history of this disease is generally as follows: poor people live in small rooms or on beds, where light and air are difficult to penetrate. The food they eat daily also lacks nutrients. Due to the carelessness of those suffering from tuberculosis, they spit phlegm everywhere, causing germs or toxins to float in the wind after the phlegm dries. They are inhaled into someone's lungs, and then one lobe of the lung begins to be corroded, and then it extends to another lobe of the lung, until the left and right lobes of the lung are slowly destroyed. Occasionally, it also invades other parts of the body.

Once a person is infected, germs or toxins are released with the phlegm when they cough. After the phlegm dries, it floats in the wind, and others inhale it, and then they contract the disease.

Anyone can be infected. Tuberculosis germs or toxins are harmful to people, regardless of their status. The phlegm spit by a small worker can infect a manager, and the phlegm spit by a wealthy person can also infect a poor person.

Other ways to contract tuberculosis include the transmission of tuberculosis germs or toxins to people through other routes, such as spoons, cups, and dishes that have the saliva of patients. Others who use them together or eat with patients are easily infected with the disease. However, in Hong Kong, transmission through breathing is more common.

Since the transmission of tuberculosis is like this, how should we try to prevent ourselves and others from being infected?

1. Try to enjoy sunlight and fresh air as much as possible. If you can do this, the harm of tuberculosis germs or toxins, although not completely eliminated, will be greatly reduced. Therefore, the windows and ventilation of our homes should be opened day and night to allow fresh air to enter.

2. The daily food should be simple food that is beneficial to hygiene and rich in nutrients, including meat, fresh fish, eggs, green vegetables, raw oil, and fresh fruits. As for rice, red rice is preferable, or at least one part red rice and three parts white rice.

3. Try to keep the body and residence clean. Ocean view and clean water have the same effect as sunlight and fresh air, and can restrain tuberculosis germs or toxins. However, be careful when sweeping the floor to prevent dust from flying up, because the dust may contain dried phlegm, leaving behind tuberculosis germs or toxins. Therefore, it is advisable to wet the floor with clean water or disinfectant first, and then sweep or wipe it with a rag dipped in clean water or kerosene.

4. Do not spit phlegm in public places, such as the floors of houses, sidewalks outside, trams, buses, trains, and ships, and publicize the disadvantages of spitting phlegm indiscriminately to encourage common compliance. If you must spit phlegm, you should spit it into a tissue or into a covered spittoon containing disinfectant.

5. If you are unfortunately infected with tuberculosis, you should seek treatment from a Western doctor as soon as possible. If the disease is not deeply rooted, the doctor's treatment can prevent it from worsening. If the conditioning is proper, there is still a possibility of recovery. As for whether to go to the hospital or stay at home for conditioning, the doctor will definitely tell the patient. If you stay at home, in order to prevent infecting family members and neighbors, you should try to live alone in a room, and the bowls, chopsticks, cups, and dishes needed for food should also be separated for your own use. You must never spit phlegm everywhere. If you want to spit phlegm, you can spit it on paper and burn it with fire, or spit it in a spittoon. The spittoon used should be covered and contain disinfectant. It should be cleaned at least once a day and poured into a water toilet or toilet bucket.

6. Anyone who has knowledge of how tuberculosis germs or toxins invade the human body, how they are transmitted from one person to another, and how to prevent them should fulfill their duty to inform those who do not know, and especially set an example, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

I sincerely ask people from all walks of life to participate in the campaign to eradicate tuberculosis and help the medical and health authorities to work hard to eliminate this disease. This is what we hope.

### New Developments in the East River War, Our Army Ordered to Counterattack, Lin Weitao's Troops have Arrived in Zengjiang, There will be Surprising Developments in the Advance of the West Road into Dongguan and Longchuan

Planning the Second Counterattack on Zengcheng

[East River Express] According to military news, our army stationed on the East Front has recently received orders from the highest military authorities, believing that the × has other plans for the East River, and ordered to counterattack at the opportune moment to crush the ×'s conspiracy.

According to gossip from the front line yesterday, Lin Weitao's troops, holding Luofu and its vicinity, are now continuing to advance along the Leitian, Luofushan foothills, Laosu, Mazha, and Da 　 Ling areas of the Bo Zeng line. The ×× Brigade Chen Shuying and Chen Wukui and other troops have assembled in Zengjiang. The right wing vanguard has already advanced to Zheng and is now threatening Guling's ×× and the left wing, forming a corner to each other, calmly advancing. The entire line is tense, and the East River war will have a brand new development during the day.

After the military affairs are over, I will still come to Shao to preside over the Provincial Council affairs. (2) The preparation for the establishment of the municipal and county councils has been requested by this Council to the Provincial Government to expedite the handling, but because the organizational regulations of the municipal and county councils have not been promulgated by the central government, they cannot be established within a time limit.

[Xuwen Express] According to military news, the × army on Hainan Island has recently been boarding ships from Haikou and heading to other places, presumably to Guangzhou to provide reinforcements. As for the Qiong Island war, since Wu Daonan, the administrative commissioner of the Ninth District, arrived in Qiong, if the power of the Li people can be used well, it will greatly enhance the strength to annihilate the ×. He personally went to the Wuzhi Mountains to convene a meeting of the chiefs of various tribes, and explained in detail the situation of our resistance war and the atrocities of the ×. The chiefs were extremely angry about the × invading us and unanimously swore an alliance to participate in the resistance against the × and annihilate the stubborn bandits together.

### A Unit of the × Cavalry in Shilong Rebels, Skirmish with × Military Police

(Shenzhen Express) More than 60 soldiers of the × cavalry Saito unit stationed near Zhusi Zhou on Zhongshan Middle Road in Shilong Town were originally intellectuals from Tokyo. Recently, they were forcibly conscripted to China to fight, and they have suffered a lot. For the past ten days, because their request to the × Chief Ariukawa Kiyoshi for unpaid salaries was unsuccessful, they were suddenly moved to hate war and asked the × Headquarters for leave, claiming illness and refusing to go out. The × Chief did not allow it and condemned them. The more than 60 × were very angry and suddenly whipped the war horses in the stables of Zhusi Zhou on the morning of the 18th and set them on fire. The × soldiers guarding the stables were unable to stop them and ran to the × Headquarters to report. After listening to the report, the × Chief immediately dispatched about 100 military police to surround the rebelling soldiers, intending to disarm them. A skirmish immediately broke out, with machine guns firing at each other. The situation was extremely chaotic for a time. After an hour of stalemate, the rebelling soldiers, unable to overcome the disparity in numbers, were all subdued. It was later found out that more than 20 of the rebelling × were killed, and the rest were all escorted to the × Headquarters for interrogation.

### Our Army in Qiong Island Recaptures Jiaji City Again

More than 100 × Died, Remnants Fled Back to Qiongdong County Town, × Ambush at Nadas City, Major Fujita Killed

The County's Our Army Attacks the × and Achieves a Great Victory

(South Road Express) Our army in Dan County, Qiongxi, has repeatedly attacked the × in the past ten days and reaped huge military gains. The × in Nadas City in the county has been repeatedly defeated by our army, and the remnants of the × are still causing trouble and looting in various villages. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, more than 10 × military vehicles, carrying more than 100 soldiers, departed from Dan County for Nadas City, attempting to provide reinforcements and counterattack us. It was unexpectedly detected by our radio. The × Brigade of the Zhuang Chang Team cooperated with a unit near both sides of the highway, waiting for the × vehicles to pass in a file. They immediately threw hand grenades at the ×. The × soldiers were caught off guard and frantically fired their machine guns densely on both sides. After a fierce battle of about half an hour, the × was unable to resist and fled in a panic. Our army won a great victory in this battle. As a result, two × military vehicles were destroyed, and more than 10 × soldiers were killed. × Commander Major Fujita was killed by us, and one × platoon leader, Nakamura, was seriously injured. Our side only suffered one squad leader and more than 10 soldiers killed or wounded.

The × Commits a Crime in Jiaji and Suffers Heavy Losses

After Jiaji City, Qiongdong, was recaptured by our army at the beginning of this month, the remnants of the × fled back to Qiongdong County Town to recuperate and replenish. The X have also sent troops to attack us. According to investigations, on the 13th and 14th, we engaged in a fierce battle with the × near Jiaji City. The × machine bombed us in cycles, dropping many bombs in the city. In order to avoid major sacrifices, our army retreated for a while. On the evening of the 14th, our army continued to send reinforcements to counterattack the ×. The battle was extremely fierce. After a fierce battle of three hours, the × was unable to resist and collapsed towards Qiongdong. Our army immediately recaptured Jiaji. The battle lasted two days and nights, killing more than 100 ×. The × are still retreating to a corner and actively replenishing, with a model of re-plotting. Our army has been strictly preventing them.

### The Han River Water Surged Again Yesterday

### The × Army in Daliang was Airstriked by Us, Several × Barracks and Armories Destroyed

[Zhongshan Express] At 7:50 a.m. on the 17th of this month, our divine eagle team suddenly appeared over Daliang. The × woke up from their dreams and fled in a panic. Our aircraft team found the target and calmly dropped bombs, destroying the × puppet barracks in the county government area. Two bombs also hit the × armory. The flames soared into the sky, and the × soldiers fled for their lives, extremely embarrassed and suffered heavy losses. Our divine eagle team had achieved its purpose and safely flew back to its base.

### The × in Jiujiang Deliberately Created a False Impression, Traitors Discussed Ways to Deal with the Guerrillas with the ×

(Nanhai Express) The × army entrenched in Jiujiang has been inactive recently, but because of its empty strength, it is preventing our attack. Recently, it has installed six or seven wooden cannons at the Shakou Railway Station and Xing'an Wharf, remotely facing the Heshun Haikou and Gulao garrisons of our army in an attempt to intimidate. Jiujiang recently dispatched more than 100 troops from the Takeokakawa unit to defend the Tunzhuxue Xianguan, but fearing an attack by our army, they are busy mobilizing. They have been pretending to be × with rubber mannequins and loading military vehicles on the Jiangfu Road, or coming or going, deliberately creating a false impression to conceal their empty strength. The Kiyokawa River × army in Jiujiang, due to repeated attacks by our guerrillas, is unable to cope with it and is extremely frightened. × Commander Ono specially convened the puppet maintenance association, the puppet chamber of commerce, and the so-called councilors (who were filled by traitors) on the 16th of this month at the Chamber of Commerce to hold a joint meeting to discuss ways to deal with our guerrillas and how to implement the administration and curb the anti- × mood of our people. However, there were no results on the above-mentioned issues.

### Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics

— Zou Falu

2.  The difference between "stretching" and "striking" or "kicking": The action of "zhong" in old gymnastics, new gymnastics calls "striking" or "kicking." The action of "stretching" has no time limit; it can be fast, slow, forceful, or effortless, all of which are stretching. However, if the action of "striking" or "kicking" is not fast enough, it will certainly lose the effectiveness of "striking" or "kicking." If it is not forceful enough, it will certainly not be able to fulfill the mission of "striking" or "kicking." From this, we can understand that the difference in these actions is that the actions of "striking" or "kicking" are faster and more forceful than the actions of "stretching."

3.  The difference between "bending" and "pulling": We can see the difference between the two actions of "bending" and "pulling" from the words themselves, which is exactly the same as the difference between "stretching," "striking," and "kicking" above. Because if it is "pulling," it must be a forceful pull, otherwise the pull will not be established.

4.  Adding "vibrating" actions: This type of action is the most important one in new gymnastics, but it does not exist in old gymnastics. This type of action can be used to practice any part of the body. Even if the part cannot be directly vibrated, it can vibrate other parts to indirectly complete its mission. For example, the chest cannot have direct vibrating actions, but the vibrating actions of the arms can be used to indirectly achieve the effect of vibration. The function of this type of action can increase the number of movements within the same time, and can gradually increase the depth of its movement. For example, when the upper body vibrates forward and downward, the upper body can bend forward and backward once during the time of one breath, and the degree to which the upper body bends downward can also gradually bend lower and lower using the momentum of the downward vibration.

5.  More "circling" actions: Although "circling" actions sometimes exist in old gymnastics, they are performed very rarely, and are mostly for the wrists of the upper limbs and the ankles of the lower limbs. New gymnastics has circling actions for all parts of the body, the purpose of which is to increase the amount of exercise.

B. In terms of practice methods, the differences in practice methods can be divided into the following points:

6.  The difference in fixed positions: Old gymnastics also has the use of fixed positions, but not every section has them, or uses the same position all the time. New gymnastics must first have a position, and then perform the action. Except for lower limb exercises, when performing upper limb, trunk, and other exercises, the lower limb positions are often the same half-open stance, in order to take the solid foundation of standing, which is easy to stabilize. Various actions are performed smoothly on a solid foundation, which is certainly better than the old gymnastics saying that one type of position cannot be used often, or that the feet cannot always be in the same position, which is completely opposite.

7.  The difference in continuous actions: The actions of new gymnastics, whether limbs or trunk, are continuous without stopping. There is absolutely no supporting one action for a long time like in old gymnastics, and then doing the second action. Therefore, its actions and actions are mostly rhythmic. It can be practiced to the playing of music, increasing the interest of the learners.

8.  The difference in direction changes: In old gymnastics, after performing one action on the left side, the same action must be performed immediately on the right side, or after performing one action with the left foot forward, the right foot must be immediately switched forward to perform the same action. In new gymnastics, for complex actions and actions that are inconvenient to change direction, the same number of actions is often performed in one direction before changing to another direction to perform the same number of actions. This practice method makes it easier to become familiar with repeating the same action in one direction, and can avoid the trouble of changing directions frequently, and the effect obtained is no different from changing directions frequently.

9.  The difference in neatness of actions: The actions of old gymnastics must be neat and uniform. For example, when bending the upper body forward, it is required to bend to 90 degrees, and all performers must bend to 90 degrees uniformly. Higher or lower is not allowed. New gymnastics is not like this. Any action must be done to the best of each individual's ability. For example, when bending the upper body forward, some people cannot bend any further after bending to 90 degrees, while others can bend to 100 degrees or more. Its requirement is that everyone should do their best. Those who can bend to 90 degrees should bend to 90 degrees, and those who can bend to 100 degrees should bend to 100 degrees. There is no fixed limit, and meaningless neatness is not sought.

C. In terms of amount of exercise, the amount of exercise in new and old gymnastics differs because the actions and practice methods differ.

10. The amount of exercise differs due to different actions: When we look at the actions of new and old gymnastics above, which are compared, such as "swinging" and "lifting," "pulling" and "bending," "striking," "kicking," and "stretching," once compared, it is obvious which has a greater and smaller amount of exercise. Although there is no comparison for "vibrating" and "circling" actions, vibrating actions can increase the number of movements within the same time and can gradually increase the depth of the movement. It has a large amount of movement and can be self-evident. For a type of exercise, the longer the diameter of its moving parts, or the larger the arc of the movement diameter, the greater the amount of exercise. "Circling" actions are movements along the largest arc of 360 degrees. The size of its amount of exercise need not be discussed in detail.

11. The amount of exercise differs due to different practice methods: The size of the amount of exercise is of course directly related to the actions, and also indirectly related to the practice methods. As mentioned earlier, the practice method of new gymnastics is continuous without stopping, which can increase the number of actions in the same time. For example, when doing the action of bending the upper body to the left and right with both arms bent upwards, old gymnastics must be (1) bending both arms upwards, (2) bending the upper body to the left, (3) returning to the posture of (1), (4) returning to standing upright, (5, 6, 7, 8) performing to the right. In eight breaths, the number of times the body actually bends is only once each to the left and right. New gymnastics is to perform the action of bending the upper body to the left and right, or vibrating the upper body downward to the left and right from the position of bending both arms upwards and the feet half-open. If it is bending, it must be a continuous bend of once to the left and once to the right. If it is vibrating, it must be vibrating two to four times to the left, and then vibrating two to four times to the right. In eight breaths, the upper body bends left and right eight times, which is four times more than in old gymnastics. Moreover, each of its actions has no fixed limit and must be done to the best of each individual's ability. In this way, the difference in the amount of exercise between the two is obvious.

D. In terms of muscle use, new and old gymnastics have the following two differences: 1. The difference in the adjustment of tightness and relaxation: In old gymnastics, when doing any action, the muscles are often tight and contracted from beginning to end. There is no opportunity to relax the muscles until a section of gymnastics is completed or during rest. New gymnastics must have tightness and relaxation for adjustment in one action. For example, when swinging both arms horizontally to the left and right, the muscles are contracted and tight when swinging to the left and right, and force is used. When swinging back to the front of the body and crossing, it is relaxed and effortless. In this way, with the adjustment of muscle tightness and relaxation, it will not become stiff and rigid dead muscles.

12. The difference between active and assistive movements: The actions of old gymnastics also have a distinction between active and assistive movements, but when it uses muscles, it contracts and tightens all parts, regardless of whether they are active or assistive. In new gymnastics, the muscles of the active part must be contracted as much as possible, and the muscles of the assistive part must be relaxed as much as possible. For example, in the old gymnastics action of extending the arms and straightening the chest, extending the arms is assistive and straightening the chest is active. However, when it extends the arms, the muscles of the arms must be contracted at the same time. New gymnastics uses arm back vibration to straighten the chest. The purpose of its arm vibration is to help the chest protrude, completely relaxing with free movement, and only the muscles of the chest are contracted. In this way, the muscle contraction focuses solely on the active part, and the contraction of the muscles in the active part can reach its extreme.

E. In terms of value, since ball sports became popular in our country, gymnastics has long lost its place in sports. The reasons why people criticize it are nothing more than saying that its actions are rigid, cannot arouse the interest of learners, cannot cultivate flexible muscles, and cannot cope with sudden changes in the environment. Its amount of exercise is small, cannot adapt to physiological needs, and cannot achieve the purpose of fitness. These reasons are not without cause when considering the gymnastics methods of the past. But what about new gymnastics? Are its actions rigid? Its actions are continuous and rhythmic, and the adjustment of muscle tightness and relaxation cannot be called rigid. Is its amount of exercise small? Its new actions such as swinging, pulling, striking, kicking, vibrating, and interlacing, and various innovative new mining methods, make its amount of exercise increase many times compared with old gymnastics. It is indeed lively, interesting, has a large amount of exercise, and is a physical examination that meets people's physiological requirements. It is enough to break all criticisms and can replace ball sports. I hope that the people of the country will promote it.

(Note) - Detailed actions and style will be explained in another article.
