### The Great International Labor Day — May 1st —

May 1st, the great Labor Day, holds a glorious, heroic, rich, and combative history both worldwide and in China.

In 1884, American workers convened the Fourth Congress of the American Labor Federation in Chicago, resolving to implement an eight-hour workday by May 1, 1886, or else take direct revolutionary action.

By May 1, 1886, American workers, under the slogan of "Eight-Hour Workday," launched a nationwide strike. Bloody conflicts between workers and police occurred in Chicago and elsewhere, resulting in numerous worker casualties and deaths. Prominent leaders such as Spies were arrested and killed, igniting animosity and fighting spirit among workers throughout America and the world.

In 1889, the Second International convened its First Congress, formally designating May 1st as International Labor Day. From that year onward, the working masses worldwide fervently commemorated May Day, using this day to review their fighting strength, inspect workers and other toiling masses worldwide, demand improved treatment, oppose oppression and exploitation, and strive for socialism, drawing on past experiences and lessons. They fought for the eight-hour workday (as decided by the 1889 Congress), they fought for peace (as decided by the 1891 Congress), and they fought even more for socialism (as decided by the 1893 Congress).

Abroad, the working masses of various countries have commemorated May Day with increasing fervor over the past fifty-three years. Particularly noteworthy is the Russian working masses, who enthusiastically participated in May Day demonstrations and parades against the Tsarist government and the bourgeoisie since 1891. During the era of the European Great War, vast numbers of European laborers were deceived and used as cannon fodder in the imperialist war. Meanwhile, the Russian working masses even more vigorously launched their revolutionary struggle, holding May Day celebrations under the revolutionary Soviet regime from 1918 onward. With the advancement of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the Soviet working masses enthusiastically commemorate May Day every year. They have already realized a seven-hour or even shorter workday, and their labor is no longer for exploitation but for themselves! Their success has influenced the consolidation and expansion of the labor movement in capitalist countries worldwide, and this influence is now growing even greater. In China, with the influx of imperialist capital and the emergence of modern workers, they first commemorated May Day in 1918 (Year 7 of the Republic of China). By 1921 (Year 10 of the Republic of China), the Chinese working masses formally established their own vanguard force, their own political party, shouldering the dual task of the labor movement in semi-colonial China – the historical mission of social and national liberation. Immediately following the formation of the party, in 1923 (Year 12 of the Republic of China), a grand and vigorous May Day demonstration was held in Guangzhou, the base of the revolutionary strategy. On this very day, the First National Labor Congress was convened, establishing the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the highest leadership organ of Chinese workers.

May Day is not only a banner of solidarity for the working masses worldwide but also a banner of solidarity for the working masses of China. It not only guides workers towards the path of happiness in capitalist countries but also guides the working masses towards the path of liberation in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

However, commemorating the great May Day this year carries special and even greater significance and tasks. First, from a global perspective, the flames of fascist wars of aggression threaten workers and all of humanity. Therefore, the working masses worldwide commemorate this year's May Day by opposing fascist wars of aggression, launching an anti-aggression front to defend democracy and peace, and establishing collective security systems in Europe, America, and the Far East as the central slogan of May Day. We want the working masses worldwide to genuinely strive for this central slogan. To effectively oppose fascist wars of aggression, the first central task is for the working class and toiling masses worldwide to achieve unity in action, from trade union movements to workers' political parties. Only the power of the united front of the working class and all toiling masses worldwide can ultimately defeat the fascist aggressors, safeguard world peace and human civilization. Only by defeating the threat of fascist wars of aggression to all of humanity can workers and toiling masses achieve their thorough liberation.

Secondly, from the perspective of China, we must first recognize the characteristics of the current political situation, namely: (1) The large-scale war of aggression against China launched by Japanese imperialism has been underway for over twenty months. On one hand, this proves that the forces of the Japanese invasion are still present, and thus the liberation of China's toiling masses cannot be realized. On the other hand, it clarifies that if the toiling masses do not actively participate in the war of resistance and national reconstruction, then China's war of resistance against Japan cannot achieve final victory. (2) Over the past twenty months of resistance, our material consumption has reached alarming figures, while foreign material assistance has been hindered and will face even greater difficulties. Therefore, the importance of increasing production has become even more pronounced. (3) Our national unity in persisting in resistance has aroused sympathy and assistance from the working class and toiling masses worldwide, especially from the Soviet Union, the socialist homeland built by the working class themselves, and their movement to aid China and restrict Japan continues to expand. Organize workers and toiling masses, as much as possible and when necessary, arming the vast toiling masses. The declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang states: "The national revolutionary movement must have the participation of the broad masses, and the workers and peasants are particularly essential." The resolutions of the session also state: "Workers are the most important among the masses. If this is not considered, then the so-called mass base cannot be consolidated." Recently, the highest leader and the National Spiritual Mobilization have placed particular emphasis on the power of workers, hoping to effectively mobilize them. (2) It is necessary to effectively guarantee the freedom of the toiling masses to participate in the war of resistance and national salvation, encourage and give preferential treatment to overseas workers returning to the country to serve. The national and local worker or employee organizations should implement democratic principles as much as possible, and give full play to their enthusiasm and initiative in supporting the government leaders in intensifying production. (3) Promote necessary handicrafts, encourage overseas Chinese and friendly nations to actively invest in this industry, absorb a large number of unemployed and displaced toiling masses, and guarantee their spiritual and material life.

### Commemorations Filled with Bloodshed: May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ××

The tragic month of May, a day of remembrance never to be forgotten in the hearts of every Chinese person, is marked by commemorations filled with bloodshed – May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ×××××.

These memorial days are all humiliating marks branded on the Chinese nation by Japanese invaders!

Let's first talk about the "May 3rd" Massacre. This occurred in 1928 (Year 17 of the Republic of China) and was a prelude to the "September 18th" Incident. At that time, our National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition had recovered Lincheng and was advancing on Jinan when the Japanese Tanaka Cabinet decided to send troops to Shandong, dispatching 50 warships and 10,000 soldiers, commanded by the 18th Division Commander Fukuda. On April 29th, the Northern Expeditionary Army entered the city of Jinan, and Fukuda's interventionist troops also arrived in Jinan on the same day, confronting the Northern Expeditionary Army. On May 3rd, a battalion commander of the Northern Expeditionary Army wanted to pass through the Japanese military cordon in the city when he was suddenly shot and killed. Following this, the Japanese army carried out a large-scale massacre. They set up heavy artillery and machine guns at important intersections and on buildings in Jinan, firing intensely every few minutes, each time turning countless civilians and soldiers into masses of blood. At that time, Shandong's Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Gong Shishi, was brutally sacrificed because he refused the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side, having his eyes gouged out and his ears and nose cut off! Huang Fu, a pro-Japanese bureaucrat who sought to appease through humiliation, actually agreed to all the demands of the Japanese General Staff and executed the order for the Northern Expeditionary Army to immediately leave Jinan. Although the majority of revolutionary soldiers had joined forces with workers in the city and farmers in the suburbs to continue resisting, they eventually ran out of ammunition and withdrew on the morning of the 11th.

The May 3rd Jinan Massacre was a cruel scene where Japan used feudal warlords to aid reactionary corruption, using large-scale armed forces to block the vigorous development of our national revolution. Due to the implementation of submission, compromise, and concession at the time of the Jinan Massacre, the September 18th Incident occurred two years later, causing the tragedy of Japanese aggressors launching a large-scale attack on China. But at the same time, we must also recognize that the broad revolutionary soldiers, workers, and peasants had already launched a direct war of resistance against Japan at that time, and the student and citizen anti-Japanese national salvation movement subsequently developed dramatically throughout the country. If it had not encountered political resistance, the Japanese aggressors would have suffered a severe blow before September 18th.

Secondly, May 7th and May 9th occurred during the First World War. At that time, Japan ×× took advantage of the European countries being unable to look eastward ×× to first seize Germany's colonies in China, declaring war on Germany in August 1914, wantonly ravaging areas around Longkou, Laizhou, and Jiaozhou in our country. Three months later, it occupied Jiaozhou, controlled the Jiaoji Railway, and threatened our entire Shandong Province. At this time, Yuan Shikai, a feudal remnant manipulating the Beijing government, was plotting to eliminate the revolutionary forces led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and conspiring to restore the monarchy. Japanese ××, believing that only by helping China's reactionary forces could they realize their ambition to annex China, used "supporting Yuan's enthronement" as a condition and sent its ambassador to China to propose the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai on January 18, 1915 (Year 8 of the Republic of China). The demands included Shandong's rights, Japan's position in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia, the rights of the Hanyeping Company, special privileges over China's coastal territories, and even harsh demands on China's internal affairs, all of which were concrete methods to destroy China. At that time, Yuan Shikai half-heartedly bargained, and Japan ××, knowing Yuan Shikai's imperial dream, issued an ultimatum on May 7th, stating that all conditions except Article 5 concerning the Fujian operation agreement must be answered by May 9th. Yuan Shikai, who sought glory by selling out the country, completely agreed under threat and enticement. As a result, the entire country was in uproar, and anti-Yuan and anti-Japanese sentiments shook the country and overseas, vowing not to recognize the "Twenty-One Demands."

"May 7th" and "May 9th" were the first step in Japan's plan to destroy China. At that time, it used international turmoil, our country's feudal remnants, corrupt regimes, and national traitors who sought glory by selling out the country to help reactionary forces suppress the revolutionary national salvation movement. These tactics are still being used today, and they are becoming more ingenious and vicious, such as using Wang Jingwei and others' "anti-communist" and "peace" remarks and actions. When our revolutionary forces rise, their poisonous schemes will become even more rampant! It showed the great power of the working masses transitioning from economic struggle to political struggle. Although the Japanese's united front power was clearly dominant at the time, and we failed to truly unite the government, the army, and the broad masses of peasants, and win international assistance to further develop the struggle, leading to failure; but it had already united the working class, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, and in the continuous tenacious struggle, achieved practical results in economic resistance, and developed the victorious prospect of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927.

The tragic historical facts of May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ×××, and the experiences and lessons learned, indicate to us that in the current new and arduous stage of struggling for the success of the war of resistance and national salvation, we must more clearly recognize that Japanese imperialism is our only and greatest enemy, we must more clearly recognize that the broad masses of workers and peasants are the main force of the national revolution, and at the same time, we must also recognize the great significance of assisting the government's military strength and winning international sympathy and assistance. Therefore, our task in commemorating May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ××× this year is first to support the central government, to protect Generalissimo Chiang, and ××××××××××. We must promote the National Spiritual Mobilization, raise national self-esteem and self-confidence, overcome pessimistic and disappointed emotions, and eliminate peaceful compromise rhetoric and actions. The second is to consolidate national unity. We must closely cooperate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, consolidate and expand the unity of all ethnic groups, parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life in the country ××××××××××××××××. The third is to accelerate political progress. We must consolidate the leadership of the Kuomintang and the central government, develop the national economy, improve people's livelihoods ×××××, and promote democratic politics. Only by striving for political progress in the war of resistance can we thoroughly realize the Three Principles of the People and guarantee the success of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People after the war. Fourth, we must strive for international sympathy and assistance. We must strive for more and greater practical results from the anti-aggression front movement that develops and defends democracy and peace, and the international aid to China and restrict Japan movement.

Editorial

### Maintain and Develop the Momentum of the War of Resistance

Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek received reporters on the evening of the 24th, making remarks on military and political matters.

In the military aspect, the Generalissimo specifically pointed out: "The overall counter-offensive has not yet begun." The battles east of the Yuehan and Pinghan Railways should not focus on the gains and losses of one place or one city. He firmly believes that the enemy will find it difficult to hold out for long." These remarks severely corrected those who recently rediscovered the theory of quick victory. We must know that our strength in the war of resistance is indeed progressing daily, and the enemy's operations are indeed deteriorating daily. However, Japan is originally a superior imperialist nation, and we cannot inflict a fatal blow on the enemy with a counter-offensive in a day or two. Our current counter-offensive only strives to take the initiative, contain the enemy's new offensives, overcome the difficulties encountered in the stalemate phase, and facilitate all the preparations for the future overall counter-offensive. Therefore, we must not be negligent about the enemy's offensives, but also redouble our efforts to support our military actions to strive for the initiative and prevent the enemy's offensives. We must also intensify efforts to enhance the strength of the war of resistance, accelerate political progress, and increase the internal and international difficulties for the enemy, and then we can smoothly launch the overall counter-offensive.

In the political aspect, Generalissimo Chiang focused on political training, especially the reform of lower-level administrative institutions, hoping to bring local party and government affairs into a new track, and establish a foundation for democratic centralism, self-defense, and autonomy. This has the same importance as the military counter-offensives on various battlefields. Because whether it is to stop the enemy's offensives or to prepare for the future overall counter-offensive, both rely on the enhancement of the combat effectiveness of the forward troops, the development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and the cultivation of new forces in the rear, and all of these rely on the mobilization of the broad masses. The precise realization of mass mobilization relies on political progress, mainly improving lower-level administrative institutions and the work of the Party. The first step is to remove obstacles to mass mobilization, and on the other hand, give the masses as much democracy and freedom as possible, and give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses to participate in all war of resistance and national reconstruction work. The first step is to establish local public opinion organs as soon as possible, and then intensify the organization and training of the masses, and arm the peasants and workers as much as possible.

The victories of the counter-offensives on various battlefields have already achieved considerable success. First, they have ruthlessly struck the conspiracies of Wang Jingwei and others and the arguments for the failure of the war of resistance politically, boosting the people's confidence in the victory of the war of resistance, raising the attacking spirit of the front-line soldiers, and further exciting international figures' optimistic sympathy and determination to help our country's war of resistance prospects. Secondly, militarily, they have realized "offensive defense," realized "seizing the initiative," realized the prevention and attack of the enemy's new offensives. The overall war of resistance situation has indeed achieved a dominant and advantageous position!

However, we must also recognize that the enemy's advantages have not been completely lost, the enemy's offensive power has not suffered a fatal blow, and they still have the power to coordinate political anti-communist and equalitarian conspiracies, and launch new offensives militarily. Moreover, they have already launched such offensives, mainly aimed at the offensive against Changsha and the threat to Fuzhou and Chaozhou, with the primary goal of opening up the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways and consolidating the occupied areas in East and Southeast China. Therefore, we must not only maintain and develop the dominant position of the current "offensive defense" on various front lines with redoubled efforts, but also launch large-scale guerrilla warfare in the rear of the enemy with redoubled efforts, contain and weaken the enemy, preventing them from advancing and penetrating further. At the same time, we must also prepare new and greater forces, such as establishing new armies, expanding the air force, and developing mechanized units, to prepare for the future overall counter-offensive.

All of these fundamentally require greater political progress and greater diplomatic success. The highest leader has a clear understanding and active effort on this point. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's talk on the 24th, which emphasizes the reform of lower-level political institutions and the establishment of a democratic foundation, truly makes people more confident and pleased with the future of war of resistance and national reconstruction. We hope that the whole country will unanimously support Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's great plan to promote greater political progress. We must promote closer cooperation between the various parties, more full and universal implementation of the Three Principles of the People's democratic politics, more resolute and thorough anti-compromise and anti-traitor movements such as the anti-Wang movement, and then promote the mass mobilization and organization work, which began with the National Spiritual Mobilization, to be broader and more lasting, and coordinate it with the promotion of national defense construction, economic construction, and diplomatic work, and the launching of work against the enemy army. If we can intensify these work steps, then we will surely be able to shorten the transition period, and overcome the difficulties of the stalemate phase, increase the enemy's difficulties, and advance the arrival of the comprehensive overall counter-offensive.

### Glorious Commemoration of the Revolutionary Teacher - May 5th

May is filled with a bloody atmosphere of battle. May 5th also leaves us with painful memories: The first is the humiliating "Shanghai Truce Agreement" of May 5th, 1932 (Year 21 of the Republic of China), caused by the failure to support the "January 28th" Battle to the end. The second is the humiliating Tanggu Truce Agreement of May 5th, 1934, caused by the failure to support the Great Wall Resistance to the end. These agreements have lost their validity today, but our painful experiences and important lessons are still fresh.

In addition to these painful memories, we should propose, with enthusiasm and encouragement: ×××××revolutionary×××××glory××××××. First, on May 5th, 1921 (Year ×× of the Republic), the tenth year after the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, the first Provisional President of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen, again assumed the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou, re-establishing the foundation of the Southern Revolutionary Regime. Second, one hundred and twenty-one years ago, on May 5, 1818, a world-renowned figure was born in Europe, the creator of scientific socialism, the teacher of the proletarian revolution, and the ardent advocate of the liberation movement of oppressed nations—Karl Marx.

Our commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen assuming the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou is of great significance today, because Mr. Sun's action had a very important effect on the Chinese Revolution. After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Mr. Sun renamed the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Shanghai to the "Chinese Kuomintang," taking "Consolidating the Republic and Implementing the Three Principles of the People" as its political program, and also wrote the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" and founded the "Construction" magazine. After assuming the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou on May 5, 1921, ××××××××××××××××××××Mr. Sun personally went to Guangxi to prepare for the Northern Expedition, and in Guangxi, he met with M.I. Manuilsky, the representative of the Communist International. Next, in 1922, the Soviet representative Joffe came to China and signed the "Sun-Joffe Manifesto"××××××××××××××××××××. The Chinese Kuomintang began a thorough reorganization from 1923 to 1924. In the autumn of that year, Mr. Sun gathered progressive revolutionary figures (including Chen Duxiu) in Shanghai to draft a reorganization plan for the Kuomintang, and on January 1, 1923, he published the Kuomintang Declaration, defining the revolutionary direction for the future. The main points were: (1) revising unequal treaties to restore China's free and equal status in the international community; (2) implementing a universal suffrage system, abolishing class elections based on property standards; (3) affirming the people's absolute freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief; (4) formulating a workers' protection law to improve the living conditions of laborers, improving rural organizations, improving farmers' lives, and affirming the equality of women and men; and (5) the state formulates land law, the use of land law and land value tax law. In October 1923, the Kuomintang published a reorganization declaration and began to implement the reorganization movement. The Kuomintang Provisional Central Executive Committee was established in Guangzhou, and Borodin was hired as a consultant. Immediately afterwards, the Kuomintang held its First National Congress in Guangzhou on January 20, 1924, to discuss: (1) reorganizing the Kuomintang, passing the new political program, the new party constitution, and the declaration; (2) passing the plan to establish the National Government; (3) allowing the Communist Party and the Socialist Youth League to join the Kuomintang. As a result of the Congress, a clear political program was established for the Kuomintang, taking ××××××××××××××××warlords as the central task of the struggle, and taking alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and support for farmers and workers as its policies.

Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen assuming the position of Extraordinary President, as we look back at Guangzhou, which has become a haunted region, we cannot but recall the wise men of the past. We must sincerely accept the Three Principles of the People left to us by Mr. Sun, and implement the central task of solving China's problems - the task of striving for national independence, civil rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness. We must sincerely follow the three major policies left to us by Mr. Sun, consolidating the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the unity of all China, consolidating Sino-Soviet cooperation and the unity of democratic and peaceful countries around the world, and earnestly implement the policy of supporting farmers and workers, mobilizing the power of farmers and workers to support the great cause of war of resistance and national reconstruction. At the same time, we must inherit Mr. Sun's spirit of never reconciling and never compromising with the anti-revolutionary forces.

Regarding Marx's greatness, Lenin and Mr. Sun Yat-sen both gave clear explanations. Lenin said: "All the genius of Marxism lies in the fact that it answered the questions already raised by human progressive thought. His theory is the direct continuation of the philosophies, political economics, and the great representatives of socialism's theories." Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Marx's writings and the theories he invented can be said to be the culmination of thousands of years of human thought."

The great works of scientific socialism left to us by Marx are just like the Three Principles of the People and the three major policies left to us by Sun Yat-sen. In this difficult and dangerous stage of the eve of the transition to victory in the overall war of resistance, we must accept them with the greatest enthusiasm, study them, use them to arm our minds, and seek correct social science knowledge. At present, we must redouble our efforts in the study of Marxism, draw lessons and experience from the international workers' movement, cooperate with the practice of national reconstruction movement, and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the construction of the "Republic of China - Freedom, Equality, Fraternity."

For a long time, the enemy dared not retaliate. Returning to our front line, the reporter saw the soldiers standing tall in the wind. Although the reporter was new to the battlefield, they also felt a surge of heroic ambition to kill the enemy, deeply feeling that the enemy was not at all to be feared. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the local people nearby were farming as usual and even arming themselves to help the defending forces protect their homes. Even women were responsible for transportation and destroying roads. The harmonious relationship between the military and the people and their cooperative spirit are something that can only be imagined by those who have not been there.

### Nanchang Battles Have No Impact; Unobstructed Traffic Between Zhejiang and Guangxi; Jiangxi Province Opens New Route Directly to Hunan and Guangxi; Enemy Attempt to Cut Off Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Fails

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guilin, 27th] Although the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been temporarily interrupted due to the spread of the war, traffic between Zhejiang and Guangxi has not been obstructed. The authorities had made preparations in advance and opened a new route starting from a certain place in Jiangxi Province, connecting the provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangxi. Most of the original vehicles from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have been withdrawn to the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, so passenger trains have had to reduce the number of trips, changing from four times a day to twice a day. The route has also been shortened, with Jinhua as the terminal in Zhejiang and XXX as the terminal in Jiangxi. The enemy's attempt to isolate Zhejiang and Anhui by cutting off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has completely failed.

According to Lieutenant Sakamoto in an interview with reporters, military leaders and financial cliques should be overthrown. The Japanese people do not want to fight and have no freedom in their lives. In the long-term war of resistance, final victory will surely belong to China.

### Counterfeit Money Continues to Depreciate; Legal Tender Rises Steadily

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] News from Beiping reports that in recent days, the banknotes of the "North China Reserve Bank" have continued to depreciate, while at the same time, Chinese legal tender has risen uniformly. In the last period of six months, every 100 yuan of counterfeit money could be exchanged for legal tender of 17 yuan. Yesterday, the discount increased again to 25.5 yuan per 100 yuan.

[Reuters, Beiping, 27th] The price of "North China Reserve Bank" notes depreciated further today. When exchanged with Chinese legal tender, a discount of 30.5% is required. The previous discount prices rose from 17% to 21%, 25.5%, and now have even reached 30.5%.

[Shanghai Correspondence] After the Ministry of Finance borrowed 10 million pounds from British banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chinese banks such as Bank of Communications and others, it established a Balance Fund Management Committee. The value of legal tender has become more stable, and foreign exchange reserves have become more abundant. The entire financial situation is becoming more stable, further strengthening the war of resistance, and benefiting trade with China from various countries. The details are as follows:

Legal Tender Issuance Policy

The legal tender issuance policy of the four major banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, is particularly cautious. The total issuance in June 1937 was 1.4 billion yuan, and in June 1938, it was 1.727 billion yuan, an increase of 300 million yuan. Some people consider this an example of currency inflation. However, in reality, after the center of the war of resistance shifted inland, provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan switched to using legal tender. Commercial credit contracted and switched to cash transactions. The proliferation of counterfeit currency in the occupied areas increased the hoarding of legal tender. Commodity supply and demand imbalances led to rising prices, increasing the need for banknotes. These are all reasons for the necessary increase in legal tender issuance. Shanghai, on the other hand, has a sense of aversion to currency contraction, such as the increase in remittance rates. Therefore, the government has not excessively issued legal tender and has been able to maintain the value of legal tender at a stable level.

People's Confidence and Ample Reserves

After the legal tender policy was implemented, the people unanimously expressed their confidence. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the value of legal tender has been closely related to the increase or decrease of individual wealth, generating an especially enthusiastic atmosphere. Apart from a very small number of mad speculators, no one does not want the foundation of legal tender to be solid, benefiting both the country and themselves. Everyone considers it shameful to exchange legal tender for foreign currency. The cash reserves of legal tender have always been above 60%. Our US dollar reserves in the United States, as of the end of last June, were estimated to be 84 million US dollars. In addition to these foreign exchange reserves, the value of legal tender in foreign exchange will likely remain within the current exchange rate range without huge fluctuations. The remaining silver reserves in the country can be used to increase the legal tender reserves by 200 million yuan, while maintaining the current foreign exchange rate for more than two years.

Effective Management and Improved Trade

The Central Bank's management of foreign exchange affairs ensures that legitimate commercial needs are met, while those who attempt to evade foreign exchange controls are not approved. The gate for capital flight is closed. Foreign exchange earned from export trade is sold to government banks at the legal exchange rate, reducing imports of foreign goods and achieving trade balance. Coupled with the government's vigorous promotion of wartime frugality, there have been months with trade surpluses. At the same time, overseas Chinese, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, have increased remittances, preventing drastic fluctuations in our international balance of payments. This has a powerful, although indirect, effect on maintaining the value of legal tender.

Chinese and Foreign Banks Help Maintain Stability

In times of war, maintaining financial stability in our country is an indispensable strategy. The friendly foreign banks' joint efforts to maintain foreign exchange stability are also a well-known fact. Each time the foreign exchange market experiences fluctuations, Chinese and foreign banks immediately provide large amounts of foreign exchange, resulting in a renewed trend toward stability in the value of legal tender. In October of last year, when Guangzhou and Wuhan successively fell, the legal tender exchange market was not affected in the slightest. Furthermore, funds fleeing to Hong Kong flowed back to Shanghai, causing the legal tender exchange rate to rise instead. The Japanese and puppet regimes' attempts to destroy the legal tender plan ultimately failed. Legal tender still circulates within the occupied areas, and its value remains above that of counterfeit money.

### Outline of Propaganda for Guerrilla Areas (3) Issued by the Political Department of the Military Commission

(Sixteen) Broadly publicize and explain the articles of the "Public Agreement on Military-Civilian Cooperation" formulated by this department, ensuring that the military and civilians abide by them consistently, so as to "fully establish the crucial element of our victory over the aggressors."

(B) Key Points for Propaganda Directed at Troops in the War Zone

(1) Abide by Chairman Chiang's instruction: "The second phase of the War of Resistance is when we shift from defense to offense, and turn defeat into victory." Highlight the characteristics of the second strategic phase, explaining that the second phase of operations follows the exhaustion and weakening of the enemy in the first phase, and is the period to "shift from defense to offense and realize the dream of destroying the aggressors and causing them to fail (Chairman Chiang's words)" after "the completion of all arrangements in our strategic plan to strive for final victory (Chairman Chiang's words)" to achieve final victory.

(2) Regular troops stationed behind enemy lines must dispatch small units when necessary to engage in guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla units that grow and expand in the war zone can also assemble several detachments to form regular troops. There is no absolute boundary between the two. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that both sides understand the need to mutually learn the functions necessary for each other.

(3) The war zone in the second phase of the War of Resistance is even larger, the front lines are even longer, transportation is even more difficult, and the enemy's forces are even more dispersed, inevitably leading to a situation where they cannot attend to everything. This provides us with many exploitable gaps. Therefore, in our operations, we must strengthen the coordination and communication of operations on all sides, and strive to cultivate a spirit of love and mutual assistance between troops and friendly forces to ensure the victory of our operations.

(4) Military operations without the help of the people rarely achieve victory. Troops remaining behind enemy lines, especially guerrilla units, must rely on the love, support, and backing of the people. Therefore, troops in the war zone must have good discipline. "Based on the experiences in various places during the first phase of the War of Resistance, as long as the government has good methods for seeking the cooperation of the people, the people invariably comply gladly. It is clear that only the troops can fail the people, not the people the troops (Minister's words)." Therefore, political workers in units behind enemy lines must publicize and explain more, and infinitely improve the troops' automatic political discipline and military discipline.

(A) Political Discipline: Ensure that the unit, when stationed in a locality, (1) publicizes during entries and exits, (2) cleans up after fighting, (3) returns borrowed items, (4) compensates for losses, (5) engages in fair trade, (6) speaks politely, (7) strictly observes all regulations of the New Life Movement, and (8) respects good folk customs, so that the people do not dislike the troops and strive to realize the principle of "service is propaganda," earnestly help the people solve difficulties, serve the people, and win the goodwill of the people.

(B) Military Discipline: Absolutely obey superiors and strictly execute orders. Cultivate the habit of "officers and soldiers valuing orders more than life." Endure hardship and be industrious, always manage and care for subordinates, be loving and helpful to friendly forces, be diligent and study at all times, and cultivate the ability to exert "everyone fighting on their own" in difficult circumstances. Cherish bullets, firearms, livestock, tools, and so on.

(5) Troops in the war zone should assume the task of establishing and consolidating revolutionary political power and organizing the revolutionary masses. Therefore, they must adhere to the principle of "propaganda is education," cultivate cadres, and ensure that every officer and soldier can become a propagandist and organizer of the masses. Based on their acquired knowledge and skills, they should publicize, educate, and organize the masses in order to expand the effect of political work and consolidate our political power.

(6) Troops in the war zone, especially guerrilla units, frequently operate behind enemy lines. The enemy will certainly use all sorts of methods to "suppress" us and use divisive, coercive, and enticing tactics to disintegrate us. Therefore, every combatant or other worker must be constantly educated about the certainty of victory in the War of Resistance, raising their cultural level, constantly correcting their incorrect concepts and views, and constantly enlightening them to have a correct understanding.

(7) For scattered soldiers and stragglers scattered in the war zone, and even vagrants and bandits, we must find ways to take them in and use propaganda and education methods to persuade and educate them, so that they get on the right track and are not exploited by the enemy.

(8) Cooperate with the people to eliminate traitors and enemy spies. Those who can turn over a new leaf and no longer work for the enemy should be allowed to surrender in accordance with the government's promulgated measures for traitors to surrender themselves, and be exempted from punishment.

(C) Key Points for Propaganda Directed at the People in the War Zone: In addition to the outline of propaganda for the people of the whole country and the common propaganda points mentioned above, the following items must be noted in the propaganda directed at the people in the war zone:

(1) First, always reveal the specific facts of the enemy officials' deceptive behavior and conspiracies to incite the people's hatred for the enemy. In particular, always point out (preferably using examples of our victory over the enemy) the enemy's crises and weaknesses, eliminate the people's fear of the enemy, and encourage the people to help destroy the enemy's transportation, disrupt all of the enemy's political, economic, and cultural measures, and even join guerrilla units to fight the enemy. We must educate the people through practical work.

(2) We must awaken the people behind enemy lines, raise their vigilance, and not be deceived or anesthetized by the enemy. (1) Do not attend schools or various training courses run by the enemy and traitors. Do not read newspapers, magazines, and all propaganda materials published by the enemy and traitors. And mobilize various teachers to lead their students in the war zone to resist the enemy's puppet missionaries, in order to crush the enemy and traitors' enslavement education policy. (2) Do not believe the enemy's false propaganda. After understanding the enemy's deceptive propaganda, you should tell others so that they will not be deceived again, in order to crush the enemy's 麻醉 policy. (3) Promote the New Life Movement and prohibit bad habits such as the use of drugs (such as morphine and white powder) and prostitution in order to crush the enemy's cultural policy.

(3) Publicize to the people the practice and preparation for the "empty city strategy."

(4) Helping the people build culture in the war zone means helping the people in the place of residence restore and build schools, establish literacy classes, etc., in order to improve the culture in the war zone and eliminate illiteracy. The main goal is to improve the people's national consciousness, cultivate service habits, encourage the spirit of sacrifice, and fulfill the mission of national spiritual mobilization.

(5) Vigorously promote increased production and long-term improvement of the people's lives to increase the strength of the long-term War of Resistance. Political workers should lead the troops to help the people with production labor in their spare time, thoroughly implementing the principle of "service is propaganda" in order to expand the impact of propaganda.

(6) For military service propaganda, attention should be paid to the environment of the war zone. Conscription is not easy to carry out in the war zone. We should encourage the people to volunteer and join the army or guerrilla units in order to achieve the purpose of military service propaganda. (7) We should cultivate many passionate young cadres in propaganda and education to supplement and expand our military and political strength in the war zone.

(D) Key Points for Propaganda Directed at the Enemy and Puppet Forces

(1) Propaganda work directed at the enemy is a direct attack on the enemy in political warfare. It attacks the enemy from the spiritual aspect, shaking their will to fight, disintegrating their morale, and promoting the trend that is beginning of anti-war mutinies and awakening to the truth. Its effect is sometimes three times greater than the effect of operations.

(2) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, propaganda directed at the enemy is not only more necessary, but also has a greater possibility of being carried out smoothly. First, the war of aggression is not for the benefit of the entire people, but for the benefit of a small number of privileged classes, that is, a small number of ambitious military leaders (the violent factions within the military), a small number of greedy financial groups (the capitalists of the military industry), and some bureaucratic politicians and shameless writers. Even within the military leaders and financial groups, there are often open and covert struggles due to uneven distribution of spoils. At the same time, the people of Japan also resent the tyranny of the military and are engaging in anti-war struggles. This provides us with space to carry out propaganda directed at the enemy. Second, because of China's heroic War of Resistance, the Japanese warlords' strategy of a "quick war and quick victory" and their conspiracy of a "quick end to the war" have failed. The indefinite extension of the war has made Japan internationally isolated, financially troubled, economically depressed, and the people's burden has become heavier and their lives have become more difficult. Therefore, the people's anti-war sentiment and the soldiers' war-weariness are increasing day by day. This facilitates our carrying out of propaganda directed at the enemy.

### British Conscription Bill Submitted to the House of Commons for Debate Chamberlain Explains Reasons for Implementation To Cope with Tense Situation in Europe

[Reuters, London, 26th] The House of Commons will debate the government's proposal tomorrow, which is to implement compulsory military training to safeguard national security and cope with the situation in Europe. At the same time, the government is seeking new powers to limit the profits of arms factories and prevent individuals from amassing great wealth from the war. After holding a special meeting in the House of Commons, the Labor Party decided to propose the following amendment: "Although the British government has taken the necessary steps to seek national security and fulfill international obligations, the House of Commons expresses regret over the government's destruction of the principle of voluntary service, as this move is not unable to supply the manpower needed for national defense." The Liberal Party has also drafted a similar amendment.

[Reuters, London, 26th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent said that most members of the House of Commons expressed relief at the government's announcement of conscription. The opposition Liberal Party will minimize criticism of the government as much as possible. The Labor Party will remain silent except for the opinions expressed in the House of Commons, and wait for the government bill to be submitted tomorrow. As for the general political situation, the scope of national efforts has been expanded, so it is not surprising if Chamberlain expands the basis of the cabinet.

[Reuters, London, 26th] Chamberlain explained the decision to implement conscription in the House of Commons today, saying that national mobilization should be carried out during wartime, but the current situation is still extremely unstable, so it seems appropriate to take certain defensive steps, while avoiding causing major disturbances to the country due to the mobilization order. Therefore, the government authorities decided to propose a reserve and supplementary service bill, on the one hand, to simplify the procedure, and on the other hand, to enable the government to authorize various military agencies to summon reserves and supplementary service members of any year to enlist after receiving an order from the cabinet meeting. This bill is a temporary measure, and it is hoped that Congress will speedily pass it so that the government can implement it. European governments all have this power, and at the same time, some are using this power to partially mobilize. Chamberlain also said that the guarantees we recently provided to certain countries and the discussions with foreign governments that are still in progress are not to engage in war, but to prevent war. Since we keep this purpose in mind, we have to adopt the opinions of democratic countries, especially friendly European countries, and think that we should strive to expand our military. However, if Britain can accept the principle of compulsory military service, this is almost the normal situation on the European continent, then the determination to resist armed dictatorship can be made clear to the world. Is it not a major weakness of the voluntary service system if we see neighboring countries actively training and preparing for war, while we are still at peace? I also thought that compulsory conscription would not be implemented in peacetime, so I have repeatedly stated the promise made by Baldwin that compulsory conscription would not be proposed in peacetime during this parliamentary session. Although there is no war yet, all countries are exhausting their financial resources to prepare for war. Everyone knows that war is inevitable. The dividing line between so-called peacetime and wartime is getting closer. The government's conclusion is that in order to cope with the above-mentioned new and exceptional circumstances, the step of compulsory military training has become necessary for the time being. I say temporarily because I want to state that the government's recommendation in the military training bill will be temporary. The bill will designate three years, but it can be terminated by cabinet order. Conversely, if it is unanimously passed by the House of Commons after three years, it can be extended for another year. The bill will be submitted next week. The competent departments are currently secretly studying the prices of ordnance in order to determine the fairest profit. The government believes that private individuals should never profit from wartime when a major war breaks out. " Opposition Labor Party leader Attlee asked Chamberlain whether he was aware that the government's decision had broken its promise. Attlee said that this would not only increase expenditure, but also lead to class divisions and face fierce opposition. Attlee even had opposition members boo and shout "Chamberlain resign!" In response, the Prime Minister said that he felt clear in his conscience, and that he firmly believed that the people of the world, if they could put themselves in his shoes, would admit that we are not in a peaceful environment. Chamberlain also said that he would submit the issue tomorrow for open debate. Sinclair asked the Prime Minister why he did not consult with the opposition and labor unions before suddenly changing his promise. Chamberlain replied that the world had changed so rapidly that it was not intentional to ignore or disrespect the opposition.

### United States Relieved Believes Britain Prepared to Defend the Country Guarantee European Democracy

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] Diplomatic circles here are relieved by Britain's implementation of conscription, believing that it has supplemented its past verbal opposition to aggression. Senator King said, "Britain's implementation of conscription shows Hitler and the Nazi and Fascist sides that Britain is prepared to defend its country and guarantee democracy in Europe."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The official impression here of Britain's move to implement conscription is quite good, believing that it can prompt small countries to adhere to British and French policies. At the same time, any country that intends to launch an aggressive action against other countries can delay the action because of this. Diplomats said that this move is unprecedented in Britain, and it is different from the past when they merely exhorted authoritarian countries with empty words. Impartial observers believe that the European situation in general is slightly worse than before, as can be seen from Hitler's refusal to meet with the British ambassador. At the same time, Hitler's inquiries to various countries, most of which stated that they were not threatened, were favorable to Germany. Therefore, his speech tomorrow may be more firm. Democratic Senator King said that the European democratic forces should find ways to strengthen their determination to fight for democracy.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] After Britain decided to implement conscription, people from all walks of life in the United States expressed dissatisfaction. Everyone is concerned that if the countries in Europe attempt to use force to change the situation in the future, Britain has decided to use all methods to resist it. This can be clearly demonstrated by the country's implementation of conscription. Moreover, this is a sign that Britain is determined to abandon its advisory policy. The security guarantees recently provided by Britain and France to small countries in Europe will be more trusted by the small countries because of this.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Newspapers here have not yet criticized Britain's decision to implement conscription, and will probably wait until the British constituencies and self-governing colonies express any reaction before commenting. Prime Minister Chamberlain's reasons for adopting conscription at this time is that he believes that it is not a time of peace. This will undoubtedly cause his efforts to make all sectors of the country sacrifice for the country in the same way. American newspapers have recently paid close attention to the alleged discovery of improper profiteering in Britain's rearmament and air defense facilities. The US Congress is also planning to take various measures to take away the profits obtained by merchants from the war and to concentrate resources and personnel in the event of war. Many people speculate that the British people will also follow suit and demand the same measures from their government.

### French Comments A Diplomatic Victory for Daladier Polish Political Circles Unanimously Praise

[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] The newspapers here regard Britain's adoption of conscription as a major diplomatic victory for Daladier. The whole country is delighted, believing that this is a true ultimatum to Hitler. Daladier has repeatedly urged Britain to adopt conscription and take responsibility since the middle of last month. At present, the union of Britain and France has increased its strength by 10 million people.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The "Debate" newspaper here believes that Chamberlain's announcement of Britain's implementation of conscription is "an extremely important event." Also, "The Times" stated, "Britain's decision to conscript today and its budget speech yesterday both show that Britain is fulfilling its responsibilities to itself and the international community with all its spiritual and material strength. If Germany believes that Britain's adoption of conscription is a provocation, then it is a serious mistake."

[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] After Britain implemented conscription, French officials all expressed extreme satisfaction. This is an unprecedented move in British history. Through this move, all countries that uphold independence and territorial integrity and are threatened have automatically accepted Britain's guarantee of obligations. This decision to implement conscription will show its determination to fulfill its obligations.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 26th] After the British cabinet decided to implement conscription, Polish politicians unanimously praised it, saying that this is the first sound of Britain's implementation of a new policy.

### Anglo-German Relations Germany Believes It Is More Difficult to Improve Italy Attaches Importance to British Conscription

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson visited the German Foreign Ministry today to inform the German authorities of the British government's determination to implement conscription.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] Newspapers here unanimously denounced Britain's decision to adopt conscription as absurd. The headline of the "Extraordinary Evening Post" was, "The British's New Language to Germany - Chamberlain's Ridiculous Threat - Britain Announces Limited Conscription."

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] Political circles here believe that the British government's decision to conscript is enough to increase the tension of the current situation, especially the Anglo-German relations, which are more difficult to improve. Hitler will give a speech on Friday, presenting Germany's response to the incident. Some believe that British conscription cannot be immediately regarded as having military significance, and should be regarded as a gesture. The German press described Britain's decision as a weak threat, which had no impact on Germany.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 26th] The British chargé d'affaires visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon and formally informed him of Britain's decision to implement conscription. Political circles here commented that Britain's move had no practical effect, and that the country's army lacked staff and will remain insignificant for the next few years. If a war were to break out at this moment, the existing balance of power in Europe would not be changed by this.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] Italy is deeply impressed by Britain's determination to implement conscription, confirming that this move indicates that Britain is prepared to adhere to its resolute attitude and will no longer yield. Newspapers mostly believe that the move is the result of France's urging.

[Associated Press, Rome, 27th] Britain's decision to adopt conscription is taken very seriously here. People here admit that Britain is prepared to take a tough stance and no longer make concessions. Newspapers unanimously said that the British government's move was entirely due to pressure from France, not the public opinion of the British people.

### United States Expanding Air Force Secretary of War Signs Contract with Manufacturers Thompson Advocates Abolishing Neutrality Law

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Roosevelt today requested Congress to allocate 32 million US dollars from the 66,800,000 US dollars in the naval aircraft base construction fee bill to start the construction of naval aircraft bases.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The Air Force Expansion Act has been signed into law by President Roosevelt. The main points stipulate the construction of 3,532 aircrafts with 372,000,000 US dollars, so as to increase the total number of army aircraft to 6,000. Assistant Secretary of War Johnson recently ordered 571 aircrafts from various aircraft factories in accordance with this law, requiring a total of 50,000,000 US dollars. According to the number of orders placed by the Department of the Army with various factories at one time over the years, this is the largest ever.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Secretary of War Johnson signed a contract with five aircraft manufacturers today to implement the plan to increase the number of army warplanes to 6,000. The value of the contract is 50 million US dollars. Johnson also said that the contract signed today is the largest in the history of the air force.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Political commentator Thompson was invited yesterday to express his views on the Neutrality Act to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He advocated abolishing the Neutrality Act so that the United States could maintain the greatest freedom when adopting military legislation or diplomatic actions to deal with international issues. He also said that if we ignore the world situation, it is tantamount to inviting the scourge of aggression. The current Neutrality Act is not neutral.

Hitler

[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] According to reliable sources, Hitler has notified Ribbentrop, Goebbels, and Goering that his speech in Parliament tomorrow will formally reject Roosevelt's proposal. It is understood that Hitler will also make a general response to the smaller countries that have replied to his questions.

The draft of Hitler's speech has been completed and is now being translated into English, French, and Italian. The entire process will last an hour and a half. It is understood that Hitler will elaborate on the following key points in his speech: (1) That Nazi Germany's policies for the past six years have been entirely devoted to the struggle for world peace, and has repeatedly proposed disarmament, the signing of non-aggression pacts, and the protection of international borders; (2) That the Treaty of Versailles is an "enemy of world peace," and that the United States' persistent insistence on maintaining this treaty is inappropriate; (3) That Roosevelt's proposal is a degeneration of President Wilson's Fourteen Points, a product of the Washington Conference, and now merely "waste paper." Roosevelt's actions are "abnormal"; (4) That Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia was in accordance with the wishes of the Czech people, and that only by annexing Czechoslovakia can peace in Europe be maintained; (5) To clarify that no foreigners may interfere with Germany's implementation of all domestic and foreign policies; (6) To urge Roosevelt, before interfering in German policy, to first address the internal disputes in the United States. "Stabilizing bandits and relieving unemployment" are the key tasks for the United States; (7) To condemn Roosevelt's proposal to guarantee the borders of 31 countries as "selfish" and disregarding Germany's "legitimate" demands for colonies and commercial development; (8) To reiterate that Germany has no intention of attacking others, but to express that Germany is prepared to resist any country that aids the Soviet Union or forms an alliance with the Soviet Union; (9) To claim that the United States has not contributed to world peace, and that it is Germany, not Roosevelt, that truly maintains world peace; (10) In conclusion, to state that Roosevelt's failure to weave a net against the scourge of communism makes him an "enemy of culture."

### European Situation Gradually Worsening: British Ambassador Not Received by German Foreign Minister; France Notifies Germany to Resist Threats

[Reuters, London, 27th] Today in the British House of Commons, a member asked whether the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, will meet with the German Foreign Minister, Ribbentrop, before Hitler's speech. Chamberlain replied that a senior official from the German Foreign Office has already met with Henderson, but meeting with the German Foreign Minister is very difficult to arrange. However, Henderson is expected to meet with Ribbentrop. Labor member Berenjoe said that the German Foreign Minister cannot receive Henderson due to lack of time, is this to embarrass him? Chamberlain replied that he did not think so, as the German Foreign Minister is indeed very busy due to the visit of the Yugoslav Foreign Minister. When asked whether Henderson carried important documents to the German government, Chamberlain said that the government has not instructed Henderson to make any proposals to the German government. "We believe that the ambassador should return to his post and report the development of our diplomatic policy to the German government," he said.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] British Ambassador Henderson was recently forced to hand his diplomatic note to the Foreign Ministry Secretary, Mr. Huick, without being received by the German Foreign Minister.

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] Opinions from observers in China indicate that the situation has slightly worsened today due to Hitler's refusal to meet with the British Ambassador. It is generally believed that Hitler is satisfied with the answers he received from various smaller countries, so Hitler's speech on Friday may take a tough stance.

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] According to reports, the French Ambassador to Germany has been ordered to notify the German Foreign Minister that France fully supports Roosevelt's peace proposal, and has expressed that France has no intention of encircling Germany, but in order to maintain the status quo, France and the allied countries are still prepared to respond to all threats.

Condemns Totalitarian States

[Reuters, New York, 27th] U.S. Interior Secretary Ickes stated in a speech to the American Culture Freedom Association today that we warmly welcome German scientists, artists, and writers who are now residing in the United States as deeply cultured and civilized figures.

[Reuters, Rome, 26th] Italian leader Mussolini has scheduled a cabinet meeting for the morning of Saturday of this week.

Brief Commentary

### Anti-British Sentiment in Occupied Areas

The Reuters dispatch from Peiping of the 27th states: "The anti-British movement in various parts of North China has not subsided. According to Japanese reports, even Inner Mongolia has anti-British rallies, and the main anti-British propagandists are Japanese. At the same time, foreign reporters who opened were also present yesterday to witness the acting governor of the puppet province appointed by the Japanese deliver a speech vehemently attacking Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Most noteworthy is that the Japanese did not invite British reporters to tour Kaifeng with the German reporters. According to eyewitnesses, the speech held by the acting governor was typed by a Japanese typewriter."

Japan's widespread instigation of anti-British movements in the militarily occupied areas did not begin today, but recently it has become increasingly intense. What we should pay attention to today are the following points: (1) This anti-British movement is purely planned by the Japanese and has nothing to do with China, even our compatriots in the occupied areas oppose it. (2) In addition to Japanese planning, although it also involves France and the Soviet Union, it only attacks Britain. This is undoubtedly to avoid friction with the United States in order to continue obtaining supplies of military materials from the United States for the Japanese military.

Japan's expansion of anti-British sentiment in the occupied areas has the following main purposes: (1) To undermine the friendship between China and the United States; (2) To undermine the solidarity of democratic and peaceful countries; (3) To threaten Britain and make it stop the aid-China movement; (4) To coerce and lure Britain to negotiate with Japan and mediate the Sino-Japanese war, pressuring China to yield.

In this regard, we should expand propaganda and mobilize public opinion to point out Japan's conspiracy, and point out that only by strengthening aid to China and only by China's victory in the war of resistance can we effectively guarantee Britain's interests in China and even the entire Far East; any policy of compromise will only help Japan to further recklessly threaten. Britain is currently launching an anti-aggression front movement in Europe, and we must call on all sectors in China and abroad to jointly launch this movement to extend to the Far East.

### International Situation Unpredictable: British Fleet Gathered in Hong Kong; Totalling 16 Warships and Submarine Squadron; Flagship HMS Kent to Return to Hong Kong Next Month

Although the recent international situation has not reached an extremely tense stage, crises abound and the situation is unpredictable. Preparations should be made. The recent concentration of the British Fleet in Hong Kong, with British warships fully deployed in the sea off the naval dockyard, can also be seen as a preparatory measure. The British ships currently stationed in Hong Kong include three cruisers, nine destroyers, three shallow-water gunboats, one supply ship, a submarine tender, and the Fourth Submarine Squadron. The number of British ships concentrated in Hong Kong is unprecedented. At the same time, there are also four U.S. ships anchored in Hong Kong, in addition to the flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, USS Augusta, the other three are shallow-water gunboats, USS Mindanao, USS Tulsa, and USS Edsall. The current British ships registered in Hong Kong are as follows: (Cruisers) HMS Kent, HMS Birmingham, HMS Cardiff, (Supply Ship) HMS Resource, (Shallow-water Gunboats) HMS Robin, HMS Scarab, HMS Seamew, (Submarines) Submarine Tender HMS Medway, and the Fourth Submarine Squadron, (Destroyers) HMS Duncan, HMS Grimsby, HMS Dainty, HMS Decoy, HMS Electra, HMS Diamond, HMS Scout, HMS Whitshed, HMS Tenedos. According to Hong Kong naval sources yesterday, the former flagship cruiser HMS Kent, which had returned to the UK for refurbishment, recently set sail from the UK to rejoin the China Squadron and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. After the ship arrives in Hong Kong, the newly appointed Commander of the Fifth Cruiser Squadron, Rear Admiral Murray, will transfer to the ship. After HMS Kent joins the fleet, its sister ship, HMS Cumberland, will return to the UK for refurbishment. The cruiser HMS Cardiff has exceeded its 20-year service life and has recently been ordered to return home. It will leave Hong Kong this Saturday. The British Admiralty will send the newly built "Town Class" cruiser HMS Newcastle to replace the ship. HMS Suffolk, whose service life has expired, has recently set sail for the UK.

### Engineer Proposes to Hong Kong Government: To Build a Great Air Raid Tunnel; From Victoria Peak Directly to Aberdeen, 2,000 Feet; Estimated Budget of Over One Million Dollars; Can Accommodate 100,000 People in Wartime; Blackout Drill Next Mid-Month

According to a report yesterday, the international situation is dangerous, and if war breaks out, air raids will be a terrible concern. To prepare for a rainy day, the Hong Kong authorities are stepping up air defense work. According to a proposal by an engineer, if a tunnel is dug on Victoria Peak, directly to Aberdeen, it can accommodate 100,000 people for shelter, with an estimated cost of approximately $1,166,300. According to his detailed plan, if the government agrees, it can be implemented.

Can Be Used for Air Defense and Benefit Transportation

In the future, with this tunnel, it can not only be used for air defense in wartime, but also facilitate troops and benefit transportation in peacetime. Vehicles in the city can pass through this tunnel to Aberdeen in just five to ten minutes. Therefore, Aberdeen will be greatly developed as a residential area, solving part of the housing problem. The tunnel is approximately 12,000 feet long, 20 feet high, and 40 feet wide. The excavated soil can be used to fill the Connaught Road sea embankment, as the Hong Kong government is currently considering widening from the United Pier to the Naval Dockyard. The project is estimated to take ten months to complete. The cost of labor is approximately $193,500, the cost of equipment is approximately $193,000, and the cost of materials is approximately $779,800, totaling over one million dollars.

Blackout Drill in Mid-Next Month

The Hong Kong military authorities attach great importance to air defense matters. Blackout drills were conducted several times last year to ensure that Hong Kong residents are familiar with air defense knowledge and reduce the risk of air raids. The first blackout drill of this year will be held at the earliest possible time. It is reliably learned that the implementation of the drill this year can be realized in mid-next month. At that time, it is hoped that people everywhere will cooperate with the authorities. The blackout drill this time will be more or less serious than last year.

Population Evacuation to New Territories Mainland

Currently, the authorities believe that the population in the urban area of Hong Kong is too dense. To cope with emergencies, the population will be evacuated. The evacuation locations are planned to be in the New Territories mainland, Lantau Island, Lantau Island and other places. The authorities have also decided to train 100 volunteer air defense firefighters in the shortest possible time, with a four-month period for graduation. The age is from 25 to 45 years old, but only those who are physically strong and have no other bad habits can be selected.

Yesterday, Senator McAdoo of the Commission stated in Washington that nine new President liners will be built to regularly travel between San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Little Luzon. Three of them will weigh 25,000 tons, approximately 3,000 tons heavier than the President Coolidge. The remaining six will weigh 15,000 tons each and will be used to travel on around-the-world routes. In the future, when the ships are completed, the strength of American merchant ships on the Pacific route will surpass that of merchant ships from other countries.

### Unprecedented Grand Union of All Hong Kong Drama Groups: "Yellow Flower Mound" to be Performed; Fundraising for the Relief Federation to Comfort the Families of Soldiers Who Died in the War of Resistance

— Qi Zhuo

"Look—the pioneers of the nation on Yellow Flower Mound,

Ringing the blood bell of revolution with their lives;

The spring is bright and beautiful, the willows are swaying,

Who can bear to bid farewell to parents and wives!

Striving for national freedom and liberation,

Vowing to bury their bones on Yellow Flower Mound,

Yellow flowers bloom, yellow flowers fall,

These people are gone and will never return."

"May the 450 million compatriots rise up and follow the bloody path of struggle and sacrifice of our predecessors to defend China—Great China forever!"

The tragic song of mourning the yellow flowers, especially when singing "Who can bear to bid farewell to parents and wives," brought tears to my eyes uncontrollably. In order to create China, the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound finally "endured" and "bid farewell" to their parents and wives! In order to "follow the bloody path of the martyrs" to rebuild China, countless soldiers participating in the War of Resistance also finally "endured" and "bid farewell" to their parents and wives! Only we, who survive by stealing life and enjoy the fruits of their labor, only we, who have parents and wives, should feel ashamed! How ashamed!

In order to slightly reduce the unease in our hearts, in order to atone for our sins in the slightest, performing "Yellow Flower Mound" to raise funds to comfort the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance is a very meaningful event.

The revolution of Yellow Flower Mound is the most tragic and greatest history of the Chinese nation; the completion of the "Yellow Flower Mound" script is the collective creation of progressive war playwrights and an unprecedented achievement in the drama world. In today's fierce War of Resistance, performing "Yellow Flower Mound" to praise the spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness and raising funds to comfort the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance is to comfort the martyrs under the Nine Springs. This is indeed the inescapable task of those of us who steal life and die later. Therefore, the drama circles in Hong Kong and the Relief Federation of all circles in Hong Kong have all risen up to jointly perform this great revolutionary drama "Yellow Flower Mound," fulfilling an unprecedented effort and unity and writing a bright page in the history of Hong Kong.

"Yellow Flower Mound" was originally scheduled to be performed on the Yellow Flower Festival. However, due to insufficient fundraising and careful arrangements, it was decided to perform at the Taiping Theater for three consecutive days starting on May 3rd. This can further symbolize the yellow flowers. And our remembrance and admiration for the martyrs will forever linger in our minds.

"Yellow Flower Mound," a great revolutionary historical drama in four acts and six scenes, requires 300 people to perform on and off stage. The vividness of the content is self-evident. The greatness and realism of the props and costumes go without saying. The drama groups participating in this performance include New Sound Drama Society, Red and White Drama Troupe, China Art Drama Troupe, Anti-War Drama Troupe, Whirlwind Drama Troupe, Ding Chou Drama Troupe, Youth League, China Travel Drama Troupe, Self-Strengthening Drama Troupe, Resilience Drama Troupe, Iron Flow Drama Troupe, Youth Recreation Club, Ant Drama Troupe, Vanguard Drama Troupe, Times Drama Troupe, Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and more than 40 drama groups.

The directors include Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi and other pioneers of the drama movement, who have been actively rehearsing at South China Middle School and China Art Drama Troupe for the past twenty days. The work is proceeding very tensely. The brave Lu Dun plays Huang Xing, the female actor Qu Ai plays Xu Zonghan. Jiang Ming plays a yamen runner who does not speak, focusing on the difference in emotions. More than a hundred other roles are all selected from the Hong Kong drama circle. It is expected that the performance will have a truly touching performance.

Recently, the Yellow Flower Mound Performance Special Committee of the Relief Federation has been actively preparing, and the work is already underway. (See the Hong Kong news of this newspaper). The problem now is that our overseas Chinese must remember.

The great revolutionary historical drama "Yellow Flower Mound" will be performed at the Taiping Theater for three consecutive days starting on May 3rd. In order to appreciate the most progressive theatrical art and receive the most revolutionary baptism, we must immediately recognize the sale of admission tickets to see "Yellow Flower Mound"! We must also sympathize with the 300 enthusiastic actors and the enthusiastic workers who are preparing for the performance, and help them promote the sale of admission tickets and encourage family and friends to watch "Yellow Flower Mound" together. Remember! Remember! Remember! The money raised from this charity performance will be used to raise funds for the Relief Federation to comfort the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance!

### Luo Xuhui Talks to Reporters: Government's Advice to Store Grain is Not True; Authorities Have Appropriate Measures for Food; Grain Storage News Was Talked About by a Westerner a Month Ago

Yesterday, the 26th, various newspapers in Hong Kong published that the Hong Kong authorities advised residents to store one month's worth of food in order to avoid being at a loss when an emergency occurs. After the news was published, all the people in Hong Kong were concerned, and Sir Luo Xuhui, the chief representative of the Chinese, was particularly concerned. The reporter made a special visit to Luo Xuhui at his office yesterday. Luo said that it has been rumored in Hong Kong recently that the Hong Kong authorities advised residents to store one month's worth of food, and the news has also been published in newspapers. After reading it, I felt very surprised. I had not heard of it beforehand, so I went to visit Mr. Kerry, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, to ask if he had heard of the news. According to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, he also said that he did not know. I then went to visit the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, and asked about this matter. According to Mr. Smith, the Hong Kong government did not order or advise residents to store grain. However, the news was first published by a Western newspaper. If you want to know the source, you must wait until you ask the Western newspaper to find out the truth. Until this morning (yesterday), the Colonial Secretary replied to me, saying that the news published by the Western newspaper was a conversation between the reporter of the newspaper and a Westerner two or three months ago about the food problem caused by the serious situation in Europe last September, and it also mentioned Singapore's food, and Singaporean newspapers had already published this problem. But this is only a local food relationship in Singapore, and it is not something that the Hong Kong government should show. As for the big food problem in Hong Kong, the government has already taken appropriate measures. Therefore, I dare to solemnly explain to the residents of Hong Kong that they can rest assured.

### Cholera Prevention Campaign: Hong Kong Government to Start on May 1st; Hopes Residents Will Cooperate in Epidemic Prevention

As summer approaches, there is a possibility of cholera epidemics in Hong Kong. If prevention is not done in advance, the spread may be alarming. The Hong Kong government authorities will start a cholera prevention campaign on May 1st, in view of the fact that one case of the disease has been discovered in Hong Kong, which was transmitted from Macau. Moreover, after the war in South China, epidemics are more likely to occur. Last year, various hospitals and district health bureaus vigorously administered vaccinations, which were very effective. The residents were also afraid of the serious cholera epidemic and deaths in 1937, and they voluntarily injected vaccinations without the government's coercion. Therefore, although the population of Hong Kong increased last year, it was able to pass safely. The medical authorities hope that residents can maintain the spirit of cooperation from last year and prevent it in advance. In addition to injecting vaccinations, they must also pay attention to their daily life and diet.

### "Phoenix City," A Passionate Anti-Japanese War Drama　Gong Jiabao　… "China Travel" Charity Performance for the Women's Federation at the "Empress" Tonight…

Writing a play is inherently more difficult than writing other things. Writing an anti-Japanese war drama is even more difficult than writing ordinary plays!

Therefore, when our national self-defense war unfolded on a vast scale, and comrades in theatrical work surged forward to shoulder the task of national salvation propaganda, a "script shortage" became a common phenomenon, a problem difficult to solve.

The Hong Kong Women's Federation, in order to慰勞 front-line soldiers and generals, has decided to collaborate with the China Travel Drama Troupe for a charity performance tonight (28th) at 9 p.m. at the Empress Theatre. For this charity performance, "China Travel" is sacrificing all performance fees. The script chosen by both parties is Wu Zuguang's "Phoenix City." The entire story depicts national heroes Miao Kexiu, Zhao Dong, and others organizing the Young Iron-Blood Volunteer Army in the Northeast, putting up a strong resistance against the × people, until Kexiu dies a heroic death in Phoenix City. The Young Iron-Blood Army, under his encouragement, continues to fight the invaders. Interspersed are some interesting segments: Xia Wanbing—Kexiu's newlywed wife—transforming from a virtuous wife and loving mother into a strong warrior; Zhang Sheng—Kexiu's loyal aide—sacrificing himself gloriously to save his master after being wounded; Xia Chuan Jujian—a female spy of the × people—stealing the anti-× plan and being arrested; Jin Ying—a member of the Korean Revolutionary Party—sacrificing her body and marrying an ×× lieutenant general, waiting for an opportunity to assassinate him; and Little Feng, a girl who aspires to join the army...etc.

The best advantage of this script is that it is passionate, compact, and full of emotion, depicting the patriotic and tragic spirit of our compatriots participating in the self-defense war, with a "raging fire" momentum, making it easy for the actors to be moved by the lines, thus making the entire performance emotional, and therefore the audience is also easily moved!

The overall structure of the play is compact, the emotions are sincere, and the stage effects are also given considerable consideration. If one must nitpick, then it could be said that it is not written delicately enough, the so-called "squeezing the lemon juice without being able to squeeze it to the last drop." However, this little flaw, under the passionate emotions and majestic momentum of the entire script, can be said to be insignificant.

For the sake of national salvation propaganda, and for the sake of raising funds to慰勞 the front-line soldiers and generals, this script has a special significance in this place. I hope everyone will spend money to come to this worry to earn hot tears, to earn inspiration, and to earn the duties we should fulfill to the soldiers at the front.

### Two More Robberies Occurred on Land and Sea　Fifteen Thieves Armed and Robbed　A Whole Boat of Firewood on the South Toutou Sea Was Hijacked　Hundreds of Dollars Robbed from a He Surname Farmer in Sheung Shui

The rampant state of banditry in Hong Kong is higher than it is today. Robberies occur on both land and sea every day, and residents are unable to defend themselves. Although the police detectives are rigorously pursuing the bandits, they ultimately do not know what the law is and act recklessly. Robberies are still frequent, especially in the New Territories. This morning, in a village in Sheung Shui, a farmer's residence was robbed by seven thieves, resulting in a loss of more than three hundred dollars. Also, on the 23rd of this month, in the South Toutou sea area near the British border, a cargo boat was hijacked by eight pirates who fired shots. The people on the boat were imprisoned in the cabin for two days. Later, near the cove, they were driven ashore, and the cargo boat was looted by the thieves, resulting in a loss of more than eight hundred dollars. The boat owner, Ou Wang, and his crewmate returned to Hong Kong yesterday and reported the case to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station. The details of the two robberies on land and sea are recorded separately as follows:

Eight Pirates

Robbed a Cargo Boat

According to the report to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station by Ou Wang, the owner of the robbed cargo boat, number 632, he is a native of Taiping, Dongguan. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, he was commissioned by Chen Jinkui, the owner of a firewood shop in Xinwu Village, Nantou, Bao'an County, to transport 150 bundles of firewood to Hong Kong. When the boat was about to arrive at a certain sea area, suddenly two pirate boats flew over from the shore, each carrying four thieves, and ordered the boat to stop. We did not heed the order and continued to sail. The thieves, seeing that we did not obey the order to stop, fired several shots at our boat. Seeing this situation, we had to stop and lie down in the cabin to avoid the bullets. Before long, the two pirate boats drove and parked on either side of our boat. Six thieves carrying guns crossed over to our boat, threatening us and searching everyone's bodies, taking more than ten dollars in cash. Then they drove the four of us into the cabin, tightly closing the gun door. Since then, we have been in the cabin, not seeing the light of day, for two days. We also did not know where the thieves were driving our boat. On the morning of the 25th, the thieves released us and drove the five of us ashore. We then learned that the place was Chuanwan in China's territory. The thieves then drove our boat away. Since Chuanwan is not far from the British border, we walked back to Hong Kong. We only arrived yesterday morning. Our boat is worth three hundred dollars, and the firewood is worth five hundred dollars. We request an investigation and arrest, he said.

Seven Strong Thieves

Robbed a Farmer's Residence

Furthermore, at the residence of a Yan family in Sheung Shui Village, New Territories, which does not have a house number, the homeowner, surnamed He, named Bing, lives in the house with his family. At 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning, everyone had fallen into deep sleep. Suddenly, three thieves broke down the door and entered. He was awakened by the noise. Knowing that they were not good, He intended to wake up his family to resist the thieves. However, the thieves had already entered the house. The thieves immediately threatened He with a gun, telling him not to make any noise, otherwise they would be killed. Under these circumstances, He had to let them do as they pleased. Before long, four more thieves came in, for a total of seven thieves, all carrying long and short guns, with a fierce aura. After entering the house, the thieves subdued each member of the He family and then ransacked the house, turning it upside down. The thieves, finding little gain, were not satisfied and searched everyone's bodies, taking everything they could find. The whole process took about ten minutes. Finally, they fled towards the Chinese border with their stolen goods. The stolen items included 120 Hong Kong dollars in cash, 117 provincial dollars, as well as gold rings, gold earrings, gold watches, and expensive clothing, worth a total of $346.50. After the thieves had gone far away, He went to the police station to report the case, requesting a rigorous investigation to arrest the bandits and bring them to justice, he said.

### Cutting Off Zengcong Road × Lost Contact　Our Army Takes Advantage of the Victory to Advance to Lapu　× Attacked from Left and Right, Retreating in Two Routes　Zengcheng × Trapped in a Large Encirclement by Our Army

[Breaking News] The Zengcheng × army has been repeatedly attacked fiercely by our army and is exhausted from fighting. They are only desperately holding on to the county seat, Zhucun, Yongqiu Market, Fuhe, and other points, acting as mutual support. On one side, they drew a unit of about 3,000 men from Conghua, with eight cannons, and on the morning of the 25th, they launched a surprise attack on Paitan along the Zengcong Highway. When it was discovered by the Song unit of our ××× Division, they immediately met them head-on. After a fierce battle all day, our army bravely charged and fought, while one side launched a flanking attack from Pingcheng. At the same time, the Liang unit of our ××× Division, upon hearing the news, dispatched troops to reinforce Pingcheng and launched a pincer attack. × Was attacked from the left and right and collapsed. In this battle, more than 800 × were killed. × retreated to Gaohe and Lapu in two routes. On the 26th, our army took advantage of the victory and pursued, crossing Gaohe and cutting off the Zengcong Highway. They are now approaching Lapu and Gonghe, and × has lost contact and their morale has been shaken. There is a sign that they are preparing to withdraw to Liangtian and Fuhe Market. Our army continues to press on and will intercept the Fuchong Highway. Recently, the situation in Zengcheng is that × is in danger of falling into our large encirclement at any time.

### West River Front　Our Guerrillas Are Extremely Active　Sanshui × Increased Troops on Alert　Fengyong × Attempting to Defend to the Death

[West River Breaking News] In the past ten days, there has been no major contact between our × and × on the Sanshui front. The Western Route counter-offensive troops received a telegraphic order from Commander-in-Chief Xia yesterday, adopting a mobile × control strategy, firmly establishing their positions, and waiting for an opportunity to strike, so the battle situation has been slightly quiet. However, the guerrillas are extremely active, constantly dispatching troops to attack the ×, making the × exhausted. The latest military intelligence is recorded as follows.

Cai Tingkai Inspects　West River Front

Cai Tingkai, the newly appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sixteenth Army Group, arrived in Zhaoqing from Guizhou East the other day to take up his new position. He once summoned Deng Longguang, Commander of the Western Route Front, Chen Gongxia, Deputy Army Commander, Wang Dequan, Zhang Chi and others to hold a military meeting to discuss and instruct on all defense, × control, and counter-offensive plans. It is currently under investigation that in order to inspect the front-line defenses and review the fighting soldiers and local teams, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief has recently been accompanied by a large number of staff members on an inspection tour of Guangli, Yongan, and the front lines of Beishui and Mafang, summoning the commanders of various defense forces and the leaders of the self-defense teams, consulting and instructing on everything. It is reported that the inspection has now been completed and he has returned to a certain place to plan military affairs.

Sanshui × Army　Increased Troops on Alert

At the beginning of this month, our army in the Western Route launched a counter-offensive against the × in Sanshui with a swift and decisive manner, crossing the river and capturing important strongholds one after another. The × entrenched in the Western Line, fearing being encircled and annihilated by us, concentrated in strongholds such as Hekou and Southwest in Sanshui, relying on their defenses and resisting stubbornly. In order to avoid going deep alone, our army closely surrounded and controlled the ×, and organized plainclothes guerrillas to launch a wide range of guerrilla warfare deep into the occupied areas. In recent days, they have repeatedly attacked the ×, gaining many victories. In order to respond to our guerrilla plan, the × commander in the West River, Zhongyuan, specially transferred a part of the × in Foshan to Hekou, Xipu and other places to strengthen security. From the 20th to the 24th, about 1,000 troops were deployed to the front line of Sanshui, distributed to guard the stations along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway.

Fengyong's ×　Building Defenses and Defending to the Death

Also, the × in Fengyong, a town on the Foshan-Shaoqing Highway north of Foshan, has been repeatedly attacked since our West River troops crossed the river to launch a counter-offensive. They are still being encircled and annihilated by our Li Division troops in coordination with the Tax Police Corps, so the × is greatly panicked. They have been constantly shelling Shengang and other places in recent days, and are rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs to resist our army's attack. On the 24th and 25th, a part of the × in Foshan, about four or five hundred people, reinforced the Fengyong garrison, capturing our strong young men and civilians along the way to help them transport barbed wire, wooden stones, sandbags, and military equipment and ammunition, with the intention of defending Fengyong to the death, it is said.

### Panyu Guerrillas　Two Successful Attacks　Seized a Batch of Firearms and Food

[Panyu Breaking News] The Panyu guerrillas have been unusually active recently, launching fierce attacks on the × from time to time. On the 21st and 22nd of this month, they again ambushed and killed dozens of × soldiers at Fulian Mountain and Hekou Estuary, and sank multiple × boats. It is found that Fulian Mountain in the county is located on the west bank of the Pearl River, which is one of the transportation routes for the × people. Early in the morning of the 21st of this month, a × transport ship released six rubber boats and sailed along the Baihu Sea behind the mountain to unload and store firearms and grain. When three large wooden boats transported it back to the ship and returned to the river near the Wenmiao Temple on the mountain, they were discovered by the No. 5 Guerrilla Team lurking on the mountain. Unexpectedly, they fired machine guns at the × rubber boats from a high position. The × were caught by surprise and could not resist, so they had to abandon the towed wooden boats and fled in panic. The firearms and food on these boats all fell into our hands. The ×, unwilling to lose their supplies, dispatched more than 80 × soldiers on more than ten rubber boats the next day, patrolling the Baihu Sea multiple times and rotating into the Hekou Estuary in the north of the mountain, intending to land on the mountain to search. When they arrived at the end of the estuary, our guerrillas ambushed them again, using the embankment as cover for combat. Another unit, with the help of nearby boat people, took advantage of multiple speedboats to surround the rear of the ×. The × then collapsed. We sank three × rubber boats and killed more than 20 × soldiers, it is said.

### Various Places in Nanhai　Bandits Like Hair, Bandits Rob in Broad Daylight　Puppet Police Turn a Deaf Ear

[Nanhai Breaking News] Since Nanhai fell, the local order has been extremely chaotic, and bandits have risen up. It has been even more rampant in the past ten days than before. The × army is unable to maintain order, and various places in Nanhai have almost become a bandit world. The most obvious are recorded as follows:

Guangzhou-Foshan Steamer Robbed

At 8:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month, the Dali steamer of the × Merchant Qianyi Company, traveling between Guangzhou and Foshan, set off from Foshan and arrived in the river off the Bian, when suddenly more than 20 bandits, divided into four long sampans, sailed towards the wheel head-on, firing shots at the wheel's helm house. One helmsman was shot dead on the spot. When they swarmed onto the wheel and reached the dining room, four puppet police officers resisted and three more were bombed to death. The remaining one was tied up in a corner by the bandits, who then began to plunder the passengers, for about an hour, before roaring away.

Bandits Rob Rongzhou Zhaocun

Rongzhou is located south of Shishi. Although puppet police officers are stationed there after the Guangzhou × handover, their strength is weak and unable to maintain order. The Zhaocun there has always been prosperous, and the bandits have always coveted it. At 4:00 a.m. on the morning of the 20th of this month, a group of bandits, about a hundred people, robbed Zhao Village. When they arrived at the edge of the village, the villagers discovered them and immediately fired at the bandits. The bandits also returned fire. After a long time, the villagers were no match and were broken in by the bandits, who plundered property from house to house until dawn before leaving. Before leaving, in addition to kidnapping three men surnamed Zhao, they also set fire to more than ten houses in the village.

Robbing Pujun Market Pawnshop

At 11:00 a.m. on the 19th of this month, more than 20 bandits broke into the Yuanchang pawnshop on Tieyan Street in Pujun Market, detained the partners in a corner, and searched for valuables and 8,000 yuan in paper money. Then they entered the Delong Rice Shop next door and robbed it, seizing more than 4,000 yuan in paper money. The puppet police were in collusion with the bandits and turned a deaf ear. Later, the bandits calmly escaped to the suburbs of Datangyong.

### Guanghai × Boats　Commit Crimes at Haiyan, Failing and Drowning Completely　A Hull of an Empty Ship Moored at Leizhu Island

(Taishan Breaking News) In order to contain our army's counter-offensive, the Jianghui × army sent out speedboats to harass the Single Water Estuary in Kaiping County on the 23rd. According to continued information from Taishan, the × warship moored near the Guanghai Shadi beach, which had been used for the ×'s offense at Shan Shui estuary, also sent seven search boats carrying 70-80 x soldiers to the Haiyan area of the 8th district in Taishan. They wanted to make a surprise attack. However, our guards noticed it and ambushed the coasts. When the × boats came near the fire line, they were greeted with a head-on hit. The × also put up with machine guns. The sides fought each other for an hour. Three x boats were sunk by our assistance. The remaining × soldiers began to save each other. The sunken x soldiers have all drowned. Seeing the sinking x soldiers, the × warship nearby fired back at the costs, covering other × boats to flee. Twelve x ships of school rank, and air-craft-carrier arrived the shore near and around. But only a hull moors the island of Leizhu, near to. Further, four battle destroyers patrol the beach and surround it, but no further attacks. The defense line is still quiet.

### After the Battle of Chaoshan, Changes Occurred in the Transportation of the Eastern Route. Waterways Will Be Centered on Meixian. Travel and Freight Can Still Maintain Normalcy

[Chaoan Breaking News] The coastal area of Chaoshan is vulnerable to threats during wartime. The Yuezhong × has been counter-attacked by us recently, and is surrounded by enemies on all sides. However, it is still rumored that it will invade Shantou on the 29th of this month. The local military and civilian administrative officials have long been prepared. In addition to deploying military forces, manpower, and material resources in various coastal areas, they have also carried out the destruction of roads early on. The Eastern Provincial Highway is the most recent transportation route. The trunk road starts from Chaoan to Qujiang, passing through Jieyang, Fengshun, Xingning, Wuhua, Longchuan, Heyuan, Lianping, and Wengyuan. It is a total of 186 kilometers. At the beginning of this month, in order to meet the needs of wartime, the Chaoan-Jieyang section was destroyed for the first time, leaving only small paths for highway vehicles to travel temporarily. Now it has been decided to destroy it thoroughly, and continue the destruction work from Jieyang to the Monkey Ridge area of Fengshun. The Eastern Road traffic will only reach Fengshun. In the future, traffic between the provincial capital and the eastern regions will change accordingly. Fortunately, the impact is still small. Those entering the inland from the coast still have to change to waterways, taking a steamer from Chaoan to Songkou, and then transfer to a boat to Meixian, where there is a highway leading to Xingning. This route has been used for a long time. In Xingning, they still follow the highway to enter the inland. From then on, the Eastern Road traffic will take Meixian as its hub, and the travel of passengers and the transportation of goods can maintain normalcy.

### Three × Warships　Suddenly Sailed into Daya Bay　Patrolling Without Leaving, Coastal Tension　Planes Reconnoiter Huizhang Highway

[Boluo Breaking News] According to a report from the local military agency, (1) On the 25th, three × giant warships suddenly sailed into the waters of Daya Bay, with unclear intentions. As of yesterday, the 26th, the three warships had not sailed elsewhere and were patrolling from time to time, their movements were suspicious, and the situation along the coast was tense. We have been closely monitoring them. (2) On the same day, a × plane flew from the west to the sky above Boluo, circling several times, and then flew to Huiyang, passing over Jiazipu and patrolling along Huizhang Road for a long time before flying away without dropping bombs.

### Along the Minxi and Southern Jiangxi Line

— Mo Feng Lan

The spring water of Poyang Lake has risen sharply, and the main force of the × army is gradually gathering along the Xiu River. The defense of northern Jiangxi is at the urgent moment before the storm. In order to understand the various wartime rear dynamics of southern Jiangxi, the reporter decided to take advantage of the eve of the war. After days of spring rain, he took western Changting as the starting point and made a journey in the flames of war to southern Jiangxi.

The car departed at 8:30 am on March 22nd. The long-distance bus, weathered and worn, was like a clumsy ox, constantly panting and stalling. Every time it was filled with fuel and water, it could not run a few miles before it had to stop. Although the weather was clear, the accumulated mud and water from many days was still radioactive. When the car flew over the mud, the mud splashed like raindrops on both sides, wetting the outer clothes of every passenger. Passengers who knew how to protect themselves mostly lowered their heads, no longer in the mood to appreciate the beautiful scenery outside the carriage.

The treacherous and narrow mountain roads between Ting and Rui, Sanjiannao, and Jiuhei, took almost two hours. The driver, loyal to his duty, measured the road and feared accidents, repeatedly advised passengers to wade through a short section of muddy slope to reduce the weight of the car. After the car went down Jiuli Ridge, a plain unfolded in front. A few minutes later, it arrived at the large market town on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi—Gucheng. Gucheng is a town with 5,000 people under the jurisdiction of Changting County. The paper industry is quite developed, and the self-defense force is also strong. Watchtowers stand facing each other in the town, and they have repeatedly used force to repel the covetousness of nearby bandits.

Upon entering Jiangxi, there is a characteristic: cruciferous green manure is planted all over the mountains and fields. The flowers of the green manure are white, occasionally mixed with purple and green, not very obvious. A vast expanse of white flowers looks like a sheet of snow. The fields and frogs are all over the highway. According to Director Jiang of the Changting County Nursery on the same car, the seeds of green manure are planted in early spring. In early February, they are plowed and mixed into the soil to increase the organic fertilizer in the soil. Its function is slightly similar to the ordinary fertilizers used in Fujian Province. Several counties bordering Fujian Province and Jiangxi, such as Changting and Ninghua, have already begun to try it. The geographical areas of western Fujian and northern Jiangxi are both spurs of the Wuyi Mountains. The climate and rainfall are roughly similar. There should be no difficulty in trying green manure. Mr. Jiang also mentioned the task of this trip, which is to purchase high-quality yellow cattle, various fruit tree seedlings, and fish species from Ruijin to improve Changting's agriculture. Northern Jiangxi has now become a war zone, and the agricultural products of southern Jiangxi will be entirely supplied to the front line, and can no longer be of any benefit to western Fujian. In response to this possibility, Fujian, which is mountainous and barren, is promoting winter cultivation and the planting of upland rice, in order to achieve self-sufficiency in the province. This kind of far-sighted planning shows the Fujian provincial authorities' determination and preparation for future changes everywhere.

The Ting-Rui Highway is a small section of the Fujian-Hunan line. Bridge foundations under construction can be seen everywhere along the way, and the road surface is also being paved and tidied up. The road workers are very busy. About four kilometers from Ruijin, the highway crosses the Mian River. A section of the bridge was destroyed by the flood. The brave driver drove at the highest speed and rushed to the other side through the water. The waves splashed everywhere, forming a spectacular sight. When the car arrived on the other side, the passengers, who had just recovered from the shock, could not help but get out of the car to see what was happening. The passengers revisited their shock at the rapid flow and broken bridge. Next to the broken bridge, there is a new-style bridge being built by more than fifty workers. Its majestic and beautiful appearance symbolizes the potential and greatness of the Chinese nation. Everyone looked at each other and smiled knowingly.

The car arrived at Ruijin Station at 1:20 pm. Forty-two miles took more than five hours. Muddy roads and broken cars really delay time. As soon as the reporter got off the car, another group of passengers rushed up, wanting to take the same car to Changting. Noteworthy among the passengers were two wounded soldiers wearing red honor badges. One with an injured left hand supported his sick companion with his right hand, limping towards the carriage. If the reporter had not witnessed it, he would not have imagined that the people in the rear would be so loving and caring for the wounded soldiers. Everyone helped the sick wounded soldier into the car, found an empty space for him to lie down, and gave up another seat for the wounded soldier with the left hand injury to sit. He refused, but the people refused even more, forcibly pushing him to sit down. The reporter was so moved by this great scene of military-civilian cooperation that he almost shed tears. With tears in his eyes, he jumped back into the carriage, took out a small packet of Yunnan Baiyao from his bag, found a bowl of boiled water, and taught him to take it. Talking to them, he learned that they were new soldiers of the 6th Division of the New Fourth Army. After the Battle of De'an, they were transferred to the ×× Division and fought on the Xiu River front. This time they were unfortunately injured and were lying in a rear hospital for treatment. Not long ago, the commander-in-chief of the war zone received a letter of honor, military pay, and taught them to return to their hometowns. Now, one is going back to Ninghua, and the other is also going back to Tai'ning. They are extremely concerned about the front, and asked about the front line extremely eagerly. When the reporter told them that northern Jiangxi was in an emergency and that × troops had been discovered near Wucheng Town, they all looked north with extreme depression, as if regretting this injury, and losing a great opportunity to kill ×.

Ruijin is surrounded by mountains and water, with fish ponds scattered like stars, quite like the scenery of Jiangnan. Since the civil war, the population of more than 300,000 has been reduced to only 191,500. Many mansions have become rubble fields. Various slogans are written all over the streets and walls. These are the historical relics. If you want to see more buildings of historical significance, there is a Yuting Park eight miles outside the city, where there are memorial towers and monuments built by soldiers of the 10th Column in memory of the fallen soldiers. Fifteen miles east of the city, there are also the execution ground and the Red Army Martyrs' Memorial Tower, quietly lying there.

Ruijin was formerly Xianghu Town under the jurisdiction of Ganzhou. It was not until the middle of the Southern Tang Dynasty that the county was established. The Mian River and Tanxi River flow through it. The rice, beans, tobacco, timber, Chinese yams, and paper produced there were worth more than two million yuan each year before the war, but now it is only more than seven hundred thousand yuan. After the Anti-Japanese War, the economic relationship with western Fujian is even more closely linked. Ruijin's products rely on the Ting River for transportation, and the food that Ruijin needs most must also be transported by Changting. Western Fujian and southern Jiangxi are not only in the same geographical area, but also have an inseparable economic relationship.

Ruijin is richly endowed by nature, but the political institutions are still disappointing. The county administration is not as sound as that of Fujian. The organization among counties, districts, and baojia is extremely lax. The meager quota of 121 conscripted soldiers per month is scraped together from east and west. People are even learning the old methods of avoiding chaos and going into the mountains to avoid conscription. It can be seen that propaganda and conscription methods cannot be perfected (To be continued)

### Happy Angel (13)

"Harry!" someone shouted outside, "Come quickly!"

"Coming!" he answered unconsciously.

When Harry came back, she was sitting in front of the piano playing the tune of "One Night of Joy." The twilight made the room dim, but he could still see the tears glistening on her eyelashes. When she discovered that Harry was with her in this empty house, she didn't seem surprised.

"What trouble are you having?"

"None." He casually picked up a bottle of opened champagne from a table. "Whose is this?"

"Mine. Would you like some?"

"Thank you." He poured himself a glass and drank it.

"What's the matter? Have you crossed the boundary?"

"The girls have all gone over. Mr. Quenais has promised to take care of them."

"So, you've come back to me?" Her voice was soft and mysterious.

"Obviously."

Irene looked at him and suddenly asked, her eyes moist with tears, "In that happy, musical soul of yours, there is a spirit of chivalry. You risk your life and run here to help and comfort a woman in distress. Is that true?"

"Yes, that is the plain and simple truth."

Opening her handbag, she took out something. "Look," she said softly, "A souvenir from Omar Black."

Harry looked at it and felt his eyelids twitch.

"Do you remember…?" Irene asked softly. "I told you that I'm not just anyone. That's true. I'm not just anyone. I know that one doesn't need to tell others the truth. I thought that if I could tell a huge lie, I could make myself great. But I can't lie to you, because you are different from all the others. You are an honest man."

Without hesitation, Harry held her tightly in his arms. They kissed.

"I'll try to get a passport. We can cross the border tomorrow morning. We can find those six girls and work together. We can work together."

Irene's eyes were shining. She said without disguise, "I will become a great person." At this moment, there was a huge crashing sound outside, and someone rushed into the house.

"Bomb!" the man shouted. "Let's get to the cellar quickly!"

"Ah, no," Irene said, "We must stay here and admire this magnificent spectacle."

"Madam, I advise you not to be so careless. Life is not a child's play," the man said.

"Don't worry, death and I are old friends."

"Turn off the lights, extinguish all the lights!" someone shouted outside again. "Everyone go to the cellar!"

"Do you want to go to the kiln?" Irene asked Harry.

"Do you want to?"

### Single Championship of the Lawn Tennis Tournament - Xu Brothers in Charge. Younger Xu Defeated Li Huitang Yesterday. Semifinal of Doubles Today

...The All Hong Kong Open Tennis Singles Semifinal was held at 5 pm yesterday. Xu Jiasheng vs. Li Huitang. Xu Jiasheng did not play strongly, often having "double faults" in his serves. His strength was also not as good as before, deviating from his standard. Yesterday, he struggled, showing his shortcomings and rarely highlighting his strengths. Unless he practices hard, his future is not optimistic. Li Huitang, on the other hand, although his serves were strong, had the disadvantage of "double faults", totaling five times throughout the match, the same as Xu. Li's net play was not of a high standard, with frequent mistakes. Even when he encountered Xu at the net, he was helpless. This is the reason for Li's defeat.

...Yesterday's three-set battle spent eight-tenths of its time in dinking the ball, with nothing exciting. It was like chewing wax. In the first set, both sides fought with the spirit of calmness and step-by-step operation, resulting in scores of 2-2, 3-3, and 4-4, tied three times. Xu's net play was skilled, and he finally won the first set with a score of 6-4. In the second set, Xu took advantage of Huitang's mistakes to take the lead all the way, from 3-2, 4-2, to 6-2. Xu's performance in this set was better than the first set, with fewer mistakes and stable drop shots. In contrast, the balls hit by Huitang either hit the net or went out of bounds, losing a lot of valuable points, hence the defeat.

In the third set, both sides adopted the strategy of defensive shots. The ball soared above the scale of 10 feet. Xu's net play was clumsy, and Huitang tried his best to meet the attack. The ball went back and forth, but it had enough "toughness but lacked sharpness." Hui once threatened Xu with a lead of 5-3. Everyone thought that this set must be won by Huitang. But Xu bravely chased after him, tying the score at 5-5. Afterwards, when Huitang served, Huitang won, and when Xu served, Xu won. They fought to five ties, making it 10-10, and continued to struggle. Xu, in the calmness, finally won the victory with 12-10 and obtained the right to the final, creating a situation where the brothers monopolize the singles championship.

There is a doubles semi-final today, with the Lin brothers against Li Rurong and He Jialiu, which is sure to be worth watching. The latest situation of the singles is listed below.

### Shanghai Meitong Public School Physical Education Department Launches Women's Amusement Day Movement - Eliminating Championship Doctrinism Intense Sports - Inviting Shanghai Chinese and Western Girls' Schools to Participate

(Shanghai News) Recently, the American sports community has deeply felt that various championship doctrinism's intense sports are harmful to women's health. Due to the different physical organization of men and women, they advocate social and recreational sports. Therefore, "Amusement Day" (Play Day) has emerged. The activity is held on a sunny day, gathering female students from various schools in one field to hold various performances, games, ball games, etc., with the aim of cultivating body and mind, and connecting feelings. Victory or defeat is irrelevant to the overall situation, eliminating the psychological tension of taking winning as the sole goal. It is truly an activity worth promoting. The Meitong Public School in this city has also taken notice of this and will invite Chinese and Western girls' schools in Shanghai to hold the first "Amusement Day" in Shanghai at the school on May 27th. Invitation senders are: Western schools include the British, Western Girls', Northern Western Girls', Sacred Heart, Le Li, etc.; Chinese schools include Chinese and Western, Industrial Girls' High, Chongde, Qixiu, Qingxin, and Deer, etc. It is expected that it will be a sensation at that time.

### New Pattern Football Performance Match - Hong Kong vs. Shanghai - The Matter is About to be Agreed and Awaits a Good Day

(Special News from This Newspaper) After Shanghai was reduced to an isolated island, the football players scattered, and many came south to Hong Kong.

Recently, Zhong Jiasen and Zhang Jinhai have also come to Hong Kong from Chongqing, so there are now more than 20 famous Shanghai footballers residing here, who can organize a strong team.

It is heard that they are preparing a new pattern of performance matches, but it can only be held after the Hong Kong Inter-port team returns to Hong Kong.

The opposing teams in this game are the Shanghai team and the Hong Kong team. All the footballers who came south from Shanghai are the main force of the Shanghai team. The planned lineup is roughly as follows:

Zhang Rongcai Miao Guozheng Jiang Shanjing Yu Qiaxing Wu Qi Li Yicheng Liu Shizan Wei Douwen Cao Qiuting Xu Wenkui Zhang Jinhai Li Mingsen

The Hong Kong team is the incarnation of South China, so the venue is set in Jia Shan, but the date is not yet determined. It is heard that the Hong Kong team will definitely dispatch its complete lineup to meet the challenge. The lineup may be as follows:

Tan Jun'gan Li Tiansheng Li Guowei Mai Shaohan Liu Qingcai Rong Rongzhao Guo Yingqi Yang Shuiyi Ye Beihua Feng Jingxiang Huang Zhaorong Deng Guangsen

If this performance match is realized, and both sides have such strong forces, it will definitely be a grand sight. Football fans who come to Hong Kong from the isolated island will definitely want to witness it, and the fans of the southern country will not disappoint this blessing of the eyes. The matter is about to be agreed, and awaits a good day. (Taisui)

### Shanghai Bicycle Race: Seven Elderly Men Display Skill, Xu Ruifen and Kuai Shitai Win Men's and Women's Championships

(Shanghai News on the 24th) The third Bicycle Race Meeting, organized by the Shanghai Cycling Association, was held in Jiaozhou Park at 9:00 am yesterday.

Swimming Guide

### Diving

Now let's talk about diving.

If you are practicing swimming and neglecting the breathing movements, then breathing is the most important part of diving. If the amount of breathing is small, it will not be easy to dive for more than five minutes. In the water, the body has to withstand great pressure, which is extremely difficult. For beginners, the distance between the body in the water and the surface of the water should be as short as possible. Since you have reached the stage of learning to dive, it is easy to do that. On the other hand, in order to make the body accustomed to water pressure and increase resistance, you should often go to deep water. At this time, the eardrums will sting, the chest will feel heavy pressure, the head will be dizzy, and the whole body will feel uneasy. If you get used to it for a long time, you will be more receptive and obviously make more progress.

Many timid people feel very uncomfortable in deep water, which is also a disadvantage that hinders practice. However, it is worth considering whether the diving environment is safe. In the swimming pool, the area in front of the diving platform is a dangerous place, and the side of the pool is also a good place to enter the water. If you are not careful, you may harm each other, which is unimaginable. There are even more dangers in rivers and seas. Boats and floating objects on the sea surface all threaten the safety of divers. It is very uneasy for beginners to keep their eyes open while diving. Most people close their eyes because of this, which makes it easy to suffer losses. If the sun is shining on the surface of the water, divers do not feel dark in the water. In principle, it is best to keep your eyes open. However, if the water is dark and you do not know the actual situation, be careful not to get your head bumped or injured. It is better to dive in slowly.

The breaststroke movement is the most suitable for diving. How about changing directions up, down, left, and right? (1) Changing directions up and down: The body's forward force is generated by the action of the limbs resisting the water. If you want to dive down, your palms must push upwards. The so-called upward push is not just pushing the palms towards the surface of the water, but also having the palms face upwards in all the movements, so that the head can descend. This is a great help for diving down. The hands that rise should press down towards the bottom of the water, and of course, the head should move upwards in coordination. (2) Changing directions left and right: If you want to turn left, increase the force of your hands pushing the water to the right, and reduce the force of your right hand, which will act as a rudder to change direction. If you want to turn right, you can use the same principle.

Because the whole body is in the water, the resistance to forward movement is greater than in other swimming styles. Strive to keep the limbs from tilting and make the movements of bending and contracting the limbs as quickly as possible. This is a way to reduce wasted effort. To achieve this goal, you must first have a correct and excellent breaststroke posture. Otherwise, it will not be easy to make progress in diving in water that is difficult to see and has more difficulties.

If diving is applied, it will not be very useful if you only have this skill. Therefore, you must increase the distance you can dive. The length of the distance can be determined by time and energy. The diving action is correct and appropriate, which is also relevant. Being able to dive for a considerable amount of time and distance will be more helpful for self-defense and application. This requires hard work and practice according to the correct methods. (Pan Zhaoye)

### Discussion on the Settlement of Accounts for Factories in War Zones

— Zhang Mengzhao

"Thousands of homes are wailing in the scorched earth, and where can the people return?" In this crucible of the War of Resistance, the prosperity of industrial and commercial enterprises has been destroyed in the flames and lost. In particular, the silk, yarn, and flour mills of the people's light industry have suffered the greatest sacrifices, either destroyed by fire or occupied. Some machines were seized, and some goods were looted. "No egg is left intact under a toppled nest," let alone the national enterprises that are the lifeline of the economy. I have been an accountant in a yarn factory for more than ten years. Now, because the location of my work, Pudong, is blockaded and occupied, the production machines of the enterprise cannot operate, and my family life is under severe pressure. I am also trapped in the depression of semi-unemployment. Thinking of the large number of unemployed workers, the large chimneys are no longer smoking, and even the thousands of small chimneys are no longer cooking. Who is responsible for all of this? In this unprecedented catastrophe in history, the enterprise authorities have suffered great pain. After the pain subsides, however, if there is a glimmer of hope for the recovery of the enterprise, they should continue to work hard and strive to sow the seeds for the future of the enterprise and struggle out of the darkness. As Mr. Xi Yushu said, "The stability of society depends on the vitality of enterprises. If vitality cannot be maintained and is allowed to die, the chaos of society will be unimaginable. Therefore, those who can continue to conduct business should try to preserve it as the best policy..." This is indeed a wise saying—(See Mr. Xi Yushu's article "Handling of Wartime Losses When Handling Settlement of Accounts for Industry and Commerce" in the previous newspaper).

I would like to discuss the issue of settlement of accounts from an accounting perspective, based on the second item suggested by Mr. Xi: "Assets" are damaged, part of the capital is depreciated, and business cannot be conducted temporarily because (1) transportation is blocked and raw materials cannot be purchased, (2) the war zone is not open and machines cannot be used, and (3) the market is depressed, even if there are loans, there is no market for sales, and business can still be done when order is restored..." This is indeed the case.

(A) Before it is actually possible to clearly understand the extent of the damage to houses, machines, equipment, and goods, etc. in the war zone, the accounting settlement for the current year should still list new subjects, debiting "War Zone Houses," "War Zone Machines," "War Zone Goods," etc. to distinguish them.

(B) If the figures for the damage and the actual losses are clearly investigated, a "Wartime Damage Fee" account should be listed as a "Deferred Asset" to be amortized annually after the resumption of business.

(C) If the war zone assets have been insured against war risks, but have not yet received compensation, the "Wartime Assets Insured Against War Risks" should be debited and the "Wartime Asset War Risk Reserve" should be credited. After receiving full compensation, or only receiving partial compensation, the amount of compensation should be deducted from the "Wartime Property Loss Fee" account and then included in the "Deferred Assets" to be amortized from the annual profits.

(D) Wartime special expenses are maintained (such as expenses for retaining some employees, and guards for factories) or paid from government bonds, or from borrowing for operation. The war has been prolonged to one year and four months—this wartime special expense is considerable. I think it can be included in the new account "Wartime Special Expenses" and also treated as a "Deferred Asset" to be amortized annually in the future.

(E) "Accounts Payable" should be planned in advance for phased payment after the resumption of business and listed in the "Wartime Accounts Payable" account. "Accounts Receivable" that cannot be recovered can be listed in the "Wartime Bad Debts" account. The various assets "Depreciation Reserves" from previous years' settlements should still be listed and included in the "Asset Loss Fee" according to the book value, and gradually eliminated after the resumption of business. I wonder if this is reasonable.

### Thinking of Air Raid Alarms

— Jianbin

Hong Kong has been practicing air raid alarms one after another. The strange sound reminds people of Guangzhou, which has fallen. There were also air raid alarms there. Not only during the day, but also many times every day. The feeling of the citizens has shown a numb state. Even at that time, I was still rolling around in bed every morning. The first alarm wailed, and then the emergency alarm rang, the shaking sound, rising and falling, seemed to be foretelling that the Japanese invaders were about to start work. As usual, I hurriedly rolled out of bed, rushed to the rooftop, and watched the air and ground artillery battles with sleepy eyes. At this time, the entire city was bathed in the light of the morning sun, and the hope of all citizens was pinned on the anti-aircraft artillery team. Such experience did not last long, and then Greater Guangzhou fell, and Zengcheng was lost and fell. When the alarm could still sound, the local authorities on high had not properly prepared how to defend this birthplace of revolution, how to strike the strikers with strikes, just like John Bull today, who is sounding air raid alarms in his colony on the one hand, and unwilling to form an iron line of peace in Europe on the other, to thoroughly strike fascism.

In Guangzhou, after the emergency alarm sounded, the anti-aircraft artillery battle rumbled! With the sound reverberating through the sky, the lights went out, the radio stopped working, and the tap water could no longer be turned on. Industry entered a semi-suspended state. The residents of Guangzhou had long experienced this. Hong Kong, this paradise without the smell of gunpowder, finally sounded the alarm for the first time today. I think the shameless and lewd people should be vigilant, right? The terrible experience, I don't know which day it will fall on them. The few wails of the alarm are to warn these people who have forgotten their motherland that the motherland needs them, and that they should not continue to live in a drunken dream.

Today, the responsibility of sounding the alarm in the country has been shouldered by the invaders. When our divine eagles fly over the skies of Guangzhou, Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai, wasn't the Japanese army's alarm sounding sadly everywhere? Gorky translated by Fan Xun

### When Lonely

— Gorky, translated by Fan Xun

Last night, when I was passing through the Torokou Bridge, I saw a young woman standing silently. This petite woman hooked her arm, wearing brown gloves, on the railing of the bridge. I watched for a while, thinking she was going to jump into the Neva River. But she just stuck out her clever tongue and posed maliciously at the moon in space.

The moon was like a cunning old fox, slipping lightly between the smoky clouds. It was round and big, like a drunken face of a drunkard. Maybe this woman had eaten its loss. Her actions were retaliatory. At least as I saw it, his pose towards the moon was very cold.

After seeing this interesting thing, I remembered other similar small things, which made me laugh out loud in my memory. As I see it, when a person is lonely and alone—at least he thinks there is no one else beside him—his behavior is like that of a mentally ill madman. I can't think of any other word to call these people who make strange movements.

The first time I saw someone's abnormal behavior when living alone was in my childhood. After a certain circus show ended, I saw the English fool Lang Er, who played the clown, walking along a corridor with no one in it. When he walked past a large mirror, he suddenly took off the tall hat on his head and respectfully bowed to his own shadow. There was indeed no third person here, but I was sitting in a water trough right above his head. He wouldn't have discovered me, but I could see his legs clearly. When he bowed at the waist to himself, I even stuck my head out to look at him. On this day, I pondered silently, feeling confused and unable to explain. But now I think about it, Langdai was just a clown, a person who made strange movements for a living, at most just a British instrument.

Many years later, one day, I went to visit Anjiaotu Chafujun, and someone told me that he was in the garden. When I walked into the garden gate, I saw him sitting there alone, trying to catch the sunlight with his hat and put it on his head. Of course, his wishful thinking would not succeed. I could see how annoyed he was by his repeated failures. His face became redder and redder. He quickly hit his knees with the hat, hurriedly put it on his head again, and finally, uninterested in this possible game, he kicked away the puppy beside him and cast a final glance at the sky with half-closed eyes, and walked lightly back to his own house. He saw me at the door, and he smiled and said to me, "Have you read Bai Mengte Xie's poems about rhythm? Oh! The sun is smiling at the grass! What a stupid guy, isn't it? In Russia, it laughs at the soap bubbles of Kachin (washerwoman), and here it laughs at the sweat of Geda Tan (grass)."

Another time I spied on him trying to stuff a thick red pencil into a narrow medicine bottle, of course to no avail. He probably knew he was conducting a great experiment to break a physical law, and he used the perseverance and patience of a scholar to do this ridiculous trick.

Lottoerstay spoke softly to a stone dragon: "Um—are you happy?" This little animal was lying on a stone in the shrubbery, sunning itself. Tolstoy stood quietly in front of it, still in his old style, with his hands inserted in the pockets of his wide coat. Finally, this great writer looked around cautiously, and finally sighed and said firmly: "If I were like you, I would not find happiness."

The great chemist Tie Xu Wensi Ji was sitting in his own dining room, holding a shallow teacup in his hand, reflecting his own shadow. He shouted loudly to the teacup: "Hey! Old fellow, what are you doing alone?" But the shadow coldly did not respond to him. Tie Xu Wensi Ji sighed for a long time, and his face gradually darkened. He frowned at his own image, twitching his nose, looking like an old elephant's wrinkled forehead and long nose.

The famous novelist Li Skowen sat alone at the table, tearing the cotton into small pieces and throwing them into the bowl one by one. Each time this small and soft cotton touched the bottom of the bowl, he pricked up his ears to listen to whether the cotton would make a sound in the bowl.

Voltrudis Ji Mus put a shoe in front of him and sternly ordered himself to walk. "I know you won't walk." He said smugly and proudly: "Look—without me, you can't get to where you want to go."

"What are you doing, Dad!" I broke in unexpectedly. He looked at me and said in self-deprecation: "You ask me about the shoes! These shoes are so small that they only wear to my heels. Now they always make these bad shoes."

When women are alone decorating or joking, they often talk to themselves. Once I saw a beautiful and well-educated woman sitting alone in an armchair by the window eating candy. Each time she lifted the food in her heart with delicate candy tongs, she murmured, "Now I'm going to eat you—" When she finished eating, she said to herself, "Wasn't I the one who ate you?"

There was only a beautiful young black woman in the lounge of a certain theater. She stopped in front of every mirror for a while. Suddenly, I heard her say: "However—a person always has to die."

There was no one else here except her and me. I was also too late and didn't get into the venue. But I was really too late and didn't see the first half of the strange drama she was performing. The room was dark, and she never thought there was anyone else in the room besides her. I think she wouldn't have asked a stranger such an unconventional question if she saw me. I don't think she ever knew that I was exploring such a profound philosophy.

### From the New Enlightenment Movement to Spiritual Mobilization

— Tongfang

The New Enlightenment Movement is currently the most urgent cultural and intellectual movement that needs to be promoted. China's war of resistance has developed to the present stage, and we undoubtedly need a strong national consciousness to complete the salvaging of the nation. Although culture and thought belong to the realm of ideology, they are an indispensable driving force for social development. The reason we can today form such a strong and firm national united front and launch such a great war of resistance is entirely due to the nationwide unity, the common belief in resisting aggression and insulting the nation, and thinking. Although any thought originates from practice, in order to achieve effective practice, various thoughts should be carefully discussed and criticized to make them consistent with practice. After the thoughts of the people across the country naturally converge, a unified opinion can be fully expressed, and human and material resources can be fully utilized. Therefore, in the current China, based on the requirements of practical development, it is necessary to widely promote the New Enlightenment Movement in thought and culture, unify opinions from all sides, and establish a solid ideological front to defeat various incomplete thoughts during the war of resistance and sweep away various traditional fallacies and theories. This is of the utmost urgency.

From this point, we must pay attention to the national spiritual mobilization that Chairman Chiang has shown us. At present, as the war of resistance enters the second stage and the enemy is in a dilemma, the introduction of the spiritual mobilization program can not only strengthen our spiritual consciousness and implement our determination to resist aggression and defend the nation, thereby laying the foundation for a unified national thought, but also indicate the common goals of Chinese thought at the current stage, serving as an important preparation for building a new China in the future. I think this is exactly the same as the New Enlightenment Movement, both being movements necessary to promote national spiritual arming.

The spiritual mobilization program stipulates the tasks that Chinese citizens should fulfill today. It requires us to regard the nation-state as paramount, concentrate our thoughts and will, and strive for survival. It also proposes that the ultimate goal of the war of resistance is to establish an independent, free, equal, and people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed Three Principles of the People republic. It also aims to eliminate selfish and self-interested feudal ideas and establish a new outlook on life necessary during the war of resistance. It can be said to be the backbone of spiritual mobilization. Just from the aspects of transforming national spirit, eliminating traditional bad habits, actively enriching, and concentrating national will, it is already known that spiritual mobilization not only provides the path that China's future ideological movement should take, but also is a higher stage of development for national unity against foreign aggression. From the union of various parties, factions, and stages, it proceeds to the unification of thought and the concentration of spirit. Therefore, all traitorous thoughts that shake the war of resistance, undermine national unity, and harm national interests should be completely eliminated so that the ideal of democratic politics can be realized.

However, in order to achieve the various common goals of spiritual mobilization, we must still strive to promote the mass literacy movement, that is to say, we cannot ignore the development of the New Enlightenment Movement in thought to complete the final task of resisting aggression and building the nation.

In the process of the second phase of the war of resistance, we should focus on military development, but mobilizing the thoughts of the entire nation cannot be ignored. Therefore, we urgently need to sweep away all traditional thoughts that are unfavorable to the war of resistance and promote the spiritual foundation for building a new China. If we acknowledge the importance of the New Enlightenment Movement to resisting aggression and building the nation, then we should accept the spiritual mobilization program to form a broad ideological front as the main basis for practice! In short,

### Digging Trenches

— Fan Zhi

Now our guerrillas have become a mighty force, and the × army feels uneasy day and night. News of attacks on ×× constantly pours into the × people's camp. They are all terrified and can only dig trenches and build high walls to strengthen their defense. Therefore, the need to dig trenches is now extremely urgent.

Digging trenches requires a large amount of manpower. They go to the countryside and forcibly conscript laborers everywhere. When they arrive at a house, they see a man, whether old or strong, and tie them up one by one with rough hemp ropes, leading them away in strings.

When walking along the way, they are not allowed to shout or cry. Violating these two "orders" will result in a severe beating. Anyone who attempts to escape will be immediately shot and killed. After arriving at their destination, each person is given an iron hoe or a shovel, and they are ordered to start digging, digging, and digging non-stop in the designated place—

At night, it is time to rest. The place to sleep is the trench that they have dug with their own labor. Bitterly cold wind keeps attacking from above, and the muddy ground is icy cold below. Hungry and exhausted, they huddle together in piles. Sitting, standing, or lying down, there is no peace, and there will not be a minute of sleep all night.

Before dawn, they are ordered to work again: Dig! Dig! Dig non-stop!

As for eating, there is only one meal a day, and each person only gets a bowl of rice, weighing only four taels. Not only is there no vegetables! But there is no soup, not even pickles. Haven't you learned to eat with your hands? No! Their "order" is that you are not allowed to grab it with your hands, you can only "lick" it up like a dog eating excrement! Anyone who dares to grab it with their hands will immediately be stabbed with a bayonet. This is "light punishment," and sometimes it will result in death!

When it is time to go to the toilet, they are not allowed to leave the trench a single step. The "order" is to "defecate" in the trench.

While working, they are not allowed to talk or laugh, and even crying is not allowed. The "order" is to be quiet! Whenever the supervising × army comes, whoever sees them must bow, and must bow with a smiling face. Otherwise, it will be considered impolite and they will definitely be slapped.

Anyone who dies because they cannot bear the bitterness of hunger and cold, or who is beaten to death or killed for violating the "order," the "order" does not allow them to be moved for burial. Instead, their corpses are used as mud and piled on top of the trench, to thicken the dirt parapet.

In short, the compatriots who are taken away all sacrifice themselves in the trenches: they work in the trenches, sleep in the trenches, defecate in the trenches, and are buried in the trenches when they die—it is pitiful that there are still some compatriots who are not dead, who are forced by the enemy to dig for them! Dig!—digging non-stop!

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Then why didn't you kill me?"

"It's too late, too late!"

"What time?"

"It should have been last night, not today."

She was expressing her remaining one-time friendship for today.

"Do you regret it?"

"—No!"

Emotional turbulence is limited: the peak of sudden change is only a moment, and after a long time, it naturally becomes ordinary. She stopped crying, gradually returned to normal, brushed her teeth, washed her face, and began the habits of daily life again. Finally, she walked away peacefully.

He and his comrades jointly decided on a letter to her father—the general idea was to demand five million yuan, to be delivered to a certain person at a certain place within three days. During this period, if any accident occurred that caused misfortune to the messenger... everything was guaranteed with her life. He sent a comrade to send this letter to her house.

Then, he found another comrade and bought her two small breads and a bottle of milk for breakfast. She suspected that the milk was poisoned, and did not even eat the small breads. At the same time, she also did not feel hungry.

In order to dispel her boredom, she inadvertently walked into their room. The room had changed, it was a mess, it was no longer as beautiful as last night. The tables, chairs, and all the utensils in the room were moved away from their proper positions and concentrated in a corner; the remaining open space was used as a bed for them to spend the night. They had no pillows, no bedding, only a thin felt blanket folded on the ground. They had not been up for long, and had no time to tidy up. Their clothes, which had been pressed into a pile, had not yet been unfolded. There were fewer of them than last night, now there were only three people left; some were tidying up the room, seemingly afraid that someone would see through some kind of flaw, others were biting on old buns that seemed to be from yesterday, eating them especially sweetly. The cheapest buns, compared to their neat clothes and wealthy appearance, were indeed an extremely disharmonious imaginative construct, and not a page of true portrayal. Therefore, it aroused in her a kind of inexplicable strangeness.
