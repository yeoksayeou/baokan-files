### Intensify Production, Persist in the War of Resistance

— Li Fuchun

Comrades, we haven't undertaken production movements on a large scale before. Today, we must start implementing them in a planned and large-scale manner. This is our new ×× task that the Party has entrusted to each of us at this moment of welcoming a new stage in the national war of resistance!

Regarding the production movement, we still lack a great deal of experience and achievements to fully explain and substantiate my report. Therefore, I can only provide a summarized and concise explanation and enlightenment based on the instructions of the Central Committee. I hope that everyone will enrich our experience and promote our achievements in the practice of production and in the process of labor in the future.

I. Significance and Purpose of the Production Movement

In today's transition to a new stage of the War of Resistance, we must prepare to overcome all difficulties and overcome all obstacles in order to win the final victory of the War of Resistance. We estimate that the future development of the War of Resistance and the actual situation of the border region will lead to an increase in financial, economic, and material difficulties. Our current task should be to overcome these difficulties.

To overcome difficulties, we must first rely on our own strength. In other words, we must rely on our own efforts, participate in labor ourselves, and use our own labor to develop our agriculture, industry, and various productions and commercial trade. This ensures that our rear and front lines are supplied with financial, economic, and material resources, unaffected by war damage, and capable of self-sufficiency. The development of the production movement enables our living conditions to be coordinated and consistent with the conditions of war, in order to achieve a smoother development of the future of the War of Resistance.

Furthermore, developing the production movement will not only enable us to overcome difficulties and obstacles but also further improve our lives. Comrades, we know that we advocate the thorough realization of the Three People's Principles; we advocate persisting in the War of Resistance to achieve the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Republic of China. This is the national principle of realizing the Three People's Principles. A democratic government has already been established in the border region. Recently, based on the laws of the National Government and the Program for National Reconstruction during the War of Resistance, we have also opened a council representing the entire people of the border region. This is the national principle of realizing the Three People's Principles. Now, we must also develop the production movement to further improve the lives of the people. This is a concrete manifestation of our thorough realization of the principle of people's livelihood of the Three People's Principles.

Then, our production movement conference today can also be called a People's Livelihood Principle Conference. If we can improve the lives of the people during the War of Resistance, we will definitely be able to carry out the work of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction even better; we will definitely be able to exert the great power of the national war of resistance.

Developing the production movement can solve our future financial, economic, and material difficulties. Not only should the border region, which is a part of our country, do this, but also from a national perspective, we should do this to overcome unprecedented difficulties and strive for final victory. Our border region's production movement should play a promoting and exemplary role in the country; telling the country about our experiences and achievements in developing the production movement, providing guidelines and methods for overcoming difficulties, and greatly developing the production movement throughout the country. This enables the people of the whole country to have a strong confidence in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance and the inevitable success of national reconstruction—backward rural areas will definitely be able to progress, and the progress and development of the vast rural areas will definitely be able to finally defeat the cities now occupied by × people. This strong confidence is a concrete and necessary condition for us to persist in the War of Resistance, persist in a protracted war, and finally defeat the × people. In short, our purpose in developing the production movement in the border region is as follows:

First, to overcome our border region's financial, economic, and material difficulties, based on the existing material conditions, we must achieve self-sufficiency in agricultural and industrial production of all kinds: further improve the people's lives, and better realize the principle of people's livelihood of the Three People's Principles.

Second, to promote the national production movement with the exemplary example of our border region's development of the main production movement; to strengthen the confidence of the people of the whole country in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance. To shatter the traitorous Trotskyites' saying: "If the big cities are lost, the economy will be in difficulty, and the War of Resistance will inevitably perish."

Third, in developing the production movement, each of us must participate in physical labor. In terms of ideology, we can change the incorrect view that many people in the past have held of looking down on physical labor. Go to the production front! Closely link theory with practice. In the practice of labor. We can deeply experience the truth of "Labor is sacred."

Fourth, participating in the production movement can strengthen our bodies. In the great national war of resistance, in the protracted and brutal struggle, we not only need correct strategies and tactics to disintegrate and eliminate the × people, but we also need to have strong and unyielding bodies in order to cope with the great disaster of the future. In the practice of labor, we will forge our bodies into steel and iron. When we go to the front line to fight the × people, we will definitely be able to eliminate the ferocious × people in our own hands!

Comrades! How can we achieve our goals? We need everyone to "do it ourselves" in order to accomplish this great and arduous task!

II. Difficulties in Our Development of the Production Movement and How to Overcome Them

We have never done such unprecedented work—a large-scale, fully mobilized production movement. From the actual situation in the border region, difficulties exist. Our difficulties:

First, insufficient labor and uneven labor. The vast number of cadres who came from the ranks of peasants and workers have superior labor. However, many staff members in our institutions and students in our schools have never participated in physical labor, never grown vegetables, and never cultivated the land. Therefore, some organs, troops, schools, and mass groups have strong labor, while others have weak labor. This reveals the phenomenon of insufficient labor or uneven labor. This is the first difficulty in our production movement.

Second, the difficulty of cultivated land. In our border region, the land is vast and the population is sparse. There are vast areas of land, but no one to cultivate them. However, some places have a very concentrated population and lack land for cultivation. For example, in the area within 20 li around Yan'an, there are more than 30,000 people, and there is not enough cultivated land to distribute. This is our second difficulty.

Third, capital difficulty. To develop the production movement in the border region, we must first develop morning agriculture, and then seek the development of industry and commerce. However, because of our insufficient capital, we feel the difficulty of insufficient tools and insufficient draft cattle in agricultural production. As for the industries in our border region, there was no foundation in the past, and commerce has never been very developed. Insufficient capital is our third difficulty.

Fourth, the lack of specialized technical talents. In agriculture, industry, and commerce, we feel that there is a great lack of specialized technical talents, and there are not enough talents to organize and lead large-scale production movements. This is our fourth difficulty.

Fifth, difficulties in terms of time, location, and geographical advantages. In the past, our agricultural production in northern Shaanxi can be said to have "relied on the heavens for food." Since our × Route Army came to northern Shaanxi more than three years ago, because the × people attacked the entire China, northern Shaanxi has become a fortress for the War of Resistance in the Northwest; we mobilized the people of the entire border region to participate in the War of Resistance, and "national peace and people's well-being" was of course out of the question; but, just in terms of agricultural production, it can be said that "the weather was favorable." However, according to what the comrades in northern Shaanxi said, the droughts in northern Shaanxi have a cycle of once every three years and once every five years; there was too much snow last year, and there was not enough rain, and there is a possibility of a drought this year. This is our fifth difficulty.

Are we able to overcome the above five difficulties? Our answer is: we are able to overcome difficulties—we are fully capable of overcoming difficulties!

First, how to overcome the difficulty of insufficient and uneven labor. We can coordinate appropriately when using labor; those with strong labor will plow deep and reclaim wasteland; those with weak labor will fertilize and weed. All Party, government, and military organs, troops, schools, and mass organizations in our entire border region should coordinate with the labor of the vast masses in the border region based on our own labor conditions, and adjust each other. At the same time, the various departments and units of the Party, government, military, schools, and mass organizations should also carry out their own adjustment work, such as logistics personnel, communicators, service personnel, cooks, and horsemen. We can adjust them and save their labor for production; (for example, expanding preparations for students to cook their own meals and pulling the cooks out to farm the land) the work of odd-job men can be replaced by staff or students; I think the first difficulty is likely to be overcome.

Second, how to overcome the difficulty of cultivated land. The adjustment of land and population, requiring appropriate coordination, is more difficult; but. This adjustment work is absolutely necessary. We organize the majority of the large organs, special schools, and mass organizations to carry out the necessary decentralization in an organized and planned manner. The troops can build land and the rear can use the method of "people adapting to the land" to solve the cultivated land problem. This is entirely possible.

Third, how to overcome the difficulty of insufficient capital. If we do not have enough capital, we can carry out a widespread conservation movement and use the money we save to train classes. They have already done this, and the results are very good. Their staff and students, in extremely difficult circumstances, went up the mountains to collect firewood and down the ravines to carry water, saving more than two hundred yuan for production funds. If all the Party, government, and military organizations and departments did this - saving some grain, oil, paper, stationery, etc. Regular and planned production movements for one or two months are not a problem. Comrades! I want to promote our style of arduous struggle and heroic struggle! National industrialists and businessmen are welcome to invest in our border region and develop our border region's national defense economic construction. Our border region government is happy to accept, protect, and reward all production investments that are beneficial to the War of Resistance!

Fourth, how to overcome the difficulty of lack of technical talents. In terms of specialized technical talents to guide agricultural production, on the one hand, we can hire agricultural specialists to guide; at the same time, we must also ask for advice from those old people in ×bei who do not know a single character, because they have practical work experience and are familiar with the actual situation in ×bei. Fan Chi asked to learn about farming. Confucius said: "I am not as good as the old farmer"; the experience of the "old farmer" in ×bei is worth our careful study and development!

Fifth, how to overcome the difficulties in terms of time, location, and geographical advantages. Although natural disasters such as floods and droughts are the power of nature, things are done by people, and human power can also conquer nature. In order to reduce or eliminate droughts, we should pay attention to water conservancy, afforestation, improving production methods, and selecting drought-resistant seeds.

III. Where is Our Guarantee?

We are not only able to overcome the difficulties mentioned above, but we also have favorable conditions for developing the production movement in the border region, guaranteeing the completion of our great production task. Where is our guarantee?

First, the vast masses in the border region are the main force in completing our production tasks; there are two million people in the border region. These two million people have been relieved of the pain of excessive taxes and levies and exploitation under a democratic life. Realizing the principle of people's livelihood, everyone is united around the border region government with one heart and one mind; they will definitely be able to respond to the call of the border region, improve their labor enthusiasm, and complete their tasks.

Second, there are approximately 50,000 people in all Party, government, and military organs and schools in the entire border region who are separated from production; organizing these 50,000 people collectively is a great dynamic force. Everyone is consciously and voluntarily striving for the revolution, and every member of these 50,000 people understands the necessity and importance of participating in the movement of life. We can estimate that: when this dynamic force of 50,000 people. When they step onto the production front on a large scale and unleash their labor firepower, they will surely accomplish their tasks.

Third, the style of our border region is one of arduous struggle; we are Bolsheviks, and enduring hardship and hard work are our daily routine; when we encounter any difficulties, we must fight against difficulties, and we will never surrender to difficulties; this is our revolutionary tradition, and every Party member should carry forward our revolutionary tradition in this production movement to ensure the completion of our tasks.

Fourth, although we have not carried out large-scale production movements in the past, small-scale production movements in individual places have achieved great results; therefore, we have considerable experience in production movements; (such as the rear garrison troops of the × Route Army, security forces, guard battalions, various organs, and various schools who chopped firewood, burned charcoal, raised pigs, planted vegetables, etc. last year) Gather these experiences, organize them, use them as basic experiences, and then develop them; this is the most reliable guarantee for us to complete our production tasks.

IV. Specific Plan for the Production Movement

First, developing agriculture is a central link in our production movement—I have already said that our production movement should develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, but we must take the development of agricultural production as the central link. Because the border region is a relatively backward agricultural area, there is vast land that can be cultivated. Moreover, we can universally mobilize the vast masses and all Party, government, and military organs, troops, schools, and mass organizations to participate in agricultural production to solve our own food problems. Secondly, we must develop the industry of the border region, only because the industry of the border region had no foundation in the past; therefore, we must start with handicrafts and national defense industries. We must develop the commerce of the border region. Only because transportation in the border region is inconvenient and production is not, we must universally develop the cooperative movement to ensure the supply of daily necessities in the border region and to transport the products of the border region out.

Second, specific requirements for developing agricultural production - Since developing agriculture is our central task, we require all two million people in the entire border region and all Party, government, military organs, schools, mass organizations, garrison troops, and security forces to participate in agricultural production and strive to increase agricultural production.

Third, how to carry out the work specifically—planting land and planting grain. The vast masses and the Border Region Council have already discussed in detail and made specific plans in this year's spring plowing movement, mobilizing all two million people in the entire border region to participate in spring plowing, and to achieve:

1. Plan to reclaim 600,000 mu of wasteland this year;

2. Improve seeds;

3. Improve agricultural production tools; improve farming methods - deep plowing, fertilization, and weeding.

With efforts from all aspects, we can ensure that the total grain production will increase by 20% this year. This will guarantee the improvement of people's lives; at the same time, because of the increase in the total production volume, our national salvation public grain can also be increased, guaranteeing the troops who have escaped from production for one year. We can see that the two million people in the border region actively participate in the production movement and complete their tasks under the life of democratic politics. How to mobilize, organize, and lead two million people to complete the task requires the hard work of our Border Region Party Committee, Border Region Government, and mass organizations.

Fourth, key points to pay attention to in mobilizing, organizing, and leading the masses to participate in agricultural production:

1. Governments at all levels must carry out detailed investigation work: a detailed investigation should be conducted on the population, cultivated land, wasteland, draft cattle, agricultural tools, etc.; we must quickly complete this work so that the accurate numbers can be combined with the actual situation for appropriate adjustments, which is what the local government, Party department, and mass organizations should do first.

2. Our mobilization work should be carried out in an educational and enlightening manner, not in a coercive manner; we must conduct detailed explanations and patient persuasion to make every person in the border region understand that we want to improve the lives of the people by developing the production movement.

3. In organizing the labor force of the masses, in addition to organizing the labor of strong men, special attention should be paid to organizing women to participate in production; in the past, not many women in the border region participated in production, and some places even thought that it was a shameful thing for women to participate in production; in this regard, we must carry out a lot of education and persuasion work, especially requiring most of our women cadres to actively participate in the production movement and play an exemplary role. We hope that our cadres in ×bei will do more political work for their wives and mobilize them to go to the production front. Our comrades should use their own exemplary behavior to influence the women of the entire border region. In addition, we should also organize children, the elderly, and families of anti-Japanese soldiers so that they can enthusiastically and actively participate in production. In short, we must organize all the people in the entire border region, regardless of age or gender, into the production movement: this is what is called truly "exerting efforts if they have strength"!

4. Local governments should help the people adjust cultivated land, labor, draft cattle, tools, etc. On the one hand, we can encourage the people to automatically solve problems; at the same time, if the people need the government to help, we should come up with many ways to help them solve problems.

5. Carry out production education work, educate the people, and help the people. Improve farming methods, improve sowing methods, and improve tools, to achieve: All existing cultivated land should be deeply plowed, but the places where deep plowing is carried out do not give up the work of opening up wasteland. To achieve: All newly opened wasteland must be turned twice; but, the places where wasteland is opened up do not stop deep plowing. Regardless of deep plowing or wasteland opening, more fertilizer should be added and weeding should be carried out diligently, so that the productivity of the land can be increased.

6. The staff of the local government agencies should stand in front of the people, actively participate in production, play an exemplary role, and lead the people to move forward by leaps and bounds. Do not "just ask people to do it, but don't do it yourself:", which will have a very bad impact on the people.

7. Implement a broad reward system to greatly improve the labor enthusiasm of laborers. This year, we want to produce thousands of labor heroes. (The border region government has done it in the past, and the results are very good)

8. Strictly implement the work inspection system. In order to complete our production tasks, we must first require all Party, government, and military agencies to take consistent steps, consistent leadership, and constant supervision and inspection: this year, we are preparing to conduct work inspections on the production movement to see whether our work in all aspects can be gradually realized in accordance with the production plan.

It is hoped that the participating senators, responsible comrades of the Border Region Party Committee, the Border Region Government, and the mass organizations will study these points of view in detail and apply them appropriately to specific work.

Fifth, those who have left production must also produce - All Party, government, and military agencies, troops, schools, and mass organizations that have left production must participate in production. Here, I would like to raise the following specific tasks and ask the responsible comrades of the Party, government, and military organizations to pay close attention to them and implement them with reference:

1. The distribution of production tasks to Party, government, and military organizations:

Border Region Government and below: 16,500 dan

Military agencies, schools: 12,500 dan

Central agencies and directly affiliated schools: 1,000 dan

2. Explanation of the production tasks below the border region level: In the border region, we plan to complete 16,500 dan of fine grain below the border region level (approximately 30,000 dan of rough grain). Although this number is large, it is not a problem to complete it. Of course, the completion of this plan requires our cadres and comrades at the border region level, especially the security forces of the entire border region, to complete it with a fighting spirit. In this regard, attention should be paid to: the adjustment of land and labor, a detailed investigation and concrete understanding should be conducted on how much land and wasteland a certain step has, and on the fertility or barrenness of the soil in the base county. For example, there is less grain production in the three border lands, and there is more grain production in the ring land. Geographical conditions are very important for agricultural production, and the entire border region cannot be averaged. Attention should also be paid to: cooperation with the vast people and obtaining the help of the vast masses in the work. This is a necessary condition for completing the production task. Why is it necessary for the Party, government, military, schools, and mass organizations below the border region level who have escaped production to complete the food to achieve self-sufficiency? Our reasons are: (1) The comrades below the border region level have the most experience in agricultural production, especially the labor force of the security forces in the entire border region is the strongest. (2) The comrades below the border region level are the easiest to get close to the masses. They can not only help the masses promote the production of the masses, but also obtain the help of the vast masses. (3) The Party, government, and military organizations below the border region level are scattered throughout the border region, and they do not have the difficulty of insufficient land and uneven manpower. (4) Most of the comrades below the border region level are comrades from northern Shaanxi. Not only are they suitable for the people and the land, but in the past ten years of revolutionary struggle, they have been the most full of the spirit of arduous struggle. With these four reasons, I think that our comrades at the first level can not only complete the task, but even exceed the task.

3. Explanation of the production tasks of military agencies, schools, and the × Route Army garrison troops: Our requirement for the military is to complete 12,500 dan of fine grain (equivalent to 25,000 dan of mixed grain). This number is not large, because the number of people in the military is quite large, and the labor force is also quite strong. I think: under the basic policy of not hindering learning and not hindering work, carry forward the style of Kangda—we are the vanguard of the workers!" There is no problem for them to complete the task.

4. Explanation of the production tasks of central agencies and directly affiliated schools: For the agencies and schools directly under the Central Government, we require the completion of 1,000 dan of fine grain. Although this number is not large; on the one hand, because the number of people is small, and on the other hand, because the labor force is small, according to our estimation, the completion of the task of 1,000 dan of fine grain still requires great efforts from our comrades below the central level.

Sixth, about the problem of planting vegetables - We require all Party, government, and military organizations and all food units to universally carry out the vegetable planting campaign. (Planting horse feed in passing) In the future, no matter which part it is, it must be able to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables, and it must also be able to eat more vegetables. We are preparing to universally reduce the vegetable money starting from July, and the reduction standards are as follows:

1. Those who originally paid seven points will be reduced by four points and issued three points.

2. Those who originally paid five points will be reduced by three points and issued two points.

3. Those who originally paid four points will be reduced by two points and issued two points.

4. The original number of troops is generally reduced by only one point.

Seventh, about the production of agricultural by-products - According to the existing strength, various agencies, troops, and schools should feed pigs and sheep themselves, and raise pigs to improve their own lives; we feed the pigs so fat and raise the sheep so fat, everyone eats a few more meals of meat a week, I think everyone will not disapprove, right?

Eighth, about industrial production - Because we had no industrial foundation in the border region in the past. At present, we can only start with handicrafts and national defense industries:

1. In the future, our problem of clothing will become more and more difficult, we must build large textile factories and develop the organization of household handicrafts. So that our clothing problem can be properly solved.

2. Start to establish a preliminary national defense industry; mining coal mines, expanding oil factories and paper mills, increasing salt production, and opening small-scale manufacturing plants for other daily necessities and military supplies.

3. Establish a natural science research institute.

4. Encourage private enterprises and private investment, and help the people develop various handicrafts.

Ninth, about the development of commerce - The universal development of the cooperative movement is a necessary condition for improving the lives of the people, but private business should also be encouraged:

1. In the future, cooperatives in various parts of the border region should ensure that the people enthusiastically join, so that these cooperatives become the cooperatives of the vast masses themselves. Become a tool to improve the lives of the people.

2. The cooperatives of various organizational departments should be unified. The cooperatives of various Party, government, and military departments should each have their unified leadership in order to achieve the effect of directing one's arms and fingers. The cooperatives of the troops should be unified under the supply department of the garrison troops; the cooperatives of the people in various places should be unified under the overall construction leadership of the border region government; the cooperatives of the central agencies and directly affiliated schools should be unified under the Central Finance and Economics Department.

3. Points to pay attention to in running cooperatives: (1) The revenue and expenditure accounts must be clear; (2) Adjust materials, do not "stock up on scarce goods"! (3) When distributing dividends, a portion of the funds should be set aside for the development of the cooperative. (4) Be able to supply the things and daily necessities that the public needs. To achieve improving life.

4. Regarding private business; in order to develop the commerce of the border region, the border region government should protect and encourage private commerce. However, it is necessary to prevent profiteering and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants.

(To be continued)

Editorial

### Japanese Intimidation of England

According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo yesterday, the "Kokumin Shimbun," the organ of the Japanese military, published an article yesterday threatening the personal safety of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The article stated that Kerr's activities in Chongqing were deliberately strengthening British aid to China's resistance against Japan. It further falsely accused the British Ambassador of using his position to protect Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife. Finally, it warned: "If he continues to provide secret assistance and abuse his diplomatic privileges in the future, Japan will not be able to guarantee his safety."

This is not only a problem for the British Ambassador personally, but also an intimidation of England in reality. On the other hand, it is an insult to our supreme leader and our sacred war of resistance. We truly lack the courage to remain silent regarding such remarks. First of all, we must declare that we are determined to fight heroically and sacrifice valiantly to achieve final victory in our sacred resistance against Japan. We do not need to resort to base means. Our supreme leader's upright actions do not require the protection of foreign "diplomatic privileges." Facts speak louder than sophistry. The reason former British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was strafed was because the Japanese suspected that important Chinese officials were traveling with him. But what was the result? Furthermore, the bombing of the American "Panay" by Japanese aircraft was also motivated by the same intent, and its result only proved the fear and incompetence of the aggressors. In fact, it is the aggressors, not us, who are using foreign protection. The Japanese planes repeatedly This is something that only the invading Japanese themselves know clearly! Moreover, Japanese goods are everywhere falsely labeling themselves with foreign trademarks for sale in the world market, even falsely claiming to be Chinese goods and dumping them in our country's markets. Is there anything in the world that surpasses this?

However, here we want to conduct a review and judgment of the aggressors' view of Sino-British relations. Not long ago, exhausted from the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese indeed intended to seek peace. They requested England to mediate, but the British Ambassador, who knew our country best, did not accommodate their request. Therefore, the militaristic warlords of Japan harbor resentment towards them. At the same time, Japan believes that England's Far Eastern policy cannot be shaken in the slightest. Therefore, recently, on the one hand, they have launched an anti-British movement, and on the other hand, they have greatly intimidated England. The "Kokumin Shimbun" often publishes editorials discussing Sino-British relations, believing that in order to ensure its interests in China, England will continue to aid China's resistance against Japan. At the same time, they have also deeply believed in our conviction to resist to the end. They predict that we will definitely resolutely carry out mountain warfare in Chongqing to the end, even if it means scorching Guilin. They also assume that even if Kunming and Chongqing fall, our supreme leader will definitely not yield. They believe that the "strength" of the "Chiang regime" lies in (1) the spiritual sympathy of England, France, and the Soviet Union, (2) diplomatic assistance, and (3) the transportation of weapons; and that this assistance will become more active in the future.

The Japanese have fully exposed their "fierce appearance but weak inside" to this point. They mock: England and France have already fully tasted the "bitter cup" of Germany and Italy, and England and France will no longer dare to taste a larger "bitter cup" in Asia. However, they have never dared to join the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance strongly demanded by Hitler, or at least not dare to offend England and France openly. Recently, they even ordered their ambassador to England, Mamoru Shigemitsu, to take advantage of the eventful situation in Europe to carry out diplomatic adjustments with England. The Japanese have repeatedly bowed down to the Soviet Union, which has a tough attitude. It is not difficult to imagine how England should deal with such a "fierce-looking but weak-inside" country.

Over ten rifles and one pistol were seized.

### The Japanese Navy Suddenly Occupies Gulangyu, Further Threatening the Shanghai Concessions. A Traitor on Gulangyu is Shot by an Unidentified Assailant. The Japanese Army Uses Pretext of Protecting Overseas Chinese to Land Sailors, Meeting No Resistance.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 12th] Japanese sailors landed on Gulangyu today. A Japanese report claimed that while a senior Japanese naval officer was inspecting the area, the chairman of the pro-Japanese Chinese Chamber of Commerce was assassinated. Therefore, the Japanese Navy took the action of landing to protect the naval officer and assist in the investigation of the murderer. The status of Gulangyu is almost the same as that of the Shanghai International Settlement. Currently, there are no foreign troops stationed there, only one British destroyer is anchored there. The nearest American warship is in Shantou. A Japanese Navy spokesman told reporters today: "If a similar serious incident occurs in Shanghai, the Japanese Navy will take similar necessary actions in the Shanghai International Settlement."

[Xiamen, 12th] According to a dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the landing of Japanese naval landing forces in the Gulangyu Concession was because a certain Hong, the chairman of the puppet Xiamen Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was assassinated in the Gulangyu Concession yesterday morning. It is reported that Hong was walking on Nantou Road in Gulangyu at 11 o'clock yesterday morning when he was suddenly shot by an unknown assailant. Hong was shot several times and seriously injured. He was immediately taken to the Salvation Army Hospital in critical condition. Afterwards, the Japanese naval landing forces immediately landed, taking control of various key locations. The Japanese commander in Xiamen then issued a statement expressing "deep concern" about this "terrorist incident," saying that the Japanese Consul-General had notified the concession authorities in advance that the commander of the Japanese fleet and his staff would come to Gulangyu Concession to inspect, and Hong was accompanying the Japanese military inspectors. "Now that he has been assassinated, it is deeply regrettable, and we should pay close attention to it." The statement even stated that the landing of the Japanese naval landing forces was a "self-defense action" to protect the lives and property of the Japanese people, and claimed that the Japanese side had repeatedly requested the concession authorities to pay attention to the Chinese "plainclothes teams" and "unstable elements" secretly coming from the mainland, but the concession authorities showed "unfriendliness." The statement also stated, "The Japanese military's landing is entirely to eradicate anti-Japanese activities," ordering citizens to continue their business as usual and not to be alarmed, and warning against fleeing to other ports, otherwise, they will be regarded as "unstable elements" escaping and punished accordingly.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 12th] The Japanese here claim that the Japanese military dispatched troops to occupy Gulangyu, a public concession near Xiamen, on Friday because the concession authorities could not suppress the anti-Japanese movement. The Japanese military's move was entirely for self-defense, attempting to eliminate the anti-Japanese organs in the concession. It was also said that since the Japanese military occupied Xiamen last year, Gulangyu has become a center for anti-Japanese movements, which led to the assassination of the chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce last Thursday. This case is the "main reason" for occupying the concession. It was found that when the Japanese military entered the area, there were no accidents. Several foreign warships were anchored nearby. Gulangyu is a small island opposite Xiamen, with a population of 50,000, including about 250 foreigners. Furthermore, people from various countries here are paying close attention to the Japanese military's move. According to Chinese political circles, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, this is the first time that a public concession stipulated by Chinese and foreign treaties has been occupied.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Yesterday, Thursday, Hong Liesheng (transliteration), chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, was shot and killed by several Chinese assassins inside. The assassins escaped. The next day, the Japanese naval landing forces used the pretext to dispatch troops to occupy the Gulangyu Concession. Hong was a well-known pro-Japanese figure.

### Diplomatic Association Cables the United States, Calling for a Halt to Weapon Shipments to Japan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Japanese warlords are conducting unprecedentedly barbaric bombings in various parts of our country, and their weapons mainly come from our friendly nation, the United States. The Chinese National Diplomatic Association recently cabled Mr. Henry Stimson, Chairman of the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression,

expressing our country's determination to resist the war, and deeply hoping that the United States will strengthen its actions to resist the aggressor countries. The original cable translates as follows: Japan is carrying out unprecedentedly barbaric bombings of Chinese cities and residents, and its weapons mainly come from our friendly nation. This kind of cowardly murder can only strengthen our determination to resist the war. At the same time, we deeply believe that this will also strengthen the efforts of our friends to resist the aggressors. The Chinese National Diplomatic Association.

### American Ambassador Nelson T. Johnson Returns to China to Resume His Post

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] According to Shanghai news, American Ambassador Nelson T. Johnson left the United States for China on the 1st.

### The Situation in Shanghai is Unprecedentedly Serious. England and the United States Study Countermeasures. The Two Countries Prepare to Jointly Respond to the Demands Made by the Japanese Army to the Shanghai Municipal Council.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] This agency's reporter has learned from non-official sources that the British and American authorities are currently working together to prepare a formal response to Japan regarding the recent demands made by the Japanese army to the Shanghai Concession. Sources close to the State Department said that the State Department is studying the Shanghai issue and its situation separately and will exchange views with England before taking any action. The future response to Japan will be largely the same in wording as England's response. Well-informed sources said that the current Shanghai Concession issue is the most serious since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, non-official sources believe that Japan's recent refusal to form a military alliance with Germany and Italy has greatly benefited US-Japan relations. However, if Japan insists on its own way on the Shanghai Concession issue and is unwilling to compromise, the goodwill between the US and Japan will be lost again. Furthermore, observers predict that if Japan intends to take "drastic action" against the Shanghai Concession, it would be tantamount to indirectly supporting the "economic sanctions against Japan" proposal by the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If the proposal is passed, most of Japan's war materials would be cut off.

### A British Merchant Ship in Shanghai's Huangpu River is Damaged by Fire.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 12th] The British Harrisons & Crosfield Ltd. ship "Harmattan" was docked in the Huangpu River when a fire suddenly broke out yesterday.

The ship is leased by Jardine Matheson & Co., and is carrying 7,000 tons of coal. It is reported that the losses are minimal.

### Ambassador Kuo Speaks in England: Resistance and National Construction.

[Reuters, London, 12th] Chinese Ambassador Kuo Tai-chi said in a speech at the annual banquet of the Oriental Institute last night that all countries in the world have recognized that our country is resolutely resisting the war, enduring hardships unprecedented in history, but also rebuilding international justice and integrity. From our national perspective, our country is currently building a "China within China," developing the southwestern provinces, and building transportation routes with Myanmar, Vietnam, and the Soviet Union. This development will allow China to have more direct relations with other parts of Asia.

### Massive Shipment of National Tea to Hong Kong to Exchange for Foreign Exchange and Enhance National Power. The Situation in Zhejiang is Tense, Making it Difficult to Bring Tea to Hong Kong. The Soviet Union and We Establish a Purchase Agreement.

[Hong Kong News] Since Shanghai's tea leaves have been concentrated for export, and since the fall of Shanghai, the entire market has shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong. All foreign trade is designated by our government, controlled and purchased by a certain company, and concentrated for export from Hong Kong. The new tea of this year has been successively shipped to Hong Kong from the mainland. The details are as follows:

### New Tea from Various Places Begins to Enter the Market.

Zhejiang, Wan, and Jiangxi provinces are the production areas of red and green tea, with considerable annual output. In recent years, after improvements, foreign sales have been good. Now, the tea-producing areas of Zhejiang Province, such as Hangzhou, Pinghu Dongting Mountain, etc., have been occupied. In other areas, such as Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanzhou, Wenzhou, Pingshui, and Suian, the new tea produced this year has successively entered the market. In the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, except for a part that has been occupied, the remaining production continues as usual. Therefore, the output of tea leaves this year will not be reduced. They are now being successively shipped to Hong Kong.

### Government Controls and Concentrates Exports from Hong Kong.

Since the Ministry of Finance and the Trade Commission implemented centralized control over the transportation and sales of tea leaves last year, exports have surged. This year, the export trade of tea leaves is still under the control of the government. The Fuhua Company is designated to purchase in various production areas and concentrate exports from Hong Kong according to last year's method. Members of the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association and tea firms have set up offices in the production areas and Hong Kong. Various foreign firms are also purchasing directly in Hong Kong for foreign transportation.

### Tea Leaves Shipped to Shanghai Must Settle Foreign Exchange.

After the Ministry of Finance Trade Committee unified tea leaves, it immediately established a platform with the Soviet Union. It was stipulated that tea from all places must be purchased in large quantities and transported by the Fuhua Company, but tea shops are only allowed to transport tea to Shanghai for domestic sales, but they must sell foreign exchange in accordance with the law. Foreign tea from foreign firms, except for raw tea that must be requested for approval in advance, the other範茶 absolutely prohibits transporting to Shanghai. Furthermore, this year's Zhejiang tea is feeling difficult due to the tense situation in Zhejiang affecting transportation. The tea produced in Anhui and Jiangxi has been concentrated in Zhejiang and Guangdong for transshipment to Hong Kong for export.

### Establishing the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base in Yanbei

— Tan Feng · Qiao Li

[Minsheng West Communication] In the northern part of Shanxi, there is an inner city of the Great Wall, intermittent and winding, following the Hengshan Mountain and the Hongtao Mountain, passing through Pingxingguan and Yanmenguan, climbing over Yangfangkou, and heading northwest directly to the border of Suiyuan, where it meets the outer city, horizontally cutting off northern Shanxi. This vast land, divided, is four to five hundred li from east to west and two to three hundred li from north to south. It includes thirteen counties, including Tianzhen, Tanggao, Guangling, Lingqiu, Hunyuan, Datong, Huairen, Yingxian, Shanyin, Shuoxian, Zuoyun, and Youyu. Because it is located north of Yanmenguan, it is collectively referred to as Yanbei.

Yanbei is almost surrounded by several large mountain ranges such as Hengshan, Guan Cen, and Hongtao. The climate is cold and unpredictable. There is a children's rhyme in this area: "The wild people outside Yanmenguan wear fur coats in the morning and gauze in the evening, and there is also a strange thing, holding a stove and eating watermelon." We can imagine how cold and changeable the climate in Yanbei is. Due to the various relationships of land, transportation, and climate, the poverty and backwardness of this place have been determined. Generally speaking, people's lives are very poor. Agricultural products are mainly millet and potatoes. Followed by sorghum and wheat. Wheat flour is already a top-grade food here. Because of the small production, it is partially dependent on the counties within the pass. Millet is the food of the Chinese people. Because the local yield is very large, ordinary people use it as the main food, and sorghum is only for the poor. The grain produced is still self-sufficient. Industry is not very developed. Factories are concentrated near Datong, such as the mining bureau for coal mining, Baojin Company, Flour Company, Alcohol Company, etc. However, after Datong was occupied by the Japanese, the entire industry of Yanbei can be said to have been completely destroyed. There are also rich coal mines here. Datong, Huairen, Hunyuan, Zuoyun, Youyu, etc. all have production. Salt is also produced in the Shanyin, Yingxian, and Huairen areas. In addition to supplying the counties in Yanbei, a large amount is also exported to Suiyuan and the counties within Yanmenguan. As for culture and education, it is backward in this area, which is determined by the backward economic conditions. We can say that Datong is the economic and cultural center of Yanbei. The fall of Datong has destroyed the economic and cultural foundation of Yanbei. After the fall of the entire Yanbei and the ravages of the Japanese iron hooves, everything backward has been completely destroyed! Therefore, we can know that the anti-Japanese guerrilla base established in this backward area must not be very complete due to the limitations of the difficult environment in the early stage of its establishment. However, under the leadership and struggle of the General Mobilization Committee, the Public Sacrifice Border Region Working Committee, and the Second Commissioner's Office and the Administrative Office, it is gradually moving forward.

This newly established anti-Japanese guerrilla base is located in the center of Zuoyun, Youyu, Datong, Huairen, Shanyin, Daiyue, Shuoxian, and Pinglu, about two hundred li long from north to south and more than one hundred li wide from east to west. It is surrounded by the Japanese on all sides. However, first, we have a considerable amount of troops here, such as the Sixth Detachment of the Second District Security, the Sixth Regiment of the Garrison, the Chahar-Suiyuan Guerrilla Army, and the Cadre Training Brigade, etc., which can be said to have more power than the Japanese, and they dare not easily invade. Second, the Japanese troops are not adequately equipped. In addition to the troops stationed in the towns they occupy, they cannot rule the vast territory. Although we do not know the exact number of Japanese in Yanbei, generally speaking, there are often three to four hundred Japanese stationed in Datong, Zuoyun, Youyu and other counties. As for Daiyue, Wuzhen and other places, there are only thirty to forty Japanese. This weak force makes them dare not leave the occupied areas to invade us. Third, the broad masses support and help us. This is a great power that the Japanese cannot overcome. Because of the above three reasons, our anti-Japanese guerrilla base has been established and grown up in the encirclement of the Japanese, and the Japanese can do nothing about it.

If we want to know how this new anti-Japanese guerrilla base being established was established in the encirclement of the Japanese and in the harsh environment, then we cannot but look back to the past: it was in mid-September of the year before last, when the Japanese invaded Datong from Tianzhen and Yanggao. At the end of September, they forced Yanmenguan. At that time, the counties had been lost one after another, and the administrative organs and troops had also retreated. The only organizations left here were a few groups leading the people's movement. They struggled in the difficult environment and developed a large number of guerrillas. As for the restoration of administrative organs, it was only in May of last year. After the establishment of our county government, the Second District Commissioner's Office established an Administrative Office in Yanbei in August and September last year. Therefore, the General Mobilization Committee, the Public Sacrifice Border Region Working Committee, and the Administrative Office jointly led the establishment of the Yanbei Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base. At the beginning of its establishment, the Japanese launched five encirclements and suppressions in an attempt to destroy it, but they were in vain. Instead, we became stronger in the Japanese encirclements and suppressions, which made the Japanese feel uneasy. Therefore, the so-called "mountain search," "bandit suppression," and "village clearing" activities were carried out more and more continuously. However, because of its own lack of power, it could not bear this major task. Therefore, it used "appeasement policies" and "coercive measures" to organize a large number of village clearing teams and puppet troops to carry out the work of "suppressing bandits." In October last year, the Japanese launched their fifth mountain search operation, which almost swept through our entire guerrilla base area. But what did they get? Apart from heavy blows, they did not get any valuable things to give him, and he had to "come happily and return disappointed."

It has been three months since it had passed through the difficult environment of constant encirclements and suppressions from the Japanese. In such a short period of time, there is not much work to be done. For example, the Japanese in Wuzhen live in the town during the day and go to a temple on a mountain four or five li away from Wuzhen at night. The Japanese in Shanyin also move to the pasture on the other side at night. In terms of political work, it is worth pointing out the attack on the puppet regime. In order to maintain our regime and destroy the puppet regime, we must not only have a large number of guerrillas constantly attacking and disturbing the Japanese, but also strengthen the work of the masses, improve their political standards, and inspire them to oppose the pseudo-regime. The pseudo-regime has no broad mass base and cannot be established stably. Like in the villages near the highway, the pseudo-regime can extend to it. At the same time, our regime can also reach it, but our regime can pass unimpeded, while the pseudo-regime has encountered difficulties one after another and cannot get the support of the masses. In addition, there are many tasks that need to be strengthened: (1) The united front work is not done well enough, which makes the work steps inconsistent and cannot be well coordinated; (2) The work of organizing and training the masses is not enough. The national salvation organizations of all classes have not been organized very soundly. Although the peasant association has made considerable achievements, it has not been developed more universally due to the unsound leadership.

In order to make this anti-Japanese guerrilla base sound and grow up quickly, new plans and deployments must be made for the work. Therefore, we have decided on the current work based on the local environment and the past work experience and lessons:

First, in order to strengthen the united front work and make the power of various organizations more closely united and coordinated, a joint meeting of the military, government, and people will be convened to jointly study various issues, so as to concentrate opinions and forces and avoid unnecessary friction.

Second, based on the existing militia and peasant associations, organize and train the masses to make the people's movement more widely developed.

Third, organize a relief committee and launch a wide-ranging fundraising campaign to relieve the people who have been affected by the Japanese mountain search activities.

Fourth, in order to solve the problem of the lack of cadres, the Mobilization Committee, the Public Sacrifice Border Region Working Committee, and the Administrative Office will jointly run training classes to train a batch of working cadres.

In addition, there are several issues that deserve our special attention:

First, the problem of backbone armed forces. In order to make this anti-Japanese guerrilla base a strong fortress for anti-Japanese resistance and take on the task of eliminating the Japanese, it must have its backbone armed forces. However, the armed forces here are not enough, and more powerful forces must be deployed around it.

Second, the problem of economic trade. The import of our necessities (such as food) into the occupied areas, the invasion of Japanese goods, and the Japanese's deliberate increase in the price of pseudo-currency and the reduction of the price of our legal tender and provincial banknotes in an attempt to disrupt our financial conspiracy, these problems have not been resolved.

Third, the problem of supplies. Because there are many local organs and troops, food cannot support for a long time, so supplies should be distributed and stored in a planned way.

Fourth, the problem of bandits. Because when this area was lost the year before last, a small number of troops did not withdraw, and they occupied the mountains, looting the people. They fought the Japanese when they came, and they fought the Chinese when they came. They have not yet been appeased or suppressed.

In short, the establishment of this anti-Japanese guerrilla base in Yanbei is of great significance. Its growth, consolidation, and expansion are not only the foundation for recovering the entire Yanbei, but also, further, can drive out the Japanese from North China. Although it still has many shortcomings and many problems have not been resolved, these can be gradually overcome.

Look! Another strong fortress has appeared in Yanbei.

### British Prime Minister Roars Like a Lion: Defending Independent Nations, Warning Germany Not to Invade Danzig, Otherwise Britain Cannot Stand By

Chamberlain

[Reuters, London, 11th] Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech to 8,000 Conservative women at the Earl's Court Auditorium today, describing the changes in world affairs over the past year. The original words are recorded as follows: "Over the past year, we have gone through various stages of emotion. Until now, the people have unanimously shown a strong and firm will. We are confident that we have sufficient strength and feel innocent. In the past and present, we have done our best to maintain world peace. Our purpose is correct and selfless. We are still prepared to listen to other people's opinions, but we will never be dictated to by anyone. Unless we have determined that we must sacrifice freedom and honor if we do not join the war, no one can induce us to participate in the war. In the traditional policy of Britain, there has never been an attempt to interfere in other people's affairs. As for Germany's actions, if Germany does not threaten non-Germanic countries in order to increase its own interests, Britain will not regard it as related to itself. I have never attempted to isolate Germany or hinder its legitimate business interests in Central and Southeastern Europe, nor have I ever organized a front against Germany to challenge it. This speculation is absurd. No one but Germany would believe it." At this point, Chamberlain cited Hitler's remarks when criticizing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Hitler said: "I am unwilling to make a firm and definite judgment. As far as we are concerned, the basis of the Naval Agreement has not been abandoned. On the contrary, the people of both countries will never want to meet each other again on the battlefield." Chamberlain continued, saying that he deeply believes that the people of Britain and Germany share this expectation, and hopes that the governments of both countries can properly mediate so that no more wars will occur between the two countries. Chamberlain further quoted Hitler's expression of hope that Britain and Germany would avoid expanding their armaments in competition, saying that the British government would give this careful consideration and would be prepared to reply to the German government at an appropriate time. Chamberlain continued: "But I would like to state at this time that, whether in armaments or in the economy, we are unwilling to engage in unrestricted competition with Germany. We will never refuse to discuss with Germany ways to increase mutual trade or improve economic conditions, but Germany must have concrete evidence to show that its bankrupt promises can be restored. I would like to express myself clearly that we will never stand by and watch as independent countries are destroyed one after another. There is no hope of guaranteeing the security of Europe unless all countries are convinced that there is no risk of being invaded. For this reason, we have given guarantees to Poland, Romania, and Greece, and for this reason, we are conducting negotiations with other countries, especially the Soviet Union and Turkey. These negotiations are still in progress, and I can only state that the government sincerely hopes that these negotiations will achieve satisfactory results as soon as possible. If this can be achieved, peace can be further guaranteed. Some people believe that the current European crisis is in Danzig, and our guarantees to Poland are extremely clear and concise. We would be happy to see the dispute between Germany and Poland resolved peacefully through negotiations, but if there is an attempt to change the situation by force and threaten the independence of Poland, then a European conflict is inevitable, and our country will inevitably be drawn into the vortex." Chamberlain then discussed the issue of conscription, saying that the countries of continental Europe had overestimated the significance of Britain's move, "so that this strong aversion made our efforts to build a peaceful front suffer great difficulties. If war breaks out in Europe due to misunderstanding, it would be a terrible event. The Labour Party's opposition to conscription is unfortunate, but it does not represent the public opinion of the nation. In the future, if the international tension can be slightly eased, there will be great room for the development of our business prosperity, and all countries in the world will benefit from it. The power to rebuild confidence is not only in our hands, but as long as I live, I will continue to hope and do my best to rebuild confidence." Chamberlain continued, saying that he had had the opportunity to meet with former French President Blum on Wednesday, who claimed that, according to his personal observations and those of his socialist friends, there was only one real danger that could cause war in Europe, "that is, the impression that Britain and France have failed to cooperate sincerely and have failed to keep their promises. If this is indeed the case, then no fatal mistake could be greater."

### Australian Queen Ship Stopped Yesterday Due to Fog

[Reuters, London, 12th] A Reuters special correspondent stationed on the "Australian Queen" reported today that the ship encountered heavy fog today, which made it difficult to navigate and has been stopped for more than eleven hours. This afternoon, the Queen visited the shops on the ship and bought two wooden sailor dolls (children's toys) for the Princess. Later, she and the King took a walk on the deck. In the evening, the King and Queen hosted a banquet for Reuters correspondent Gordon Young and official photographer Horton. After the meal, they watched a movie screened on the ship.

### Important Speech by French Prime Minister: Maintaining Peace with Strength, Welcoming Soviet Participation in Cooperation, Increasing Unity Between Britain and France

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] French Prime Minister Daladier delivered an important speech in the House of Representatives today, saying, "France has decided to do everything in its power to resist any attempt to weaken its spiritual resistance." He continued, saying that the unity between Britain and France is stronger and more trustworthy than ever before. This is the basic principle of French policy and cannot be weakened by any conspiracy or malicious propaganda. "We believe that the Soviet Union's participation in common mutual assistance is highly desirable. The Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935 is still valid, which shows that making the Soviet Union participate in cooperation equally and mutually is an integral part of our diplomatic thinking." Daladier continued, saying that even if the British, French, and Soviet governments have differences of opinion on the form of the agreement, they have agreed in principle at the beginning of the discussion, that is, to act jointly to ensure the supreme interests of peace. Daladier mentioned that France and Turkey are conducting negotiations to establish a guarantee agreement, the purpose of which is to ensure peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. Later, he discussed the issue of national defense, saying that the French government has no intention of reducing its military steps. If a large army is still mobilized outside the French border, then France will strengthen its military measures. In 1939 alone, France's national defense expenditure has reached 500 billion francs. "Some people believe that the unity of France cannot be underestimated and hope to control it with threats and promises of peace in order to destroy its morale. If they are truly willing to obtain a fair and honest peace, we should be prepared to make it a reality. If there is an attempt to strike a blow to peace, then we should also compete with it in military strength. If those who are making us exhausted between the choice of peace and war, the necessary time to determine the outcome is still in our hands! France can never be opposed by force or cunning!"

### Danzig Issue: Germany Does Not Want to Participate in Meetings to Discuss, Attacks Speeches of British and French Prime Ministers

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th] Political circles here do not attach importance to the speeches of Chamberlain and Daladier yesterday, and said that the declarations of the two are only to explain to the domestic public the reasons for the two countries to expand their armaments with huge sums of money. Chamberlain's statement on Britain's attitude towards the Danzig issue in his speech stated that Germany does not want to participate in any meetings to discuss the Danzig issue, because the free city is originally German territory, so the Danzig issue is not related to Poland's independence and sovereignty. Unless there is an attempt to call the crooked straight and the straight crooked. If Britain really wants to interfere in this issue, Germany believes that this step by the British government is not to maintain peace, nor is it to show Britain's neutrality. Political circles also criticized Daladier's speech, saying that this move is actually to explain to the public that the current increase in special taxes is for the purpose of expanding armaments, which is also the result of the serious situation. France's praise of peace does not have a deep impression here, because for 150 years, French political circles have had the desire to dominate Europe, and the so-called love of peace can no longer be expressed in the language of the 1789 revolution, because Napoleon was also a revolutionary soldier. From the perspective of France's colonial government, it is already known that the French have honey in their mouths and swords in their bellies.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th] All German newspapers are commenting on the international political situation reports of Chamberlain and Daladier last night, saying that the official statements of the two are only for domestic purposes, hoping to gain public sympathy, and constantly increasing huge sums of money to expand armaments for the purpose of encirclement policies. The newspapers also unanimously and fiercely criticized British Prime Minister Chamberlain's attempt to mix the Danzig German issue with Polish sovereignty. The German newspaper said that these two matters are completely separate and cannot be related. The Nazi newspaper People's Observer expressed regret that Chamberlain said that all evils originated from Germany and Italy, and questioned whether Chamberlain knew that U.S. President Roosevelt believed that countries threatened by Germany had replied to Germany's questions. The newspaper also said that Germany's attitude towards the countries of Southeastern Europe is extremely peaceful, while Britain is the opposite. The newspaper finally questioned whether Britain believed that this was enough to help solve the Danzig issue. The German General Report said that so far no one has dared to say that Germany's proposal to solve the Danzig issue has harmed Poland's sovereignty. Poland's so-called zealous patriots have gained Britain's support, which has made the Danzig issue difficult to solve, and Chamberlain himself, in turn, believes that such steps are suitable.

[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] Political figures here expressed doubts about Chamberlain's speech. They believe that although Britain has repeatedly expressed to Germany that there is no hostile attitude, the facts show the opposite, especially the statement that Britain has no intention of restricting Germany's expansion of business, which is even more contradictory. Regarding Britain's hope that Danzig will achieve peace as soon as possible, all parties believe that it is very laughable.

### French Reserve Officers Arrive to Inspect

[Haitong News Agency, London, 12th] French Defense Committee General Desveux led 100 French reserve officers to England today to visit Britain's armaments expansion projects and will stay for three days. It is heard that the general and his party will visit the Birmingham aircraft factory, review the army air force performance at Portsmouth, and inspect the Turkish fleet.

### Plymouth Resigns from British Foreign Secretary Post

[Reuters, London, 11th] The official announcement stated that the Duke of Plymouth had resigned from the post of Foreign Secretary due to health reasons in order to recuperate. It seems that the vacant post will no longer be filled, because the British Foreign Office used to have two deputies to attend the Upper and Lower Houses separately, because the Foreign Secretary did not attend the Upper House meetings. Now that Foreign Secretary Halifax is a member of the Upper House and Butler attends the Lower House, there is no need to add another deputy.

### British Pavilion Opens at World Expo

[Reuters, New York, 11th] The largest British pavilion in the World Expo here will open tomorrow for visitors. The opening ceremony will be presided over by British Overseas Minister Hudson, who will present a silver rose leaflet to the Mayor of New York. The treasures displayed in the pavilion include the British Magna Carta, which is carefully preserved. The British authorities specially made a sturdy box to hold it, which can avoid bullets, fire, and thieves cannot steal it. It is guarded day and night and has insurance of 100,000 pounds. The pavilion also has the genealogy of the first U.S. President Washington, indicating that Washington is a descendant of King John of England. In addition, there are replicas of British royal ornaments, and models and photos of British cities. There is also a band playing music in the British Pavilion.

### Anglo-Turkish Agreement: Chamberlain Announced Yesterday, France and Turkey are Also Conducting Negotiations, a Trilateral Agreement May Be Signed

[Reuters, London, 12th] Prime Minister Chamberlain announced that he will issue a report on Turkey before 4:00 today (British Summer Time).

[Reuters, London, 12th] A diplomatic correspondent for The Times wrote today that, barring unforeseen obstacles, the Anglo-Turkish agreement is expected to be announced in the House of Commons today. The scope and content of the agreement include the Mediterranean and the Balkans, which are related to Turkey's interests. The governments of Britain, France, and Turkey have completely agreed. The Pope is not expected to invite Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to convene a meeting to resolve the disputes between Germany, Poland, France, and Italy. He has apparently received guarantees from Germany and Italy.

[Reuters, London, 11th] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the negotiations between Britain and Turkey on the conclusion of an agreement have reached complete agreement on the main issues. France is also conducting negotiations to conclude an agreement of the same nature with Turkey. Therefore, Britain, France, and Turkey may sign a trilateral agreement.

[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] Authorities claimed that the Franco-Turkish agreement has been agreed in principle by both sides. As for the form of the agreement, whether it is a trilateral agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey, or separate agreements between Britain and Turkey and France and Turkey, the final decision can be made today or tomorrow.

[Reuters, Geneva, 11th] The Executive Council meeting of the League of Nations, originally scheduled to be held on May 15, has now been decided to be postponed for one week so that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin can attend and be able to consult with Halifax and Bonet.

### Polish Senate Authorizes President to Govern by Decree; US Considers Trade Agreement with Poland

[Reuters, Warsaw, 11th] The Polish Senate today passed a bill authorizing the President to govern the country by decree until the next regular session of Parliament. The bill also grants the President special powers in national defense and finance.

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 12th] According to yesterday's Danzig Sentinel, two squadrons of Polish heavy artillery disembarked at the Grunia station, a Polish military port ten miles from Danzig, yesterday. The Polish side explained that this step was taken to maintain order in the area, as the situation remains unstable and people are constantly in fear.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The US State Department announced today that the United States and Poland are considering a trade agreement, and exploratory talks have already begun.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 12th] The "Asahi Shimbun" reports that Japan proposed mediation to Germany and Poland several days ago to ease tensions between the two countries.

### Franco-Spanish Relations Tighten; Spain Rumored to Join Axis; Göring Leaves Italy for Valencia

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] Franco-Spanish relations are strained again. Simultaneously, it is rumored that Germany and Spain have agreed to negotiate a commercial agreement, and Spain may join the Italo-German military alliance. Göring left San Remo, Italy, last Tuesday for Valencia to discuss matters with Spanish government officials. Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Daladier ordered government departments to expedite the implementation of agreements with Spain.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] It is reported that the Spanish Franco government has threatened France due to delays in fulfilling the conditions stipulated when exchanging ambassadors, stating that Franco-Spanish relations may be severed. This intention has been communicated to French Ambassador to Spain, General Pétain, and Spanish Ambassador to France, the Duke of Alba. Alba has decided to return to Spain to participate in the May 19th victory parade in Madrid. He informed France that unless the French government provides guarantees before his return, he will not return to his post in France.

[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 12th] Yesterday, a grand review was held in Coronel, the headquarters of the Spanish Italian volunteer army, as the Italian troops are about to return home. General Franco's representative, Spanish government officials, and the Italian military commander were present for the review. The Spanish Minister of Interior delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the assistance of the Italian soldiers.

### Belgian Baron and Priest Detained in Japan; Reportedly Related to 'Currency Issues'

[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondent] Baron de Pechamps of Belgium and Father Gorada have been detained by the police here. It is rumored to be related to 'currency issues'. Father Gorada was arrested on April 18th, and Baron de Pechamps was detained on the 20th. Pechamps was detained on April 20th upon his return to Yokohama from Shanghai. He is seventy years old and came here four years ago to visit his son, who was then the secretary of the French Embassy here and is now the Second Secretary of the French Embassy in Washington. Father Gorada is thirty-seven years old and has been preaching in Japan for six years, living in Tokyo. It is unknown when the two will be released.

### Plane Crash Kills Soviet Female Pilot and Brigade Commander

[Reuters, Moscow, 12th] The famous Soviet female pilot Osipenko and Brigade Commander Sirotin were killed in a plane crash today. Both were hailed as 'Heroes of the Soviet Union'.

### Soviet Izvestia Comments on European Situation

[Moscow, 11th] "Hitler's abandonment of his agreements with Britain and Poland, coupled with the recent signing of the Italo-German military alliance, has changed the entire European situation. Therefore, mutual assistance pacts among peace-loving nations should be established swiftly." The above is the tone of today's editorial in the semi-official newspaper "Izvestia." The paper also stated, "Western European political leaders still want to deceive themselves, claiming that Germany's abandonment of its agreements with Britain and Poland and its military alliance with Italy has not changed the European situation. Such arguments are not only incorrect but outright lies, intended to deceive public opinion. In reality, it not only changes the outlook for Europe but also causes the worst changes in the already unstable situation. Since the Italo-German military alliance, it has been clear that they have united against Britain and France, and the proposals put forward by Britain and France cannot be considered reciprocal in nature. Due to its geographical location, if Poland and the Baltic states are invaded, the Soviet Union could face most of the war alone. The Soviet Union sincerely wishes to negotiate a mutual defense pact with the Western European powers. When Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons yesterday, he mentioned seeking an alliance with the Soviet Union for cooperation. However, so-called cooperation implies reciprocity. Without a foundation of reciprocity, true cooperation is difficult to achieve."

### Chicago Fire; Grain Elevator Explosion; Many Dead and Injured

[Associated Press, Chicago, 11th] The grain elevator of the Robertson-Keedy Company here suddenly exploded and caught fire today. The force of the explosion shook an area of about one block, killing as many as ten people. Four employees of the elevator and one firefighter were crushed to death by collapsing walls. As many as seven firefighters were injured. The intensity of the fire has not been seen in years, and firefighters were unable to control it, causing it to burn for quite some time. It spread to two other grain elevators nearby. Many fire trucks slowly arrived, numbering over a hundred. As of the time of this report, the fire has been burning for three hours, and the fire is still not decreasing.

### Britain Loans 5 Million Pounds to Romania

[Haitong News Agency, London, 12th] Yesterday, British Trade Minister Stanley announced in the House of Commons that the British commercial delegation led by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, which is holding Anglo-Romanian economic negotiations in Bucharest, has learned that Britain has agreed to loan 5 million pounds to Romania. This action is not unusual; this agreement was reached before the delegation arrived in Bucharest. The agreement was signed yesterday in Bucharest by the Romanian Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, British Minister, and Leith-Ross. The agreement also stated that this measure would increase trade between Britain and Romania, and Romania has the right to use the funds to purchase any goods and may use them to purchase armaments.

However, the procurement and transportation will be managed by the British government. It is reported that the previously agreed Anglo-Romanian commercial agreement has been amended, but details were not released yesterday.

Brief Commentary

### Today's Shanghai!

Today's Shanghai, including the entire foreign concessions, has fallen under the military power of Japan!

Under the coercion and oppression of military force, the Shanghai Concession authorities have abandoned their "neutral" stance and taken actions to serve the Japanese side. They prohibit Chinese people from displaying the national flag; they suppress patriotic speech in Chinese newspapers; they even forbid the publication of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's pronouncements; they allow Japanese plainclothes agents to arrest Chinese people in the concessions at will; they declare a strict prohibition on people within the concessions from engaging in political activities; and they have ordered restrictions on speeches by Chinese people in the concessions. While we must shed tears of sympathy for the difficult situation of the Concession authorities, we cannot help but express regret and sorrow for their willingness to yield. Because with every concession to [the Japanese], everyone will worry about its own future!

The compatriots of all circles in Shanghai have been fighting bravely for more than a year amidst all the difficulties, dangers, humiliations, and terrors! Supporting the Central Government, supporting the Commander-in-Chief, supporting the protracted war of resistance, and supporting the united front, the compatriots of Shanghai have been the most enthusiastic and resolute. Responding to and implementing any military, political, or economic call from the government leaders, the compatriots of Shanghai have also been the most enthusiastic and resolute. Spiritual mobilization, the National Covenant oath, and opposing Wang Jingwei's "anti-communist peace" actions and pronouncements, the compatriots of Shanghai have been the most enthusiastic and resolute. Now the compatriots of Shanghai have entered an even more arduous and dangerous situation! How sympathetic and admirable is their struggle! Their situation should raise everyone's vigilance even more!

Our Central Government is very concerned about the current situation of the compatriots in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the British and French consuls, demanding freedom of speech and publication and freedom to display flags for compatriots in the concessions. This requires all sectors to unite and support in order to achieve it. Today's report from the Associated Press, Washington, 12th, states that Britain and the United States are prepared to cooperate against Japan regarding the Shanghai concession issue. Leaders from all walks of life and colleagues in the media should especially step forward and rally to be the backing for the government's protest, solicit and promote the opinion of friendly nations, and work together to advance the movement to restrain Japan and regain its true position. The beneficiaries will not only be the patriotic compatriots in Shanghai!

### Crushing Economic Aggression Conspiracy; Industrial Cooperation Actively Promoted; Hong Kong Promotion Society Holds First Talk Inviting Celebrities; Arousing Overseas Chinese Attention and Efforts to Help Enhance Anti-War Strength

In order to develop wartime industries and exploit resources to enhance the strength of the war effort, the government established the China Industrial Cooperatives in Shanghai last August. Minister Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Finance presided over the effort, promoting the industrial nation-building movement. Thirty thousand work cooperatives were planned to be set up in various regions of the country to develop light industry to relieve war refugees. Overseas promotion societies were established to advance the society's work. Since its establishment, the work has achieved remarkable results. The Hong Kong China Industrial Cooperatives Promotion Society, to assist the development of the society's work and enhance the effectiveness of relief, convened its first symposium at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 4:30 pm, inviting Hong Kong's leading gentlemen and celebrities. Those present yesterday included Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching-ling, Sir Shouson Chow (Chairman), Sir Robert Ho Tung, barrister Lo Man Kam, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Snow, Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Chow Shouson, Li Xingqu, Ho Gam Tong, Ye Lanquan, Zheng Shouren, Miss Pu Aide, Yan Chengkun, Rong Guanwen, Chow Xingchi, Tang Zhaojian, Liao Mengxing, Ye Guisong, Miss Shan Dexin, Miss Guo Fengxuan, Miss Liu Qingxuan, Dr. He Ailing, Mrs. Li Hanhun, Ho Minghua, Zheng Hongnian, Slaw, and many others. Gathering Hong Kong's leading gentlemen, celebrities, and industry giants in one hall, it was a grand occasion. Sir Shouson Chow stood up to give the opening remarks, followed by Miss Pu Qingde, Sir Robert Ho Tung, Snow, and others. Finally, Chairman Chow announced that Hong Kong women's organizations are scheduled to hold a dance dinner at the Hong Kong Hotel on the evening of the 26th of this month to raise funds for the Society. Mrs. Li Hanhun Wu Jufang stood up as the meeting was about to end, briefly stating that the organization of the Industrial Cooperatives is the only effective way to provide relief to refugees. However, there are many refugees in Guangdong and Hong Kong. It is hoped that the cooperative will implement the founding principles of the society and provide relief nearby to conform to the spirit of cooperation. Excerpts from the speeches are as follows:

Industrial Society's Purpose Summarized into Six Major Points

Chairman Chow Shouson said, in brief, that the China Industrial Cooperative General Society is located in Chongqing and is managed under the leadership of Minister Kong Xiangxi. In Hong Kong, there is the 'China Industrial Cooperative Association Hong Kong Promotion Society.' The work of this cooperative has a great relationship to the future of China's war of resistance. Because the Japanese occupy our coastal provinces, the industries of the provinces that have been devastated by them have reached more than 70 percent. They hope to reduce China's production capacity in order to achieve a quick war and a quick resolution plan. However, although our country is in a period of war resistance and has suffered all kinds of destruction by the Japanese, not only has the spirit of resistance not been affected in the slightest, but it has strengthened the determination to resist and the belief in a protracted war. At the same time, in order to enrich the strength of resistance, we are working harder to promote industry. This is why the cooperative society was established. The purpose and work of the society are divided into (1) collecting economic power and re-exhibiting industry, (2) enabling refugees in the occupied areas to have legitimate industries to support themselves, (3) rescuing industries in the coastal provinces so that their machinery can be transported to the interior to enrich the organization, (4) exploring local raw materials and discovering resources, (5) producing various items needed by the front, (6) enabling domestic goods to be promoted. The above is the purpose of founding the Industrial Cooperative Society. Since its establishment, it has been widely supported by Chinese and foreign people. Even in New York and London, there are sympathetic responses. How should our Hong Kong overseas Chinese rise up to help quickly? Now that we have the government as a backing, all Chinese people should act as the vanguard of the government.

Our Raw Materials are Endless, Depending on Human Development

Miss Pu Aide said, in brief, that the heroic resistance of China today, the spirit of the whole country, men and women, old and young, whether in the front or in the rear, all unanimously supporting the government, is a good omen for the birth of a new China. Although under the bombing of airplanes, the people in the war zones are living a life of displacement, leaving their homes and villages, their spirit of great fearlessness is still calm and intensifying the work of resistance, which is even more admirable. At the same time, participating in important production work is even more in line with the total mobilization that China is urgently promoting, which is the China Industrial Cooperative Society. China has now reached a period of great industrial development, and industrial cooperative societies for mining and smelting metals and manufacturing raw materials have been established, and are being intensified. In total, there are more than 50 kinds, and more than 500 have been established. Among them, the creation of machinery requires a larger amount of money, with each society needing more than 1,000 yuan. It will not be difficult to promote this throughout the country. China has endless raw materials to develop, deeply buried underground, so China's only major problem in resisting Japan is how to explore raw materials, cooperate with manpower, and unite to resist foreign aggression.

Solving Three Problems, Enhancing Anti-War Strength

Sir Robert Ho Tung said in his speech, in brief, that since the Sino-Japanese war, compatriots in China and abroad have had various organizations for saving the country and providing disaster relief. The one with the greatest and most lasting benefits for the future of the country is none other than the Industrial Cooperative Society. Although other organizations are important, they only belong to temporary measures, while the establishment of the Industrial Cooperative Society is a fundamental plan. National economy and people's livelihood are all based on this. Now China is in a period of resistance to the war, and all things are needed, and the import of foreign goods is experiencing various difficulties. In addition, the industries in Shanghai and other places have been destroyed by the war. Therefore, if China wants to compete in the world, it must focus on industry. From this point of view, the establishment of the China Industrial Cooperative Society is indeed the only important move. This industrial movement can solve China's three major problems: (1) using China's natural resources to enhance the strength of the war of resistance, (2) re-establishing China's industrial foundation to protect rights and interests, (3) providing technical training for tens of millions of displaced refugees to establish a foundation for their lives and enable the country to cultivate talents as the driving force for developing industry. The benefits gained from the above three matters are immeasurable. The purpose of the initiators is to plan to set up 30,000 cooperative societies in appropriate locations in the country. It is unfortunate that there is a shortage of skilled personnel and insufficient start-up capital, so they have not been able to achieve their goals. Although the central government has allocated 5 million yuan, called the loan fund, to help this endeavor, this fund is only used to lend to cooperative societies in various places and must be repaid at the specified time. In addition to capital, there are also recurring expenses and special expenses. This really relies on the assistance of Chinese and world people. Therefore, we have this meeting today to discuss solutions. This meeting is convened by the Hong Kong Industrial Cooperative Society Design Committee. Hong Kong is the center for promoting this plan. Branch processing groups have been set up in Shanghai, Xiaolulai, London, New York, Singapore, Saigon, Batavia, and other places. Their task is to handle fundraising matters, purchase application materials, transport donations, collect technical proposals, recruit professional talents, and publicize domestic and foreign obligations.

Many Foreigners Help, Compatriots Should Work Harder

The current chairman is represented by Miss Ai Ai De. Foreigners who support include Bishop He Minghua, the wife of Financial Secretary Jin Xiyi, the wife of Chief Medical Officer Situ Yongjue, and Mr. and Mrs. Jue. All the foreign friends have sacrificed a lot of energy and time to work for China. How should we Chinese people work even harder? There is no need to say more. Moreover, Hong Kong has a close relationship with China in terms of geography and commerce. China prospers, Hong Kong prospers, and China declines, Hong Kong declines. The prosperity and decline of each other are inseparable. I hope that our compatriots will work together with one heart and one mind to assist, contribute financially and in terms of effort. As for publicity obligations, we must rely on the efforts of colleagues in the press. I think the gentlemen of the press are extremely enthusiastic about patriotism and will be happy to help. I believe that if this initiative is successful, China will not only gain glorious peace, but China's resources can be developed, China's industry can be developed, the lives of the Chinese people can be self-sufficient, and the 60 million or more compatriots who are suffering can rely on industrial skills to support themselves, reduce the government's burden, and cultivate the country's vitality. This is in line with the Three People's Principles and is sufficient to uphold the legacy of President Sun. If this initiative cannot achieve its purpose, the items needed during the war of resistance will be even more lacking, and tens of millions of suffering compatriots will inevitably lose their support. In the future, China's financial resources will inevitably be absorbed by others. The consequences are unimaginable. Therefore, the success or failure of this industrial movement lies in the hands of the Chinese people. Where to go? My compatriots should know how to choose.

China's Human and Material Resources Have Not Been Slow to Mobilize

Finally, Snow said, in brief, that many people believe that China is late in issuing a mobilization order today, but in my opinion, I do not think so. Since the Japanese sent troops, they have shown signs of exhaustion, but China is not the same. After a long war of resistance, it is still very relaxed. This alone is enough to see one aspect. In addition, after China issued the mobilization order, there was a rapid progress. Who said that China's mobilization was late? From the perspective of the Chinese army, they are now mobilizing 10 million, and the people's self-awareness is even more remarkable. In terms of the economy, the establishment of this industrial society shows that China's strength in the war of resistance is increasing day by day. I think that the current problem of China's mobilization should be to prevent [the Japanese] from using the raw materials and manpower in the occupied areas. All Chinese people should assume the task of spiritually preventing [the Japanese]. At the same time, we should find ways to solve the livelihood problems of the people and refugees in various places. On the one hand, we can increase national defense production, and on the other hand, we can be self-sufficient. All of these are in line with the purpose and objectives of the Industrial Cooperative Society. Therefore, whether it is the people in the country or overseas Chinese, they should help each other to complete this mission in order to resist foreign aggression.

### Lung Disease Woman Jumps from Hospital Ward in Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and Commits Suicide; Deceased Yang Xia Entered the Hospital for Treatment for Only One Day; Suddenly Jumped from the Third Floor Yesterday Morning and Died on the Spot

At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a case of a hospitalized woman jumping from the third floor of the Tung Wah Eastern Hospital in So Kon Po and committing suicide occurred. The deceased, named Yang [ ], 33 years old, was admitted to the "Qiao An" room on the third floor of the hospital at 6:00 AM on the 11th by her family due to lung disease. After the doctor on duty examined her, he told her to rest peacefully. At the time of admission, the deceased had no other diseases besides lung disease. Therefore, although the deceased was in the ward, she would often get up and move around in the room, or go to the balcony railing to look down. The nurses in the building did not stop her because her illness was lung disease, and movement did not affect her body. Later, the deceased muttered to herself, as if she was thinking nervously. The nurses in the building saw that the deceased's shape had changed suddenly, so they took strict precautions. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the deceased did not know why she was touched and took advantage of the nurse's unawareness to get up and walk to the balcony near the sky staircase, jumped down, fell to the ground, and her head burst, her limbs were broken, and her internal organs were severely injured. When she fell to the ground, the watchman downstairs heard the sound and went out to inspect the sky staircase, and was shocked to see her tragic situation. He immediately reported to the person in charge of the hospital. The doctor and nurses on duty in the hospital treated her, but soon, she died due to her serious injuries and ineffective rescue. The people in the hospital then called No. 1 Police Station to report the case and sent someone to notify the deceased's family. Soon, No. 2 Police Station sent Chinese and Western detectives to the hospital to investigate everything and take statements from the people in the department for record, in preparation for the future opening of the court by the magistrate. Then, the hearse took the deceased's body to the public morgue for autopsy.

### Guangdong Provincial Bank Recruits Staff; Takes Thirty in Hong Kong

Since the Guangdong Provincial Bank moved its office to Shaoguan, its business has been thriving. In order to adapt to the war situation and improve efficiency, it plans to recruit 60 staff members, openly held in Shaoguan and Hong Kong, respectively, taking 30 in each place. All young people of Chinese nationality who are 20 to 35 years old, who are able to endure hardship and are honest and reliable, and who are not afraid of danger and are willing to serve in the mainland and nearby war zones, can go to 81 Ma Bao Tong, King's Road, Hong Kong, 3rd floor to register.

### Ho Tiechou Expands Yi Tong Education Institute; Will Perform Famous Drama to Raise Funds

After Ho Tiehua held an exhibition of famous scenic spots in the occupied areas to raise funds for the military disaster relief society and the Women's Federation, he felt that rescuing out-of-school refugee children and cultivating new national forces was a top priority. He gathered comrades in the painting community and established a mass school. Because the place was small and could not accommodate refugee children, he expanded and established the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Yi Tong Free Education Institute" and called on the society. He then obtained the "Spring and Autumn Drama Troupe" led by Tang Huaiqiu and Zhang [ ], who were willing to perform the drama "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain" for free to help raise funds. The troupe automatically donated all the performance fees so that the funds raised could be used for the Yi Tong. It is heard that it is actively rehearsing and will be performed in the near future.

### Benefit Performance for Disaster Relief by Distinguished Women: The Exquisite "Dream of the Red Chamber"—Introduction to the Various Protagonists (1)

Special Report

We have already provided a general introduction to the benefit performance for disaster relief hosted by the Chinese Women's War Disaster Relief Association. During the rehearsal period, the master of drama, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, came again last night to guide their performance skills, personally demonstrating those exquisite postures, and side-view, front-view, and looking-back movements, setting a good example for them.

Miss Guan Bixia starred in the scene of "Daiyu Burying Flowers." With her slender figure and wearing those gorgeous ancient costumes, she was naturally endowed with a delicate face that was prone to illness and sorrow. She swayed and moved slowly and carefully in her performance. Before burying the flowers, she sang a passage of the song of cherishing flowers, shifting from a very high pitch to a low one, and then rising again after being suppressed. Her manipulation was very smooth and lively, and she was able to portray Daiyu's personality. Mr. Ouyang Yuqian couldn't help but clap his hands and exclaim: "Bravo!" "Good!" "Not bad!"

Miss Guan Bixia as Daiyu in the play

In the scene of the Twelve Golden Hairpins of Yi Garden celebrating a birthday, the instructor pursued perfection, performing it repeatedly. Mr. Luo Tangsheng, as Baoyu, was an elegant and refined young gentleman, with unique skills in singing and acting. As the feast began, the Twelve Golden Hairpins sang the birthday banquet song in a rotating manner, with clear songs and beautiful dances, neat steps, and controlled movements, all regulated by the music.

Mr. Luo Tangsheng as Baoyu in the play

In the scene of "Qingwen Tearing Fans," it is extremely difficult to find the right person. Fundamentally, one must possess the qualities of being—fiery,娇俏, and thoughtful—to take on the role. Miss Li Huilan took on the difficult task of playing this role. In the scene of serving Baoyu, she broke the fan. Coincidentally, Baoyu had a bit of resentment in his stomach that day, so he took the opportunity to vent it, scolding her a few times, which provoked her.

Miss Li Huilan as Qingwen in the play

But women shouldn't provoke her. Otherwise, she will cry sadly. Look, the more vigorously she cries, the more it stimulates Baoyu's love and affection. What is the result? He slowly stepped forward and gently apologized to her. She turned her tears into a smile. "Do you like the sound of tearing fans? What does spending a thousand gold pieces for a smile matter?" Baoyu said those words, and Qingwen laughed "喀嘻" as she tore each fan to pieces. (To be continued)

### Our Army Achieves Victory in Zengcheng Area: Captures Fuhe and Presses Towards Zhucun, Enemy Troops Retreat from Longkou, Longxiang, and Liantang Area, We Are Actively Advancing, Striving to Annihilate All of Them

[Express News from Wengyuan] On the northeast two lines, the enemy troops have recently been restless again, attempting to invade Boluo from the east and Conghua from the north. Therefore, the deployment has been frequent in recent days. Regarding the enemy situation on these two lines, according to military intelligence, it is described as follows:

Capturing Fuhe, the Enemy Retreats to Zhongxin According to the enemy in Zengcheng, they have been severely damaged by our attacking troops many times. In recent days, they have been arranging defensive works and are extremely busy. On the morning of the 9th, more than 500 artillerymen and more than ten field guns arrived from Guangzhou, reaching the area between Zhongxin Market and Fuhe Market on the Fuhe Highway. Also at noon today, more than 1,000 enemy infantrymen marched along the Guangzeng Highway to Changping Village, appearing to advance towards the Tan Zhengguo area. In order to crush the enemy's conspiracy to invade, our 12th Group Army's National Army Division headquarters launched an attack in the Erlong Liangtian area at noon that day, and also launched a surprise attack on Fuhe with surprise troops, immediately engaging in a fierce battle with the enemy. Our army temporarily gained many captives. At about 4:00 PM, our army rested briefly. At dusk, our army attacked the enemy in two routes, and another unit launched a slanting attack from near Liangshui, attacking the enemy's right wing. The enemy was extremely flustered and hastily fought back. Our army quickly established contact on all routes and continued to launch a fierce attack, finally occupying Fuhe Market. The remaining enemy troops fled in defeat to Zhongxin Market. Currently, our army is pursuing the enemy while also advancing towards Zhucun and Danqiu and other places.

Enemy Troops Retreat from Longkou and Other Places As for the Huaxian area, the enemy troops have been lying dormant due to our suppression. Recently, because our army on the Yuehan Railway line has been advancing section by section to Jiangcun, the Huanghua Highway is already under serious threat, and it is feared that we will cut off their retreat. Yesterday, on the 9th, a part of the enemy troops in the Longkou, Longxiang, and Liantang areas were transferred back to Guangzhou. Currently, only a hundred or so enemy infantrymen remain in the area, and it seems that they are abandoning this line. Our armies of Peng and Li have actively advanced to annihilate the enemy, and they must completely resolve the enemy in these three places during the day.

[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan] On the morning of the 9th, more than 500 enemy artillerymen and more than ten cannons arrived in Zhongxin from Guangzhou. At noon, more than 1,000 enemy infantrymen arrived at Changping Village along the Guangzeng Road, with the appearance of continuing their advance. A certain division's assault team of our 12th Group Army launched a surprise attack on Fuhe Market on the night of the 9th. The enemy hastily fought back and was heavily annihilated. The Luohe Market was immediately occupied, and the remaining enemy troops fled to Zhongxin.

[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan] A part of the enemy in the Longkou, Longxiang, and Liantang areas of Huaxian left for Guangzhou on the 7th. Currently, there are still more than 100 enemy infantrymen in the area. A certain division's assault team of our 12th Group Army is advancing towards the enemy.

[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan] There are more than a hundred enemies in Tangxia Yukang near Jiangmen, forcing the villagers to repair the highway.

### Commander-in-Chief Zhang Agreed to Exempt Demolition of Blockhouses in Four Counties: Mr. Deng Longguang's Remarks

(Express News from Zhaoqing) In the past, the blockhouses in the territory of the Siyi counties were ordered by Deng Longguang, the military commander of the Sixty-Fourth Army, to be demolished within the deadline to facilitate the war. At that time, the people of Siyi and overseas Chinese from Siyi raised objections. In addition to telegramming the army commander to request exemption from demolition, they also telegraphed the highest military authorities and Zhang Fakui, the acting commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone, to order the exemption from demolition. According to Deng's remarks, the demolition of blockhouses in Siyi was entirely from the orders of superiors, and our army was ordered to execute it. It was not intended to deliberately make things difficult for the local area. After receiving telegrams from the Hong Kong Siyi General Chamber of Commerce and Industry and overseas Siyi groups requesting exemption from demolition, our army immediately telegraphed Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang of the Fourth War Zone, stating everything. The Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry once again telegraphed, applying to send strong men to guard the blockhouses to assist in the war, and it was also considered feasible. We directly submitted it, and recently we received a telegram from Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang, approving the exemption from demolition. I am also very happy and can comfort the people of Siyi and overseas Chinese.

### Department of Education Orders Various Counties and Cities to Continue to Accept War Zone Students and Faculty: Revises Registration Methods to Broaden Acceptance

(Express News from Qujiang) Since the Department of Education moved to Qujiang, considering that students and faculty in the war zone in this province are inevitably being transferred to various places, if no measures are taken to accommodate them, it would be detrimental to cultivating the foundation of the country. Previously, orders were issued to various county governments and provincial schools outside the war zone to establish local registration and acceptance, so as to send them to their original schools and other schools separately to maintain their studies. Now, the registration methods have been revised again, and orders have been issued to various county and municipal governments to implement them conscientiously. The order stated, "The outline for the methods for accepting faculty and students withdrawing from the war zone in this province has been approved by the Provincial Government and implemented, and orders have been issued repeatedly to various county and municipal governments and provincial schools to conduct war zone faculty and student registration. However, due to the extraordinary times and traffic obstruction, few people know about it, so not many people have registered and signed up at the county schools. Now, in order to facilitate registration and broaden acceptance, in addition to establishing a registration office in Hong Kong, entrusted to the private Lingnan University, and establishing a registration office in Kowloon, entrusted to the private Guangzhou University, the registration methods have also been slightly revised. All counties and schools in the rear should immediately move to continue to hold them."

As of yesterday (12th), the enemy warships had sailed elsewhere, and the situation had eased. However, in the Tanzhou area of the Ninth District, many enemy warships are coming and going again, attempting to land again, entering Zhongshan, with ulterior motives, causing rumors to flourish in recent days, saying that the enemy is surrounding Zhongshan's coast and watching for landings, or that the situation is tense and preparing to evacuate the population. A false alarm occurred in Wan Chai the other day. In this regard, it is urgent to strictly guard against traitors, prevent problems before they arise, and prevent micro-invasions.

### Seventh District Commissioner Zhang Yan Promotes Education in Southern Guangdong: Maoming Concentrates Students for Military Training, and Holds Teacher Seminars

(Correspondence from Maoming) Maoming originally had more than five provincial and county-run secondary schools, with thousands of students. After the fall of the provincial capital, many students who escaped here to study became more lively. However, the schools lacked contact with each other, which has had an impact on the progress of wartime cultural work. Since the arrival of Zhang Yan, the Commissioner of the Seventh District, he has given many instructions on improving local education, concentrating the city's middle and high school students for military training, with more than 800 male and female students participating, which is an unprecedented event in the southern route.

### "Four Hundred Million Compatriots" Premieres in America

The premiere of the film "Four Hundred Million Compatriots" at a famous theater in New York recently caused a sensation throughout New York City. It was almost sold out every showing for two weeks.

This film records all the circumstances of China's War of Resistance. The lives on the front line and the dynamics of the rear are all vividly captured on camera. The filmmaker is the very experienced Joris Ivens. Three years ago, he gained fame for filming the news feature "The Spanish Earth" and is one of America's most famous news photographers.

The making of this film was extremely difficult. In China, Joris found that the materials he needed were scattered in various places. He had to travel at least eighty miles a day. In Spain, he only had to hear the sound of artillery fire at the hotel in Madrid and set off. He could be on the front line within fifteen minutes and start filming. But in China, the battlefield was so vast that it often took a week to find a good piece of material. He also spent a lot of effort and took great risks to obtain the footage of the great battle of "Overcoming Taierzhuang".

When the film was released in New York in March of this year, he was invited by journalists to present his working situation and thoughts. Below is a section of his report:

"... Regarding China, many Americans only know that it is a vast and rootless land and countless people who have suffered hardship. Therefore, the first purpose of my making this film was to go deep into the Chinese interior and bring back some real things, so that the audience can see the true face of China, their leaders and people, and their heroic posture in this War of Resistance, and sweep away the general superficial view of China. I can believe that I have not failed in making this film. The audience will definitely feel amazed and excited after seeing the heroic battle of the Chinese people in this film and overturn the old prejudices... Everything in this film is without embellishment. I recorded the truth..."

By the way, the narration of this film is provided by the famous star Little March.

### Isolated Island Silver News

Recently, in Shanghai, many film practitioners have leaped to become new directors. For example, Xinhua has Wang Yin and Chen Jiqing, Guohua has Zheng Xiaoqiu and Gong Jianong, etc. Li Ying of Yihua also recently presented the script of "The Flower Girl" to the authorities, intending to give it a try.

The purely classical beauty Zhang Cuihong will make a comeback, starring in Wu Cun's "Wang Baochuan."

Recently, in addition to the Dumi Theater on Avenue Joffre and Route Doumer, which will soon appear in Shanghai, some people are also planning to rent the entire second and third floors of the Paramount Hotel to open a theater. Negotiations have taken place, but it is feared that it will not be realized.

Liu Qun and Yin Xiucen recently led the un-disbanded trainees of the Xinhua singing and dancing troupe to visit Yihua. At that time, Fang Peilin's "Three Transformations of the Girl" was being filmed, and they were warmly received by Han Lagen and Yuan Meiyun.

Wu Cun's new work "Spring of the Isolated Island" has been renamed "Spring Rhapsody," starring Zhou Xuan.

Many drama and film personnel have gone to the mainland and Hong Kong, resulting in a lack of technical and specialized talents in the Shanghai film industry. In order to remedy this panic, various companies have promoted former assistant staff, especially in the areas of photography and lighting.

The comedian Liu Chunshan has also recently engaged in film production. His script has already been completed and is tentatively titled "No Way Out." He is currently in negotiations with a company to produce it. If negotiations are successful, Liu will direct and act in it himself.

Fang Peilin has been rushing to produce "Three Transformations of the Girl" for days, and he looks exhausted. At the same time, Yuan Meiyun, "the girl," also shows similar symptoms. However, Guan Hongda, despite his hard work, has actually gained weight. Some people say it's "one got fat, a pair got thin."

Li Pingqian's "Gold and Silver World" has been produced and filmed. His next new work is "Life and Death Hate," written by Sun Jingsuo, which is a love drama.

After Wang Yuanlong finishes filming "The Swallow Thief" at Yihua, he will go to Hong Kong, supposedly to film "The Beauty Trap." Wang Yuanlong previously starred in the silent film "The Beauty Trap" at the Da Zhonghua Shuanghe Company, in which Wang played Zhao Zilong. This time, he will likely play the same role again.

Wen Yimin's "Mysterious Lady" follows "Mulan Joins the Army" in being shown at the New Guang Theater. This film is a moral drama, and the performance is very tragic.

Diao Banhua, starring in "As It Is," is scheduled to begin filming on the 15th. Diao has been getting fatter recently and is in good spirits, so she often appears on Connaught Road.

### Husband, Wife, Friend

(9)

"Get out!" Toris said, sitting on the bed and crying angrily. Leo then walked towards the dressing room. Toris threw a telephone directory at Leo. When he turned his head, she had already hidden under the covers. His pace slowed as he walked into the dressing room.

Leo traveled outside for four days, to a small hotel. He discovered that Toris was no longer at home, and even his friend Meek didn't know where she had gone. When he returned to the office, the secretary worriedly collected a small sum to pay for his hotel rent. He learned that the concert manager Rossi was looking for him.

Rossi was able to give him a five-week contract for five hundred dollars a week to sing at the Scala Opera House in America. At that time, Caifa would also be the lead role. The first opera, "The Wanderer," was about to be staged immediately. Leo and his company were bankrupt. Although he was unwilling, he had to sign the contract.

"This is a matter of bread," he murmured.

On the first night of the performance, the audience in the theater was packed. Leo panicked for the first time on stage. He saw his own makeup in the mirror and was startled.

"Ah!" he sighed softly.

"My love, you look so good," said Caifa, who looked very beautiful in the costume of the heroine of the play.

"I look as ugly as the madman Rasputin," said Leo.

### The Finale of the Six Major Football Championships. Who Will Win the Xuhe Cup? If South China Wins, They Will Complete the Creation of Our Hua Team Sweeping the Championships. The Navy Has Abundant Talent, and Fierce Competition is Expected.

(Our Newspaper Special) The Xuhe Cup football final will be held at 4:30 this afternoon at Jia Shan.

South China has already won two championships in the five championships organized by the General Association—the Group A League and the Special Silver Medal. The remaining three championships have also fallen into the hands of our Hua team. If they defeat the Navy today, they will complete the glorious creation of sweeping the six major championships.

It is recalled that in the league final, South China once defeated the Navy to win the championship. The Navy at that time may not have been much different from today's. South China has selected elite players from both teams to participate in this time. It is reasonable to say that South China will not fail this time.

However, many of South China's players are suffering from foot injuries and are unable to play. Therefore, the lineup is not very complete, so whether they can win is quite doubtful.

Sweeping the championships is a major event. It is hoped that all the generals of South China will work together and not let their efforts be in vain.

Judging from South China's strength, although several elite players are absent, they are still very strong. They are very confident in Tengli, and their power will not be disappointing. However, the Navy now has abundant talent and has concentrated its efforts to form an army, which is not easy to deal with. Don't underestimate them.

As for their battle formation, it is not yet known how strong it is, so it is difficult to predict. South China has selected the following generals:

Zhang Rongcai, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Xie Jinhong, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai, Yang Shuiyi, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, Deng Guangsen, Tan Zhenhui

(Reserves) Luo Douwen, Lin De, Yang Genbao

### The Tennis World Appeals for Refugees. A Charity Match Will Be Held Today at the Hong Kong Cricket Club Ground.

(Fundraising) An unprecedented tennis

(Vibration) charity match will be held this afternoon

(Disaster) at 4:00 p.m. at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. Tickets are priced at $1.50 and $1.00, and all proceeds will be donated to the British Relief Association to help our country's disaster victims. All the matches are doubles matches.

(Veteran) The first match is between De

(Encounter) Fu and Gao Luwen and

(New Aristocrat) Li Rurong and He Jialiu. Many people know the skills of He and Li, but the partnership of De and Gao is also something the audience is eager to see. "Mr. Cane" De Fu is a former Shanghai singles champion. He participated in the Hong Kong Open Doubles this year, but was eliminated halfway due to an incompatible partner. Today, he and Gao Luwen will play together, and it is believed that there will be a wonderful performance. Gao is not only a tennis master, but also represented Hong Kong in the inter-port football team, holding an important position in the midfield. He is strong. A few years ago, he partnered with Fen Zha in doubles and competed fiercely with the then-popular Lin Zhen brothers. His tennis skills can be seen from this.

(Fateful) The second match is between Lin Zhen

(Again) brothers and the Xu brothers.

(Reunion) In this year's Open, the Lin Zhen brothers made a cold performance due to strategic errors. Mok and the Xu brothers competed for the championship, but they were depressed and unable to stretch themselves. Today, they have the opportunity to meet again and will put on a great show.

The third match is between De Fu and Gao Luwen and the Xu brothers, which is also worth watching. The two Xus are energetic, and De Fu is experienced. There will be good shots.

(Enemies) The fourth match is between Li Rurong

(Again) and He Jialiu and Lin

(Gather) Zhen brothers. It is expected that this match will be the most exciting scene in all the matches. Because the Lin Zhen brothers have revenge in mind, they will definitely go all out. At the same time, the audience can also test whether the tenacious tactics of the Li and He pair are still effective.

Each match has various styles, so don't let it go lightly. I urge tennis fans not to be stingy with their wallets, spend money to enjoy themselves, and do good deeds. It is really a win-win situation.

### A Fire Broke Out at the South China Stadium. A Small Part of the Stands Was Burned.

At 5:40 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the South China Athletic Association Stadium on Caroline Hill. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished quickly, preventing a disaster.

Yesterday afternoon at 5:40 p.m., several members were practicing baseball in the field, and the staff in the field were having dinner in the clubhouse. At that time, the members practicing baseball suddenly saw thick smoke rising from the stands near So Kon Po. They knew it was a fire and immediately notified the clubhouse staff to turn on the water pipes to extinguish the fire. On the one hand, they notified the Central Fire Station by telephone. After receiving the report, the station immediately dispatched a fire engine. At the same time, the No. 2 Police Station also dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene after hearing the news. However, when they arrived, the fire had already been extinguished by the people in the field. However, it still burned 300 feet long and 10 feet wide, with a loss of about 100 yuan.

The cause of the fire is suspected to be arson, otherwise it would not have started from the top of the stands. The police are currently investigating the matter.

### Tonight's Basketball Match. A Great Battle of Heroes and Heroines. It's a Charity Event...Don't Be Stingy

It will be held at 7:00 p.m. tonight at the YMCA basketball hall on Bridges Street. The men's YMCA team will play against the Star team, and the women's Meifang team will play against the China team. Heroes and heroines will gather together at one time, and there will be extremely exciting performances to satisfy the fans. Tickets are priced at $5, $3, $1, and $0.50. Yesterday, they were distributed for sale separately. People from all walks of life consider these two matches to be a rare opportunity, and because it is a charity event, they are happy to buy tickets. It is believed that the fundraising results will be good.

### Today's Baseball Game. China Meets a Strong Enemy. Let's See Who is Stronger, Hong Kong Club or China?

...[Our Newspaper Special] Baseball is the most brain-intensive sport. The changes are magical and different at every moment. If you understand the rules of the game, you must admit that it is more mysterious and spectacular than any other ball sport.

...This year's Open Baseball Tournament has already opened last week. Two good shows have been staged successively, giving the audience a good new impression.

...Today, another big battle is coming. It is China against Hong Kong Club. The match will be held at the Caroline Hill Navy Field at 2:30 p.m. I heard that Hong Kong Club has recruited many new players this year, and their strength is quite strong. Unlike last year, when they were mediocre and incompetent, they have a new lineup this year.

...Although Hong Kong Club is playing for the first time today, it is difficult to estimate their strength. We will have to see it clearly after the war breaks out. However, according to news from related parties, there are indeed several good players from the Golden State who have joined the team, so they have suddenly developed a strong ambition to compete for the future championship.

...Coincidentally, the team's first match is against China, the defending champion. If the team is really strong, then this battle is equivalent to a touchstone. If they have the possibility of defeating China in the next match, it is no wonder that they are ambitious.

...China suffered a setback in its first match last week and was defeated by the Myanmar slaves in a situation where it should not have been defeated. However, this was an accident, and its championship prestige has not been damaged as a result. If the members work harder on cooperation, they will not be afraid of any strong enemies.

...If Hong Kong Club is not extremely strong, it will not be easy to defeat China. In short, this battle is worth watching. (Tai Sui)

### Philippine Travel Notes

— Hui Tang

May 4th, 4 to 1

The drums of the crowd urged frequently, and the three-month period was over. Looking around, I felt a chill. After several discussions, a surprise army stood out. The lineup is as follows:

Tan Jun'gan, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Liang Rongzhao, Shi Han, Fei Shu Xie Da, Hou Chengtang, Bi Ludo, Da Gao, Nu, Feng Jingxiang, Yan Ba Chen

Looking closely at the bizarre lineup, the weaver had long been worried about it. However, the talent is exhausted today, and although it is desired to adjust and strengthen it, it is impossible. Bi Ludo's transfer to the front line is really a creation. Shi Han's appointment as the central army is also a forced attempt. Moreover, the YCO, with its tired division, is facing the champion's high intentions. It is no different from hitting a stone with an egg. Who knows that there are things in the world that cannot be expected by people? In the past two battles, they had the heart to win but could not win. Tonight, they thought they would lose, but they could not lose. "Living after being placed in a dead place," "When two armies meet, the sadder one wins," the art of war has already said it. Our people broke the cauldron and sank the boat and tried their best to fight to the death. We have a considerable understanding of the weather and lighting, and the competition is more regular than before, with no faults. Although Bi Ludo has no achievements, Shi Han has just started his career and his performance is excellent. He is the most outstanding member of the whole game, making people applaud and praise. Finally, with a score of four to one, they played the triumphant song for the first time. The two inside forwards each made one goal, and Da Gao bravely pulled out two cities. It is enough to be comforted by this small victory. The strange soldiers and different achievements are especially pleasantly surprised. After the game, the Philippine side believed that our team's measures were gradually improving and firmly invited us to the fourth game. Our side politely declined due to the fatigue of the soldiers. The result of the ball battle is magical and unpredictable. Tonight's battle is another solid proof.

Baguio Baquio rings the bells, and at this time, the affluent people of the Philippines gather together. Our people, with the good intentions of the host, also drove to Baguio early this morning. The car traveled for nearly five hours before arriving. Along the way, the trees were sparse and the mountain roads were winding and tortuous. Looking down, it was like walking a long snake. The sky here is always spring, and the mountain scenery is especially pleasing to the eye. When entering the country, there is a wooden sign with the words "Baguio warmly welcomes you" written on it. Behind it is "Thank you for your kindness, turn back as soon as possible." In the middle of the road, at dangerous corners, there are often warnings, such as "If you want Baguio to be quiet, unless you use the car brakes more and the horn less," which is quite similar to the road police signs in a certain city in the Americas, "Driving slowly allows you to see the city, driving fast only allows you to see the prison." When we arrived, we had a quick look and it was almost dusk. We took off our clothes and took a bath and felt quite shivering. In the evening, the clear wind and bright moon stirred up the thoughts of the guests. In the distance, we faintly heard the sound of flutes in the village. Turning our thoughts to the mountains and rivers of our homeland, we increased our sorrow. We embraced the quilt and lay down, and the single felt still felt cold. (To be continued)

### Lessons Learned from Going to the Philippines

The Hong Kong football team suffered two defeats and one victory in this expedition to the Philippines. The record was extremely poor, which was not expected by the team itself. The news came, and it made the hearts of the Hong Kong people cold and greatly disappointed. The main reason for this is that the team suffered successive injuries and illnesses. The luck was bad, and the heat and lights of the Philippines caused it. I dare not not do my best, and it is difficult to live in peace.

In the three-game review, those who were able to maintain the level of performance in Hong Kong with good performances were only Jun'gan and Rongsheng. Those who were passable were Da Gao, Shi Han, and Chengtang. Old players such as Jingxiang and Tiansheng also had measures that were not as good as when they were in Hong Kong due to changes in the environment. Rongzhao and Guangrong had not recovered from their foot injuries, and their true talents were not seen. The rest were mediocre and unremarkable. Strictly speaking, they were not enough to help. I myself did not take warning and injured my leg on the stage. I was deeply sorry for the heavy trust. Fortunately, all the friends were full of energy, the group was harmonious, the trip was harmonious, and they felt at home. And the lessons learned from this trip have their own special value, which can be used as a reference for any team that goes to the Philippines in the future.

I think that if you want to send a football team to the Philippines, you must pay attention to the following points: (1) There must be a month of preparation and strict training to make the players full of strength. The level of football skills in Hong Kong is still difficult for the Philippines to compare with. If the strength is not lacking, it should be able to cope with it easily. The Hong Kong team was selected too early this time, which made the players who performed well recently fail to be selected. Moreover, there has not been a proper test match after the selection, and there is no certainty of cooperation. The training of English and Portuguese members is insufficient, and the Chinese members have too many football affairs. Both excess and insufficiency are not suitable. This is the mistake in the preparation aspect. (2) The Philippine weather is hot all year round, especially in May and June, which is the most unbearable. Insufficient sleep and food, and a sluggish spirit, how can you fight for a long time? February is relatively cool, and it is suitable to go south at this time. (3) In the war in the Philippines, the opponent's actions are uncultured, and the audience (referring to Filipinos) are even more barbaric, helping the evildoers and giving people a bad impression. Moreover, it is easier to get injured in evening games. The visiting team should have a full reserve of six or seven people to prepare for emergencies. If the Hong Kong team is short of generals this time, it has been unable to cope with it. How can an incomplete army win? (4) In the evening battle, low lights are easier to control, but high balls are often difficult for beginners. This is a vision problem. Without a considerable amount of time to understand, it is the biggest loss for the visiting team. The Hong Kong team's ability to cope with ease in the third game was nothing but a habit. I think it is best for the visiting team to have three or four days of practice under the lights before the game, so the blind bumps and leaks, and the pre-judgment errors, can be reduced.

In addition, it is advisable to use low balls frequently during the game to facilitate vision, and to use long passes to break the enemy's usual "man-to-man" defense. The food and accommodation of the players should be properly adjusted. It is inevitable to drink in hot weather, but ice water hurts the stomach, and drinking too much is useless. All these kinds of things are what the team leaders should know in the future, so that everything is prepared and adapts to the environment, and they will not repeat the Hong Kong team's mistakes this time. As the Bible says, "If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell," so the sacrifice of the pioneer of the inter-port team this time can indirectly benefit those who follow, so what harm is there?

### Basketball Association Incident. South China's Appeal is Upheld. The League's Decision to Re-schedule the Final

On the evening of the 8th of this month, after Xingdao defeated South China 31-29 in the Open Men's Group A Basketball Tournament, South China stated that during a request by Xingdao to replace a player, South China learned from the recorder's whistle to suspend the game. However, Xingdao took the opportunity to shoot the ball in, and therefore lost to Xingdao by two points. Therefore, it filed seven complaints with the Basketball Association. At 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the League convened an emergency committee meeting at the Shengsi Hotel to discuss and resolve this matter. Those who attended the meeting were Yan Dianlian (Xingdao), Liu Xiwent (Zhong Sheng), Xie Feilie (Zhong Nan), Zhao Kuiz (Li Xing), Ma Zhaohua (Hua Xiong), Cai Guoping (Dong Fang), Li Zhiming (Reporter), Yang Juhua (Hong Kong University), Dian Huiming (Meifang), Xu Heng, Hu Zhengqu, Lin Zhong, and others. Lian Dianlian presided over the meeting, and Xie Feilie recorded the minutes. The press reporter read South China's appeal. Then the referee of the game, Han Lie, and the linesman Liu Deyu reported on the circumstances of the execution of their duties at that time, and the members expressed their opinions on the incident. Later, South China coach Hu Zhiqu expressed his opinion, saying that the sound of the whistle used by the recorder at that time was no different from that used by the referee, so the South China players stopped moving according to the sound of the whistle. If the players did not stop and continued the game, they would be against the referee and would be in violation of the rules. The players focused their attention on the ball during the game and only listened to the sound of the whistle to determine whether to advance or retreat. At this point, reporters and people from both sides were asked to leave, and the committees discussed the matter. Since Yan Dianlian represented Xingdao, he recused himself, and Zhao Kuiz chaired the meeting instead. As a result, it was decided that the South China team did not recognize the two points that the Xingdao team had won. It sent a letter of ten complaints to the committee. According to the letter, an emergency meeting was convened in accordance with the procedures, and the referee, record officer, and timekeeper of the game were invited to attend. According to the referee's report, when the recorder blew the whistle, the ball was in progress. However, the record officer said that when the whistle was blown, the ball was out of bounds. In the midst of the confusion of the audience, it was difficult to observe the situation at that time. The committee could not find conclusive evidence from this report, so it was decided that the two points won by Xingdao would be cancelled, and the scores of both sides were equal. The two teams should re-schedule a game.

### Stock Market Prices Higher This Week; Trading Volume Still Low.

The local stock market this week has improved due to the easing European situation. The stock prices of companies such as Hong Kong Hotel, Whampoa Dock, Hongkong Land, Telephone Company, Dairy Farm, Kowloon Wharf, and Hong Kong Electric have all increased. However, sellers are reluctant to part with their stocks at higher prices, resulting in low trading volume. It is generally expected that the prices of various stocks will continue to rise.

Shanghai is the center of our national culture and a gathering place for cultural fighters. The vigorous cultural endeavors and revolutionary struggles of the past years can prove this. This cultural stronghold, even though it is now being trampled by the bloody feet of Japanese fascists, still has the excellent tradition of struggle deeply buried in the hearts of countless young fighters, stirring up a burning tide of resistance. No matter how bad the environment created by the Japanese warlords and their running dogs, or how foul the poisonous flames they spew, they cannot extinguish the strong will of the young fighters. This is precisely why the "isolated island" is not lonely; its surroundings are buried with huge sparks, and its shores can be swept by waves of anger at any time. The reality of the struggle never deceives. Precisely because of this, those people are very jealous of the struggle of these patriotic men and women, and they do not hesitate to use all kinds of means to persecute them.

The Shanghai Student Wartime Work Team, which ignited the fiery flame of the patriotic movement and stirred up the anti-Japanese and anti-traitorous tide on the "isolated island," was naturally regarded by the authorities as a "monster". They negotiated with the concession authorities and demanded that their activities be stopped. These young fighters were surrounded by this bad atmosphere and were subjected to various threats of surveillance, arrest, and warning by the concession authorities. Now, thirteen of them (four women) have been forced by the final warning of the Central Police Station to leave their homes, the smoky and miasmic Shanghai, and embark on their journey elsewhere.

From the suffering and hardships experienced by these thirteen fighters, we have fully confirmed that they have written a page of heroic combat life for the sake of the nation, forgetting themselves. It is also fully confirmed that they are indeed a vital force of the new force of the Chinese nation, and it is even more fully proved that they and the invaders and traitors are in an extremely opposed and irreconcilable position.

They are now forced to arrive in Hong Kong and plan to transfer to the Guilin battlefield to serve. However, even before they have started their long journey, they have already suffered a serious blow. However, I know that they do not feel pain. They still issue strong calls and strong accusations of justice from this inevitable phenomenon in the course of struggle. This makes us even more admired.

But in order to ensure that our warm salute does not become a formal, empty gesture, we need to reach out our ardent hands and use the material resources we can donate to complete the journey of these thirteen fighters back to the battlefield. These thirteen fighters are about to leave, but this is not an escape or refuge. Instead, they are forced to change to another combat environment and sow their anti-Japanese sparks again. Friends! Understand them correctly and help them!

### Soviet Female Aviator (Part 1)

— Paulina・Osipenko, translated from Moscow News

Osipenko is the most famous female aviator in the Soviet Union. She was originally a poor peasant girl. Here is her self-report of her struggle history. –Translator

When I was young, I never dreamed that I would become an aviator. My childhood was spent in the Ukrainian countryside, in Novospasovka, in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. My father was worried about our bread, and our thoughts were suppressed by heavy farm tools.

When I reached school age, I stopped reading after a short time to help the family by working as an infant. My school years passed by hastily.

I graduated from the second grade, and after only learning to read and write, I worked on the farm.

In 1924, when I was seventeen, I joined the Young Communist League.

In 1927, my family joined the collective farm, and I was also shaken into society.

Although I was very young, I could tell the difference between the collective farm and my father, a poor farmer... I thought, if I read more books, I would definitely understand more.

Soon after, our collective farm received many admission certificates from agricultural schools, and I also requested to study. I was sent to Kiev to study a six-month poultry farming course.

But after attending the first lesson, I immediately realized that my level was far behind other students. They all had seven years of education, while I only had two years of education.

Should I go back to the collective farm? No, I will never. Even if I work day and night, I will stay here. I studied desperately, and my mind was filled with "effort", but I succeeded. Six months later, I graduated with other students.

So I contributed my opinion to the collective farm and organized a poultry and livestock farm in the Petrensk District, which determined my destiny.

One summer, two planes came, and the rumbling sound covered all the sounds on the farm. I stood at the door, watching, afraid to breathe.

The plane landed, and there was a great commotion in the village. Everyone, with gray beards and swaying, ran to the field to see this strange thing. Of course, I was in the middle of this group of people.

The strangeness made me stunned. I didn't know if what I saw was a plane or a person. I didn't believe my eyes. Outside the fuselage, together with the mechanic, there was a woman walking with a leather helmet-shaped thing on her head.

"Oh! Can women fly too?" I asked her, my curiosity overcoming my shyness.

"Of course, they will," she laughed (I later learned that she was not an aviator, but a caregiver).

'Are you frightened?'

'Not at all.'

'I know a female aviator in Kakovfo,' a pilot said.

I turned around and heard that a woman can also become an aviator, or maybe I can succeed. Why not? I want to go, I want to go, I firmly decided that I will be an aviator.

One of them, I knew, was studying at the Aviation School in Sebastopol. Without hesitation, I wrote him a letter. I told him about the plane that stopped in our village, the woman in the plane, and the female aviator in Kakovfo. I also wrote that I wanted to be an aviator. I am twenty-three years old this year, in good health, and a member of the Young Communist League. Could he help me learn to fly?

His reply came to Sebastopol, we can confirm.

I went there.

### Night Watch

— Zhang Zhenshan

——Fragments of a strong man's life

The dark night sky stretches broadly before people's eyes. The vast and silent suburbs are eerily quiet. One cannot see the fields and villages, nor hear the voices of people and the barking of dogs. Looking up into the distance, there is only a black void. The trench that stretches along the railway also merges with the ground.

In the wilderness, the strong men guarding the night are advancing to the trench. Although the path needs to be groped in the darkness, there are no difficulties.

Groping along the railway, arriving in the trench, crawling forward, in a moment, one passes through the entire trench and reaches the end. Then, one takes up a post and stands guard.

In the trench, one imagines an unceasing invasion, treating the mountains in front, the thatched huts, and the trees as Japanese planes coming for a night attack. We do not neglect defense because we are in the rear; nor do we relax our vigilance because we are in the dark night. Only by strengthening exploration and steadfastly guarding, the drifting clouds in the sky, the sparse trees, and the flickering points of light, the subtle sounds of the wind blowing across the grassland are all imprinted clearly on our minds. The courage and determination of a group of people, the police, fully demonstrate a full combat power.

Everyone pricks up their ears, listening to the night sounds flowing out of the silence, listening to the rise and fall of the natural music in the high sky. In this cold and desolate suburb, although there is no crackling of flames, when we imagine the battle scenes on the front line, our hearts will jump.

At this moment, suddenly a faint sound comes from the mountain valley. We shine a flashlight, and three blurry figures are immediately reflected in our eyes. Urgently, raising our voices, we loudly ask for the password. They ignore us. We continue to ask for the password again. When we answer the first part of the password, they cannot answer the second part. And they remain silent.

"No password?" The group of people becomes nervous from doubt. With a shrug, they jump out of the trench and run to surround them. Many beams of flashlight light are focused on the three people, and they immediately stop moving and ask for the password:

"Final" - "Victory"

The password is shouted. Approaching for a closer look, it turns out that the training officer and a resourceful chief of staff have come to observe and test our defensive spirit. Another person is a conscript. After paying respects, the training officer asks us with a smile: "If you are really on the front line guarding the night and encounter someone without a password, what would you do?"

"Surround them, search them, disarm them, and escort them to——."

The training officer nods. Continuing to smile, he says: "The most important thing is: alertness and communication; vision and hearing must control all directions. One should only run when one should advance quickly; even if separated from command, one must be able to act alone."

Returning to the trench, standing at the post, we eagerly review the expectations in our hearts again: perhaps our strength will achieve something in a certain position and fill us with the joy of victory?

The night becomes deeper and also darker, the wind also becomes stronger. Looking up at the high sky, due to the gradual and sharp decline in natural pitch, we realize that the first half of the night has passed. When the second shift of strong men guarding the night gropes to take over the shift, although we embark on the return journey, we still feel attached to the trench.

### Two Eras

— Jiong Chang

In the handwriting, I seem to see a patch of blurred bloodstains. In my memory, it is a long-sealed past event. I am overwhelmed. A vague phantasm emerges in my mind.

One year, two years, three years... pass by uneventfully. Two different faces in the dark shadows of the high walls also gradually disappear. However, I think it is worthy of pride.

In the west of the city, beside that, under the trees, in that vast open space, the sound of shouting slogans, the enthusiastic speeches, the startling gunshots, the men and women who fell in a pool of blood under the trees, disarray, fleeing, fear, terror, anger... Everything intertwines into a memory of comfort. After all, in an unfortunate arrangement, the prison cell, without freedom and without the breath of new, became their residence.

The second year was on a cloudy afternoon. After much hardship, I saw them in that cramped, dark little room. We painfully spoke some irrelevant words, because many "protectors" (?) were standing at the door. I quietly signaled the good news I brought, and they both only smiled bitterly slightly. That impression was so deep. I gave them a touching smile. A ray of light flashed across those two thin and haggard faces, that heavy shackle.

Another year passed. Those who made inevitable sacrifices in the era of transit still remained in that peaceful and eternal realm. The storms outside could not blow in at all. Separated by a high wall, they were unaware that the dark era had passed.

Today, the last day of Youth Movement Week, the commemoration in this island under a foreign flag makes me recall my friends who were imprisoned for liberation. However, the times are different! Everything is changing.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

"No, I still have work to do."

"Look, your injury is too severe."

"Yes, I was in pain all night."

"How did it get so bad?"

"I think it was from that night." He said unintentionally, "This is a memento."

"Forgive me! Or, you just stab me once."

She threw herself into his arms and cried. This cry stunned him; he didn't know how to arrange himself in this moment. Fortunately, she roused herself and moved her head from his chest, forcing herself to change his bandages. She kept saying:

"I hope to see your injury heal soon!"

However, one of his comrades came and told him with a smile:

"The money has been received in full." Then he turned to her and said, "Miss Zhu, please go home, thank you!"

After hearing this, she seemed a little dazed; she continued to put new bandages around his neck, all the while tearing up.

"What did that person say? ... What go home? ..." Then she immediately asked:

"Are you telling me to go home?"

"Yes, you should go home!"

As a result, her tears, which had just stopped, continued to flow. Her gradually calming mood was disturbed again. Since yesterday, she had been conquered by their lives, devoted to them, hoping they would give her shelter. She was already disgusted with her own family, especially her father. She had hoped to turn from darkness to light. But now, her once beautiful dream will be shattered again—leaving them whom she is reluctant to part with, walking back to her silent and evil family alone; so she cried, and shouted:

"I can't go home! ... I can't go home!"

"No, you should go home! Let me tell you the reason—"

"I won't listen, you are a liar!!! A liar!!!"

She stared at him and cursed fiercely. But she was still bandaging him, and she was being more careful, not letting a thin gap be left between the bandages, or a loose thread.

Other comrades, seeing this scene, also felt helpless and shook their heads. At the same time, they were waiting for this work to end quickly, their address needed to be moved immediately. (64)
