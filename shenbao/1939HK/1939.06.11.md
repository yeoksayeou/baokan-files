### What is the Basis of the Legal Tender's Value?

— Wang Musheng

The Shanghai foreign exchange market, which had been stable for several months, suspended the sale of foreign exchange due to a telegram from Hong Kong seven days ago, causing turbulent waves, rampant rumors, and a sharp contraction in the black market exchange rate for British and American currencies, with almost no official market rate to speak of. The price of gold skyrocketed by one hundred fifty to sixty yuan, and the prices of cotton yarn and other commodities also soared, while public bonds fell by three, four, or five jiao. This phenomenon, on the one hand, indicates the people's pessimism about the future of foreign exchange, and on the other hand, it shows a misunderstanding of the legal tender, believing that once the legal tender cannot buy foreign exchange, it has no value, so they rush to hoard gold and commodities to prepare for the worst.

For those who hold this pessimistic view, we should first point out to them that the basis of the legal tender's value is not entirely in foreign exchange, and that even if Shanghai suspends the sale of foreign exchange, it will only help the legal tender and not harm it.

Do we have any basis for making this observation? Yes! We must first recognize that China is now a country that implements currency management. In all countries that implement a managed currency system, the internal and external value of its currency can be separated and established on two different bases. Internally, as long as the amount of legal tender issued can develop in parallel with the amount of domestic production, that is, it should not be issued indiscriminately without limit, then the relationship between the legal tender and commodity prices will definitely be able to maintain a balance, and the legal tender will not depreciate. Because, fundamentally speaking, under currency management, the legal tender cannot be redeemed, and its value is entirely determined by its exchange ratio with all other commodities. Although the amount of legal tender issued in China after the war has increased slightly compared to before the war, it has definitely not reached an excessive level, which is known to everyone. Therefore, to say that the legal tender is worthless if it cannot buy foreign exchange is completely ignorant. Can't the legal tender still buy rice and clothes in the inland? Secondly, externally, under currency management, the external value depends on the gold and silver it holds abroad, but the most important thing is its own country's ability to export. If it can export a large amount of goods, whether they are industrial products or agricultural products, it can obtain a large amount of foreign exchange to purchase bulk foreign goods, and the external value of its currency can be maintained. Although most of China's foreign transportation routes have been blocked after the war, the number of export goods has not decreased much due to the overall planning of the Trade Commission, and the future is very bright. Therefore, there is no problem in the constant replenishment and accumulation of China's foreign exchange resources, which means that the basis of the legal tender's external value is also extremely solid.

However, does the suspension of foreign exchange sales in Shanghai mean a drop in the external value and a loss of internal value of China's legal tender? Absolutely not. Why? Because we know that in a country with currency management, in order to protect its valuable foreign exchange resources, it is necessary to implement foreign exchange control to prevent foreign exchange from being wasted or used for useless consumption. China is now in a difficult period of seeking national liberation, and foreign exchange must of course be controlled. However, due to the complexity of international relations, although the import and export of foreign exchange in the inland areas are under the government's overall control, only a part of it has been controlled in Shanghai, that is, the import, but not the export. However, the government is still selling foreign exchange here, which is obviously to maintain the goodwill of the United Kingdom and the United States and to win our aid to China. However, Shanghai is no longer an independent place, and selling foreign exchange here will inevitably be exploited. Therefore, in order to maintain friendly relations with democratic countries on the one hand and to prevent others from taking advantage on the other hand, it may be possible to adopt further and more appropriate measures to prevent foreign exchange from being wasted in vain. But this does not mean that China's foreign exchange resources have been exhausted and the legal tender is worthless. On the contrary, if the government appropriately and rationally transfers foreign exchange resources to the inland for use, so that precious foreign exchange is not taken advantage of by anyone in this so-called occupied area, China's foreign exchange resources will only increase and become stronger day by day, and it will never be the end of China's foreign exchange or the depreciation of the legal tender.

Having understood the characteristics of the value of modern currency and the particularity of Shanghai, we will not panic about the evolution of China's foreign exchange policy, and we will not have the slightest shadow on the future of the legal tender. Will the Shanghai foreign exchange market return to its original state in the future? We cannot judge now, but judging from the current international situation, it may not be possible to completely ignore Shanghai. Even if we take a step back and say that foreign exchange will not be sold in Shanghai, a brand-new foreign exchange market will definitely appear in the inland in the future, because no matter how much control there is, some foreign exchange will eventually have to be sold. And as long as the purpose is proper and the use is necessary, foreign exchange can eventually be obtained, but perhaps not as freely and casually as it is now.

Is it not appropriate for a country to make reasonable control over foreign exchange within reasonable limits in order to seek national survival and liberation? And shouldn't the general property class slightly reduce some unnecessary Western enjoyment? Smart friends should be able to think about it calmly, right? Why should the general public worry about the future of the legal tender for no reason?!

### World Trends in a Week

— Pan Lang

From June 4th to 10th, 1939

This is a heart-shaking week!

The British special envoy has flown to Moscow, and the British King and Queen have arrived in Washington amidst the cheers of hundreds of thousands of people. However, the British government's policy is still doubted by the world, and the invaders are taking the opportunity to do evil even more rampantly. In the West, Germany is "striking first" and its evil hands are reaching into the Baltic coastal countries. In the East, Japan has completed the arrangement for attacking and seizing the Tianjin concessions, and even dares to kill British expatriates in Shanghai!

On the other hand, the depreciation of China's legal tender has shaken people's hearts and even more so the market. Rumors about the attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States are spreading from all sides. However, at this moment, the National Government issued an order to strictly arrest the traitor and traitor Wang Jingwei. It swept away the dark clouds in everyone's mind, it demonstrated the power of the Chinese people's voice and the progress of the entire political system, and it further increased the international prestige of Chinese politics and people!

(1) Strang Flies to Moscow Slowly, The British Government Has Not Abandoned the Policy of Compromise

Last week, it was said that the anti-aggression line of the British, French, and Soviet mutual assistance negotiations, due to the British government's insufficiently resolute and active attitude, had been frustrated again. On the Soviet side, in addition to Foreign Minister Molotov's report on May 31, a reply was proposed to the United Kingdom and France on the second of this month: (1) The agreement shall take effect when any of the three contracting parties of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France is subjected to aggression. (2) The agreement shall take effect when any of the three countries is involved in war due to the protection of Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Finland, Estonia, or Latvia. (3) The agreement shall be implemented when any of the three countries is invaded for assisting other countries applying for assistance. (4) The contracting parties shall immediately discuss technical and mutual assistance methods for resisting aggression. (5) The actions produced by the negotiations shall be unrelated to the League of Nations. (6) The contracting parties shall fully report their original anti-aggression agreements to each other, and exchange opinions with each other before each acceptance of a new treaty. (7) After the implementation of the three-nation agreement, they shall not separately sign peace treaties with opponents. (8) The term of the agreement shall be five years, but it may be extended. According to reports, the British and French authorities have formulated a new counter-proposal as a result of studying this reply. The British government has appointed Strang, the director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to fly to Moscow to continue the negotiations. Chamberlain said in a report on the 7th, "The British government will satisfy the Soviet Union's hopes and is prepared to establish an agreement based on a complete mutual relationship, and at the same time clearly express its willingness to unite with France without reservation. Once the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression, it will provide full military assistance." However, when the British Foreign Secretary elaborated on diplomacy in the House of Lords on the 8th, he still tried his best to please Italy and Germany, indicating that Britain had not forgotten the policy of compromise. And Strang also postponed his trip to the Soviet Union. Therefore, some people still suspect the sincerity of the United Kingdom towards the Soviet Union. Churchill of the Conservative Party has risen up and loudly called for it, and the French political circles have also expressed dissatisfaction with this policy of the United Kingdom. (See today's newspaper yesterday)

(2) Invaders Take the Opportunity to Launch Major Activities, Strange News Reflects New Conspiracies

The fascist invaders had already been watching from the sidelines. Seeing this attitude of Britain and the wavering of the French government, they believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so they enticed and flattered on the one hand and sharpened their knives on the other. On the 4th, Hitler delivered a speech, trying his best to defend the policy of aggression and threatening the United Kingdom and France. Germany and Italy separately withdrew some invading troops from Spain, trying their best to entice the United Kingdom and France. Then, under the guise of the Pope's "peace" appeal, it claimed that the Pope had instructed Italy, Germany, France, Poland, Britain, and other countries to contact their governments to convene a five-nation conference to resolve international issues and prevent "Bolshevism from spreading in Europe," and did its best to entice and collude with a small number of reactionary leaders in the United Kingdom and France. At the same time, they also "struck first" and extended their evil hands to the Baltic coastal countries, first seizing Latvia and Estonia, and signing the "Non-Aggression Treaty" between Germany, Estonia, and Latvia in Berlin. The "Non-Aggression Agreement" between Germany and Denmark was also approved by the Danish Parliament on the 2nd. In addition, Germany and Italy also joined forces to attack Yugoslavia. Italy was showing off its military power and deploying war on the southern border, and Germany even invited Prince Paul of the southern country to Berlin, forcing him to recognize the five requirements in an attempt to control the southern country politically, economically, and militarily. At the same time, news came that Germany and Italy were also coveting Bolivia in South America. U.S. Secretary of State Hull and the Bolivian Embassy in the United Kingdom both issued statements on the matter on the 4th. And the news that Germany and Italy were helping the Japanese army to deploy future military work to continue invading China and preparing for the Soviet Union was also published in several newspapers this week.

(3) "Foreign Slave" Cleverly Plays a Two-Faced Game, The United Kingdom, The United States, and France Suffer Three Lashes

Last week's report was not wrong. The Japanese ×× shamefully succumbed to the provocations against the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. Although it will continue to have the same shameless performance in the future, the main thing is that it will first choose the weak to attack!

At this time of "European chaos," the Japanese invaders of the East are staging a big magic show, imitating the two-faced tactics of Germany and Italy in Europe today. On the one hand, they pretend and act, claiming that they will never participate in the German-Italian military alliance. Then, they promote that "the British-Soviet negotiations have failed, and the British-Japanese alliance is brewing 'revival,'" and even spread rumors that "the United Kingdom and the United States have come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, and the United Kingdom and the United States are forcing China to yield" (this was especially loud when the legal tender depreciated). Anyone who knows a little about the international situation will naturally see at a glance that this is a Japanese ×'s plot to lure the great powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to fall into its ×, to sow discord in the friendship between China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. On the other hand, the Japanese × unexpectedly put on the airs of an evil star. In addition to continuing and intensifying the anti-foreign propaganda, they also specially selected the United Kingdom, one of the weakest links in the anti-aggression line, to carry out a "full martial arts" political and diplomatic offensive. They continued to express their strength and arrogance towards the Gulangyu incident, and tried their best to worsen the situation in Shanghai, even beating to death Dingler, a British employee of the Lun Chang Factory (he was found dead in a bizarre way by the British in the factory on the 8th). In addition, what is even more noteworthy is the breakdown of the negotiations on opening the Pearl River, the detention of Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Foshan ships, and the forced surrender of the British on the Yangtze River issue. What is even more astonishing is that after Spear, the military attache of the British Embassy, was tragically arrested by the Japanese ×, his attendant Cuba was also detained. The preparations for the armed seizure of the Tianjin concessions are also being actively arranged, and the Tianjin concessions have once again fallen into a state of "stormy weather." The United Kingdom, the United States, and France have obviously suffered heavy losses. Allowing negotiations with the Japanese side is the first mistake. Pressuring Shanghai newspapers and anti-Japanese elements, and even delivering the Japanese ×'s peace "conditions" on their behalf, is the second time they have been fooled. Ordering British expatriates to apply for Yangtze River passes from the Japanese military leaders can be said to be the third time they have been beaten.

What is the result of concession and compromise? The "Kokumin Shimbun" in Tokyo published on the 9th: "Japan must expel British forces in the Far East!"

(4) Roosevelt Guarantees Pro-Soviet Policy, The United States Greets the British King Warmly

The friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States, the guardians of world peace and the most loyal and reliable friends on the anti-aggression line, has been improving recently. The new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Oumansky, presented his credentials to the United States on the 3rd of this month and said, "In the current international situation, universal peace and cultural progress have been greatly threatened. Therefore, the enhancement of mutual friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union is even more important. The Soviet Union's foreign policy has the deepest sincerity for world peace." At that time, U.S. President Roosevelt said in his speech, guaranteeing that the United States is determined to maintain and promote the Soviet policy. He said, "The United States is now cooperating with the Soviet Union, and it should develop the friendly relations between the two countries in the future." In addition, the commercial treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Poland was approved by the Soviet government on the 4th. The Soviet fleet's exercise in the Baltic Sea, the U.S. President's all-out advocacy of abolishing the unfair ban on arms exports in the current Neutrality Act, and the U.S. Pacific Fleet's commencement of a large exercise on the 5th, etc., all the news in this week can be seen the efforts of the Soviet Union and the United States in anti-aggression and peace-keeping work. And what is even more sensational in the world is that the British King and Queen's engagement to Canada and the United States arrived in Washington on the afternoon of the 8th, and all the U.S. officials and people sent out a frenzy of cheers. During the grand party in the evening, when the U.S. President raised his glass to wish the British King and Queen health, he said, "The entire United States welcomes distinguished guests. Recently, the settlement of the Pacific islands' affiliation issues between the United Kingdom and the United States has further increased the friendship between the two countries. We hope that this kind of understanding between the two countries will become closer and work together for world peace." The British King also said in his reply, "I hope that the two great countries of the United Kingdom and the United States can move forward side by side in a peaceful world in the future." Yes! If the United Kingdom and the United States work together to resist aggression, world peace will come!

(5) Peeping at Northern Shaanxi and Western Shanxi, A Great Battle, On the Overall Situation, Our Army Has the Advantage

Once the War of Resistance Against Japan came, there were still no major changes.

First of all, in the Central China area, since our army smashed the Japanese ×'s plan to "encircle and annihilate" a large-scale campaign under Dahong Mountain in northern Hubei and southern Henan, the Japanese × fled in embarrassment, retreating four or five hundred li. Our army took advantage of the victory and advanced, gaining control of the Japanese ×'s actions in Central China. At the beginning of the month, the Japanese × turned to southern Hubei, attempting to circle around northern Hunan along the Han River, and coordinate with Henan × to meet in Changsha. However, after the fierce battle in the Han River, the × army lost its offensive power. Now the × in the Han River cannot cross the East Jing River, and our troops on the north bank of the Xinqiang River have been sweeping away the remnants of the × for days, with the momentum of a broken bamboo. Not only have they recovered the original strongholds, but they still maintain the encirclement of Yueyang. The × in northern Jiangxi have been trying to cross the Gan River for days without success. The borders of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi are generally calm. The ×'s plan to open up the entire Yuehan Railway is temporarily impossible to realize.

In the Northwest, the situation has become tense in the past week. The Japanese × are attacking from southern Shanxi and western Shanxi. Regarding southern Shanxi, the × has been dividing its troops into three routes since the 6th, attempting to directly attack Maojiandu, and the war is unprecedentedly fierce. As of the 8th, the telegraph reported that as a result of our army's brave counterattack, it had successively recovered Shengshangjian, Hanjia Village, and other places, and the morale was high, and the situation had improved. Regarding western Shanxi, the × has been transferring more than 10,000 troops from the Taiyuan, Yuci, and Fenyang areas to Zhongyang and Lishi, attempting to cross the Yellow River to the west and invade northern Shaanxi. Thus, the major battle that became the focus of the war this week was staged in western Shanxi. Our army first killed more than 1,000 × in the area south of Jicheng on the 4th of the month. Then, the × changed its strategy and adopted a roundabout encirclement strategy, dividing its troops from Zhongyang and Lishi and encircling them from north and south, attempting to occupy the various crossing points of Kuangkou, Jundu, and Sanjiao, and then cross the river to attack Shaanxi. However, after days of counterattacks and fierce attacks by our army, more than 1,000 × were annihilated, and its momentum was frustrated again. According to the speeches of Commander Wei Lihuang on the 3rd and Commander Yan Xishan on the 5th, it can be seen that the military, government, party, students, and the people in the Northwest are fighting together on the united front. At present, they are able to prevent the × army from attacking, and are also training millions of people and 300,000 iron troops, preparing to drive out the Japanese ×.

Overall, we have indeed gained a comprehensive advantage militarily. At present, the Japanese ×'s combat power has been brought to its peak, and all strongholds are threatened and attacked by us, trying to use our manpower and material resources to supplement themselves. Therefore, we must now intensify the battle behind the × army and carry out the conspiracy to oppose Wang ×, the traitor, "peacefully oppose communism and establish a new central government."

(6) Falling Currency Prices Strike the Traitors, National Law Strictly Arrests Wang Jingwei

Our country's highest authorities are now able to cope with the military situation freely, so they are focusing on training cadres, improving politics, and working hard to build the army and the country.

However, the conspiracy and poisonous schemes of the Japanese × and its running dogs in Jingwei are being intensified, and they are actively operating in politics, diplomacy, and economy. These activities are what we cannot ignore, and we must immediately launch a painful attack on them.

"The fall in the price of the legal tender" is like a bomb that fell on the speculative market. Although people's hearts were once disturbed, everyone now understands that this is not about the credibility of the legal tender itself, nor is it about our country's foreign exchange fund. What is being hit is the Japanese × and the traitor's "financial offensive," only those Chinese ×× who have lost their conscience and fled with funds, and only those fools of the nation who rely on national currency to supply their overseas indulgences. On the contrary, the legal tender itself remains stable, the credit of China and foreign countries remains, foreign exchange control and trade management are easier to implement, and the possibility of inland production事业 gaining double the development is greater!

Just when the legal tender depreciated and the Japanese × traitor Wang was spreading rumors, just when they were using this incident to slander the government's prestige, provoke the feelings of friendly countries, and shake the confidence of compatriots in the war of resistance, with a clap of thunder, our National Government finally issued a clear order to strictly arrest Wang Jingwei, the running dog of the Japanese ×, under the unanimous appeal of the soldiers on the front and compatriots at home and abroad! This clear order swept away the doubts of the people of the whole country about the government's attitude, this clear order consolidated the united front of the whole country's resistance against × and increased the strength of the battles on all fronts, this clear order made clearer the greatness of the Chinese people's power, the sincerity of the Chinese government and in democratic politics, and greatly increased the prestige of the Chinese nation in the world on the anti-aggression line!

However, the Japanese × traitor Wang faction and all the stubborn conservatives who facilitate the × people, all these countercurrents that hinder political and war progress, will still have more cruel and shameless performances in the future. We must, under the leadership of the government, intensify the struggle with them!

### The Current State of Higher Education in China (Continued)

Establishing New Schools

Although pre-war colleges and universities experienced stagnation or reorganization due to the impact of the war, the Ministry of Education continued to establish new schools during the Anti-Japanese War to meet the needs of the war effort. Details are as follows:

(1) National Guiyang Medical College: In the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Ministry of Education originally planned to establish the Wuchang Medical College. However, with the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, many existing medical, nursing, and midwifery schools were destroyed or suspended. At the same time, there was an urgent need for medical professionals to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Therefore, it was decided to establish the Guiyang Medical College in Guiyang to train specialized medical personnel.

(2) Teachers Colleges: Since the establishment of schools at the end of the Qing Dynasty, China had established junior and senior normal schools to train primary and secondary school teachers. After the founding of the Republic, the name "senior normal school" was changed to "higher normal school," which continued to be the place for training secondary school teachers. At that time, the academic atmosphere was pure and simple, and teachers were highly respected. Many graduates had the spirit of serving the cause of education for life. Since the reform of the school system in the 11th year of the Republic (1922), most higher normal schools have been upgraded to universities. As a result, except for the National Peking Normal University, there was no specialized institution for training secondary school teachers in the country. Secondary school teachers generally lacked professional training, and the education of secondary school students became a serious problem. In April of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the National Provisional Congress passed the "Outline of Implementation Plan for Education at All Levels During Wartime." Article 3 stipulated the necessity to cultivate teachers with morality, intelligence and physical education for secondary schools, and to urgently plan for the establishment of such institutions with reference to the previous higher normal school system. Based on actual needs, the Ministry of Education planned to establish teachers colleges in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), initially intending to coordinate the overall situation and establish them in different regions. However, due to the ongoing war, this could not be realized. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily establish one independent teachers college, and to transform the education colleges of National Central University and Northwest Associated University into teachers colleges. The education department of Southwest Associated University and the education department of Yunnan University were merged and reorganized into a teachers college, located within Southwest Associated University. The education departments of Zhejiang University and Sun Yat-sen University, along with their education research institutes, were expanded into teachers colleges to meet current needs. From then on, secondary school teachers would have a unified and well-established training institution. Excellent teachers would emerge in large numbers, and the teaching and training in secondary schools would inevitably improve day by day. This was truly an important measure in higher education during the Anti-Japanese War.

(3) National Central Vocational and Technical College and Various Specialized Courses: Developing the interior and building the rear area were the most important national policies during the Anti-Japanese War. The Ministry of Education specially established the National Vocational and Technical College in Sichuan, offering six departments: papermaking, agricultural product manufacturing, leather, dyeing and weaving, aquaculture, and sericulture. It also established specialized courses in telecommunications, automobiles, mining, machinery, chemical testing, agricultural economics, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, accounting, statistics, hygiene, engineering, and health administration, which were to be affiliated with various universities and colleges. All courses were designed to be completed in two years, in order to cultivate senior specialized technical personnel in various fields and meet the needs of developing the rear area.

(4) National Chongqing Merchant Marine College: Although China's shipbuilding and shipping industries were initiated at the end of the Qing Dynasty, they had not been able to develop much over the decades. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the only school in the country that trained professionals in this field was the Wusong Merchant Marine College. Unfortunately, it was suspended after the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai. With the expansion of China's river and sea navigation scope, it was impossible to ignore shipping education. Based on the recommendations of the Education Committee of the National Defense Supreme Council, the Ministry of Education specially established the National Chongqing Merchant Marine College, recruiting shipbuilding and navigation experts. On the one hand, it enrolled students and provided instruction to train specialized personnel. On the other hand, it conducted research and design to meet needs.

(5) National Veterinary College: The Gan-Qing area has lush pastures, which are most suitable for livestock raising. Developing the Northwest should promote livestock husbandry to increase production. Although many local residents are engaged in this, the livestock industry has not developed because too many animals die from disease, and there is no way to prevent or control it. The Ministry of Education is now formulating measures to establish the college as soon as possible.

(6) University Preparatory Courses: Since the start of the war, colleges and universities have moved to the interior one after another. Secondary schools have also been affected by the war and cannot maintain their classes as usual. Most young students have moved to different places and cannot concentrate on their studies. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), when the Ministry of Education organized unified national enrollment for all national colleges and universities, more than 11,000 students applied in various regions. Although more than 5,400 were admitted, their overall performance did not fully meet the standards. The performance of those who were not admitted was even worse. In order to remedy students' academic performance and improve the level of universities, the Ministry of Education took supplementary measures, ordering all colleges and universities to supervise and urge newly admitted students to receive remedial instruction. On the other hand, it established university preparatory classes to recruit high school graduates who aspired to study at the university level but had not been admitted, providing them with preparatory training for university education, so that they could take the entrance examinations for various universities and colleges in the 28th year of the Republic (1939). These preparatory classes have already been established by the Ministry in various parts of Sichuan Province. The student enrollment quota was set at 400, and enrollment and classes have begun in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Guiyang. In addition, Yunnan University and Northwest Associated University each enrolled 50 preparatory class students. The duration of study was from January to August of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Because there were still many out-of-school students in the Shaanxi area, Northwest Associated University was ordered to add one class, and Guangxi University was ordered to establish one affiliated class, in order to provide relief. In total, 12 preparatory classes were established, which could accommodate 600 out-of-school students.

(7) Other Vocational Schools: In addition, the vocational schools established by various provinces that have been approved by the Ministry of Education include the Jiangsu Provincial Bank Vocational School, the Fujian Provincial Medical Vocational School, the Jiangxi Provincial Veterinary Vocational School, and the Shaanxi Provincial Medical Vocational School. All of these are new measures to promote vocational education. (End)

### Financial Authorities Issue Statement: Policy of Maintaining Legal Tender Has Never Changed; Adjusting Market Prices Benefits Our Country's Economy

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] Regarding recent fluctuations in foreign exchange market prices, reporters inquired with the Ministry of Finance. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry, the following statements were made: (1) Maintaining legal tender is the established policy of our government. The methods used by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee to adjust foreign exchange market prices recently have neither changed the government's policy nor have they been taken without the approval of the government. (2) Due to seasonal import and export relationships, imports are currently increasing, especially the import of non-essential goods. Therefore, adjusting foreign exchange market prices to meet standards that are beneficial to our economy and maintain the balance of international payments will further consolidate the foreign exchange market situation. (3) The government's policy of maintaining the legal value of legal tender has remained consistent before and after the war. Since the management of foreign exchange began, public and private institutions with legitimate needs for foreign exchange, after approval by the Ministry of Finance, have been sold foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the legal value. This is a well-known fact. As for the difference between market prices and legal values, this phenomenon is not unique to our country after the management of foreign exchange. (4) The government has repeatedly ordered banks to maintain market stability in order to reduce market fluctuations, with good results. After the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, the institutions handling the matter are even more perfect in maintaining strength, which is particularly evident. (5) Recently, the government has made greater efforts to reduce the import of non-essential goods and has taken various measures to encourage exports, while also saving on the use of foreign exchange, in the hope of benefiting our country's economy and adapting to the needs of the war of resistance. The strength of the Stabilization Fund Management Committee is also sufficient to stabilize the market situation. We firmly believe that all parties' confidence in the legal tender will be further enhanced and will not be affected by current market fluctuations.

### Important Strongholds Are All in Our Hands; Fierce Fighting in Southwestern Shanxi Province

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 10th] Telegram from Yuanqu: The fighting in southwestern Shanxi is still fierce. As of the 9th, both sides were fiercely contesting the areas near Liulin, Qikou, and Sanjiao. All important strongholds are in our hands. The ratio of casualties is much higher for the enemy than for us, which can be called a great victory. The enemy, advancing on Pinglu, has been killed by us in the hundreds over the past three days. The enemy, attacking south of Jie County, was intercepted by us north of Monan Town, suffering heavy casualties. Although the enemy has been reinforcing and attacking continuously in various places, judging from their strength, their attempt will be difficult to achieve. One of our units attacked Yicheng at the beginning of the month, annihilating nearly a hundred enemies.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 10th] Telegram from Luoyang: Along the Pinghan Railway, the enemy is rushing to build fortifications day and night to defend against attacks by our guerrillas. However, our troops are lurking everywhere, continuously cutting off transportation.

[Yuanqu, Central News Agency, 10th] The enemy is continuing to attack eastward. On the 9th, 500 enemy troops occupied Panan Village (west of Maojin) and built fortifications, attempting to join up with enemy troops fleeing south from Zhangdian to attack Maojin Ferry. One of our units has met them head-on and is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. The two strongholds of Shengrenjian and Liyao Village, directly north of Maojin, are still in our hands. On the afternoon of the 9th, 200-300 enemy troops from Dachen Village once harassed us but were repelled. One of our units has moved to the rear of the enemy, in the area north and south of Guocun and Lv Village, to thoroughly wipe out the enemy. On the 10th, more than 1,300 enemy troops were surrounded and defeated by us at Buan Ferry, with many enemy troops killed and a large number of military supplies captured.

[Fancheng, Central News Agency, 10th] Due to our continuous attacks, the enemy in Qianjiang has mostly withdrawn from the city and is deploying defenses on the east bank of the Dongjing River. Civilian houses have been opened up by the enemy, and our civilians are not allowed to enter. A few enemy cavalry are active near Gangjiang from time to time.

[Foreign News from This Port] A Shanghai telegram reports that Jinan was suddenly placed under martial law yesterday (the 10th). Several hundred Japanese soldiers left the city to reinforce the suburbs, because it was reported beforehand that Chinese guerrillas had completely annihilated several Japanese troops about ten miles from the city and were advancing towards Jinan. It is reported that Japanese troops and guerrillas made contact last night.

### Battlefield on the Border of Henan and Hubei Provinces: On-the-Spot Inspection; A Magnificent Historical Trace Left in Remote Areas; Iron Cavalry Reports Arriving Amidst Ruins and Walls

[Fancheng, Central News Agency, 9th] After the defeat of the enemy on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces, a reporter immediately went to inspect the area. However, because the roads were completely destroyed and the civilian donkeys and horses had been seized by the enemy, the reporter traveled on foot, reaching the destination after two weeks. Wherever the enemy's iron cavalry went, the cities and villages were mostly burned. This was especially the case in Zaoyang and Lishan. The houses were reduced to rubble, which is not sufficient to describe the tragic situation.
Forty... two strong... can be heard everywhere. In almost every village, our strong men were bayoneted or shot by the enemy. All of this is sufficient proof of the enemy's brutality and the inviolability of our national spirit. The people of the border area of Henan and Hubei provinces enthusiastically assisted the army in combat this time. It is unnecessary to mention that the people brought their own food to destroy the roads and transport bullets. What is most touching is that the people took in the wounded soldiers. An old woman living alone in Nanguo, Xinye, whose arm was injured by enemy artillery, insisted on taking in the wounded soldiers. When asked, she said, "I live and eat in this village. The soldiers protect my homes and land. How can I not take them in?" Xu Buchen, the magistrate of Xinye County, personally led the self-defense team to resist when the enemy invaded, blocking the enemy's advance for two days, which eventually allowed our main force to arrive and annihilate most of the enemy. This point is also commendable. The general public was able to thoroughly implement the National Covenant. For example, the people of Xinye did not guide the enemy, nor did they seek food for the enemy, which became a widespread phenomenon. After entering, the enemy was like stepping into a field of thorns and could not extricate themselves. Order has been restored in the recovered counties. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Ministry of Military Affairs to allocate 10,000 yuan to relieve the affected compatriots in Zaoyang. Other counties have also distributed accumulated grain and implemented emergency relief measures, so the local situation is showing a good outlook.

### Defense of Chao-Shan Is Completed

[Chao'an, Central News Agency, 8th] A Central News Agency reporter, having traversed the damaged railway on foot, recently arrived in a certain place and transferred to Chaozhou for inspection. Along the way, the reporter witnessed women, children, the old and the weak being evacuated from Shantou, with soldiers and civilians assisting in the construction of fortifications in a busy manner. The atmosphere was full of wartime spirit. After arriving in Chaozhou, the reporter visited the military and political leaders. Based on the judgment of the enemy's situation and the anti-Japanese defense forces in Chaozhou and Shantou, the reporter inquired of Commander Xu, who expressed his determination to defend Chaozhou and Shantou with a firm tone. He said that the defense deployment had been completed, the military and political connections were very strong, and the enemy air force's movements in the Linghai area in recent days were a test of their attempts to invade, and they were on high alert. If the enemy comes, they will be met head-on. He also said that the political and military sectors have established a unified command mechanism with interconnectedness, and that he is working hard to make politics catch up with military affairs, which is gradually becoming effective. Regarding the Chaozhou and Shantou teams, he is determined to thoroughly reorganize them in terms of quality and quantity, and will deploy coastal strongholds step by step to ensure that the enemy who lands will eventually be trapped in the mud and be painfully annihilated.

### Wang Ni Met in Shanghai, Left Quietly Before the End of the Meeting; San Francisco Overseas Chinese Groups Telegraph to Request Punishment for Wang

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shanghai] According to reliable sources, Wang Ni arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month. On the third day after arriving in Shanghai, he secretly invited six of his confidants for a half-hour conversation. However, before the conversation ended, Wang suddenly left his seat and entered the back hall. The six confidants sat upright and waited. After more than a quarter of an hour, a male servant came out from the back hall and notified the six that Wang had left the place and asked them to inform everyone that they would make an appointment again on another day. As for the location where the six met, it is said to be in a certain building on the Shanghai section of the extraterritorial road in the southern part of Suzhou River, and there was no slightest security there.

Short Commentary

### Roosevelt's Eloquence Is Unmatched

Amidst the raging flames of war, the leaders of Britain and the United States met hand in hand. When President Roosevelt raised his glass to bless the King of England, he specifically said the following words:

"The negotiations between Britain and the United States regarding the ownership of the two islands in the Pacific have resulted in an agreement to use them jointly, which has been successfully resolved. We hope that this understanding between Britain and the United States will become closer and closer, and that the friendship between the two countries will become more and more cordial."

Roosevelt is truly a wonderful person in the international political world. He did not say it too early or too late, but used these words in the middle of this grand meeting between the British and American leaders, which is really worth noting. Because it not only hits the nail on the head regarding the close cooperation between Britain and the United States, but also correctly points out the focus of future international issues.

We sincerely hope that Britain and the United States will obtain further cooperation in Pacific issues. We also hope that the general public will pay more attention to the future of the Pacific. China since the Anti-Japanese War has become an important player in the Pacific. We must intensify the struggle for liberation, and we must be the cornerstone of a stable and truly peaceful order in the Pacific!

### Young Men of Nanyue Enlist Enthusiastically; Farmers of Daxing County Bravely Kill the Enemy

[Nanyue, Central News Agency, 9th] The local customs of this town are said to be simple and unsophisticated. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, enlistment has been quite enthusiastic. Among them, there is a man named Dongchu from Guangdong. His two sons, the elder son Wanxiong, is 25 years old. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred the year before last, he stopped the wedding and enlisted in the army first. He was assigned to the XX Division and is still fighting bloody battles on the front lines. The younger son Yun, who is 16 years old this year and graduated from elementary school, was motivated by patriotic thoughts and went directly to the town office to enlist, and was transferred to the county government and assigned to the military, waiting to depart. Their father, Dongchu, and mother, Wen, were extremely excited that both of their sons could serve the country, and they took care of family affairs themselves. There are also three daughters in the family, two of whom are young, and the eldest daughter, who is 22 years old, seeing her brothers joining the army one after another, also decided to go to the front line to take on rescue work. The other day, neighbors and villagers gave them settling-in money and set off firecrackers to send them off. Kuang Jun believed that it was his duty to serve the country and firmly declined to accept the gifts. The spirit of loyalty and righteousness is concentrated in one family, which truly adds a lot of color to the famous mountain. Now, people from all walks of life in the town are jointly petitioning the government to give them a special commendation to inspire and motivate others.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 9th] Telegram from Tianjin: Because the guerrillas in various counties are active, the enemy recently issued an order ordering farmers to cut down all unripe wheat. As a result, farmers in various counties united to resist. Another telegram: The farmers in Daxing County, Hebei, attacked the county seat and killed the head of the puppet county government and the assistant officials sent by the enemy.

### The Enemy Declares Blockade of British and French Concessions in Tianjin; Enemy Consul Asks Various Parties for "Understanding"; British Overseas Chinese Association Convenes Emergency Meeting

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] News from Tokyo: The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin. However, before implementing the blockade, the Japanese will issue a statement explaining that Japan has to blockade for self-defense, regardless of any difficulties. The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have also issued instructions to all Japanese overseas Chinese, asking everyone to work closely with the Japanese authorities to ensure the success of the new plan. The blockade order will be implemented around the 14th or 15th of this month. At that time, all those entering the Chinese or Japanese concessions from the British and French concessions will be inspected, and overseas Chinese and foreigners will be treated equally. The reason why the blockade order must be delayed until that time is that the goods of Japanese shipping companies and Osaka Shosen Company must be completely moved by the 14th.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] News from Tianjin: Because Japan will soon begin free action against the British concession, the Japanese consulate in Tianjin is now asking the consulates of France, the United States, Germany, and Italy for understanding, and the French consul has telegraphed his country about the seriousness of the situation in Tianjin.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] External News from Tianjin: The British Overseas Chinese Association is scheduled to hold a general membership meeting tonight to discuss the issues raised by the Japanese. The Japanese are demanding that four Chinese people related to the Cheng Xigeng case be handed over. Otherwise, the Japanese will take retaliatory action. According to Reuters, quoting authoritative Japanese sources, the so-called retaliatory action by the Japanese will probably take the form of special treatment, such as the roads connecting the British concession to the outside world will be completely closed to traffic, and the activities of British overseas Chinese and the movement of British merchants' goods will be restricted, with only the import of food being unaffected. If this move is implemented, all residents in the concession will inevitably feel serious inconvenience. As for the French concession, due to historical traditions, it is feared that it will also inevitably suffer the same restrictions as the British concession.

### British Ambassador Visits Japanese Foreign Minister

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The Ambassador to Tokyo, Craigie, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on Saturday morning and met for one hour. It is reported that the content of the conversation concerned the Japanese demand for the handover of terrorists in the Tianjin concession, as well as the British government's protest against the detention of British Embassy military attache Sipinlie by the Japanese army.

### Sipinlie Is Still Detained

[Haitong News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Lieutenant Cobo, an interpreter at the British Embassy in China, was released only on Saturday after going to Zhangjiakou to investigate the detention of military attache Sipinlie. However, Sipinlie has not yet regained his freedom and must wait for the Japanese side to review the matter.

### Britain Rejects Japanese Demands

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] The tense situation between Britain and Japan has not eased to date. The British government plans to submit a memorandum to Japan in the short term, rejecting Japan's demand to control the public concessions in China.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 10th] Two famous Chinese bankers in this area were arrested by the police of the Public Concession. This matter was instigated by the Japanese authorities, who strongly claimed that one of the bankers was a military officer and the other was the leader of the Shanghai guerrilla team. Both men work for the Chinese-owned Far East Bank, one as a manager and the other as a director. Both are currently detained by the Public Concession police station, awaiting the Japanese to present evidence.

### Central Government Allocates Ten Million to Develop Production; Designated for Use in Eight Provinces Including Guangxi

[Continental News Agency, Guilin Aviation News] In order to strengthen the long-term war of resistance, the National Government is working hard to develop the production business in the interior. It recently decided to allocate 10 million yuan for the development of production business in Guangxi, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Jiangxi provinces. The plans promoted by the Farmers Bank in promoting agricultural production have achieved remarkable results, and agricultural cooperatives have been established in all provinces. The industrial cooperation movement led by the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association is also being promoted rapidly in all provinces. The Bank of China has decided to lend 6 million yuan to the Gansu Provincial Government for the development of handicrafts production cooperatives and general commerce in Gansu Province. After the establishment of the Industrial Cooperative Association, more than 200 cooperatives have been established in the Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Sichuan-Kang areas, with more than 1.5 million yuan in funds loaned out. In addition to the 5 million yuan previously allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the association's foundation, it has now negotiated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate another 2.5 million yuan to meet the needs of continued development.

### Foreign Reporter's Report: The Current Situation in the Guerrilla Areas of North China (Part 1)

Our Guerrilla Strongholds are Scattered Like Stars, Growing and Growing, Leaving No Way to Deal With It

[Shanghai North-China Daily News, Beijing Correspondence] Many people in Chinese towns and cities whose real homes and families are in inland villages must now have lost contact with their families. This is because North China has been clearly divided into two regions, with absolutely no communication between them. On one side are the towns and cities occupied by the Japanese army and the small surrounding rural areas connected by narrow railways. On the other side is the vast inland area, mostly untouched by the invaders and still under Chinese control. Nowadays, the Japanese authorities are always displeased with those who want to go inland, and it is not easy to make the trip. This is because the two regions are separated by a "no man's land," continuously consisting of burned or destroyed villages, unrestrained by either side, with guerrilla forces lingering in between. Therefore, the situation in the inland areas is now very difficult to ascertain. We can only learn a little from the occasional missionaries living inland, or from the few Chinese intellectuals who manage to sneak back into the occupied areas.

Various Places in North China

The current situation in the areas of North China (northeast of the Yellow River) controlled by the Chinese and Japanese sides is summarized as follows: (1) Inner Mongolia: Mostly under Japanese control, but the Japanese have not planned for proper garrisoning. (2) Suiyuan: The railway and the cities and towns along the route, and the narrow strips of land, are all in the hands of the Japanese army. However, the countryside south of the railway line, and the vast area west of Baotou, the terminal station of the line, are still held by the Chinese army. (3) Chahar: The northern area outside the Great Wall and the narrow strip of land along the Pingzhang Railway are under Japanese control. (4) Shanxi: After three long and arduous attempts to expel the guerrillas, the central plateau, the western and southern parts of Taiyuan, and the narrow strip of land along the narrow-gauge Datong-Puzhou Railway to the Yellow River are now in the hands of the Japanese army. The rest of the province is still under Chinese control. (5) Hebei: The eastern part (i.e., what is called Eastern Hebei). The area between the Beining Railway and the Great Wall is still relatively peaceful (remember that before July 1937, this area was already in the hands of the Japanese army). In the central part, the Japanese army claims to have "suppressed" the guerrillas as far as halfway to the Yellow River. (6) Shandong: The area connecting the two railways, and the area north of the Yellow River, is still relatively peaceful. However, the mountainous areas and straits in the central part of the province are still in the hands of the Chinese army. Even in the areas along the railway where Japanese troops are stationed, the situation is often unstable.

Along the Railway Lines

Many important railway lines are far from being tranquil, and the railway lines that penetrate into the interior can only be used for military purposes. The Pinghan Line has been repeatedly attacked and destroyed, as has the Pingsui Line between Zhangjiakou and Suiyuan. The damage to the Pingsui Line is so severe that trains have not been running for several weeks. The Datong coal mine on the Pingsui Line in northern Shanxi has been damaged in recent weeks and cannot operate, as is the Liji coal mine in the western mountains not far from Beijing. There have been frequent reports of train damage, resulting in a shortage of trains, which are even insufficient to cope with the greatly reduced passenger and freight traffic in these areas. It is no wonder that the Japanese have been unable to carry out economic development after occupying North China for nearly two years. (To be continued)

### The Gold Rush at Wangjiang Tower

— Yufei

[Chengdu Airmail] Sichuan is the ancient Shu Kingdom. Protected by mountains and rivers, it has always been ruled by feudal forces. Therefore, historical sites and strange tales are more numerous than in other provinces. However, the only thing related to the current war of resistance is the "gold rush" on the Jinjiang River outside the east gate of Chengdu.

The famous historical site outside the east gate of the city is "Wangjiang Tower." Wangjiang Tower is the former residence of the Tang Dynasty courtesan Xue Tao, with historical sites such as "Pipa Gate Alley," "Xue Tao Well," and "Floating Cup Pond." All year round, tourists fill the road, so the Chengdu Municipal Government has opened it as a suburban park. In recent months, someone suddenly said that there was a great treasure of silver buried here, and a company had been organized to excavate it, causing a sensation among the people of Sichuan and spreading news throughout the country. Those who cared rushed to inquire. The reporter has been to the site several times, but because the matter was too vague and no discoveries had been made for several months, the reporter has been waiting for the matter to develop. Now that more and more people are concerned, I will make a general report.

Zhang Xianzhong's hatred of using Sichuan people is a rare event in history, ancient and modern. When he held military power, he massacred three-quarters of the people of Sichuan. Later, when he was defeated by Yang Zhanhua, he buried all the gold and silver of Sichuan in the Jinjiang River. When Ding Wen-cheng was governor of Sichuan, someone tried to excavate, but the site was in Jiangkou, Pengshan, and nothing was found. When the War of Resistance had been going on for a year and a half, and the whole country was enthusiastically donating money and conducting charity sales, an old man named Yang from Shuangliu was willing to use his intelligence to serve the country under total mobilization. He said that the place where Zhang Xianzhong hid the silver was on the Jinjiang River near Wangjiang Tower. At first, people thought he was crazy. Old man Yang sighed that no one could recognize the "Jade of Bian He." Driven by patriotism, old man Yang told people everywhere, hoping to realize the gold rush and supplement the economy of the War of Resistance. The matter was known to Ma Shiweikunshan, a former Sichuan army officer, who gathered comrades and organized the "Jinjiang Gold Dredging Company," requesting the Executive Yuan to be in charge of the gold mining project. The Executive Yuan approved it and appointed Ma as a special commissioner to be responsible for handling it. Thus, there is now the news of the gold rush that has caused a sensation throughout the country.

According to old man Yang, his ancestors were subordinates of Zhang Xianzhong and participated in the silver burying work, but were killed by Zhang. When his ancestors died, they left a will saying that the gold was buried in a certain place and could be passed down from generation to generation. Old man Yang's grandfather was in the Qing Dynasty government and had checked the files and found no clues. Yang spent more than twenty years collecting facts and is now over seventy years old. He said that if the excavation is unsuccessful, he is willing to gouge out his eyes and die for it. His firm belief is evident.

According to the "Shu Bi" record, when Zhang Xianzhong entered Sichuan, he forbade people from hiding silver privately. Those who did not obey the order to hand it over would be killed. Later, when Zhang Xianzhong arrived in Chengdu, the people, upon hearing the order, abandoned the silver they had hidden at home in the streets at night. Zhang ordered people to collect it and bury it near the city, and then killed all the silver buriers to prevent others from knowing. Therefore, we know that there were many silver buriers, but no one knew where they were buried. According to old man Yang, the amount was 76 million taels. At 1.4 yuan per tael of legal tender, that is 106.4 million yuan of legal tender. According to the 50% reserve ratio, 212.8 million yuan of legal tender can be issued. In today's war of resistance, the amount is quite considerable.

Jinjiang Gold Dredging Co., Ltd. is a private organization. 80% of the gold mined is donated to the country, and the rest is retained for excavation wages. According to the person in charge of the company, on February 27th of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the provincial government approved the appointment of Ma Shizushan Yang Bailu as a special commissioner for gold dredging, ordering him to start work immediately and submit an engineering plan for record. On March 1st, Special Commissioner Yang and others gathered the company's colleagues to plan the start of work. First, a board of directors was established, with Yang Bailu, Ma Kunshan, Wu Yihou, Luo Zunan, Zhang Xiehua, Xin Shufeng, Fan Kongjia, Li Chongshu, and Wen Chao as directors. Later, Yang Bailu and Ma Kunshan were elected as chairmen, and then the board of directors elected Ma Kunshan as general manager. An engineering office was set up in the first park in the suburbs, and 96 workers were recruited. The method of dredging began in the middle of the river near Wangjiang Tower. Ten zhang long and one zhang wide, this is the first step in the experiment. After five days, about ten zhang were dug, and the water intrusion was very large. Four earth method dragon bone carts were used for drainage work. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th, another hundred workers were added to dig down. When it reached a depth of one zhang and eight feet, it was purely gravel, with no abnormalities. At the same time, the water intrusion became greater, and the four dragon bone carts were not enough to solve the problem. The chairman of the board of directors saw that the project was stalled and was very anxious, and feared that the spring floods would start, abandoning his previous efforts before reaching his goal. A gasoline water suction machine was set up. On the 12th, it was dug in from the right side of the sand pile. At a depth of four feet from the water surface, countless dry bones and four human-shaped bones were found. Each was separated by a foot or so, proving that they were not washed down by the river. According to archaeologists, they were dry bones from within one or two hundred years, and the public believed that they were gold-burying engineering people killed by Zhang Xianzhong. Another layer of blood-soaked sand and gravel was dug down, about five or six feet thick, with a fairly wide area. After research by many experts, this kind of sand and gravel was indeed soaked in human blood, as evidenced by Ren Shou Chen Shaoxiang's "Juan Bi Jin" record, "After Zhang Xianzhong was defeated by Yang Zhan in Jiangkou, he decided to go to northern Sichuan, casting the gold and silver ingots and Yao treasures obtained from the Shu government, and using the law to move the Jinjiang River, drying up its flow, digging holes several ren deep, and filling them with wood and stones to cover them. All the chiselers were killed on top of them." Also, Shen Xunwei's "Shu Nan Xu Lue" says, "He gathered more than a thousand people to transport the gold and silver to the river bank, which took three months. Like building a river break, a small drought was created, and a large hole was made at the bottom of the river, into which gold and silver were thrown, and the transporters were killed on top of them, and then covered with soil, and the river flow was restored to its old course." According to the above two statements, it is sufficient to prove that the blood-soaked sand and gravel layer is the blood of the chiselers and transporters killed by the bandit Xianzhong. The company's colleagues, based on the above two signs, believed that there must be stone bars under the blood-stained sand and gravel layer. On the afternoon of the 13th, several red stone bars were dug up under the blood-stained sand and gravel layer and the decayed human bones layer, about two feet deep, arranged horizontally across the river. The joints between the front, back, left, and right were all covered with tung oil and lime. After washing with water, the word "Zhang" was engraved on one stone. Digging along the stone, stone bars appeared one after another, arranged along the shore, quite like artificial buildings. After four days, a total of ninety-two stone bars were excavated, many of which had engraved characters, such as "Tian" (Heaven), "Si" (Office), "Shang" (Up), "Xia" (Down), "Liang" (Two), etc., the meaning of which is unknown. The words "Dong Zheng" (East Zheng) were dug up on the east side, and the word "Bei" (North) was dug up on the north side. However, the words "Xi" (West) and "Nan" (South) have not yet been dug up. Based on this, the public believes that Zhang Xianzhong's hidden silver originally had boundaries. There is a character "(一)" (one), the meaning of which is unknown to the public. Some older scholars say that "(一)" may be Zhang Xianzhong's killing symbol on the Seven Kill Stele? According to "Shu Gui Jian," "Bandit Xian gathered the students, each with a silver yuan ingot on their head, entering from the west and exiting from the east, killing one student and taking one silver ingot. Answering, 'Are you selling your head?' The one who kills you is still me. Bandit Xian slaughtered the people of Sichuan, playing as if they were little kids." Is "(一)" this circle a silver ingot, and the circle in the middle is a killing knife? The so-called killing symbol is understood here. On the 18th and 21st, stone bars were taken one after another. About two feet below the stone bars, a layer of tung oil, lime, and sand and gravel was found. After the three-combination layer was removed, countless decayed black woods were found. At 11 p.m. on April 8th, a white light suddenly appeared around the project, resembling moonlight, which lasted for about ten minutes before disappearing. Supervisor Xie Guangqian was surprised when he first saw it and woke up the driver Li Zhongyi. They looked at each other in surprise. Four water car workers also saw the white light. The public thought that there was no moon in the sky, so where did the moonlight come from? The light was a large ring shape, with no light outside the ring. Knowing that it was a strange thing, they asked archaeologists. According to them, "A fine gold contains treasure light, which sometimes burns outward; where there is a silver cellar, there must be a white light of the same color." Before the light appeared, a sound of riverbank collapse was heard at the digging site. The water car workers were frightened. When they looked at it with a light, there was nothing. When they dug two zhang deeper, the water color was yellow and black, with a strange smell similar to that of a rotten corpse. A stone ox was found on the right corner, lying down, its head facing northeast. The ox weighed several thousand catties, and its sleeping shape was not knocked over by the water. The public suspected it had a function. According to a Sichuan proverb, "Stone ox faces stone drum, silver is 150,000 taels; if someone can break it, they can buy the entire Chengdu mansion." Does it refer to this? The public was delighted and dug in the direction pointed by the ox's head. A stone was indeed obtained; it was different from the others, half round and half square, with the stone's surface convex on the left and right and concave in the middle. There was only this one stone there. There were no other stones. The public believes that Zhang Xianzhong's thinking was bizarre and strange, or he had other intentions? On May 2nd, more than seventy stone bars were dug out behind the stone ox. There are still characters and the "(一)" symbol. Under the stone bars, countless rotten woods are laid flat, and under the woods are many "Da Shun Yi Xiao Qian" coins cast by bandit Xian.

The gold mining project is now here. According to the person in charge, we will continue to work hard to excavate in the future, and have hired radio expert Xu Weili to rush to make a gold detecting instrument. After the test, a bell-like sensation was felt below. Xu said that there were indeed metal objects buried below. But whether it is silver? And how much is it? And how deep is the block buried? It is still not very certain? The company also hired Zhang Zhonghua and Jin Xiang, two metallographers, to study and manufacture instruments to detect. It is said that since the start of mining, more than 10,000 yuan in wages have been spent. However, the people of the company are still working hard with a spirit of perseverance and determination, and will definitely dig out the gold to strengthen the economy of the Anti-Japanese War. This is the first report of the gold rush at Wangjiang Tower.

### Ambiguous Attitudes of Britain and France - European Situation Presents Chaos Again - Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Unlikely to Progress in Short Term - France Still Expresses Optimism

[Reuters, London, 9th] Reuters diplomatic correspondent understands that today's British Cabinet meeting discussed the reply to the recent Soviet note. The British Ambassador to France, Sir Eric Phipps, and the Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, Sir William Strang, were present. It is understood that Strang will not be able to depart before the 12th of this month, as he must first examine a large number of documents before he can leave. Also, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Seeds, has recently suffered from influenza and must wait until he recovers before negotiations can proceed.

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] The French Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet, gave a lengthy foreign policy report to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee today, giving a detailed account of the progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. Although he acknowledged that some difficulties had arisen in the negotiations, he expressed confidence that these difficulties were not a major obstacle to the future of the negotiations and believed that the future was optimistic and that the negotiations could eventually be completed.

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech in Birmingham yesterday that we are still prepared to hold meetings to discuss the demands of Germany and any other country, but this is subject to one condition, that we must be confident that the negotiations will result in a satisfactory solution and will not resort to force. This has also been made clear by Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House of Lords. He also mentioned that Britain will hold a general election, but the exact date has not yet been determined.

[Central News Agency, Plymouth, 10th] Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech in Birmingham yesterday that Britain had become a militarily powerful country almost overnight, and that in a few days, Britain would have 550,000 armed people.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The speeches of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax inviting Germany and Italy not to expand their armaments and to jointly participate in a meeting to discuss their demands for colonial raw material distribution have been supported by the French government in a tacit manner. Foreign Minister Bonnet said in the Senate yesterday that France is determined to make the encirclement of the status quo faction around the dictators even tighter than before, because the French government firmly believes that the tripartite agreement and the mutual security treaty are the most effective tools for European peace.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] The House of Commons held a debate on the budget of the Ministry of Commerce today, and discussed the commercial relations between Britain and the Eastern European countries and the Balkan countries. The British-German commercial relations were also discussed. The Minister of Commerce, Stanley, gave a lengthy report. He said that the negotiations between German industrialists and the British Industrial Federation were held shortly before Germany annexed Bohemia and Moravia and have now been suspended. If negotiations are to be reopened, both sides must restore mutual confidence, as this is necessary to resume negotiations. Finally, Stanley called on the British people to develop commerce in accordance with the principle of "business as usual" and not to think that an inevitable war is about to break out.

[Reuters, London, 9th] The newspapers here attach great importance to the speech made by Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House of Lords. The Times said that if the spirit of the speech is echoed by Germany, the relationship will be very important. If Germany still responds with ridicule and abuse, then Britain's attitude has also been fully expressed in this speech. If Germany can understand Britain's intentions and ease its actions, then it is hoped that the differences and barriers between European countries will gradually disappear as a result. The News Chronicle expressed that the speech was feared to be misunderstood as a sign of weakness in British policy and a return to the policy of appeasement. If foreign countries misunderstand this, then Britain's position will be even more dangerous. The newspaper went on to discuss Germany's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia, saying that ending such acts of annexation is a prerequisite for negotiations. While foreign countries have not accepted this proposition, Britain should continue to expand its military and form a peace front.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] The Daily Mail commented on Saturday and Sunday, praising the speeches of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, talking about foreign policy, saying that they are prepared to consult with Germany for understanding. The newspaper also advocated taking into account Germany's economic needs, saying that Germany's prosperity would benefit the whole world, and supported the reform of the administrative system of the Suez Canal, because Italy's rights should be equal to those of the Netherlands.

[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] Political and newspaper circles here express extreme distrust of the speeches made by British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Prime Minister Chamberlain on Thursday of this week, saying that these speeches were issued because of the twists and turns in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. German political circles declared, "If Britain is willing to recognize Germany's position in the world, then the most obvious expression of this is to return Germany's old colonies, as these colonies were taken from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles."

### Turkey is Active in the Anti-Aggression Camp - Franco-Turkish Declaration Could be Issued Next Week - Anglo-Turkish Military Negotiations are Actively Underway

[Haitong News Agency, Turkish Capital, 9th] According to well-informed sources here, the Franco-Turkish negotiations have actually reached the final stage. The Turkish Foreign Minister met with the French Ambassador to Turkey on Thursday and talked for a long time. It is believed that the content of the discussion was about the Franco-Turkish joint declaration to be issued next week. Political circles here believe that its content will be of the same nature as the Anglo-Turkish declaration of May 12, stipulating that the two countries will provide mutual assistance in the event of a Mediterranean war.

[Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 9th] The British military inspection mission to Turkey is expected to arrive here in the middle of next week, including representatives of the navy, air force, and army. The military attache of the British Embassy in Turkish Capital, who previously accompanied the Turkish military inspection mission to the UK, will also return to Turkish Capital to participate in the Anglo-Turkish military negotiations.

[Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 10th] According to yesterday's Turkish newspapers, the United Kingdom has recently loaned another 15 million pounds to the Turkish government for the purchase of military equipment. According to the terms of the loan, if British merchants cannot supply certain munitions, merchants from Belgium and the Netherlands should be asked to supply them.

### League of Nations Opium Conference - Envoy Hu Shih-tse Vehemently Condemns Japanese Atrocities - Yugoslavia Shamelessly Aids the Evildoer - Committee Members from Various Countries Strongly Criticize

[Reuters, Geneva, 9th] At today's meeting of the League of Nations Opium Committee, the Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, strongly requested that the report to be submitted by the committee to the League of Nations General Assembly must include the situation of Japan forcibly poisoning the population in the occupied areas of China. Mr. Hu said that Japan was deliberately seeking to poison the people of the occupied areas in order to increase tax revenue and reduce the Chinese people's resistance to war. Foreign neutral observers have fully confirmed this point. The Yugoslav representative, Jelić, strongly opposed this, but most of the committee members believed that it was inconvenient to refuse Mr. Hu's request. Several members spoke up, strongly criticizing Mr. Jelić's attitude.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 9th] The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee has been discussing drug trafficking in the Far East for three weeks and is nearing completion. It entrusted the Yugoslav representative, Jelić, to draft a report, but he insisted on refusing to include in the report the points made by the Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, accusing Japan of poisoning China for political purposes. The Chinese representative therefore protested. The Advisory Committee discussed the matter today for two hours and finally decided, with the approval of most of the national representatives, to comply with the Chinese representative's request and use the accusations against Japan as material for the report. inform Bonnet that the French Foreign Minister's speech focused on the Franco-Polish agreement, saying that the conclusion of the agreement was a natural move, and mentioned Britain's participation in the agreement, saying that he was very pleased that Britain had concluded a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, as this was the greatest assistance to France and Poland.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] The Daily Express said that Britain will hold a general election in November of this year, but although the government has this determination, everything still depends on the development of the European situation.

### French Morocco - Restricts Japanese Goods - Must Have French Consulate Certification Before Import

[Central News Agency, French Morocco, 9th] The authorities issued an order today stipulating that from the 20th of this month, all goods shipped from Japan must be accompanied by a special certificate signed by the Commercial Counselor of the French Embassy in Japan or the French Consul, and must still be countersigned by the Japanese authorities before they can be allowed to be imported. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has strictly managed foreign exchange, and France's trade with Japan has changed from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. The French government has therefore implemented a consular visa system to remedy this.

Imprisoned in Soviet Union for 18 Months - Sees the Light of Day Today

[Reuters, Moscow, 9th] The case of the American woman, Mrs. Rubens, who was arrested by the Soviet authorities in December 1937 for entering the Soviet Union illegally, was heard today. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, but the period of detention can be used to offset the period of imprisonment, so she can be released today. The Chief Justice, Vyshinsky, asked the defendant if she had anything to say. Mrs. Rubens replied, "I have nothing else to say, but I want to know how my husband is doing." The judge said that he would be informed later. The trial of the case lasted less than an hour, without formal procedures or the summoning of notaries. Mrs. Rubens, dressed fashionably, sat alone in the front row of the courtroom, smoking a Soviet cigarette.

### Brown Shirt Chief of Staff Flies to Danzig, Nazis Welcome Him Frantically, Goebbels to Deliver Speech

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 10th] Yesterday, the Chief of Staff of the Nazi Brown Shirts, Lutze, flew to this city. Among those welcoming him at the airport were Danzig Senate President Greiser and Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster. After disembarking, Lutze reviewed the police honor guard, the Danzig Brown Shirts, and a delegation of workers. Last night, they gathered at Langer Markt Square for a large parade featuring 6,000 Brown Shirts from East Prussia and 2,000 from Danzig. Because the Prussian Brown Shirts had to pass through the Polish border by train to reach Danzig, some traveled by ship, while others switched to automobiles. Furthermore, because the bridge over the Vistula River required crossing the Polish border, they preferred to hire small ferries and detour. It is reported that Lutze will return to his country on Sunday after listening to a political speech by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels.

Assassination of German Police Officer, Terror in Czech Capital

[Haitong News Agency, Prague, 10th] Local officials announced yesterday that after the German police officer Niestrath was shot and killed in Krnov, District Administrator Neuwirth immediately ordered the implementation of a state of emergency on Thursday. The emergency decree remains in effect and will be enforced more strictly because the murderer of the German police officer has not yet been apprehended. Krnov is under curfew from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM, prohibiting pedestrian traffic, and anyone who knows the whereabouts of the murderer but does not report it to the authorities will be subject to the death penalty.

Such suggestions must be fully considered by the British government's military advisors, as well as the governments of India and Burma.

### British King and Queen Visit New York Yesterday, Tour the World's Fair, Return to Hyde Park in the Evening

[Reuters, New York, 10th] This city is currently eagerly awaiting the arrival of the British King and Queen. The British King and Queen will disembark in Raritan, New Jersey, and then travel by car to Cockroft's Point, before boarding a destroyer to New York, which is only ten miles from the Port of New York. The King and his entourage will drive to Flushing fifteen minutes after arriving in New York to visit the World's Fair. The King and Queen will have lunch at the Fair and visit the Canadian, Irish, and British pavilions in the afternoon. They are scheduled to go to Manhattan at 4:15 PM (local time) to visit Columbia University, and then drive back to President and Mrs. Roosevelt's Hyde Park residence for dinner.

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 10th] On Friday night, the British King and Queen hosted a banquet for President Roosevelt at the British Embassy, with 35 guests. The First Lady, the Vice President, Secretary of State Hull and his wife, Canadian Prime Minister King, and several senators attended. After the banquet, the King and Queen left the embassy for the station to board a special train to Riverside. President Roosevelt also drove to Hyde Park for the weekend to host the King and Queen.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Today, the British King and Queen went to the US Capitol to visit members of Congress. When they ascended the steps, the cheers were deafening. In front of the Capitol, 3,500 seats were arranged for the wives of members of Congress and other female guests. The King and Queen met and shook hands with senators and representatives in the Capitol rotunda, but did not have time to visit the chambers of both houses. As the King and Queen left the Capitol, they were escorted down the stairs by several members of Congress. The King and Queen then boarded a car and drove to the Navy Yard, where they boarded the Presidential yacht and went with President Roosevelt to visit Mount Vernon. Later, Senator Pittman said that the King had expressed to Congress his gratitude for the sincerity of the American people, saying, "I am privately grateful for the universal affection shown to me, and it is difficult to express in words." Mrs. Roosevelt, at her press conference, praised the Queen as "a young queen with a loving heart who can empathize with the suffering of the people." President Roosevelt also told the press that he had an informal discussion of international issues with the King, but that the matters discussed were not of particular importance. President Roosevelt called the King and Queen "amiable and sincere." The situation at the British Embassy this morning was different from the restrictions on participants at yesterday's garden party. Any British people, regardless of race or religion, could enter to pay their respects. Black people from the West Indies also gathered on the lawn to welcome the King and Queen. The King also reviewed veterans there.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] The King and Queen are staying at the White House, and soldiers are patrolling the perimeter. This is the first time since the American Civil War that the White House has been guarded by soldiers. The King and Queen slept soundly last night and woke up refreshed this morning. On their way to the British Embassy, they happened to meet eighty-four women from the press in the White House, who had gathered to attend a women's press conference convened by Mrs. Roosevelt. The weather today is still hot, and the temperature continues to rise. Thunderstorms are predicted.

### International Labor's Aid-China Movement

— Ge Baoquan

For twenty-three months, the heroic resistance of the Chinese people has shown the world that we are fighting for our own national independence and freedom, against the fascist forces of East Asia, and for the peace of the entire world. Therefore, from the very beginning of our sacred and just war of resistance, we have received assistance from peace-loving people around the world. They have not only extended a hand of sympathy to us, but have also provided us with various kinds of help, both spiritual and material.

During this period, many international organizations, such as the League of Nations, the League of Nations Association, and the International Anti-Aggression League, have been doing their best to mobilize people in various countries to actively support China. The International Anti-Aggression League has convened several conferences to call on all countries to boycott Japanese goods. In July of last year, it also held an International Anti-Bombing Conference to oppose fascist bombing of undefended cities in East Asia and Western Europe, and the killing of innocent peace-loving people. In addition, even the Second International and the International Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution in early spring of last year to help the Chinese people resist aggression and sanction the violent acts of aggression by Japan. The International Labor Conference also passed a resolution in June of last year to continue to help the Chinese people. In individual countries, the United Kingdom has the China Aid Movement Committee, and the United States, France, and Belgium have "Friends of China" organizations. They publish various China aid magazines and publications, organize various China aid activities and demonstrations, and donate money and medicine to help China's war of resistance.

Currently, the scope of the international China aid movement is not only widespread in Europe and the United States, but also in South America, South Africa, Australia, the West Indies, India, and Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in the Malay Peninsula. Among them, the working class of various countries is the most active in participating in the China aid movement. This fact proves that "the working class is the most advanced class, the greatest force in modern society," and "the most determined and thorough advocate and organizer of peace."

The international labor aid-China movement is mostly manifested in refusing to load and unload goods for Japanese ships and boycotting Japanese goods. This also shows that workers in various countries have realized that transporting one more ton of scrap iron to Japan and selling more Japanese goods is helping Japanese fascists kill more Chinese brothers. Therefore, in the United States, there is a warning slogan: "Buying a pair of silk stockings is like sending bullets for four rows of machine guns to Japan!"

We can cite many examples of international labor aid-China here.

As early as January of last year, the National Railway Workers Union of the United States held a conference in Bristol and resolved to boycott Japanese goods and refuse to transport all wartime industrial raw materials to Japan. In the same month, dockworkers in Middlesbrough decided not to ship pig iron to Japan, and even sacrificed several days of unemployment benefits because of refusing to transport steel. This is even more worthy of our respect. Similar situations have occurred in London, Liverpool, Bristol, and Southampton. In June, miners in South Wales unanimously resolved to implement a boycott movement. At the end of last year, Manchester, one of the major industrial cities in the United Kingdom, held a large-scale anti-Japanese movement. In addition, China aid marches and demonstrations in various cities are also often heard.

French workers have not lagged behind the British. When dockworkers in Middlesbrough, England, refused to load steel for Japanese ships, dockworkers in Marseille, France, immediately responded and decided to refuse to transport any goods used for Japanese warfare. During the "May Day" celebration last year, more than 60,000 workers in Paris held a large demonstration in the suburbs of Paris. In addition to paying tribute to China, they also advocated that French workers should actively boycott Japanese goods to help China.

Looking at the situation in the United States. In February of last year, more than 500,000 miners in the United States unanimously boycotted Japanese goods and opposed fascist aggression. Due to the organization of various China aid groups, many marches and demonstrations, "frugal eating campaigns," "one bowl of rice campaigns," and donations have been held in various cities in the United States. Tens of millions of workers saved a portion of their meager wages to help the Chinese people. Longshoremen at various seaports also refused to transport steel to Japan. For example, in December of last year, a large number of workers in San Francisco refused to load scrap iron for Japan, and more than 2,000 longshoremen responded immediately. Subsequently, workers in Long Beach, California, and Astoria, Oregon, also refused to transport scrap iron to Japan. The American Federation of Labor also passed a resolution at its annual meeting in Houston, Texas, in mid-October of last year to continue the boycott of Japanese goods movement that had already begun in the United States.

These many situations are also reflected in other countries and regions. Countries such as Argentina in South America have implemented a boycott of Japanese goods. The South African Workers' Union in Cape Town, South Africa, also resolved to unanimously boycott Japanese goods. India has held several "China Days," with a large number of workers participating. In addition, the Indian National Congress sent a medical team to China to serve. In the iron mines opened by Japanese in Kuala Lumpur in the Malay Peninsula, Chinese and Indian workers jointly went on strike and refused to work for the Japanese. These many situations are too numerous to mention.

Among these many examples of labor aid to China, one thing worth mentioning here is the assistance of Australian workers to us. Workers in ports such as Melbourne and Sydney in Australia have repeatedly refused to load pig iron and scrap iron for Japanese ships. In November and December of last year, dockworkers in the port of Canberra, Australia, unanimously refused to load scrap iron for Japan. 3,500 workers from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in the port's steel factory were dismissed by the factory before Christmas for supporting these dockworkers' China aid actions. Since this incident occurred, people from all over Australia have come forward to help these 3,000+ soldiers who lost their jobs for justice. The trade unionists in New South Wales were even more vigorous, convening a conference and broadcasting by radio to support the dockworkers' actions. However, the local postmaster-general forcibly suppressed them and closed down the trade union's radio station. But this unreasonable suppression not only failed to have an effect, but instead aroused a great wave of anger. First, it was the protest of 58 trade unions in Australia. At the same time, due to the opposition of people from all walks of life, several governors, bishops, and archdioceses, the order to close the radio station was finally revoked, and workers in various ports in Australia more actively expanded the China aid movement and the embargo on scrap iron to Japan. From then on, it also proved the greatness of the power of labor.

We especially appeal to the working masses of all countries to let them know that the Chinese people's war of resistance is to fight for their own national independence, but also for the peace of the world, and for the peace-loving mankind of the whole world. China is a link in the world, and the victory of the Chinese people is the victory of all the people in the world, first of all, the workers of all countries. We hope that the workers of the world will extend a hand of sympathy to us, and fight together for the justice and peace of the world, and for the reduction of fascist savagery in East Asia and Western Europe!

### Local Authorities Have No Intention of Devaluing the Hong Kong Dollar

Financial Secretary Gimson Announces, Various Outside Speculations Are Not Credible

Recently, the exchange rate of Chinese currency has fluctuated slightly, with the price of each Hong Kong dollar being approximately equal to two Chinese yuan. Some nervous people in society, unaware that this situation is merely a temporary abnormality that will return to normal in the short term, believe that if this continues, Hong Kong's exports to China will be hit. They have thus made reckless speculations, saying that the price of Hong Kong silver dollars will inevitably be devalued to adapt to the needs of the environment. As a result, rumors have spread, and many people in society believe that these speculations are well-founded. Financial Secretary Gimson issued a special notice yesterday to clarify that the authorities have no intention of devaluing the Hong Kong dollar. For the sake of correcting the views of the public, we hereby translate the original text as follows: "In order to dispel any doubts arising from the recent dynamics of Chinese foreign exchange, I am instructed to declare that the Hong Kong government has no intention of devaluing the Hong Kong dollar or changing the policy adopted since the establishment of the Hong Kong foreign exchange fund in 1936."

### Hong Kong Students to Present Sword to Generalissimo Chiang, Student Relief Society Holds Third Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday

Appeals to the World Student Union Congress to Relieve Students in War Zones of China

The Hong Kong Student Relief Society held its third executive committee meeting yesterday from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. More than 30 executive committee members attended, chaired by Li Zhengyao. Before the meeting, Advisor Wang Shutao was invited to speak about the news he received in Chongqing regarding the great victory in northern Hubei. The secretary read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were signed by the chairman. Reports on work were given on: 1. Organizing a bathing event at Clear Water Bay; 2. The Girls' Student Group is scheduled to be established at 1:00 PM on the 18th; 3. The Propaganda Department is holding a translation competition for the whole of Hong Kong; 4.

Participating in the reception for the Kuala Lumpur Service Corps of 70+ people; 9. Report on this year's financial budget. After the reports on various tasks were completed, the Chairman reported on the World Student Union Congress, stating that the Society had received a letter from the Paris Student Union of France stating that the World Student Union would convene its third congress from August 14 to 19 to discuss issues focusing on "democratic countries," with the participation of 40 countries. The number of representatives was set at 50 for large countries, 30 for small countries, and 10 or 5 or fewer for each region. Whether Hong Kong should send representatives to attend is the most important proposal today. Another matter is that the Philippine Youth Congress recently planned to convene the Far East Youth Congress and sent representatives to Hong Kong to discuss it. The motivation for convening this Far East Youth Congress is due to Japan's recent active efforts to win over Philippine youth and implement deceptive measures to mislead the public. Therefore, Philippine youth are actively uniting to deal with this Japanese conspiracy. This issue will be discussed at the Far East Youth Congress. Members of the Congress will include the Philippines, China, India, Siam, Annam, and other countries. The Philippine Youth Congress has now sent representative Mr. Liu Ziwang to Hong Kong to discuss with the Society. The Society has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow night to receive Mr. Liu.

Hong Kong Proposals

After the Chairman completed his report, the agenda items were discussed. 1. World Student Union Congress issues. A. Issue of sending representatives to attend. The chairman provided his opinion, stating that the congress is of great significance, but the cost is a problem, and asked everyone to express their opinions. After much discussion, the majority opinion was to not send representatives to participate, but to achieve the Hong Kong students' wishes for the congress through other means. It was resolved and passed. B. Hong Kong student proposals. It was resolved that the Society should send a circular to all student groups and schools in Hong Kong to solicit proposals, and organize a committee to collect and organize them before submitting them to the congress for discussion and decision. The committee members expressed their opinions on the spot, which were summarized as follows: 1. Collect reports on the activities of students in China since the War of Resistance and report them to the congress; 2. Request the congress to establish a world student communication network; 3. Demand that the congress provide practical assistance to China's educational and cultural undertakings; 4. Request the congress to step up relief to students in China's war zones and establish a "Relief China Student Committee" to handle relief work on a regular basis. The above opinions will be included in the proposals. 2. Retain the two administrative advisors who resigned. Resolved and passed. 3. Omitted.

Presenting a Sword to the Leader

4. Discuss summer work issues. A. Xia Jiehua proposed to organize a "Hong Kong Students Presenting a Sword to Generalissimo Chiang and Comforting Frontline Soldiers Group" during the summer vacation. This work has the following significance: 1. Presenting a sword to Generalissimo Chiang and comforting frontline soldiers expresses the Hong Kong students' sincere support for the supreme leader and pays tribute to the loyal and brave soldiers; 2. It shows the overseas Chinese youth's loyalty to the country and their struggle for the liberation of the people; 3. Therefore, it promotes close ties between Hong Kong students and the mainland and strengthens the unity of Hong Kong students. It was originally resolved and passed, and the specific methods will be determined by the Standing Committee. B. Develop the work of various groups; C. Visit the countryside and serve the countryside; D. Serve refugees and educate refugees; E. Work in rural areas. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Concerning Public Morals: Moralists Urgently Call For a Ban on Tour Guides, Will Jointly Petition Chinese Representatives to Convey to the Authorities the Elimination of Lewd Customs

Some years ago, the Hong Kong authorities, in order to improve the "moral values" of the residents, implemented a ban on prostitution. After the ban, most of the former prostitutes who remained in Tong Sai changed their profession to singers, and their lives were very difficult. At that time, it was said that Hong Kong was a pure and flawless city. Who would have known that after the promulgation of the ban on prostitution, private prostitution flourished, poisoning society even more severely than during the period of public prostitution? However, most self-respecting people are unwilling to get involved in "private brothels," because private prostitution is an abnormal phenomenon not permitted by law. Contact with such people is tantamount to breaking the law. Therefore, the harm of private prostitution to society is limited to only a part of the population. Those who value their own integrity may not even know where private brothels are located or where private prostitutes congregate. In recent years, the tour guide business has risen on the island. At first, the number of tour guide companies was only a few, and the number of female tour guides was also small. Their business scope was still considered prudent. Later, more and more companies were established, and competition became increasingly fierce. Now, the number of tour guide companies is in the hundreds, and the number of female tour guides is over a thousand. They all try their best to promote themselves and attract customers. As a result, the business of singers and private prostitutes is far behind. This is because they are not restricted by law. Singers and private prostitutes are even in danger of being eliminated. Public prostitution has already been banned, and private prostitution is not permitted by law. Only the tour guide business is not subject to prohibition. In a place governed by law that does not allow the existence of prostitution, it grows insidiously without any scruples. People who like to boast about "dating" often accompany female tour guides, swaggering through the streets and appearing in public places without feeling strange. If they were with singers or private prostitutes, they would never be so blatant and disregard criticism. All of these things are of great importance to social morality. As for the addresses of tour guide companies, the names of female tour guides, and their beautiful faces, we have heard and seen them in detail and are familiar with them. Social figures who pay a little attention to the situation in Hong Kong are deeply impressed by tour guide companies and female tour guides. From this, it can be asserted that the tour guide business has penetrated deeply into people's hearts, and the resulting negative impact is to be expected. Now that the tour guide business has become a universal and special business, if we conduct further research on this business, the concept of a "pure and flawless city" will definitely be shattered. The authorities previously banned prostitution in order to improve the moral values of the residents. Now, Hong Kong has discovered a phenomenon of leading people into lewdness and leading people into depravity, the harm of which is thousands of times greater than that of public and private prostitution. For the sake of Hong Kong's reputation, the authorities should immediately plan a way to eliminate this kind of harm. If it is said that banning prostitution can improve the moral standards of the residents, even the most foolish person knows that this is impossible. It is heard that concerned people among the overseas Chinese have gathered comrades to jointly petition Chinese representatives to convey to the authorities a request for a prompt ban, so that the decadent atmosphere can be eliminated. The petition is being drafted and will be submitted to the Chinese representatives soon.

### Lingnan University Entrance Exam: Horticulture Scholarship Students

Zheng of Chaoyang, Guangdong, in order to cultivate horticultural talents to serve their hometown, specially donated the Zheng Yuquan Memorial Horticulture Scholarship at Lingnan University. The quota is set at two to three students, and the scholarship for each student is originally set at 300 to 500 national currency yuan per year. However, when the school is holding classes in Hong Kong, the scholarship will be paid in Hong Kong dollars according to the original amount. Anyone who is from the Chaoshan region, can speak the Chaoshan dialect, has pure character, is physically healthy, and is from a poor family in need of financial assistance, and who wishes to enter the Department of Plant Production of the Agricultural College of Lingnan University, paying special attention to horticultural subjects, can apply for this scholarship. The school's first autumn enrollment has now begun.

### Underwater Water Pipe Connection: Water Rationing in Hong Kong for Two Days

The total amount of water stored in Hong Kong and Kowloon in May is 200 million gallons more than last year.

The Water Authority, in order to increase the supply of drinking water from the Kowloon Reservoir to Hong Kong Island, modified the underwater water pipe last autumn to transport water to Hong Kong. Since the construction and installation of the new water pipe, which has taken many months, the section of the project in the sea near Queen's Pier has been completed, and it can be connected to the main pipe under Queen's Pier today. For the convenience of the connection project, the Water Authority announced that water will be temporarily rationed in Hong Kong Island starting today, and the water supply will be limited to ten hours per day for two consecutive days. From 9:00 PM today to 4:00 PM next Tuesday, the water supply time will be from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM. It will return to a full day of water supply until 4:00 PM next Tuesday. As for Kowloon, it will continue to supply water all day as usual and will not be affected.

In addition, the Water Authority issued a report for May yesterday, stating that the total water storage in Hong Kong's reservoirs is 2,362,550,000 gallons, while in May last year it was 1,553,370,000 gallons. The average daily water consumption per person is 27.9 gallons, while in the same period last year it was 34 gallons. The current water storage in Kowloon's reservoirs is 2,901,550,000 gallons, while in the same period last year it was 1,615,09,000 gallons. The average daily water consumption per person in May this year is 21.1 gallons, while in the same period last year it was 26.8 gallons.

### Hong Kong Government Civil Servants: Holiday Salary Exchange Rate Set at One Dollar for One Shilling and Three Pence

The Hong Kong government personnel who draw salaries during the holidays have always used the average of the monthly bank announced exchange rate as the standard. According to yesterday's Hong Kong Government Gazette, this method will be cancelled, and at the same time, the exchange rate is set at one dollar for one shilling and three pence. In other words, each pound sterling is exchanged for sixteen Hong Kong dollars. The Gazette also published an amendment to the 1937 Gold Pound Salary Exchange Regulations. The above method is also one end of the amendment to the regulations. "In accordance with Section 3 of the 1937 Regulations, the payment of salaries shall be based on the rate of one shilling and three pence in exchange for one Hong Kong dollar, and one pound sterling in exchange for sixteen Hong Kong dollars." The annex to the regulations stipulates that there is a "treasury rate." If civil servants take leave or are on regular holidays for more than three months, they can be paid according to the average of the monthly bank announced exchange rate. This example remains valid until June 1, 1939, after which the annex will be cancelled. The one shilling and three pence exchange rate specified in the amended regulations will be implemented for an indefinite period. Civil servants who take leave or are on regular holidays after June 1 must draw salaries in accordance with this new regulation.

### How Can There Be a Woman Crying in a Military Camp?

A woman, Yao Xiuying (32 years old), from Shanghai, was accused at Magistrate Fu's court of the Central Magistracy yesterday morning of trespassing into the Marlborough Barracks. According to the barracks police officer Bishi Da, he said to the magistrate, "At 2:30 AM yesterday morning, I suddenly heard the sound of a woman crying and shouting wildly. I followed the sound to investigate and saw the defendant naked and not wearing anything. Later, the defendant led me to the front of the barracks detention center, where I saw the defendant's clothes hanging on the window." The magistrate asked the defendant why she entered the barracks. According to the defendant's confession, she has sisters working in the homes of Westerners on the Peak. Last night, she wanted to find her sisters. She is from Shanghai and has been in Hong Kong for a short time, so she does not know the way and accidentally entered the restricted area. Unexpectedly, two Westerners in uniform dragged her to a place and then took off her upper and lower clothes. The magistrate believes that the truth of the defendant's confession should be investigated, so the case was postponed to Monday morning for further hearing.

### Various Issues in Battlefield Drama

— Hu Xian

The great War of Resistance, from "July 7th" until today, has been almost two years. In this national revolutionary war, like workers in other sectors, advancing drama workers have fairly fulfilled their responsibilities. Tens of thousands of young soldiers rush about on the battlefield and in the villages, swinging axes, enduring cold and hunger, and steadfastly guarding their posts.  In reality, most of them had no connection with drama before the war. The reason they chose the drama position is very simple: drama is the best propaganda weapon! For two years, they have used this weapon to play a significant propaganda role and educate countless people. However, they have also encountered unspeakable suffering! (Overcoming difficulties, discarding the elements of failure, reaping the fruits of success, educating themselves, and growing!)

These young soldiers have been traveling to various battlefields for two years, and what the audience sees in the streets and alleys and on hillsides and lawns are almost entirely one-act plays. ('Living newspapers' are also included here. Multi-act plays are rare on the battlefield!) This is good! The era we are experiencing is an era unparalleled in history. We pay our highest respect to the young fighters who work hard on the front lines! We should understand the difficult environment they are in and should not make excessive demands! At the same time, I believe that the performance effect of a one-act play on the battlefield is unimaginable without personal experience. One-act plays easily give the audience a complete impression, easily capturing the extremely tense time and space. Therefore, it is also conducive to work outside of drama - organization after propaganda. (Pay attention to this. Performing drama on the front lines is not merely performing!) Subjectively, one-act plays are incredibly convenient for a theater troupe: set design, props, lighting, actors, and stage staff can all easily solve difficulties. Objectively, the audience does not have to spend a lot of time and has enough time to repeatedly reflect on the plot.

The biggest drawback of one-act plays is that there are too many long dark scenes, and they cannot dissect a story in detail for the audience like a multi-act play. However, I believe that this is only a matter of writing technique! (Of course, it is easier to handle a subject in a multi-act play than in a one-act play. But forcing some one-act play subjects into multi-act plays is also a waste!) If we fundamentally oppose performing one-act plays on the battlefield based on this, (and there are actually people who oppose it now!) I think it is unreasonable! The effects of countless one-act plays performed in the past two years, the touching stories, can only be told by the drama workers themselves. As for the audience regarding the treacherous officials in the play as loyal ministers, and regarding mothers who put righteousness before family as proof that "the most poisonous heart is a woman's," I believe that this is not a problem of one-act plays versus multi-act plays. This involves acting, makeup, language, and script issues. (The script issue is naturally more important.)

Scripts are indeed a major problem on the battlefield. Since the War of Resistance, how many satisfactory scripts have we produced? As far as I know, the ones performed most often on the battlefield are probably "Lay Down Your Whip" and "Seeking Survival from Death." It is still being performed now, no wonder Mr. Xia Yan has his feelings! However, the "script shortage" is a significant fact. Counting the published scripts, the number is indeed not small! However, workers on the battlefield do not dare to easily stage them, because they fear that they will have a counterproductive effect on the audience. Even without this concern, some scripts, even if the audience watches them a thousand times, are still vague. It seems that we cannot blame the audience for being "stupid". The playwrights should reflect on themselves, and it is not difficult to find their shortcomings. As Gorky said: "Dry, lifeless, without personality." Some scripts are formulaic, all the same. After watching the first half, the audience doesn't need to watch the second half. Can we completely attribute the opposite effect and the vague impression to the drama workers who are born and die on the front lines? Can we say that this is being prevented by "one-act plays"?

Gorky said in the same article: "We live in a profoundly dramatic era never before seen, we live in a tense, dramatic era in the process of discarding the old and creating the new. But only those who work constantly can understand such people." (On Drama) Therefore, to solve the "script shortage" problem, it is best to have people working on the front lines, but they often turn the expectation of "division of labor" into reality. Moreover, due to practical difficulties, it is put aside, which is a bad phenomenon. People living and working on the front lines should be determined to overcome this difficulty. Dependence has led to a sense of desolation today and will leave an unnecessary blank for the future. How will we settle this blood debt with history?

Along with the "script shortage" and other issues, another phenomenon has occurred on the front lines: excessive repetition and blanks. In some places, many groups are concentrated, while in other places, people are waiting to pioneer. This is one. Secondly, in places where groups are concentrated, the performed programs are often repeated countless times. The first point belongs to the issue of distribution, and the second point belongs to the issue of distribution and the "script shortage". The problem of the "script shortage" has already been discussed earlier. The distribution problem can be discussed from two aspects: the distribution of groups should be decided by the political departments of each war zone, and the performance programs should be discussed with the local government. This way, the effect of overall planning can be achieved.

There are two more serious problems in battlefield performance: insufficient actors and a lack of materials.

The number of pure drama groups working on the front lines is relatively small. General salvation groups combine propaganda, organization, and training. The weapons of propaganda include drama, singing, writing, painting, photographs, and even oral communication, using all possible ways to penetrate the masses and be accepted by them. The war zone area is too large, making it impossible and insufficient to specialize each group. Many groups, especially local groups, such as the Shangcheng Student Service Corps and the Wuchang County Teachers Wartime Service Corps, because they have to undertake various tasks in that region, the situation must be general, and naturally, they will not focus on performing. Since the number of people is limited, once a performance is put on, actors immediately feel that they are not enough to be distributed. In the past, the remedy was joint performances; but this is not the best way. Many groups should not be concentrated in one location, and in fact, there are not many times when they are concentrated, so joint performances can only be done occasionally. I think the most thorough way should be to clarify the individuality of the groups. General groups should be localized, and specialized groups should move frequently. But to do this, the first thing to do is overall planning. The responsible organization is the General Political Department and the political departments of each war zone. The scope of movement of specialized groups should preferably be based on war zones.

With the solution of this problem, the lack of materials will also be easier to solve. In the past, thousands of groups had to prepare their own props, costumes, lighting, ... for performances. Now that the performing groups are specialized, it is easier to organize. Of course, government funding is needed! Government funding will also not be as difficult as in the past.

As mentioned earlier, most of the thousands of drama workers working on the battlefield had no connection with drama before the war. Naturally, they will feel deficient in acting and drama in various aspects, and the most difficult thing is the lack of directors. In China, the history of the spoken drama movement is still very short. Now that the field has been expanded to such a wide extent, the lack of talent is immediately felt, not to mention that many "drama people" who were active for a while before the war ran to the rear and became disconnected from the War of Resistance? The lack of directors can be partially solved by specializing theater troupes, but new directors should be trained. Before starting training, small books on directing methods and acting training should be compiled as soon as possible, so that general salvation groups have a basis and use these suitable teaching materials to remedy the current shortcomings using collective directing methods.

As for the dialect problem, it is relatively minor. Local groups do not have this problem at all. If the mobile groups are based on war zones, it will not become a big problem. The language of performance is naturally best in Mandarin. However, in some places, such as South China, Mandarin is quite problematic, so dialects must be used. Dialects also have an advantage: they sound familiar to the audience. However, if there is no difficulty with Mandarin, it is better to use Mandarin. Carrying out national revolution is approached from many aspects. When the people are suffering great difficulties and unprecedented migrations and unprecedented integration, the unification of language is a good opportunity to accelerate.

Because I have worked on the battlefield for a period of time, today I am merely presenting the difficulties encountered by many groups in battlefield performances with my own views, hoping that experts will pay attention and find ways to improve and remedy them. The era is too great, and the great era is a furnace. Who can disconnect from the War of Resistance? History is the most ruthless. It will tell us who is declining and who is destroying himself! Strong workers will stand tall in the face of history. I pay my highest respect to them! June 9th, Hong Kong.

### The Inevitable Decline of the Star Actor System

— Shi Chao

The star system in film and the star actor system in drama are undoubtedly deformed fruits of capitalism, the offspring of an unhealthy transitional period in art. It is inevitable that one day it will sound its own death knell. Countless complex and intricate conclusions from history tell us that the existence of any system has a background of a certain era. When it exceeds the background of this era, it will be canceled and replaced by another new system by the corner of another era, just as the feudal system cancels the primitive commune system, the capitalist system cancels the feudal system; ... the same truth as the Three Principles of the People's Grand Harmony system cancels the aggressive fascist system. It is undoubtedly certain that the star system in the drama world will be canceled by the "no star actor" system.

In the process of the anti-fascist Three Principles of the People's revolution, what is reflected in the drama world is: the decline of groups of outdated and famous people, and the rise of countless unnamed folk artists. This proves that the "star actor system," a "child of capitalist society" supported by the capitalist system, has gradually reached beyond the limits of its era, like a shooting star falling off course and disappearing, and finally collapsed without a fight.

...The golden age of the star system and the harbinger of decline...

To fully understand the reason for the decline of any system, it is necessary to clearly understand its growth process. The birth of the star system in the drama world has its social characteristics. In a society where art products, and even artists, must become commodities under capitalism, the owners of theater troupes or theaters are forced to compete in order to exchange works as commodities to make a living. To win the market, they have to resort to competition. However, competition requires stronger technology and better goods, because they must have excellent goods to embark on the path of struggle. The owners of theaters or theater troupes have to choose more excellent actors from countless excellent actors. They also use various advanced propaganda techniques, or give more performance opportunities, to make him succeed as a part of the representatives, and use him to call on the large group of worshipers he attracts and mesmerizes - commodity buyers - to support the life of the drama workers and the life of the theater troupe. This is the factor that gave rise to the star system - even if this factor is not the main whole, it must be the main link in the whole.

Of course, the star system has its lovely golden age, especially when capitalism develops to its most prosperous. These precious days are still vigorously growing in theater troupes or theaters in capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, and France, floating in beautiful colorful clothes. However, inevitably, due to the increasingly sharp and profound internal contradictions of capitalist society and the increasing demands of art appreciators, it has gradually begun to be turbulent. For example, the famous star actor and movie star Li An Nuo Ba Li Mo in England, because he gradually lost the support of the audience, had to retreat to supporting roles, which is a very good proof.

...The impact of the star system on the drama movement...

At the same time, the star actor system has a great obstructive point to the drama movement, which needs to be pointed out. Usually, in order to create a star actor, a theater troupe unconditionally makes him perform many scripts and have him take on important roles. This situation will naturally stipulate a mechanical iron law of "the more popular, the more popular" and "the unpopular will never be popular." Even if later actors have some outstanding acting talent, they will stand by in vain and never have a chance to raise their heads, burying many useful talents, directly and indirectly causing great damage to the drama movement. What's more, due to the importance attached to star actors by the owners of theater troupes or theaters, they unconsciously raise their status to a high level, cultivating the actor's underlying arrogance and unwillingness to endure hardship - which is meaningless and even prevents the achievement of great art - sometimes, because the actor knows that his reputation and status (originally created by the theater troupe owner's painstaking efforts) already has the ability to exist independently, he raises his banner and goes far away, throwing himself into the arms of others, regardless of the mother nest. Even if it does not reach this extreme, in the rehearsals or rehearsals in the theater troupe, it often happens that the star actor who plays an important role is absent due to some improper reason, or does not arrive on time, which delays the rehearsal time or puts the rehearsal on hold. Although this is a trivial matter, it has a lot of damage to the collective life of the theater troupe and the seriousness of the drama movement.

What's even more annoying is that when the curtain is about to be drawn at the last moment before the official performance, time is running out mercilessly, and the star actor is still late, or arrives gracefully one minute before the opening, but cunningly proposes to pay before performing. (Amateurs also have other tricks) It is not difficult to see in the backstage that the stage manager or the theater troupe owner is sweating profusely under the pressure of the audience's applause urging the opening, and begging the star actor to kowtow and plead to put on makeup. As a result, it is only after paying full or half salary that the matter is successfully completed - of course, this is a good reward for the theater troupe owner's self-inflicted suffering - however, the drama workers' faith in the audience has gradually been destroyed.

...The poisoning of the star system to actors...

The reason why an artist becomes a great artist is not, as art-for-art's-sake advocates or inspirationists say, because of "genius." "Genius" - this is just a goblin that deceives people and leads them to depravity. Looking at the great artists of the past world, it can be said that there are absolutely few who succeed entirely by relying on genius. Even if there is genius, it is only a small part of the sum of hard work. In other words, their success depends more on hard work than on genius. For example, the success of the Soviet Art Theater director, the pioneer of the Soviet people, and the playwright Stanislavsky, is entirely due to his glorious hard work and his great determination to serve the art of the Soviet people, and it is not necessarily due to any genius.

However, star actors are often followers of the genius superstition. The reason is that they began to taste the life of drama, or by chance they were discovered by the theater troupe or theater owner - which is indeed not an easy thing - and they were recognized as having the hope of becoming the star that the theater troupe owner expected. He (the theater troupe owner) then inadvertently put the hat of "genius" on the actor's head. In this way, the actor, who was initially flattered and then arrogant, forgot all about the phrase "hard work and self-cultivation" and replaced it in his mind with a "no passage" signpost - "genius."

In fact, to succeed as a truly great actor, it is necessary to do at least what the famous Soviet director F. Kaweilin said: "...Actors must constantly improve their knowledge and cannot rely solely on what they have learned in drama school..." "Actors in leading positions in the theater must also be as enthusiastic about art as young beginners, and must make everyone unconsciously satisfied; get into the mire of complacency and self-satisfaction, even the highest skills and the greatest genius will inevitably have to shrink back." This point is true. However, star actors who superstitiously believe in genius often disregard it! The angel of famous saying will eventually defeat the demon of superstitious genius.

Secondly, what poisons star actors even more is "typical making." The biggest reason why the above-mentioned Li An Nuo Ba Li Mo can only play supporting roles now may be because his acting art has reached the realm of "typical." When an actor just plays the typical of a certain type of role, he has already announced the death penalty of his acting creation, and from then on he will gradually be forgotten by the audience. However, the operators of theater troupes will never forget the power that money gives them. In order to call on the audience and to support the life of the theater troupe, they need and use a typical actor with a highly confusing power like a god to compete. Therefore, star actors are unconditionally selected. Therefore, he (the star actor) is given various opportunities to start creating a typical of a certain type of role, and as soon as he succeeds, he will begin the sentence of death - due to the awakening of the believers or when he gradually feels that this god cannot give them more happiness.

...The inevitability and practice of overthrowing the star system...

Whether it is for the drama movement, the theater troupe, or the actors, it is poisonous. It goes without saying that it is necessary to overthrow the "star actor system." What is being correctly and bravely implemented now is socialist Soviet Russia. The actors in their theaters are all art-loving workers. Regardless of whether their artistic cultivation is deep or shallow, they all live an equal artistic life. There is no longer any distinction between "popular roles" and "star actors." As for movies, there is no star system either.

The final conclusion we have reached is: the star system will eventually die with the old society. In the process of the Three Principles of the People's revolutionary struggle, all stale systems are mercilessly eliminated. When the final victory comes, it will be the time when all the old dies and the new grows.

### The Performance of "Peace Under Heaven"

— Tang Xi

The revolutionary May is also the drama May. In mid-May, major theater troupes were busy performing, forming the biggest climax in the Hong Kong drama movement. June, which comes after the May drama climax, will be even more tense and deeply displayed.

The first major event marking the beginning of June's drama movement is the first public performance of the Red and White Theater Troupe. They performed a new type of satirical comedy, "Peace Under Heaven," with a new lineup.

Zhao Rulin made the following introduction in "Comedy of Resistance Against Japan is Growing": "Humor is an essential spice in the anti-Japanese drama. 'Peace Under Heaven' purely satirizes certain people in this place who are said to be living in a dream of death, living a life of diligently pursuing profit. This stimulus hopes to correct the general people's psychology of complacency and wrong worldview."

Indeed, the story of "Peace Under Heaven" is produced in a specific environment. Those who live in "Peace Under Heaven" are specific people. Therefore, the playwright gives these characters a variety of life descriptions, and consistently expresses them through the form of comedy.

The performance of "Peace Under Heaven" is a new attempt and a new stimulus. In terms of the script itself, it is a new type of work that breaks away from formulaic and photographic writing. In terms of style, it is pungent and full of profound and sharp alert performance.

The director's handling of this play has reached a certain appropriate degree. He did not allow the performance of the script to become a funny play or a farce. However, he does not seem to be able to fully apply the methods that should be used to handle a comedy. This is a slightly demanding point of mine.

The stage design is full of realistic style, rendering bright colors and natural angles. It's just that the setting of the distant view is not very presentable. The stage lighting maintains the appropriate brightness and light distance in the first and second acts. In the third act, the display of time is not very obvious.

As for the performance, Li Boming (played by Xu Guoyu) is a very important role. The performer has made great efforts to imitate his posture and expression, but the performance is still not delicate enough. Both the action and the demeanor seek to transform into a middle-aged person. The third concubine (played by Lulu) naturally reveals the character's personality, and the performance is stable. The fourth concubine (played by Tang De) gives the character extremely rich and true emotions. The internal reaction is also enough, but the hand movements lack a beautifying angle. A De (played by Hu Ruihua) gave a very delicate performance, but the display of the character's class is not enough. However, this is mostly due to the writing of the script. Jin Zizhang (played by Li Zhulun) is very capable of using his eyes and hands to help the performance of a greasy and sly merchant, but he lacks deep life experience. Li Mingyuan (played by Ling Ke) has a firm grasp of the character's personality, but the performance of the posture is a bit old, Li Mingzhu (played by Die Er) bites the words loud and powerful, and lacks delicate insertions. Li Mingying (played by Zhong Ying) and Mingda (played by Shi Bing) have enough strength, but no profound performance.

In the performance, we can directly and indirectly see that: the comrades of the Red and White Theater Troupe have made every effort they should subjectively under the constraints of extremely difficult material conditions to hold this huge performance, which is worthy of our respect.

### The Creation Process of the Battle of Taierzhuang

— Zhiwei

"The Battle of Taierzhuang" is an excellent script created through the collective understanding and highly skilled collective creation of the China Salvation Drama Troupe from the vivid and bloody reality of the War of Resistance. It has been performed several times in Guilin and Hong Kong, receiving unprecedented acclaim from the cultural circles. The author of this article, one of the four writers of the script, allows us to further understand the detailed process of how an excellent script is produced, and their serious attitude towards creation—the meticulous attitude towards historical facts. It also provides an opportunity to introduce this script to readers. This script has been published by Life Bookstore as one of the books of the China Salvation Drama Troupe. According to the editor, the first edition is about to be sold out in less than half a month, which further shows how excellent the content of this script is! ·Editor·

When we bid farewell to the Dabie Mountains and walked from Shangcheng to Songpi, we encountered unforgettable things on the way.

At that time, we had already passed a hundred and twenty li of the expedition, watching a wisp of remaining red fall behind this mountain, and nine crystalline stars were inlaid in the sky, it was already dusk. We stopped at a deserted small station, sitting in front of the thatched hut, listening to several warriors who had participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang narrating the story of the battle at that time with a slightly excited, rough, and boastful expression. What a group of lovely and valiant heroes returning in triumph! We wanted to see their faces under the sparse starlight, but the night was too dark. A round medal was proudly worn on their left lapels, emitting an unusual brilliance.

After arriving in Songpi, we met Mr. Li several times, who was slightly weathered and weary, but his grace and kindness made people feel a warm caress, and sincerely want to get close to him. Once, we were performing a play in the headquarters, and Mr. Li calmly mingled among hundreds of officers and soldiers, watching quietly, revealing boundless smiles, his expression serene. No one felt a little restraint. It is hard to believe that such a kind elder is actually a national pillar bearing the safety of the world. We silently thought that with such an admirable leader and such brave and good-fighting soldiers, the victory of Taierzhuang was inevitable, and the future of China was bright.

So we started thinking about performing Taierzhuang. Coincidentally, the fourth and sixth teams of the Political Department had both arrived in Songpi. After discussion, it was decided to have a joint performance, using the script "Taierzhuang" written by Mr. Xijin, Luo Feng, and others. At that time, we felt that although the story structure of this script was very tight, it lacked a realistic depiction of the Battle of Taierzhuang, which was a defect. However, due to time constraints, we only slightly modified the parts of the script that lacked drama.

But the two performances ended in a tragic way: ×× advanced into eastern Hubei, and the bloody battle was in full swing. × planes came to the war zone to reconnoiter every day. Although Songpi was a small town, it had become a major target due to military relations. On the morning of September 26th, after eight consecutive days of rain, the sky had just revealed a bit of clearness, and × planes had reconnoitered three times in a row, and even strafed at low altitude. The situation at that time was indeed extremely tense, and everyone knew that a major bombing was inevitable today. But because we had a serious task in front of us, everyone was still very calm in performing their duties. At about 2 p.m., more than sixty of us drama workers were gathered on the stage, busy with setting up when suddenly a heavy bomber sound, like thunder, swept over. Before we had time to move, twenty-seven heavy bombers rushed straight to our heads. We could not disperse for a while, so we had to lie down under the stage. In that moment, more than a hundred bombs rained down like dense rain, explosions erupted everywhere, houses collapsed and bridges broke, smoke filled the sky. The trees on the opposite bank, two or three thousand meters away from us, were immediately hit by bombs, their branches and leaves scattered, and the flying earth and debris fell on us. And the dense machine guns kept firing fiercely. The small town, under the threat of destruction, spewed out towering black smoke. After thirty minutes, × planes finally soared away. As a result, our comrade Xiao Ziying and comrade Pu Shaozhe of the fourth team were injured, while comrade Hui Xingzhi of the sixth team was sacrificed on the spot. When he died, he was holding a bunch of ropes tightly in his hand, which was used to hang the national flag in the play of Taierzhuang. To express our respect and mourning for Comrade Hui, we specially covered his remains with a national flag stained with blood, and wished him to rest in peace forever in the ground with the loyal souls of the martyrs.

At the end of September, we returned to Hankou and met Mr. Bai, who gave us many inspirations. His far-reaching and insightful views gave us a deeper understanding of the War of Resistance and our future work.

We arrived in Guilin in October and performed more than ten times. We are grateful for the care of the vast audience, who made more enthusiastic demands on us. At the same time, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xia from the provincial government, Mrs. Li, who presided over the Children's Welfare Institute, and Mr. Liu from the Guangxi Support Association also discussed with us, asking us to hold performances for raising money for winter clothing for the anti-× soldiers at the front and for the Children's Welfare Institute Fund. Under such a serious working significance and under such earnest urging and expectation, we did not hesitate to decide to perform Taierzhuang again.

So, the question was raised again: should we adopt the original script, or create a new one? After collective discussion, it was decided to write our own. The biggest reason was that we wanted to faithfully reflect Taierzhuang as a great historical theme. Of course, in order to make the plot lively and vivid, in the drama, we sometimes used a refined story to connect the beginning and end, but its role was also limited to this.

At that time, it was decided that Wang Ying, Jin Shan, Mu Zhizheng, and Liu Danqing would be the writers, but the time allotted was extremely short, because we were preparing to go abroad for propaganda at this time. In order to avoid conflicts between these two tasks, we had to shorten the writing time to within seven days. To write a five-act historical play in such a hasty time almost left us helpless!

But courage broke through all the difficulties, and we finally started writing. The initial division of labor was that Danqing constructed the story and wrote the first three acts, Jinshan and Wang Ying wrote the fourth and fifth acts, and Zhiwei and the entire team were responsible for the whole script. However, before the first draft was completed, we replaced it with a new creative method: the four writers sat together, and every story, every action, every line was written on paper after common thinking and deliberation. Although this felt wasteful and clumsy in terms of time, on the whole, it allowed the entire script to be more complete and refined.

In the process of creation, we encountered many difficulties: First of all, our academic ability and experience were not enough to melt many rich historical materials into art and condense them into perfect works of art. Whenever we felt such difficulty, we always held on to the basic attitude of preferring to sacrifice artistic value rather than damage the true meaning of history. Therefore, we did not exaggerate the story intentionally for the sake of drama, but rather put the story into the track of history. This considerably restricted the development of the plot, and at the same time, we also had to consider the number of people in our team to ensure that it would not affect our independent performance, so we had to make appropriate restrictions. In terms of material, because we did not have many books at hand, we could only refer to a small amount of material, but we also made a lot of painstaking searches. As for the need to adapt to the stage conditions, we sometimes made slight changes in certain places. If there are still places in the play that do not conform to the actual situation at the time, we sincerely hope to get instructions and understanding from all parties!

Regarding the characters in the play, it is necessary to add an explanation about the handling of the poet Tang Ke and the British journalist Simpson. Originally, poets are full of emotions, but sometimes they are often regarded as lacking enthusiasm due to their extraordinary sensitivity, and are misunderstood as a kind of romantic impulse. On this point, we hesitated a lot, and later decided to write it anyway, and the task we intended for the poet was to hope to convey the great victory of Taierzhuang to tens of thousands of viewers through his enthusiasm, and inspire greater strength for the War of Resistance. Whether we can achieve the ideal level depends entirely on the writing of the script and the degree of the actors' performance. The British journalist Simpson has consistently appeared with a sympathetic attitude. We believe that all impartial people in the international community will understand and help the great revolutionary war of our Republic of China with the most sublime and enthusiastic friendship!

After seven days of work, "The Battle of Taierzhuang" was completed as scheduled. At that time, because there was still a lot of other work to do during the day, we couldn't spare any time, so most of the writing was done in the middle of the night. The four of us buried our heads under a dim light, a gust of cool wind blew in from the window, and occasionally a wisp of thin voice trailing and stopping on the street to sell, as if we were once again experiencing the scene of the battlefield in the lonely wilderness.

After writing, we first made a review, which we regretted was that due to manpower reasons, many heroic stories of soldiers and civilians helping in the battle could not be realistically brought to the stage and were abandoned. We can only quote the heroic deeds of a few daredevil teams to simulate the general hard-fought soldiers. We are very sorry and uneasy about this. We would like to add a sentence here that the great victory of Taierzhuang was a hard-won achievement achieved by thousands of heroic soldiers cooperating with the extensive guerrilla warfare, under the leadership of wise officers, and promoting a strong spirit of attack. They are the most glorious descendants of the Chinese nation.

In addition, the lack of typical character, the lack of delicate writing, can only be regarded as a rough work. Fortunately, at a symposium we convened, we heard many valuable opinions from friends in the literary and art circles, which gave us the opportunity to revise it. Therefore, the second play has different places from the original in terms of characters and plot.

We are very grateful to Mr. Ai Qing, Lin Lin, Xia Yan, Yang Hu, Sun Shiyi, Sheng Cheng, and Zheng Yangu for providing many valuable opinions. Mr. Ni even gave written advice in his busy schedule. Mr. Rokuchi Dan and Ms. Midorikawa helped translate Japanese songs and Japanese military language. We would like to express our sincere gratitude here!

If our performance can somewhat praise the true meaning of the Battle of Taierzhuang, that would be our greatest honor.

### The Shenbao Cup Charity Basketball Tournament Opened Yesterday. Zhixing Fought Hard to Defeat Xinan. Zhonghua Defeated Huaxiong Greatly and Elegantly

(Special Report from This Newspaper) The female athletes in the basketball circle enthusiastically participated in the Shenbao Cup charity tournament this time, seeking orders in times of difficulty, with chivalrous hearts and tender feelings, worthy of praise.

This charity tournament officially opened the war last night in the gymnasium of the YMCA. The four female warriors are lively and actively performing a series of good plays, pleasing to the eye. The distinguished guests in the audience were delighted.

The first play was co-performed by the ladies of Zhixing and Xinan. Because everyone tried their best, there were many highlights, and there were very few dull moments.

The Zhixing team has Chen Rongtang, Li Baozhen, He Defang, Lin Shaoping, Sun Yuming, Gu Gong, etc., all of whom are veteran players, performing extraordinarily, with great momentum, good connections, and free and easy performance, making everything they touch successful. Therefore, from beginning to end, they occupied the upper hand.

However, the attack from Xinan was also strong, especially in spirit. Although their skills were not as good as others, their morale was consistent. Under the resistance, they gained something. Zhu Zongxian and Wu Ruixin had very high skills and were often able to take advantage of the opportunity. However, encountering the Zhixing guards, who were steady and solid, they had no way to reverse the situation.

First Battle

After the start, the Zhixing forwards immediately launched an attack. Before they knew it, Miss Rongtang had penetrated deep and scored under the basket. Then, Li Baozhen also hit two "peacock screens." At this point, Xinan began to return a little color by Wu Ruixin. After the first quarter, Zhixing took the lead with ten to four.

The battle restarted, and the stalemate was very fierce. The Xinan forwards were not easy to succeed under the interception of the opponent's guards, and it was also difficult for the Zhixing forward troops to score. Therefore, Zhixing only scored three goals in the second quarter, and Xinan scored two goals. The total score ended the first half with sixteen to eight.

The battle situation in the third quarter was also as stalemate as in the second quarter. You attacked, I killed, like a few flowers competing for beauty, which was very beautiful. At the end of this quarter, the record board showed twenty to eleven, with Zhixing taking the lead.

In the last quarter, Xinan did not gain anything except for Zhu Xuanzhi's two free throws. Zhixing was crowned by Chen Rongtang and Li Baozhen, adding five more points. As a result, Zhixing won with twenty-five to thirteen.

The best performer in the Zhixing team was Rongtang, whose passing and shooting showed great skill. Baozhen also tried her best, but her shooting skills were still lacking. Sun Yuming guarded the pass alone, with great prestige, and repeatedly transported the ball to the forwards, indirectly contributing a lot. Lin Shaoping, He Defang, etc. also performed steadily. In short, Zhixing's defense was better than its offense, and it was a steady and solid strong team.

The Xinan forwards were quite agile, and their shooting skills were good, but because they were blocked by the opponent's two guards, Yuming and Shaoping, they were unable to use them as they wished. Li Chanqing was the most competent in defense, and the rest were average.

Second Battle

The battle between Zhonghua and Huaxiong followed. Because of the strong and weak strengths, it turned into a one-sided situation after the start. Huaxiong had difficulty in progressing and it was not easy to defend. Seeing Liu Shouguang, Li Chunyu, etc., without having to deliberately create, they succeeded with a single wave. Therefore, the Huaxiong position was turned upside down. It was like a heavy rain rolling over peach blossoms and a light breeze passing over swallows. At the end of the first quarter, Zhonghua had already won with a big score of fourteen to two.

After that, it was still Zhonghua's world. Chunyu, Shouguang, etc., scored every time. It was most pitiful that Xiaoyu was very capable, but looking back at the Huaxiong forwards, they wanted to show off but couldn't, and had no chance with the basket. The team leader Lei Yuegui was so anxious that she frequently stole glimpses of her loose hair. At the end of the first half, with a score of five to twenty-two, Huaxiong had already shown signs of a big defeat--

After a short break, the battle started again. Zhonghua had the upper hand, so they didn't do too much. Rao Huizhen's rear army was transferred to the front army, and the performance was also successful. Huaxiong was in a slump, and the third quarter handed in a blank score. Only in the last quarter did Lei Yuegui score several baskets, creating a record of more than ten points, but it was still inevitable to be defeated. As a result, with a score of forty-seven to thirteen, Zhonghua sang a triumphant song.

In this battle, on the Huaxiong side, the only thing worth mentioning was that the thirteen points were all managed by Lei Yuegui alone, which was a miracle.

On the Zhonghua side, everyone had good skills, so they could control the overall situation. The front-line Shouguang and Chunyu cooperated very tacitly, passing to each other, writing articles with their hands, which was wonderful. The guards responded easily to the opponent's weak attack, with no leaks at all. Winning this big victory was the result of excellent technology. (Taishui of the Basketball Court)

### Small Soccer Charity Tournament Dongfang and Minda Both Won

……Wu Tiecheng Performs the Opening Ceremony

……Ms. Soong Ching-ling Presents Awards

The Hong Kong Chinese Women's Welfare Association specially invited the Dongfang Club, Small Football League, National University Team, and Lingnan University Alumni Team to hold two small football charity matches at Caroline Hill yesterday afternoon to raise funds for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees.

Because it was a charity event, all sectors enthusiastically attended the meeting. It is estimated that those who came to visit included He Xiangning, Wu Tiecheng, Hu Mulan, Liao Mengxing, Soong Ching Ling and many ladies, the situation was quite lively. It is a pity that the weather was not good, sometimes cloudy and sometimes raining, so it inevitably spoiled the scenery.

During the game, the players were inevitably bumpy and fell because the field was slippery, and there were many jokes.

In both competitions, Miss Hu Mulan and Liao Mengxing accompanied Wu Tiecheng to perform the opening ceremony. After the competition, Mrs. Soong Ching-ling presented awards as a souvenir.

In the first game, the Dongfang Club played against the Small Football League Team. The League Team took the lead, with Li Anna scoring a goal with the wonderful pass from Lu Dakeng. However, Hou Chengtuo quickly tied the score. In the second half, Dongfang's morale was even stronger, and Xu Jingcheng scored a long shot. Then Hou Chengtuo scored twice, and Dongfang won with a score of four to one at the end of the game. The two formations are as follows:

Dongfang

Liu Xianhan

Luo Weiquan Zeng Zhongyun

Wu Qixiang Xu Jingcheng Liu Shixu

League Team

Huang Jie

Ge Shida Chen Sijin

Qu Shi E Zheng Yingquan Zhang Songgen Li Dacai

Zhang Jinquan Lu Dakeng Li Shuoyou Li Anna Li Bingzhao Zhu Jincheng

In the second game, Minda played against Lingda. Minda had many famous generals, and its strength was exceptionally strong. During the battle, Minda launched an attack and repeatedly besieged Nanda. Huang Dingfen and Lu Guanyi were busy responding, so Li Shuoyou seized the opportunity to score a goal. In the second half, Nanda tried its best to counterattack, but Minda's defense was solid, so it did not succeed. Soon after, Minda launched a counterattack, and Yang Jianbang's wonderful shot hit the target, so it won with a score of two to zero. The players of the two teams are as follows:

Minda

Tan Jun'gan

### The 1944 World Games Will Be Held in London Next Year's Winter World Games Location Changed to Germany

[Reuters, London, 9th] The World Olympic Committee has decided to change the 1944 Olympic Winter Games, originally scheduled to be held in St. Moritz, Switzerland, to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The reason is that Switzerland recently refused to be responsible for hosting this year's ski show.

The Committee also decided to hold the 1944 Olympic Summer Games in London and the Winter Games in Cortina, Italy.

When the Committee held a meeting in London today, those competing with London to host the next World Games included Lausanne, Rome, and Detroit.

The Association also passed a special award to Ms. Leni Riefenstahl of Germany, because she was responsible for photographing the film of the last General Assembly, which made great contributions to promoting the spirit of sports of the General Assembly to the world.

Regarding the decision on the location of the next 1944 General Assembly, the Chairman of the Committee solemnly stated that the General Assembly's decision was made without any political effect or component, and was entirely for the purpose of sports interest and the Olympic Movement.

### After Reading the "Improvement Plan for Physical Education"

— Zou Lu

The method of training cadres, of course, requires the establishment of a detailed plan. It cannot be explained exhaustively in just a few words. However, we can outline the principles it must possess. Each county can compile statistics on the number of village chiefs and heads of security units in their respective counties. Each county can then independently organize and convene training sessions in phases. The training time should utilize agricultural off-seasons so as not to hinder farming activities. This should occur once a year, each time for one to two months. The training subjects should be simple and essential. Practical skills should primarily focus on traditional Chinese martial arts, gymnastics, running, and necessary military physical education. Academic subjects should emphasize essential knowledge necessary for exercise.

After the cadres are created, the responsibility of directly training the populace naturally falls upon the village chiefs and heads of security units. At the same time, each county must establish commissioners to supervise, distinguishing between the merits of the results, and applying rewards and punishments accordingly. Physical education teachers in local primary and secondary schools must provide compulsory assistance. Local individuals familiar with physical education and enthusiastic about service must be recruited to provide leadership. Through such continuous efforts, the promotion of social physical education may be successful.

Third, the cultivation and further education of physical education teachers must include the publication of central publications—The plan proposes establishing schools to cultivate genuine leading talents, setting up government-funded study abroad quotas to improve research and facilities efficiency, and requiring three years of service before short-term training, providing encouragement for high-level academic research and writing in physical education, and other measures that can be said to be well-considered. However, physical education is constantly changing, and the results of colleagues' research also yield new insights from time to time. If it must take three years to absorb new academic knowledge, or if colleagues' research findings lack opportunities for exchange, new academic knowledge and methods will inevitably be difficult to obtain and apply in a timely manner. Moreover, it is possible to discover difficult problems during the teaching process of physical education. If efforts cannot be made to find solutions and correct paths, there will be no way to truly seek them out. Isn't this greatly at odds with the original purpose of cultivation and the intention of improvement?

To remedy this shortcoming, the highest national physical education administrative organ should issue regular central publications for schools of all levels, large, medium, and small, as well as social physical education and physical education administration. All physical education service personnel affiliated with these organs must subscribe separately. Government physical education laws, new foreign physical education discoveries, new domestic physical education reforms, and new physical education insights from colleagues should all be published one by one. In particular, difficult problems encountered by colleagues can be questioned at any time, and the highest physical education organ is responsible for answering them. If they cannot be answered, they can be discussed publicly and decided quickly. In this way, not only can physical education teachers have the opportunity to continue their education at any time, but all improvement problems in physical education can also be resolved at any time.

The above three points, regarding the promotion of social physical education, may seem somewhat impossible on the surface. However, today the masses of our country have awakened and become organized. Innumerable things that were considered impossible by ordinary people can now be smoothly promoted. For example, national social military training and Guangxi's adult education are both excellent examples, and Guangxi's adult education is promoted by village chiefs and heads of security units. Therefore, if the government is determined, using the power of the government to promote education in the same way as promoting military training, I believe that our awakened masses will definitely be happy to accept it. The remaining two matters are even easier. It is hoped that those who hold the highest power in national physical education and those who are compiling the implementation plan for physical education in our country in the future will pay attention to it.

### Do Foreign Banks Accept Hua Xing Banknotes? The Japanese Side Has Made This Statement, But It Is Not Known Which Bank It Is. The Customs Side Has Not Yet Discussed the Issue of Counterfeit Currency.

The Zi Lin Daily reports that a Japanese spokesperson stated at a press conference yesterday that several foreign banks have accepted Hua Xing Bank banknotes, but he does not know which banks. The spokesperson mentioned American banks to a reporter and asked if these banks accept Hua Xing banknotes. The spokesperson also firmly refuted the claim of discounting and using Hua Xing currency. It is claimed that Hua Xing headquarters has used its banknotes to exchange for foreign currency, and Japanese banks have also used Hua Xing currency to exchange for legal tender. It is also said that no arrangements have been made with the customs to accept Hua Xing currency.

Two Types of Counterfeit Currency Are Divided by the River Boundary

The English Great American Evening Post reports that members of the investigation committee organized by the "Joint Reserve Bank" and the Liaison Department of the Japanese Asia Development Board are about to come to Shanghai to discuss cooperation between the "Joint Reserve" currency and the new "Hongkou" currency with the newly established Hua Xing Commercial Bank. According to the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, the puppet regimes in Peiping and Nanking have agreed in principle that the two currencies should be linked to each other at a fixed rate, but both currencies should maintain a fixed and not excessive circulation area. Japanese financial circles expect the circulation areas of the two counterfeit currencies to be divided along the Yellow River, with the "Joint Reserve" currency circulating north of the river and the "Hongkou" currency circulating south of the river.

### Accountant Chen Derong on War Losses

Listed as Deferred Assets With Considerable Basis

Accountant Chen Derong's article on war losses as deferred assets states that listing war losses as deferred assets seems to have a considerable basis in both accounting practice and theory. There are four main points: (1) Basis in accounting practice: According to the standard table of the Railway Accounting in our country, there is a item of Accumulated Deficit. Its nature is no different from war losses, both being virtual numbers in actual assets. (2) Basis in accounting principles: In Accountant Pan Xulun's book "Accounting," it is mentioned that although the nature of an expenditure is absolutely a loss for the enterprise, if it cannot be borne by the earnings of the current period, or if treating it as a loss for the current period is obviously unfair, it can be temporarily treated as a capital expenditure and listed in the balance sheet. Its meaning is simple and its principle is clear. The war losses seem to be similar to this situation. (3) The British Income Tax Law has similar provisions: According to the provisions of the British Income Tax Law, business losses can be deducted within the following six years, which other countries' tax laws have already implemented. (4) Approval from the ministry can serve as a basis: It has been found that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval from the Ministry of Finance can still be approved and amortized over ten years, and listed as deferred actual assets, which also seems to have a basis. Other details will be discussed in my article "Further Discussion on the Issue of Listing War Losses as Deferred Assets" in the June issue of the Selection and Anthology Monthly.

### China's Cotton Industry Since the Outbreak of War (Continued)

— Bo Ming

(Translated from Miller's Review):

Since the outbreak of war, 280 Chinese factories along the coast and along the Yangtze River, with a total capital of 40 million yuan, have moved to various cities in the southwest provinces. More than 50% of them belong to the textile industry. Its capital, labor force, output, and operating power previously accounted for one-third to two-thirds of the total number of factories in China.

Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese side has announced many attractive plans for developing the cotton industry in China, saying that huge amounts of Japanese funds are waiting to be invested in this industry. However, so far, none of these plans have been realized. Even the Qingdao Japanese yarn factory, which was destroyed in the war, is now being rebuilt at an extremely slow pace, and on a small scale. It is said that the Japanese side is not transporting new machines from Japan, but is transporting many machines from Chinese yarn factories in the occupied areas, especially British and American-made machines, to be installed in old Japanese yarn factories.

The Japanese side's ambitious plan to control the cotton industry in China has been around for a long time. Since the establishment of the first yarn factory in Shanghai by domestic and foreign societies in 1900, the Japanese have studied and understood the psychology of yarn, cotton cloth, and Chinese workers. Before the war, the Japanese had already installed or purchased about one-half of the total number of spindles in China.

China's imports of textile machinery and accessories are absolutely dominated by Japan. However, many of the imported Japanese textile machines are Lu spinning machines and weaving machines transported from Osaka. The huge commercial war booty obtained by the Japanese side in China is obvious. Its figures can also indicate the huge losses suffered by other countries in the past in China's important markets.

Since the Japanese side controls the manufacturing, transportation, and sales of cotton goods, as well as the import of textiles and textile machinery, it has also established a cotton production and sales control committee. Its purpose is obvious. The export of raw cotton from North China has now been placed under the licensing system of the "Peiping Provisional Government." Government "agency organizations" for purchasing cotton have been established in Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao. Last year, about two-thirds of the cotton available in North China was transported to Japan, and it will no longer be allowed to continue to transport North China cotton to Central China. The Japanese side levies miscellaneous taxes called "protection" taxes on the transportation of raw cotton in transit, in order to expand its complete control over the transportation of raw cotton. For example, the cost of transporting one dan of cotton from Tongzhou to Shanghai used to be about three yuan, but now the cost, including various taxes, is close to eighteen yuan. Its effect is conceivable.

### Ten

— Ye Chiqiang

Suddenly thinking of "ten", I seized it as a topic,

Writing about "ten," there probably wouldn't be anyone in the world with a brain as simple as yours!

However, I didn't consider this aspect; one horizontal and one vertical, although not a universal library, it cannot be denied that great principles are contained within, so I braced myself and imitated Confucius's cry: "Heaven! My Way is consistent with one principle!" - That's what I thought.

Chinese people have always liked this "ten," regarding "ten" as candy. Examples abound.

Mencius was, after all, a remarkable "eat-lecture-offering gentleman" of the Warring States period, who, going against the grain, proclaimed "Am I fond of arguing?" However, he also often pinned his words and deeds on this cross.

"— Digging a well to nine ren but not reaching the spring is like abandoning the well."

Probably adding one ren, making it ten ren, would prevent abandoning the well... heartfelt advice. Speaking of nine ren, it is already arduous and deeply worked, but leaving only one ren to teach people to persevere is a bit like "a cup of water to put out a cartload of firewood"! Therefore, I dislike the "ten" character, this terminating number, symbolizing all limits.

We certainly do not hope for "heinous crimes," but when counting crimes, according to Mr. Lu Xun's conclusion: "Generally, there are ten items," perhaps it is another "perfectly complete" plot!

The ancients often said, "What ten hands point at, what ten eyes see." According to ordinary observation, if humanity has not yet evolved to "three heads and six arms," then whether "ten hands" or "ten eyes" are no more than five people. A family of five has nothing to wear, nothing to eat, and even less to teach. Then, under the pointing and watching of these so-called "ten eyes and ten hands," isn't it creating a source of overflowing sin? And in between glances, perhaps it is the driving force of revolution.

Therefore, the ancients often found traces of emptiness in this "ten". Similarly, for five thousand years, China, known as the land of civilization, has been able to create the moderate nature of perfection and goodness. When it comes to rewarding and punishing, this "ten" has helped or suggested it in many ways.

From "ten drops of medicine" to "ten directions of benefactors," this level of society contains countless thousands of cross-philosophies. (Let's say that.) And—"ten" being "ten" means self-containment, hoping to only stop at "perfection," telling us that accomplishing "ten imperfections" is also a very easy thing.

Isn't it because West Lake is now under the iron heel that I feel this way? I've long said that it's more than just "ten scenic spots." Apart from the current "spoiling the scenery" or adding a "copper camel and thorn bushes picture," I have intuitively or inspiredly experienced that West Lake has at least "three hundred seventy-nine and a half scenic spots." The so-called half is my hasty last half-turn admiration when I broke the reporter's well-fixed "password" with a thunderclap and reined my horse back on the lakeside. Every time I face that kind of environment, dozens of kinds of scenery emerge! However, only "ten scenic spots of West Lake" are generally allowed; this is clearly "ten" acting up and monopolizing everything.

After returning to Shanghai, what I settled in is still the "ten-mile foreign concession." Although I don't have time to calculate whether it is truly ten miles, after eating "ten scenic fried rice" in a Cantonese restaurant, I inadvertently discovered that the "char siu" was being deducted, and the owner was still "ten scenes, ten scenes"! Suddenly realizing that deceiving the world and stealing fame is beyond compare! This directly makes me doubt "ten."

"Ten" creates many, many obstacles to progress in our society, scattering countless seeds that sprout but do not bear fruit, believing that "ten" is completely beautiful and good. Marking "ten" and advancing, the advance is only slight, freezing "ten" under the potential power of the entire society, the most moderate of the moderate! If "Tang's inscription on the basin says: 'If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.'" has value, then this "ten" should be spurned. Unceasing self-improvement originally shouldn't have "ten" to seal the steps. Pull down the framework of the cross and leap forward, is this what we should strive for together?

"Crossroads," how can we allow shuffling again! Write about "ten" to criticize and expose ugliness.

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

2. Is this the county seat?

At 7:00 AM, the bus departed from Mianyang and arrived in Zitong at 10:30 AM, stopping for lunch. Two days before departing from Chengdu, I happened to see a news article in the newspaper about the Executive Yuan commending the county magistrate of Zitong County. It said that the county magistrate was young and handsome, worked hard, and shortly after taking office, everything was well-organized, and he was specially commended by order. Now that I have arrived in Zitong County, I really don't know what kind of place this is. One street, dozens of old-style wooden shops. The people are poor, and their clothes are all tattered rags. The standard of living is also not low. Fried pork slices for lunch cost 5 jiao, egg flower soup costs 1 jiao, and rice costs 5 fen per bowl, which is also too coarse and black to eat. After lunch, we continued on our way, passing through Jiange County, Zhaohua County, and arrived at Guangyuan County at 10:00 PM. Unable to find a hotel, the bus drove into the warehouse of the train station, allowing passengers to move freely. Everyone was quite apprehensive. Some people took their luggage to find acquaintances or find hotels on their own. The remaining group sent two people who were more familiar with the local situation to find a hotel. They returned half an hour later and said they had found one. The bus drove to the entrance of that hotel. The name of the hotel was "Tongkang Inn". After moving the luggage into the inn and washing our faces, it was already 11:00 PM. I didn't feel hungry, but my heart was filled with a heavy sense of terror. Because for the entire fifteen hours, from getting on the bus to getting off the bus, it had been drizzling and a strong wind was blowing. I was wearing thin clothes, and my coat was completely soaked by the rain. Waves of cold were freezing my heart and lungs. My body was extremely weak. I had been seriously ill four years ago, and I still haven't fully recovered my spirit. If I were to be hit by the cold wind and rain, I would get a cold at best, and pneumonia at worst. Then this fragile life (although not a soldier) would be in a situation of "dying before achieving victory".

From Mianyang to Guangyuan, we passed through a total of four counties. The county seat of each county consists of two or three small streets, and the shops are all small wooden bungalows. There are no electric lights, no running water, few residents are literate, and there is absolutely no modern civilization. These county seats are only "prosperous" because they are located at important transportation hubs. Tongkang Inn has a couplet that says: "Read the passing guests from all over the world, be a hasty host for a day"; and on the lanterns at the entrance of another inn, it is written in red paint: "Do not stay at cockcrow". This fully shows the nature of these so-called county seats. If the county seats are like this, the primitive state of the countryside is imaginable, isn't it? I am a Southerner, and my hometown has the most overseas Chinese, and it is also praised by the Chinese as the richest county. Overseas Chinese brought Western civilization back very early, built railways, and opened up horse roads. The prosperity of the county seat is praised as Little Guangzhou; the towns have also opened up wide cement roads, and even in the countryside, two or three-story Western-style houses can be seen everywhere, and cars can directly reach the doorsteps of the villages. Having grown up in such a cradle, and having lived in capitalist cities like Shanghai and Hong Kong, I ask whenever I arrive in a county seat: Is this the county seat? And I lament that these places have not been baptized by Western culture.

Starting from Mianyang, we gradually entered the mountainous area. There are no vegetables or wheat on the mountains, nor are there any plants or trees. It is all a barren expanse of yellowish-brown. The height and barrenness of the place can be seen in general. In the territory of Jiange County, there is Jianmen Pass. A dozen towering mountain peaks stand tall and steep, with snow accumulated on the peaks, like silver pillars. On the north and south sides, there is only one pass, forming a herringbone shape. Although there have been no famous major battles fought here in the war history of our country, if there were a major battle fought here, it would definitely be a dangerous pass of "one man guards the pass, and ten thousand men cannot enter."

### Joyful Colors

— Dongfang

The earth once again welcomes the vibrant return of spring.

Madam Li sat in the sunlight on the veranda, quietly knitting a wool sweater for her daughter. Four steel needles moved incessantly, emitting glints of reflected light. In the corner of the courtyard, a pear tree's buds had already begun to bloom, and small blades of grass were also stretching their heads out from the cracks in the paving stones.

The steel needles moved unceasingly, the wool sweater grew longer inch by inch, suddenly weaving a somber net before her eyes. This red expanse, faintly pulsating, seemed to symbolize red blood flowing from her heart! Madam Li deeply regretted choosing this joyful color.

With a "shush" sound, a cat darted straight out from behind the door and leaped onto the pear tree. Following closely, Xiao Ping emerged from the doorway, dragging a bamboo branch, chasing to the foot of the tree, and raising it to brandish it at the tree in a display of defiance. She was dressed in a tender green wool sweater, bulging and rounded. Madam Li sighed, placed the knitting on her lap, closed her eyes again, and called out, "Xiao Ping." Xiao Ping twisted her body, grunting in response, indicating her unwillingness to give up. The cat turned and jumped onto the wall behind the tree, leaping a few times onto the roof of the house behind.

Xiao Ping turned back in disappointment, craning her neck to look at the roof. The sun forced her to squint.

"Xiao Ping!" Hearing her mother call, Xiao Ping ran to her, leaned on her lap, and burst into tears. The child, feeling wronged by the cat, involuntarily shed tears. Madam Li quickly pushed her away, pulling out the half-knitted wool sweater. Several large, bean-sized teardrops glistened on the wool. Madam Li patted Xiao Ping's back, repeatedly saying:

"Don't cry, don't cry. Stand up and try it on for size!"

She pulled open the half-finished wool sweater, slipped it over Xiao Ping's head, and down to her belly. Xiao Ping wriggled, looking up, half-crying, half-laughing, said:

"When Dad sees it, he'll say 'Red Child, Red Child' again!"

"Is Red Child not good?" Madam Li said, while taking it off her.

"Mom, do you think Dad will come back after all? What's he doing there? Why is he always squatting at the end of the world and not coming back to see me?"

"He's fighting for us at the end of the world! Only when he's done fighting can he come back to see Xiao Ping!" Madam Li put away the yarn, held Xiao Ping on her lap with both hands, and looked at her wide-open eyes. Her own voice seemed unnatural, and she felt troubled. She leaned close and kissed Xiao Ping's tender cheek. Xiao Ping pushed her away with her little hand and asked in surprise:

"Mom, are you crying too? Tears are dripping on my face."

"Mommy is not crying, the tears are Xiao Ping's. Mommies are grown-ups, grown-ups don't cry." Madam Li truly couldn't hold back, and her throat felt especially constricted.

"Dad doesn't hit Xiao Ping, he hits bad people? Mom, when you write a letter, don't forget to ask Dad to buy a big foreign doll to bring back. Xiao Ping likes dolls the most." Xiao Ping bounced up and down on Madam Li's lap, one small hand groping Madam Li's face, the wet tears disappearing from her fingertips onto the back of her hand.

The sunlight had quietly slipped outside the veranda. The pear tree seemed to be smiling. Suddenly, the corner gate creaked open, and the head of a nurse poked in, her face full of smiles:

"Xiao Ping, hey!"

Xiao Ping turned her head, struggled to jump down, and ran towards her, opening her arms, calling:

"Auntie! Auntie!"

The aunt ran in, squatted down, picked up Xiao Ping, and walked along, kissing her cheeks again and again, smiling and saying:

"Sister, look, I'm pretending to be like this, and Xiao Ping is not afraid?" As she spoke, she twirled in front of her sister. Madam Li nodded, smiling, and said:

"Have you learned how to bandage? Are you still afraid of seeing blood?"

"What are you talking about? When have I ever been afraid of blood?" She sat down on a stool next to Madam Li, holding Xiao Ping, and bounced her high.

"You are not afraid of blood, but I hate this red. Red symbolizes blood. Knitting this red wool sweater is like a large patch of blood flowing from my chest!" Madam Li pulled out the unfinished wool sweater, shook it open, and waved it in front of her sister, "My heart can't bear to think of blood, but this thing keeps making me think of it. You still say it's a joyful color! I don't feel it when I'm sick myself, but when other people are sick, I can't see it, and that's exhausting! It feels like I always have something hanging on my heart, I can't grasp it, and I can't spit it out, I'm really suffering! I would rather go out and do something, let people worry about me, I really don't want to worry about people anymore! You are so carefree, jumping and running, doing your best for the country, and also venting your anger. I'm just sitting here, guarding, unable to do anything useful, watching you with empty envy."

"Alright, sister, you're unleashing that speech again," the sister laughed and took off her nurse's cap, "What does it mean to work in one's own position? If you want me to leave, then Xiao Ping won't have anyone." She really couldn't find any words to comfort her sister.

A hissing sound came from inside the window, it was the sound of the younger brother playing a record:

"...Arise, all who refuse to be slaves..."

### Fire

— Simon

The indifferent night arrived, and the biting winter wind howled. Those streets, those roads brutally bombed during the day by iron crows emblazoned with sun emblems, lay beneath the gloomy sky without moon or stars. The desolate, shattered scene was even more desolate and shattered than after a storm. The shuddering and somber feeling it evoked was even more miserable and terrifying than the shuddering and somber feeling evoked by the most desolate countryside and the most deathly silent and gloomy ruined tombs in the depths of winter.

The streets were piled high with small hills of rubble fragments, brick wall fragments, scattered with broken, fragmented wooden pillars, beams, and flowered door panels. In addition, there were a few lonely, cracked walls, tottering precariously in the face of the gusts of wind. And there were unburied corpses, exposed here and there, whether they had lost an arm, a leg, their heads separated from their bodies, or only had half of their bloody bodies left... In short, those dead who still had recognizable faces all displayed an expression of resentment at being brutally murdered, making one's hair stand on end at the sight.

Apart from the whistling of the wind, occasionally, from a not-too-distant place, the cries of night vendors passed by, along with the "tuk-tuk" sound of clacking bamboo castanets. These had become the only sounds on the earth, but the miserable feeling was intensified by the encounter. At the other end of the street, those who had lost their homes huddled together, high and low, like beetles, curled up. Some went to the roadside to pick up grass stalks, paper balls, peanut shells, and other fuels. Gathering in front of the door of that family's grass shed dwelling, they piled up the things they had collected and lit a fire. As these things burned, they slowly blazed up, and the red flames rose higher and higher. A group huddled together, hissing air, snot dripping down their hands. Each frozen hand was stretched out and waved wildly above the firelight, desperately stroking and roasting.

Fire, fire, fire, burning, and then adding more things, the fire became more and more intense. The fire then curled up to the shed, and the shed caught fire.

Disaster. An intuitive alert. The people who had started the fire to keep warm all fled in a puff of smoke.

Very quickly, the fire spread to the grass sheds one by one. By the time the people in the houses noticed and ran out, their homes were already engulfed in a scorching fire pit.

The soaring red sparks obscured the entire space.

Under the illumination of the scarlet firelight: human voices were in turmoil, and footsteps were panicked. Strong men squinted and rushed out of their yards. Only when they got outside did they remember who was missing, and they desperately rushed back in to drag out a crying child. Some, wearing only single layers of clothing, were jumping around aimlessly as if they had lost something. Some old women fell on the roadside, spitting out half-frozen saliva. Some children couldn't find their mothers, and mothers couldn't find their children...

A cacophony of crying mingled with wailing, shouting, and yelling, mixed with the gushing sound of water spraying from the rubber hoses of the fire engines.

The more vigorously the north wind blew, the more the fire refused to subside. Moreover, fueled by the wind, it wildly and rampantly swept across the grass sheds, spreading forward wantonly. Firefighters wearing copper helmets, holding long iron shovels, taunted it, cutting off the houses about to catch fire to stop its progress. However, a gust of wind once again boosted its momentum, and it rolled up into the air, crackling and snapping as it devoured easily combustible things.

The screams and cries, along with the newly ignited fire, once again chaotically filled people's ears. Accompanied by the piercing sound of copper bells, the Red Cross ambulances were busiest, arriving with empty vehicles and leaving with a full load of people who had been burned by the fire.

The water in the street was overflowing.

The wind subsided slightly, and the flames gradually became tired. In the cold and gloomy night, many grass shed houses had become a scattered scorched earth. Then, despairing cries began: In the gloomy and cold night, the home was destroyed, the son was gone, buried in the fire; the wife was gone, taken to the Red Cross, injured. Everyone knew that. In the desolate and cold night, a pile of ashes, still flashing sparks of fire, contrasted with the pile of rubble at the other end of the street. Such an unfortunate and intense tragedy was tormenting the poor, peaceful people!

Likewise, the home was gone. For now, they would spend the night at the corner of the street in December. But where would they go tomorrow? And what about the long days after tomorrow?
