### Anglo-French Secret Agreement and the German-Italian-Japanese Military Alliance

Last night, the Associated Press in London reported: "The United Kingdom and France have signed a secret agreement, mutually agreeing to jointly protect Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland from foreign aggression." On the other hand, the same agency reported from Berlin: "According to extremely reliable sources, the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will soon be transformed into a military alliance agreement." This is the inevitable culmination of the escalating antagonism between the aggressive and anti-aggressive fronts in the world. Originally, the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance had been brewing for a long time. The joint military and diplomatic conference of Germany, Italy, and Japan in Berlin a month ago already had the practicality of signing the agreement. Now that Hitler feels the need to further promote new aggressions and stabilize old ones, it is only natural and inevitable that Germany more actively demands that Italy and Japan come out again to cheer and support Germany, and it is not surprising. Berlin diplomatic circles believe: "If the European 'Anti-Hitler Front' is completed, it will be an excellent opportunity for Germany, Italy, and Japan to proceed with a military alliance" (yesterday's Associated Press report). In fact, even without the establishment of an "Anti-Hitler Front," the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance would still be realized. The "Nazi" side's revelation that "negotiations for this military alliance have already been underway for some time" is honest, but the release of such honesty at this time may have other intentions.

Regarding the collusion of the German-Italian-Japanese aggressors, what needs to be deeply understood is their current style. Hitler is now not only occupying Slovakia and annexing Memel, but also subjugating Romania and signing an economic agreement with Germany. Hitler has devoured a lot of things in this short period. No matter how strong his appetite is, he must rest a little. However, the methods of this "heroic soldier" (Göring's flattery) are different. According to our speculation, although Hitler needs a little rest, and in fact must rest temporarily, he will inevitably adopt a political strategy of "advancing as a retreat." The methods will be nothing more than (1) issuing more declarations threatening Britain and France, and making more gestures to strike at Britain and France; (2) wooing and instigating the accomplices Italy and Japan to act more actively in the Mediterranean and the Far East, in order to threaten Britain and France not to interfere with his consolidation in Eastern Europe, so that he can safely achieve greater results. The other day, all newspapers in Berlin widely publicized: How Mussolini will make a tough speech next Sunday; last night, the German "Asia News Agency" threatened: "Italy will make demands on France with extremely tough measures," and at the same time cheered Mussolini: "Italy's demands are as important as Germany's demands, and if necessary, the two countries will fight together," and also said: "It is believed that Italy will obtain satisfaction in the inevitable war." On the other hand, the Japanese cabinet convened an emergency cabinet meeting all night, "to discuss the European situation caused by Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, and the new diplomatic policies that Japan should adopt." According to our observation, Japan's so-called new diplomatic policy will be nothing more than two points: first, to further establish closer contact with the two accomplices, Germany and Italy, or even completely follow Hitler's demands, focusing on coercing Britain and France in the Far East; second, to take this opportunity to more actively launch military operations in Central and Southern China, coercing China to "surrender" in order to end the increasingly deeply mired invasion war. The fragile Japanese imperialism, knowing that it does not have the strength to launch a two-front war, and understanding that Hitler will not attack the Soviet Union at present, abandoned its northward advance and focused on the southward advance. The Japanese side has already yielded to the Soviet Union, willing to participate in the auction bidding for Soviet fishing areas; military operations in Central and Southern China have also become more active. Hitler is indeed an extremely clever "hero," and Italy and Japan have completely become Hitler's two hands.

However, in the situation where the aggressive front is becoming increasingly consolidated and strengthened, how is the development of the anti-aggressive front? The rumored Anglo-French secret agreement may have a considerable possibility, and the Four-Power Declaration can also be issued. The United States has decided not to recognize Germany's annexation of Memel. The strength of the democratic bloc is indeed increasing day by day, but it always feels fragile, slow, dispersed, and even too selfish and isolated. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference of nine European countries seems to be as we predicted, unable to be realized, and more concrete cooperation between the Soviet Union is temporarily not possible. Even if we examine the rumored Anglo-French secret agreement, what Britain and France are seeking is limited to stabilizing Central Europe. They only want to protect the small Central European countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. As for the Eastern European countries, they have been left behind. No wonder the small Eastern European countries have been defeated by Hitler one by one, and they are all vying to submit to the "Nazi Eastern Crusade."

Today, we cannot help but say that Britain and France should take advantage of Hitler's need to rest after his rampage to express a tougher attitude towards the aggressors in order to prevent the accomplices Italy and Japan from taking advantage of the situation to act rashly; on the other hand, they should more sincerely and practically contact the United States and the Soviet Union, and even other small countries, to form an "anti-aggressive front." The situation has become urgent, and the "anti-aggressive front" must not be allowed to continue to be so dispersed and suspicious. Even empty bluster cannot stop the arrogance of the aggressors.

### Wartime Democracy and Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils

— Mei Zhen

Since the formal establishment of the National Political Council, the call for establishing local political councils and establishing local public opinion bodies has been loud and clear, forming a unanimous national demand. The authorities then made the decision to organize provincial, municipal, and county councils, and announced their organizational laws. Later, because the situations in various places were different, most provinces and cities failed to submit their lists within the deadline. Now that the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has entered a brand-new stage, and the national strength urgently needs to be concentrated and brought into play, the need to establish local public opinion bodies is felt to be even more urgent. Here, we will briefly discuss the great historical significance borne by the provincial, municipal, and county councils at the current stage, and their major tasks in striving for the final success of the War of Resistance, for the reference of all those who care about national affairs.

1.  The Urgent Need to Implement Democracy During the War of Resistance

The final success of the Chinese nation's War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is inseparable from the implementation of a democratic and legal system. The decision made by the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress last year to convene the National Political Council was aimed at adapting to the urgent needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, concentrating the strength of the whole country to eliminate the unprecedented national crisis, and gathering the will of the whole country to establish a foundation for democratic nation-building. On February 21st, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said in his closing remarks at the Third National Political Council: "The historical mission of this council (the National Political Council) is to establish a foundation for democratic politics, especially to establish a permanent and true foundation for democratic politics… Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the Three Principles of the People, and the ultimate goal of his Principle of Democracy is democratic politics. If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is to say, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, they cannot create a happy country. Therefore, the greatest, most powerful, and most solid politics in the world must be built on public opinion, and must take the interests of the people as their own, and the people's vision as their own. Dr. Sun's ideal is to create a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, which is the same throughout ancient and modern times, in China and abroad. We are now fighting the war on the one hand and building the nation on the other. To achieve victory in the War of Resistance and success in nation-building, we must not rely solely on military force, but must mobilize the spirit of the masses and organize the spirit of the masses that has already been launched, using the sum of the spiritual will and strength of the whole country to be the backing for the soldiers at the front and the driving force for the development of the rear. Therefore, in addition to strengthening military power, it is even more necessary to gather public opinion. The reason why the Provisional National Congress last year resolved to convene the National Political Council was on the one hand to hope that the true public opinion of the whole country could be concretely expressed through our councilors, so that the government could understand the people's suffering, know the people's hopes, and use them as the basis for governance. At the same time, we hope that our councilors will use their status, prestige, and experience to express the people's views on the major plans for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and actively contribute our talents and experience," "to create a truly democratic nation in this arduous period of the War of Resistance." From this, it can be imagined that in this difficult period of the War of Resistance, there is an even greater need for the active promotion of democratic politics, so that the mobilization of the masses, the organization of the masses, and the launching of the spiritual will and strength of the whole country can be smoothly realized.

Mr. Mao Zedong also clearly stated in his famous report "On the New Stage": "Democratic politics is the advancing engine for launching all the lively forces of the entire nation. With this system, the anti-Japanese enthusiasm of the entire people will be immeasurably launched and become an inexhaustible source. The completion of the great process of the thorough unification and solidarity of our entire nation can only be based on the establishment of a democratic system." He also said: "Regarding this point... all are for the purpose of closely linking the government and the people, increasing the strength of the government, so that it can play its important role in the War of Resistance against Japan. There is no question that any local government in the country should be concentrated under the leadership of the central government, and there should be no expression of disrespect for the central leadership due to the administrative regions being divided geographically. The whole country must implement democracy in accordance with the central laws, but the whole country must be unified under the central government." From this, it can be even more imagined that if we do not actively promote democracy today, and if we do not actively improve politics today, we will not be able to support the long and arduous War of Resistance against Japan, and we will not be able to realize the victory of the War of Resistance and the success of nation-building.

The Third National Political Council also passed the "Proposal to Establish a Democratic and Legal System to Lay the Foundation for National Reconstruction," proposed by Huang Yanpei and 49 others. The opening of the original proposal also clearly pointed out: "At this time when the War of Resistance is becoming increasingly favorable and national reconstruction is beginning, it is especially appropriate to encourage the system of democracy and the rule of law, in order to achieve the most substantial achievements in political tutelage and to lay a solid foundation for constitutionalism." In addition, this conference also passed the "Proposal to Strengthen the Realization of Democracy and Inspire Public Morale to Benefit the War of Resistance," proposed by councilor Dong Biwu and 26 others. This can prove that at this new stage of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, it is necessary to quickly and definitely promote democratic politics. This is not only the clear indication of the wise national leader, but also the common requirement of the councilors who represent the public opinion of the whole country. All of this can show that our work to establish a foundation for democratic politics will have a more important and practical development in the future, and will open up an unprecedentedly brilliant page in the revolutionary history of the Chinese nation.

2.  The Important Position of Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils

True democratic politics lies in the broad masses of the people obtaining various opportunities and organizations to participate in national politics. The current War of Resistance and National Reconstruction in China aims not only to expel the Japanese through the War of Resistance and restore our rivers and mountains, but also to establish a new China of the Three Principles of the People, a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, through the War of Resistance, and also to gradually realize democratic politics in the difficult process of the War of Resistance. Today, the most urgent requirement of the first step is for the broad masses of the people to obtain various opportunities and organizations to actively participate in the work of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Here, we cannot but express our deep expectations for the National Political Council in the national scope and the political councils in various local areas of the country.

(1) The National Political Council and Democracy

The National Political Council is neither the same as the parliamentary organizations of various democratic countries in the world today, nor is it the purely public opinion body that we need and hope for, but based on the motives for the establishment of the National Political Council and its achievements since its establishment, it can already be worthy of the reputation of a "transitional public opinion body during the War of Resistance," and should occupy a glorious page in the history of nation-building of the Chinese nation. Chairman Chiang's instruction that the historical mission of the National Political Council is to "establish a foundation for democratic politics, especially a permanent and true foundation for democratic politics," should especially be trusted by us.

However, in order for the National Political Council to truly be able to live up to its great mission, the first lies in the fact that the organization of the National Political Council and the generation of councilors must be in accordance with the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Democracy. Regarding this point, of course, we still need to work hard to promote its thorough realization. The second lies in the fact that every councilor must understand that he is a representative of the hardworking and productive people, and at all times and in all places insist on his glorious and important position. This point has given people a clear expression and inspires respect and belief since the defection of the President of the Council, Wang Jingwei, from the motherland. Third, it is even more dependent on the propaganda and mobilization of the national public opinion circles and the enthusiastic participation of the nationally awakened masses; we have done very insufficiently in this point in the past, especially the relatively indifferent attitude of the general public towards the National Political Council, which requires us to make redoubled efforts to improve.

(2) The Past Achievements of the National Political Council

However, the National Political Council has been established for less than a year, and its great achievements in promoting democratic politics and assisting the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction should be valued by us. The first is that the first conference passed the proposal to support the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Program, the second conference passed the proposal to support the national policy of protracted war, and the third conference passed the proposal to support the national policy of protracted war. This enhanced the strength of the government and the people, and clarified the vision of China and foreign countries. On the one hand, it gave a major blow to the anti-communist, ceasefire, and compromise conspiracies advocated by traitors and collaborators, and on the other hand, it raised the nation's self-esteem and self-confidence in adhering to unity and resisting Japan and building the nation. The second is that it has passed many important proposals concerning various departments of military affairs, people's livelihood, internal affairs, diplomacy, finance, economy, education, and culture. Most of these proposals have been accepted by the government or have been gradually implemented, and have made considerable contributions to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Third, as Chairman Chiang said in his opening speech at the three conferences of the National Political Council: "In addition to working hard to participate in the meetings, many councilors are also engaged in the practical work of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction outside the meetings. Whether in the war zone or in the rear, our councilors have made adventurous, difficult, and outstanding efforts."

Chairman Chiang also reminded everyone: "If the spirit of our national sages and talented people, and leaders can be uplifted, and the will of the government and the people can be connected, and the strength of the government and the people can be gathered, this effect will be ten times greater than raising the spirit of brave sacrifice of officers and soldiers on the front line!" However, regarding this point, if we only rely on the efforts of a few councilors, it is naturally not enough in fact. The rapid establishment of local public opinion bodies is particularly important at the current stage!

(3) Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils in the New Stage of the War of Resistance

The current new stage of the War of Resistance is the stage of stopping the Japanese from advancing and preparing for our army's counter-offensive. It can also be said to be the stage of turning defeat into victory, turning passivity into initiative, and preparing to drive out all the Japanese invaders and restore our rivers and mountains. In order to strive for the victory and success of this stage, it lies in intensifying the blows to weaken all the forces of the Japanese invaders, and especially in intensifying the growth of our new forces. This depends on the total mobilization of the lively forces of the entire nation, and the establishment of local public opinion bodies and their practical responsibility are even more important.

In order to rapidly establish local public opinion bodies, the authorities have decided to establish temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils. Now, all provinces and cities have been ordered to prepare as soon as possible, and Guangdong Province has also decided to formally establish it on April 1st. In addition to hoping that all provinces, cities, and counties can prepare for establishment as soon as possible, in view of the urgent needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance, the temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils must at least achieve the following points:

First, the temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils must become true local public opinion bodies and strive to lay the foundation for the implementation of democratic politics.

Second, promote the spirit of the National Political Council and closely link the government and the people.

Third, realize the total mobilization of the spirit and material strength of the entire people on a larger scale to adapt to the new needs of the front, the rear, and the struggle after the Japanese retreat.

3.  A Model of a Temporary Council

Since the government announced the organizational law of the temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils and ordered them to be established within a time limit, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government took the lead in complying with the order and actively prepared for it. It held an inaugural meeting in Yan'an in early February of this year, which seems to be worthy of important reference for other provinces, cities, and counties. According to a telegram from Yan'an by the Associated Press on February 7:

The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Temporary Council is the first popular legislative representative assembly in Chinese history. It has been meeting here for a week and has now closed. The council has passed the following major proposals:

1.  Free distribution of land to soldiers returning from the front line.

2.  Implementation of confiscation of traitor property.

3.  Prohibition of marriage for those suffering from venereal diseases, leprosy, madness, and incurable diseases.

4.  No marriage is allowed for women under the age of 18 and men under the age of 20.

5.  Stipulation of divorce law, divorce is allowed for those who are bigamous, incompatible, have illicit relationships, and are unable to bear children.

6.  Guarantee of freedom of speech, publication, religion, and assembly.

7.  Implementation of complete equality between men and women in politics, economy, and society.

8.  Implementation of complete equality among all ethnic groups in the country, allowing the minority groups of the five races to maintain their original customs and family education.

9.  Forced implementation of military training.

10. The government provides relief to the sick, the elderly, orphans, and widows.

11. Implementation of agricultural education, reclamation of wasteland, and protection of forests.

12. Government officials and students must support themselves in order to reduce government expenses (officials and students at all levels are provided with clothing, food, accommodation, and a salary of no more than five yuan).

13. Implementation of an eight-hour workday.

14. Abolition of usury, with the government lending money to the people and charging low interest rates.

15. Establishment and organization of government and court laws, prohibiting all kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies except for farmers donating no more than seven percent of agricultural products.

According to Lin Boqu (Zu Han), chairman of the Border Region Government, told the Associated Press reporter: "In 1937, the people elected representatives from various districts to meet. This time, the representatives to the Border Region People's Congress were elected by secret ballot. This is the first meeting, and all administrative officials are elected in this way. Workers, farmers, and the middle class from all over the country elect representatives according to their numbers. The result of this legislative meeting has laid the initial foundation for democratic politics."

4.  Practical Facilities for Wartime Democracy

The main guarantee for the final victory and success of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is the gradual implementation of democratic politics under centralized leadership, and the main guarantee for the implementation of democratic politics during the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is the smooth and practical development of the work of the National Political Council and the establishment of provincial, municipal, and county councils as true public opinion bodies. In the past year, with the great achievements of the National Political Council and the successive establishment or preparation for establishment of provincial, municipal, and county councils, we have already begun to take the first step in implementing democratic politics. In the future, as long as everyone works together to supervise and assist the accelerated promotion of all the work of these national and local public opinion bodies, and all the resolutions of these bodies are conscientiously and practically implemented by the government, we can gradually promote true democratic politics. However, in order to guarantee the smooth progress of this major work, we feel that it is still necessary to quickly and practically pay attention to the following points: First, it is necessary to guarantee the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, religion, and ideological belief of the people as stipulated in the "Program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," so as to fully unleash the strength of the entire nation for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. On the one hand, we must absolutely guarantee that all central laws are implemented in all parts of the country without being arbitrarily restricted by any local government, and on the other hand, we must restrict the freedom of speech and action that violates the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and restrict the freedom of speech and action of traitors and pro-Japanese elements.

Second, it is necessary to follow the instructions in the recent declarations and documents of the supreme leader, and begin to implement thorough democratic politics in the war zones and in the areas behind the enemy lines and occupied areas, and establish democratic political power for the anti-Japanese revolution. As for the specific methods, such as implementing popular elections for local governments at all levels and then entrusting them by higher levels, such as adopting a democratic committee system in governments at all levels in the war zones, and establishing people's representative bodies at all levels, such as adding several necessary working departments to the war zone governments, such as eliminating corrupt and degenerate elements, absorbing active elements who are willing to dedicate themselves to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and stipulating that the local governments in the war zones have the power to promulgate local regulations under the unified leadership of the central government. Stipulating that all male and female citizens in the war zones who are not traitors or pro-Japanese elements have the right to elect and be elected, as well as the right to freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and armed resistance, and can implement the open and legal status of all anti-Japanese parties in the war zones, in order to further realize true democratic politics and make all the spiritual and material forces of the entire nation truly mobilized, concentrated, unified, and utilized.

The War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is a long and arduous undertaking. The success of the national revolution and the prospects are still very distant. We must adhere to the long-term unity of the whole country, intensify the total spiritual mobilization of the whole people, and work harder to promote the implementation of democratic politics under centralized leadership during the war.

### The Treasure House of Xikang (Part 1)

Kangding Correspondence: Since the military rise, most of the coastal ports have been blockaded by the Japanese, and all wartime and peacetime resources have been greatly affected. Developing resources and supplementing the front line is the urgent task at hand. Xikang is rich in products, especially mineral resources. Since the establishment of the province, the authorities have paid attention to surveying various natural resources, and the virgin land that has been mysterious and unexplored since ancient times will also be actively utilized and developed separately.

Rongjing Has Many Mines

During this visit to Kang, the reporter paid special attention to the investigation of various sectors of the economy and the mineral resources. Last month, when I passed through Rongjing, I had already investigated in detail and reported truthfully on the reserves and quality of the red iron ore in the county. However, Rongjing's mineral products are not limited to red iron ore. There are also large reserves of bituminous coal in the Huajianzi, Banjing, and Huayan areas, and anthracite coal in the Ronghe River basin. In addition, copper mines are also rich in all districts of the county. In addition, there are millions of hardwood trees with diameters of more than one foot produced in the Xiangling area, which can be used for railway sleepers. The great Rongjing is almost a real treasure house. How the country should use and develop these rich resources to strengthen its power is something that the authorities should pay special attention to.

Copper Mine Suspended

Rongjing is located southwest of Ya'an, with high peaks and deep valleys, and dangerous natural barriers, guarding the thoroughfare between Sichuan and Xikang. The county's mineral deposits are the best in eastern Kang. In addition to coal and iron, copper mines are also abundant. According to the reporter's investigation in recent days, copper mines are found in all districts of the county. The mines in Daihuangou and Shanxilin in the northern district are the most promising, and the mines in Qianhou Zhaoba in the eastern district are second. The discovery of the Shanxilin copper mine has not been around for many dynasties, and the old tunnels that have been operated are only thirty or forty feet deep. The reason for its suspension is indeed flooding by yang water, not abandonment due to exhaustion of the mine. Therefore, today, reopening it must still be carried out along the old tunnels in Shanxilin in order to be sure. In the past, there were two mines in the area, one was the Fuxing Factory owned by the Ma family, which was founded in the twentieth year of Guangxu, and the other was the Sanyuan Factory owned by the Li family. By the beginning of the Republic, it had been dug to a depth of forty feet. However, as the mining developed in all directions, it pierced the wall of the Baodian Cave, and the water flowed in horizontally, also resulting in the mine being destroyed. It has been suspended to this day, which is a pity.

### The Importance of Spiritual Mobilization

— Soong Mei-ling

It is a very common principle in modern life that when a person becomes ill, they must seek treatment from a doctor. To ensure that the disease can be treated, the source of the illness must first be diagnosed. If there is a need for surgery, one should not hesitate to ask the doctor to operate. If it is discovered that the patient's internal organs have been fundamentally impaired due to neglect in their lifestyle, it is of course necessary to take urgent measures to restore them to their normal state.

Just as this is true for individuals, it is also true for countries and their administrative institutions; it is true for countries with well-established organizations and proper governance, and it certainly should be true for our China.

Precisely because our country must take the quickest methods to restore the vitality of the people (which can be achieved simply by appropriately applying effective modern scientific methods), I have, in the past nine weeks, exposed the root causes of the political ailments that have severely corroded us for several generations. Perhaps I have been too direct, speaking about some traditional chronic diseases in a completely naked and undisguised manner; however, I knowingly did so because I felt it was necessary. We must first understand our own worst shortcomings, and then we can hope to get rid of the old and usher in the new, and achieve the most perfect state.

I hope to stir the conscience of those who have neglected their duties and harmed the public, causing them to repent of their past mistakes, or else resign from their positions. I also hope to move all honest, pure, patriotic compatriots who have the will and ability to examine and correct the nation's shortcomings, to concentrate their sincere enthusiasm, to carry out vigorous reforms, and to rebuild our country.

By criticizing the various parts of society in this way, I hope to sow seeds throughout the country, so that our intellectual class can work together to eliminate those obsolete, wasteful, and inefficient old methods, as well as all bad habits and customs, in administrative, economic, and other undertakings. I also hold the same enthusiasm, eagerly desiring intellectuals to quickly adopt new methods that have proven effective, and to use their wisdom, loyalty, and strength to develop our hidden human and material resources, so that the War of Resistance against Japan will be won as soon as possible, and a new Republic of China will be forged from the crucible of this war, which has sacrificed so many compatriots and so much wealth.

In the nine articles above, most of my attention was focused on the material conditions for building a new China; in this final article, I want to specifically discuss the importance of national spiritual renewal and its relationship to the work of national rejuvenation.

Regarding spiritual renewal, the Supreme National Defense Council has already announced the Outline for the National Spiritual Mobilization on March 12, urging the entire country to implement it consistently. This plan grasps the basic points of how to eliminate the various national shortcomings that I have declared, and strives to mobilize the essence of our national spirit to meet the needs of the country. The outline explains the intention of the National Spiritual Mobilization as:

"To gather the spirit of the people of the whole country to a simple common goal, so that the people of the whole country can establish the same patriotic morality for themselves, and firmly establish the same belief in national construction for the country, and that every member of the people can struggle and sacrifice for the same belief based on the same moral concept." This summary contains many of the principles that I ask everyone to implement. Now, a National Spiritual Mobilization Council has been established, with the Chairman serving as the President, to promote and implement this movement. In terms of implementation, the goal is to encourage the people of the whole country to become active and do their best to create the national life and patriotic spirit that are indispensable for the revival of China.

This is a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years, to awaken all qualified and knowledgeable people to make drastic reforms for the country. Anyone who cannot use this opportunity to make a contribution is giving up their qualifications as a citizen; those who are willing to work hard according to this outline will surely make a practical contribution in the process of winning the War of Resistance and successfully building the country, and will surely receive lasting comfort.

Whether this spiritual rejuvenation can affect the entire nation can be understood by slightly studying the national character that the enemy has exposed to the world in the past twenty months of brutal aggression against China. Previously, the Japanese boasted of two outstanding characteristics: one was the spirit of the samurai contained in their Bushido education; the other was the material progress shown by their industrial development and new military equipment.

Before the Japanese military leaders decided to carry out their international policy to invade China, world opinion generally accepted the Japanese's own assessment, acknowledging them as a civilized, cultured, and chivalrous nation. At the same time, people from all over the world unconditionally acknowledged that this nation possessed an invincible military force.

Later, when Japan launched the war with sophistry, people from all countries were also convinced that it would achieve a quick and humane victory; but in just a few months, the public opinion of the world had undergone a historically amazing transformation. Brutality followed brutality, and Christians all over the world were shocked and dumbfounded to see Japanese officers and soldiers committing all kinds of evil. The heroic qualities shown by the Chinese army and the sustained determination of the Chinese people to resist the war made the Japanese soldiers panic and had to tear off their mask of civilization and chivalry. They tried their best to display their character of injustice and indiscipline, and did not hesitate to carry out all kinds of illegal, untrustworthy, and inhuman atrocities in order to achieve their goals.

People from all over the world have been shocked and amazed by this, but the Japanese continue their inhuman behavior month after month, losing all the reputation they had previously gained through hypocrisy, and their true colors are becoming more and more exposed, showing that they are a lawless hodgepodge and a product of barbaric materialism. They irrationally believe in "might makes right" and foolishly regard themselves as descendants of gods, and regard those who do not obey their will as scum that should be swept away from the earth.

What good this pure materialism will do them remains to be seen in future history; but based on the facts that have already been revealed, it can also become a beneficial lesson for our people across the country. Japan is on the verge of collapse. Human heredity originally has spiritual qualities, but Japan has devoted all its efforts to the development of material and military power for the past sixty years, completely ignoring the cultivation of the spiritual aspects of the people. This is the reason for its collapse.

Such a profound lesson and warning are deeply imprinted on the souls of our nation and individuals, so we must absorb all the virtues of our ancestors into our lives and keep them respectfully. These virtues have not only enabled us to survive for thousands of years, but also enabled us, this great, hardworking, and unarmed nation, to overcome all kinds of the most inhumane war disasters.

According to the plan for spiritual mobilization announced by the government, we must improve and enrich our own lives, and we should bravely move forward on this spiritual path: we should actively, confidently, and unyieldingly implement the various programs stipulated in this plan, we should promote it and make it shine, and at the same time, we should make full use of other spiritually valuable forces to help its completion.

In this current period, we should rebuild our country on a spiritual foundation, cultivate our precious cultural traditions, and build all our due constructions in a sound and complete manner. Since the people of our China have been spiritually mobilized to engage in the work of national construction, we will surely preserve our nation and our own right to survival. We should not be discouraged, nor should we be afraid of others. We can be inspired by that sensitive Latin word Resvrgam "I will rise again", and receive infinite comfort and honor. We should make full use of this inspiration to complete the rejuvenation of our nation.

### Fierce Battle Unfolds on the Left Wing of Nanxun × Two Regiments Cross the Xiu River to Harass Our Troops Reinforce Northwest Nanchang

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, this newspaper, 24th] Nanchang Telegram: Ganbei × This invasion is intended to be a major operation. Since the beginning of the month, it has been launched southwards along Ruide, Nanxun, and Dexing Roads. It is rumored that there are three divisions, but this is not the case. More than 10,000 people have been concentrated in the vicinity of Dean and other places, mostly transferred from Hankou. The main force is distributed in Dean, Wuning, and other places.

### From Laohekou to Xi'an Part 1

— Special Correspondent of this newspaper: Geng Ya

From Laohekou, the transportation center in northern Hubei, you can take a bus north to Nanyang, east to Yancheng, a stronghold on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, or north to Luoyang, a stronghold on the Kaihai Road. If you go west along the Han River, you can reach Hanzhong on the southern route and Chang'an on the northern route. The reporter decided to take the last route, that is, to go to Chang'an first.

At the "de facto but not de jure" ticket office of the Taihe Inn outside the South Gate of Laohekou, a temporary ticket with the word "full" or "half" written in ink was purchased according to the registration procedures, and was taken away when the car was about to start. The procedure was sloppy, causing suspicion: first, the number of people was crowded, exceeding the quota; second, military personnel were given half-price tickets, which were said to be limited to five; third, it is said that the car on this road is operated by the Shaanxi Construction Department, but there are no formal signs and documents, so everyone guesses that this business must be a "knockoff" operated by the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Department. If you have to transfer to a Shaanxi Provincial Orphanage car when passing through Shangxian the next day, there will be many malpractices, which will undoubtedly be thoroughly investigated.

Even some selfish drivers of military vehicles, especially those who changed from commercial vehicles to military vehicles, dared to steal and sell gasoline in order to enrich themselves; or colluded with the heads of various gas stations, saying that the gas station had no stock, and then bought it at a higher price, so as to make false reports and cheat. What is more serious is that some people in the agencies that control goods in various places also want to make a fortune from the national crisis. Their conscience is really gone! But as the ancients said, "What comes in improperly goes out improperly." Those who usually swallow public funds to enrich themselves have never had a good end, and those who catch fish in troubled waters during wartime will certainly not get beans from planting melons.

The car initially traveled tens of miles, and the road surface was very bad - the car was too late that day, and the driver tried desperately to catch up, and overturned once in Xixiakou, Henan Province. Fortunately, the place was not a deep pit, and no major disaster was caused, and it arrived late in Xiping Town to stay. The town has an earthen wall and a fairly dense population. There were no hotels before. This spring, roads were built and traffic was opened, and restaurants made a fortune. Only bamboo were used to separate rooms for guests. The villagers call the waiter "shop second", and the shop second responds immediately when called, with ancient sounds and ancient music, which is quite laughable. Chen Zhejun, a young military officer from the Northeast, talked about the news of the war in the next room, involving the truth about how to transport fresh troops to the rear, which was especially interesting.

The next day, the car passed the border between Henan and Shaanxi, and what I saw was a dilapidated and ruined city, which is said to be the place where Guan Yu, during the Three Kingdoms period, passed five passes and killed six generals. The mountains are steep, the river courses are curved, and in the wilderness outside the city, the majestic killing sounds of the army's field exercises make you feel excited, happy, and have a hope: if this ancient battlefield becomes a modern battlefield, that is, when their fake exercises become real victories!

The organization of the Red Spear Society in this area is also developing vigorously. Along the way, I saw their public exercises, which were similar to the national exercises, but the ranks used new-style military exercises, all with a unique style. There is another kind of secret exercise called "sending the knife"; it is said that when the knife is sent effectively, it can kill without being injured in a hail of bullets. Sending the knife must be held in a quiet room at night. At that time, all sounds are silent and the four elements are empty. First, burn incense and worship in the shrine, and then listen to the master's instructions on spells. Stand on the cross drawn on the spot, and you can not speak and bear the knife and gun records with your arms, chest and abdomen without being injured. The magic of sending the knife has what is called "black three ways", which can be tested to the time (that is, 24 hours); there is also "red three ways", which can be tested to a month. During the period, you can rush to kill the × without hindrance. They call themselves "Red Spear Society" to the outside world, and those who are in charge of the entire society are called "Chairman" or "President"; but internally they call themselves "God Group", and call the chairman "Group Head", and call the teacher of martial arts the commander. The number of people in each association ranges from hundreds to thousands or tens of thousands, but the vast majority are strong and solid farmers. Associations have contact with each other, watch out for each other, and support each other in and out. In short, although his organization and appeal have a color of superstitious theocracy, they are essentially a people's self-defense force. Once they are publicized by the county governments and the political workers of the stationed troops in various places, they will participate in the great war of national resistance and contribute their great potential forces as much as possible. The Red Spear Society in southern Henan and northern Anhui used false surrenders to lure × to gather and annihilate them; Master Hou of Yitiaoshan in southern Shanxi led the masses to assist the Datu army and repeatedly made surprise attacks against × - these are all good examples of the Red Spear Society's heroic resistance to the war.

Also, the mountains and ridges in the border area of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, such as Zijingguan, Nanshan, and Yunxi, were all areas with a heavy banditry in the past. Since the War of Resistance, two or three thousand people have been recruited successively by the authorities, given strict organization and training, and transported to the rear to work. However, Liu Songlin, a well-known bandit who had been entrenched in Longju Village, Shang County, Shaanxi Province, for five or six years, gathered more than 800 bandits and refused to accept orders. He was also attacked by Wen Liangxu, the commissioner of the area, a few days before the reporter passed through Shang County. After a fierce battle for five days and nights, they were all wiped out. Therefore, local transportation has become safe.

The method of digging cave dwellings by the people in this area is very dangerous and strange. They dig living rooms and halls in the inner layers of dangerous cliffs and precipices, layer upon layer, with winding paths leading to secluded places, which can house dozens of households and accommodate hundreds of people. The entire cave dwelling only opens a main door at the top of the mountain, or leaves a passage at the bottom. Strangers ask about it before entering, only to see layers of wall windows with sewage flowing down, often unable to find the door.

These residents who live high on the cliffs and walls, like the residents of the Yungang Mountains and the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, sometimes see opportunities to take advantage of and also engage in robbing passers-by. Because the cave is dark and there are many holes, and there are even grain storage water sources, it is difficult to arrest them after repeated crimes. But in the future, it may be a good base for guerrillas. (To be continued)

### Customs Releases Statistics: China's Foreign Trade, Surplus Increases Daily in Chongqing Occupied Areas, Monthly Surplus in Various Rear Areas

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The Directorate General of Customs has recently released foreign trade statistics for China for the past year, listing the import and export trade of various ports in China. It is divided into two parts, with a one-month unit: "Ports under the control of the Chinese government" and "Ports under Japanese occupation." If a port is still in the hands of the Chinese army this month but falls next month, it will be included in the second part from next month. This way, the actual trade development situation of the "free China" part and the "occupied China" part can be clearly seen. According to the statistics, under the control of the National Government, the deficit in January last year reached approximately £1.34 million. By the end of the year, the average monthly surplus was approximately £240,000. Conversely, in the "occupied areas," the deficit in foreign trade was £400,500 in January last year. After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan in November and December last year, the deficit suddenly increased to approximately £1,192,500 per month. During the past year, imported goods in the "free China" area decreased by approximately 82%. As for the export of goods, the successive fall of commercial ports should have shown a sharp decline, but in fact, the decrease was only 52%. Exports from the "occupied areas" increased by 133%, while imports increased by as much as 192%. The value of exported goods in the table is converted into pounds according to the average exchange rate of the pound each month, so that the relationship between them can be more easily understood. This is because the fluctuations of other currencies were very large last year, and using them as a unit would be more confusing.

### × Exclusive Monopoly, Shipping Industry in China, Establishment of National Shipping Association, Excluding the Influence of Shipping Merchants from Various Countries

### Japanese People Suffer Hardships, Number of Tuberculosis Patients Increases Daily

[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th] Mr. Kiyoshi Yamada of Tokyo recently raised the serious situation of public health in Japan in the Diet, urging members to pay attention. He said that millions of people suffer from lung disease every year, among which 100,000 die from the disease. The infant mortality rate is also extremely high. Japan cannot boast about this matter. The main reason for the large number of tuberculosis patients in Japan is that most of the people cannot obtain nutritious food.

### Japanese Military Factories, Laborers Shrink Back

[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th] In a Diet session one day, someone raised the question of whether the shortage of labor in military factories and similar other government organizations was due to low wages. A representative of the Ministry of the Army strongly stated that there was no shortage of labor and that wages were not low. Last year, the minimum wage for male workers was 38 sen, and the maximum was 6.48 yen. The minimum wage for female workers was 31 sen, and the maximum was 1.56 yen. The average wage was 1.30 yen for male workers and 80 sen for female workers. The average wage for workers in private military factories in Tokyo is about 6 yen (wages are calculated daily). It is heard that the wages of workers manufacturing aircraft engines are the highest. The Japanese military industry will employ 25,000 graduates of elementary schools in Tokyo and 10,000 people from rural areas next month. The main sources are from the eastern and northeastern regions, but there will still be a need for 35,000 child laborers.

### Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Dispute, Japan Hopes to Break the Stalemate, Soviet Union Second Auction of Fishing Areas

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Tokyo Foreign News: A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated this morning that during the fisheries negotiations held in Moscow on the 22nd of this month, Litvinov only made "slight concessions," but this was far from the compromise attitude newly adopted by Japan in the negotiations. However, Japan is still determined to continue consultations with the Soviet Union.

Yu Hanmou, commander-in-chief of the ×× Army Group, upon receiving the report, specially issued a reward of 650 national currency and issued a commendation order. Chairman Li of the Provincial Government, in addition to reporting the participation of the said chief to the central government, also recorded a major merit once and also provided 6,000 yuan in disaster relief funds to Tang County Magistrate to distribute relief funds.

### The Picturesque Yangshuo, Song Zheyuan Recuperates on the Side of Ma'anshan Mountain, Magistrates Zhu and Liu Bury Themselves in Hard Work

It is the season when the rainy season returns to southern China. At the invitation of an international friend stationed in Guilin, I took a break to visit Yangshuo.

Glimpse of Administration

Yangshuo is bounded by the Peng River in the east, and surrounded by layers of green mountains in the west, south, and north. The county town is limited by the mountains and rivers, and its area is probably less than four square li. The population is only over 300 households. Apart from the market days on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of the month, there is no commerce to speak of. Baisha Market, 18 li north of the county town, Fuli Market in the southeast, and Yuping Market, 30-40 li northeast, surround it. These markets have several times more population than the county town and have more lively streets that the county town does not have. They make the county town isolated and desolate. I had several meetings with County Magistrate Zhu Mo and Deputy County Magistrate Liu Biguang. They maintain the simplicity and sincerity of the Guangxi local government officials. The county magistrate, in the past, and even now outside of Guangxi, is still the "hundred-li marquis," the so-called "parent official," but County Magistrate Zhu's monthly salary is 150 Guizhou currency (75 legal tender). Although there is a government-stipulated reward of 1% of the land tax revenue that the county magistrate can receive each year, he is, after all, a county magistrate with countless unavoidable expenses and social engagements. Therefore, he still cannot bring his family from his hometown in Hubei to Yangshuo. Currently, the county government's monthly office expenses are only 200 yuan, and the oil lamp alone costs more than 100 yuan. This forces him to limit the time the local government lights its lamps, and he often tells the clerks to save paper and pens to balance revenue and expenditure. From this, I believe he lives a life of austerity. Yangshuo County is mostly mountainous with few villages. It is a poor fourth-class county. The annual regular and temporary balanced revenue and expenditure is about 120,000 yuan. The largest income is the land tax surcharge. The remaining land surcharge and local product tax account for 30%, and public property income accounts for 10%. Administrative expenses and education expenses each account for 30% of the total expenditure. There is one county high school and 14 central primary schools. There are more than 160 primary schools. According to County Magistrate Zhu, there are no school-age children who are out of school in the county, and adult education is also actively promoted. The number of illiterate people has been reduced to the minimum. Relatively speaking, there are still more illiterate women than men. The reason is that women in Guangxi work longer hours than men. As for the village women in remote and poor mountain valleys, there are more inconveniences in both promoting and accepting education. But broadly speaking, illiteracy can also be said to have been eliminated. A total of more than 1,000 people have been conscripted from the county. There are still more than 17,000 reserve soldiers under the age of 30 and 30,000 people under the age of 40, all of whom have been trained by the village chiefs and know various basic tactics. Deputy County Magistrate Liu is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. His hair is already gray, but he still retains the spirit of a young soldier. I saw him in the rain giving a speech to six companies of militiamen at the public stadium. Those militiamen were recommended by each village, five from each village. They brought their own guns, ammunition, clothing, and food, and came to the county to receive a month of guerrilla warfare training, and then brought what they learned back to teach other community soldiers who had received ordinary military training. When Deputy County Magistrate Liu led me to visit their dormitories, I felt that they got along like family. What impressed me the most was that Yangshuo County now has several guerrilla warfare bases. Those works were completed under the guidance of these two county magistrates and in cooperation with the people.

Visiting Song Zheyuan

In the past, standing at the valley entrance of Ma'anshan Mountain, you could see a large sugarcane field and a native sugar mill on the west bank of the river. Now, part of the sugarcane field is surrounded by a new bamboo fence. Under a few tall palm trees, three-room bungalows are scattered and built on the fields. That is "Jinde New Village." Every resident of Yangshuo knows that it is the villa of General Song Zheyuan. Walking into the gate, bypassing a row of screen-like bamboos, is a small hall. On both sides are the reception room and the garage. As soon as you turn around, you see a guard hanging a box gun and holding the 29th Army's signature broadsword. He handed my business card to Mr. Gao Zihou, Song's chief secretary, and was immediately granted an audience. After ending his mission as Deputy Commander of the First War Zone, Song had recuperated in Nanyue for some time. In the second half of last year, because he loved the mountains and rivers of Yangshuo, he specially bought land and built a house here. Now, he is suffering from mild hemiplegia and can only barely walk in the courtyard. His family is protecting him, politely declining visits from guests. Director Gao is a cautious Shandong native who once served as the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government. We had a very pleasant conversation. They have lived in the north for a long time, and the humid climate in Yangshuo, where they have not seen the sun for months, makes them feel unaccustomed. However, strolling in the mountains and rivers in the morning and evening is also a pleasant pastime after the busy military life. According to Director Gao, "Song recently took up a position as a military committee member in Yangshuo and has telegraphed Chairman Chiang for leave. Once his health recovers, he will go to Chongqing to attend meetings and handle affairs. In addition to Song's wife, sons, daughters, and several secretaries, there are also more than 60 guards. Song sometimes personally gives speeches, hoping that his subordinates will be useful to the country. Song is currently taking Chinese medicine and expects to recover in another month. Song gets up at 8 am every morning and rests at about 10 pm. His daily life consists of writing, reading scriptures, and walking." The new village occupies an area of ​​approximately 30 mu, and the purchase of land cost approximately 1,000 yuan. Although Song cannot live in Yangshuo for a long time, the structure of the houses is still very solid, costing approximately 1,000 yuan each. In the future, he plans to hand over this new village to the county government as a local industry. Song is 56 years old this year. When Director Gao sent me out of the village, I saw him wearing casual clothes, holding a cane, and chatting with his wife and daughter in the yard. He looked very good. Song is very optimistic about the future of the resistance war. He believes that Wu Peifu will never be fooled by others.

### If Germany Invades Again, Britain Will Resolutely Stop It, Chamberlain's Speech Approved by Members, Anglo-French-Soviet Declaration to Be Released Soon

[Reuters, London, 24th] Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons last night about the international situation, saying that the recent actions of the German government have raised the question of whether Germany's future goals will be to control Europe or to make further attempts. On this point, Britain has made a clear statement that if the explanation of Germany proves to be correct and Germany repeats its past actions, it will inevitably cause constant resistance from Britain and other countries to maintain their freedom. As for the consultations with various governments due to the recent developments, the situation cannot be reported. However, I would like to state that if Germany engages in rational development in its export trade, Britain will not hinder it. The British government is extremely unwilling to establish relative barriers in Europe due to different domestic political systems. What we are concerned about is the use of force to threaten independent countries and force them to give up their independence. If this method is put into action, we will do our best to resist this attempt.

[Reuters, London, 24th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a declaration on the international situation in the House of Commons last night. Members of the government party greatly approved of its content and wording, believing that in the current situation, the Prime Minister's declaration is as clear and accurate as possible. Some opposition members also expressed satisfaction with the wording of the declaration. After Chamberlain's declaration, leading members of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party did not raise questions. Zeng Peiwenci did ask a question.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th] According to French political circles, the Anglo-French declaration accusing Germany of violating the agreement will not be released until Friday night after the French Foreign Minister returns from London. According to well-informed sources, the declaration will only be listed by the three powers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, because Poland refused to participate. It is heard that the British capital is advocating for a speedy release.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] According to British sources last night, the Soviet government sent a note to the British Foreign Office yesterday, expressing its agreement to the British proposal for a four-power declaration. At the same time, it was reported that Poland still has some difficulties. It has not been decided whether Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will release the declaration first.

### Hitler Returns Home, Issues Order to Annex Memel, Intentionally Creates a Strong Fortress

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Hitler left Memel at about 4 pm today, first by destroyer, then transferring to the battleship "Deutschland."

[Associated Press, Berlin, 24th] Hitler has issued the following orders for the annexation of Memel: (1) Memel is incorporated into the German Empire; (2) Memel is incorporated into the Gumbinnen district of East Prussia; (3) People of Memel who lost their German nationality in 1924, if they still reside in Memel on March 21, 1939, will be allowed to restore their German nationality; (4) All German laws will be implemented in Memel from May 1; (5) All Prussian laws will be implemented in Memel from May 1; (6) Foreign commercial issues in Memel will be resolved by the German Minister of Interior.

[Reuters, Memel, 23rd] The large-scale advance of German naval and air forces into Memel is seen here as Germany's intention to flaunt its military power to northeastern Europe. According to opinions in political circles, 80% of Lithuania's foreign trade is transported through Memel. Therefore, Germany's influence on Lithuania will greatly increase in the future.

[Haitong News Agency, Memel, 24th] It has spread throughout the city that Germany intends to create a strong fortress in Memel with its navy. Since Hitler's arrival here, by yesterday afternoon, the German warships that have entered the port of Memel include three cruisers, three battleships, eight destroyers, nine torpedo boats, and five transport ships. In addition, there are several minesweepers and mine-laying boats.

[Reuters, Kaunas, 24th] The delegation led by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Mabisic returned here today after signing an agreement in Berlin to return the Memel region to Germany. The Foreign Minister will report on the progress of the situation to the parliament this afternoon.

### Three Aggressor Nations, Organizing a Military Alliance, Resisting the United Democratic Front

[Associated Press, Berlin, 23rd] According to diplomatic circles here, if the anti-Hitler united front in Europe is completed, Germany, Italy, and Japan will take the opportunity to organize a military alliance as retaliation. Nazi sources revealed that negotiations on this goal have long been underway. According to extremely reliable sources, the Anti-Comintern Pact may soon be transformed into a military alliance. [Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] As a result of Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Memel in the past week, the population of Greater Germany has suddenly increased by 10 million people, and its territory has also expanded by 35 million miles. As for where Hitler will move in the future, various rumors are flying around and there is no consensus. The most likely ones are the following: (1) Danzig Free City; (2) The Polish Corridor that separates East Prussia from Germany; (3) Romania, whose food and oil fields are abundant and urgently needed by Germany; (4) Schleswig, which Denmark acquired after the European War; (5) Malmedy and Eupen in Belgium during the war; (6) Swiss border area. It is known that the strength of the German defense forces has greatly increased in the area adjacent to the Swiss border; (7) The two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine in France. Germany had previously stated that it would never demand the return of these two provinces.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 24th] Here is celebrating the return of Memel to Germany with enthusiasm. At the same time, according to well-informed Nazi sources, Hitler will suggest to Mussolini to take the following measures to retaliate against democratic countries: (1) Abrogate the Anglo-German naval agreement; (2) Publish documents obtained from Prague, exposing Britain's attempts to restore Czechoslovakia to its state before the Munich Agreement; (3) Actively promote commerce to resist the activities of Britain and France.

### Slovakia, Signs Selling Body Treaty, Permanently Protected by Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Germany and Slovakia signed a treaty today. According to the treaty, Germany is responsible for protecting the political independence and territorial integrity of Slovakia. German troops have the right to be stationed at any time in a line on the west and east sides of Slovakia (including the eastern foot of the Little Carpathian Mountains, the east of the White Carpathian Mountains, and the eastern foot of the Javorníky Mountains). Slovak customs duties are controlled by Germany, and German imports are duty-free. Military affairs and sovereignty in the above-mentioned areas are completely controlled by the German army. Slovakia will cooperate with the German army to organize its own military forces, and Slovakia's foreign policy should always be in harmony with Germany.

### Belgian Government Refutes Rumors

[Central News Agency, Brussels, 23rd] The two cities of Eupen and Malmedy originally belonged to Germany and were only transferred to Belgium after the European War. Since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, it has been widely rumored that Belgium and Germany have conducted negotiations, and Germany has provided assurances to Belgium, stating that it has no intentions towards those cities. Officials here have recently denied this. The German government solemnly declared on October 13, 1937, that it respects the territorial integrity of this country, and there is no need to conduct negotiations at this time.

[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] According to the "Martin Report" here, as a result of negotiations between Belgium and Germany, Germany has promised Belgium territorial integrity with "certain guarantees." Eupen and Malmedy in eastern Belgium originally belonged to Germany before the war. Germany now claims that it does not want to take them back.

### Fascist Trade Union Conference, Italian King Presides Over Opening Ceremony, Reads Proclamation Explaining Policy

German Press Claims to Support Italian Demands

[Central News Agency, Rome, 23rd] The Fascist Trade Union Council held its opening ceremony this morning. King Emmanuel III personally presided over it and read a proclamation, first stating the process of Italy conquering Abyssinia and establishing the Italian Empire. He continued, "Formerly, the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy, and Italy had no choice but to completely change its foreign policy. Since October 1936, the Italian government has established the closest cooperation with Germany in politics and economics. The Rome-Berlin Axis was announced at that time. This axis is actually vital to the survival of both countries. When the Anti-Comintern Pact was established, the cooperative relationship between Germany and Italy was extended to Japan, Hungary, and other countries. As for Italy's relations with other countries, Italy signed an agreement with Britain on April 16 last year, establishing a good foundation for lasting friendship. We also maintain friendly relations with Albania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Switzerland. As for France, the Italian government notified that country on December 17 last year that it would abolish the Franco-Italian Association of 1935 and explain the various outstanding issues that had temporarily separated the two sides. As for

### Franco's Troops to Enter Madrid; Peace Negotiations Underway; Spanish Civil War Nearing End

[Reuters, Rome, 24th] According to the latest report from Burgos, Franco's troops are scheduled to enter Madrid tomorrow. This morning, Italian newspapers stated that three representatives from the Madrid Defense Council and two representatives from General Franco arrived in Burgos yesterday via commercial aircraft to continue peace negotiations that began in Madrid, aiming for Madrid's immediate surrender to end the war.

[Associated Press, Rome, 24th] According to the "Il Popolo di Roma," a message from Burgos states that a Spanish government military plane landed in Burgos at 10:30 AM on Thursday. Five representatives from Madrid indicated that the government army had agreed to unconditional surrender. Negotiations commenced immediately. The report claims that the representatives included the Western government's Interior Minister and key figures in the Defense Council. They stated that if Franco granted freedom to some leaders of the government army, the government army would proceed with the surrender. Madrid is currently plagued by famine and disease, with 2,000 deaths daily. The newspaper also noted that the government army can only represent Madrid's surrender, as Valencia, Cartagena, and several other key cities have become independent and are no longer under Madrid's command. [Reuters, Burgos, 23rd] According to a Madrid broadcast received here, Madrid is about to surrender to Spain. Italian volunteers fighting in the country are exceptionally brave and have made significant contributions. From now on, cooperation should be maximized. While not believing that peace can last forever, it is hoped that it can be maintained as much as possible. One point must be stated: the expansion of Italian military preparations cannot lag behind others. Regarding the financial situation, although there have been difficulties in the past, they have been overcome step by step thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. We must know that maintaining economic independence is a necessary condition for maintaining political independence. Therefore, we must strive to break free from foreign constraints economically. The King concluded by saying that he had great faith in the fate of Italy and was willing to encourage the people.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The "Frankfurter Zeitung" reported tonight that Italy's demands for French colonies will be "more aggressive than before," and Germany considers all of Italy's important demands to be as important as Germany's own. If necessary, the two countries will fight together, but the newspaper hopes that Italy can achieve a satisfactory resolution without resorting to war.

### Hungarian Foreign Minister's Speech: Intends to Conduct Friendly Negotiations with Romania

[Associated Press, Budapest, 24th] The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated at the Hungarian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee that Hungary is prepared to conduct friendly negotiations with Romania to establish an embassy in Romania through peaceful means. However, he mentioned that Romania did not show a friendly attitude when Hungarian troops occupied Ruthenia, mobilizing a large army. In contrast, Yugoslavia held a friendly attitude. He also stated that the Hungarian-Romanian dispute is entirely over Transylvania in eastern Romania, which was originally Hungarian territory but was ceded to Romania after the war.

### Germany and Romania Sign New Agreement; Everything Enters German Control; Cooperation with Democratic Countries Interrupted

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] A report from Bucharest states that the new German-Romanian agreement covers a wide range of areas. The main issues of the new agreement are the development of Romania's resources (especially in agriculture) and the supply of industrial equipment. It is expected to expand Romania's production, with grains, oil-producing plants, and hemp as the main products. Germany will supply machinery, and German-Romanian companies will jointly exploit copper, manganese, and lead mines, and establish iron alumina and copper alum industries. A German-Romanian company will also be organized to improve oil production and determine distribution methods. The two countries will adjust their respective industries, establish free zones, and build warehouses in the free zones to store German goods. The agreement includes the supply of armaments to Romania's army, navy, and air force. The agreement will come into effect one month after it is formally signed by the two countries and will expire on March 31, 1944. Unless an objection is raised one year before the expiration date, the agreement will continue indefinitely, with each term being four years. If one party wishes to terminate the agreement, it must notify the other party one year before the expiration of the four-year term.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 23rd] Germany has notified Romania that the armaments and ammunition ordered from the Skoda Works in Bohemia before Germany annexed Czechoslovakia will still be delivered on time.

[Associated Press, Bucharest, 23rd] The German-Romanian commercial agreement was formally signed at 5:30 PM today. The German side made extensive and unprecedented concessions to Romania, solemnly stating that Germany has no ambition to control Romania's economy. The agreement is valid until 1944 and aims to establish reciprocal facilities between the economies of the two countries, designate several free zones for Germany to organize transportation companies and warehouses, develop Romania's production, and increase Germany's imports. It is believed here that Romania's cooperation with democratic countries has been interrupted and that it has fallen under German control.

[Associated Press, London, 23rd] It is believed here that the German-Romanian commercial agreement has caused Romania to lose its political, military, and economic independence and fall under German control.

### Czech Consul in Columbus Refuses to Hand Over Consulate

[Reuters, Columbus, 23rd] The Czech consul here, a British national, refuses to hand over the Czech consulate to the German authorities, arguing that Britain has not recognized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia.

### British Trade Delegation Arrives in Moscow Last Night; Hudson and Litvinov Hold First Meeting Last Night

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 24th] British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson led a British commercial delegation to Moscow and visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov last night for the first meeting.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] The British trade delegation, led by Overseas Trade Minister Hudson, arrived in Moscow today from Warsaw. The Soviet side believes that the economic negotiations also have significant political implications. The recent establishment of the Soviet-Polish trade agreement indicates that Poland has changed its policy due to the increasingly fierce German aggression.

### Hungarian Troops Enter Slovakia; Fierce Fighting for a Day, Casualties on Both Sides; Joint Committee Formed for Resolution; German Officials Do Not Overemphasize This

[Associated Press, Budapest, 24th] The Hungarian government has issued a communique stating that Hungarian troops have occupied several areas in the Encs Valley on the border between Ruthenia and Slovakia, with the aim of protecting the railway leading north to the Polish border. The communique also confirms that Hungarian troops had local conflicts with Slovak troops in Slovak territory for about a day, stating that a joint committee has been formed by both sides to resolve the issue and determine the permanent border.

[Associated Press, Budapest, 23rd] A communique was issued here in response to Slovakia's protest, stating that the Hungarian government has agreed to conduct an immediate investigation. However, since the Slovak border has never been clearly defined, it is possible that local conflicts occurred between the two armies. It is denied that Hungarian military action was instigated by Germany, which is unfounded.

[Associated Press, Bratislava, 23rd] Hungarian troops invaded Slovak territory today, attempting to occupy a strip of land about fifteen miles wide. Slovak troops and the Hlinka Guard, along with large bomber formations, fiercely resisted. According to reports, Hungary's move was approved by Hitler. Hungarian troops attacked Slovak territory in three routes, and the Slovak troops retreated to the second line of defense and worked hard to counterattack. It is reported that the Hungarian troops have been repelled. The Slovak Minister of Defense issued a communique stating, "According to a report from the Commander-in-Chief of the Slovak Defense Forces at 2:30 PM, the Hungarian attack has been contained." Hungarian troops have now advanced 13.5 miles. According to military sources, the Hungarian troops clearly want to advance to Iberyes and directly threaten the Polish border. Slovakia has filed protests with Germany and Italy, demanding that the two countries force Hungary to abide by the border. It is also known that Hungarian troops have used tanks and various armaments.

[Associated Press, Bratislava, 23rd] The Slovak government has lodged a strong protest with the Hungarian government regarding the Hungarian military's invasion of Slovak territory. The protest states that the Hungarian military's aggression is an act that completely violates all treaty obligations and is contrary to the Hungarian government's original intention to recognize Slovakia, demanding the immediate withdrawal of Hungarian troops.

[Reuters, Budapest, 23rd] Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky has responded to Slovakia's protest regarding territorial encroachment, agreeing to immediately investigate the truth of the matter and stating that the lack of a defined border on the eastern side of Slovakia may be the main cause of the dispute. Csaky denied reports of Hungarian military action in Slovak territory and said that the rumor that Hungary's move was instructed by Germany is completely unfounded.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] According to news from the Slovak capital, the Slovak government has announced that Hungarian troops have entered eastern Slovakia.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] According to the latest news, the response caused by the entry of Hungarian troops into Slovakia is more serious in nature than initially anticipated.

[Reuters, Czech Republic, 23rd] The Slovak capital has protested to Budapest regarding the Hungarian military's violation of territory, demanding a satisfactory response within a few hours, and has also reported the situation to Berlin, but it is not known whether it has requested German military assistance. At the same time, Slovak troops have begun to resist the invasion, and the two armies have begun to engage, with casualties on both sides. Aircraft were discovered in the skies over Barad, but no bombs were dropped.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] German officials do not place much emphasis on reports of Hungarian troops invading Slovak territory. It is reported that Hungarian troops crossed the border into certain areas to stabilize Ruthenia. Although the Czechs call it soil, it is still questionable, and it is said that the same trial occurred when German troops occupied the Sudetenland.

[Reuters, Budapest, 24th] Slovakia has declared that Hungarian troops have invaded its border and has suggested establishing a joint border committee. Hungary has responded, issuing a communique today stating that Hungarian troops have occupied several locations west of the Uzh River in Ruthenia to ensure the safety of the railway. The border between Ruthenia and Slovakia has never been properly demarcated.

Brief Commentary

### Save Our Overseas Chinese Compatriots in Siam

According to a Hong Kong report from Minzhong News Agency today, the Siamese government is heavily levying registration certificate fees, forcing many overseas Chinese to return to their homeland. Another group arrived in Hong Kong yesterday aboard the Nanmei vessel, heading back to their native places. According to their accounts, under the current government's [censored], life for overseas Chinese is extremely difficult.

Ever since [censored] fascist forces have been steadily penetrating Siam, the Siamese government has, in recent years, repeatedly promulgated various [censored] measures against the overseas Chinese. Not long ago, they even conducted large-scale arrests of overseas Chinese, something that overseas compatriots must still have painful memories of. Whether intentional or unintentional, this policy of serving the [censored] aggressors harms our overseas compatriots and, given the historical position and economic importance of the overseas Chinese in Siam, the Siamese government itself suffers damages as well.

We hope that our government will quickly engage in stern and forceful negotiations with the Siamese government to ensure that the legitimate rights of our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam are not trampled upon again. At the same time, we further hope that our overseas missions can be effectively strengthened to genuinely protect the legitimate lives and activities of our overseas compatriots in various regions.

### Congratulations on the Official Opening of the Chongqing-Hami Air Route

The Chongqing-Hami air route, which has been in preparation for a long time, was officially launched yesterday. If the weather remains stable, the Ministry of Communications' "Lanzhou" aircraft will fly to Hami today. At the same time, Soviet aircraft are also scheduled to leave Alma-Ata yesterday to fly to Hami. This marks the first official flight of the new Sino-Soviet air route. In addition to celebrating this new success in wartime transportation, we should recognize its significant economic, cultural, and even political implications. Therefore, we dare to anticipate even closer cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union in the future, to jointly oppose [censored] in the Far East and to lay the foundation for world peace. We must do our best to secure this [censored] air route, and we must also make every effort to develop new ground routes!

### Schuster's Travelogue (Continued and Concluded)

Regarding the future of Greater Ukraine, Frosson cautiously said: They are conducting a large-scale competition to realize the dream they made in 1918. Although that [censored] dream vanished within weeks, Hitler was indeed their friend, and the racial principles established by the Munich Conference are their charter. But they do not want to be tools of Germany. Britain was also a common enemy with the Bolsheviks, so why can't they be friends with them?

Youth in Training

If the President is gentle and philosophical, then in the "Sick" concentration camp, we can discover a completely different spirit. Here, children of all levels are being trained in Ukrainian history and culture. To the extent possible, they are also taught to use military weapons. Every training method is full of lively military spirit. When we went in to visit, in the dormitory, a large bread warehouse was covered with a lovely floral patterned woolen cloth. The young people sang discordant songs, starting with Nazi-style singing, but later sounding more like better-sounding Ukrainian hymns.

It is said that 12,000 people are being trained in batches every month, of which 2,000 are in Schuster's camp. Some of the young people, who formed the most resilient and courageous part of the concentration camp, still carried the habits of farmers. According to my guide, they were specially recruited from the eastern border region to deal with any eventuality that might come. If the Czech government insisted on appointing Czechs to the Schuster government as administrative officers, my friend said: "We will absolutely not tolerate such officers, we do not want to be ruled by foreigners."

The "Sick" camp's loyalty to the new and expected nation is very fervent. The stories of the oppression of the people in Soviet Ukraine are told vividly, but not in detail. In fact, I found it almost impossible to get the truth about what happened outside the Russian border, even if you tried every method and asked repeatedly from the Baltic states and Romania. What the "Sick" camp hates, and increasingly hates, is the Hungarians, the Poles, and the Bolsheviks; for the latter, they hate not only their "godless communism" but also the long-term oppression of them by the Russians in history. They also mentioned Maizibo.

I am sorry that I did not linger long and immediately took the road to the Czech capital. The nearest station to it is about 186 miles away. Of course, there are already trains there, but the Poles and Hungarians have blocked the railway traffic, and now it is being replaced by state-owned buses. In the bus I was riding in, the passengers were very crowded, about fifteen people were sitting and eight people were standing.

After traveling twenty-five miles on poor ground, the engine showed signs of difficulty in continuing to move forward. Therefore, we took turns getting off the bus and waiting by the side of the road, and the bus disappeared immediately. Every time a truck passed by, two or three passengers would ask to get on the truck. I was unable to follow them, and I was alone. Without a word of Russian, Slovak, or Ukrainian to help me, the situation was very embarrassing. Finally, a truck brought the last few of us to a small town.

A Discontinuous Bountiful Meal

The stationmaster I asked bluntly refused me. Knowing that I was British, he lifted his nose from the two pots filled with meat and sweet potatoes, stood up straight, and said to me in a very fierce posture and with many gestures that even if I stood there and did not leave, he would not lift a finger to help me. He was really too much. The railway he managed was blocked by the Poles and Hungarians, and he could only allow small motorcycles to run over very short distances. His regulated life had become a mess.

I wandered on the road, asking everyone: "Do you speak German?" But after asking for a long time, there was no one. In addition, there was one noteworthy thing - the drummer on the [street] summoned many people to listen to current affairs reports. Then I encountered some seemingly miraculous things. Someone, in answering my question, told me that there was a missionary in this town, and then pointed to me and said: "It is him". This is how I met McGrath, Alexander, who was from Soufloux and came here to help the refugees.

We started together in a small car. The driver was eager to do business and squeezed two more passengers on. There were five people sitting in total. After a while, driven by profit, he couldn't help but stop to solicit a sixth person, he opened the door and waited. Suddenly, a state-owned public well [bus] drove by and broke the open door and footboard, and half of the side [of the car] was destroyed. But this was an extremely fortunate opportunity, because this caused the bus to stop, and Mr. McGrath kindly asked the driver to take me to the army.

From then on, we forged ahead towards Slovakia's Bransa, we got off in the dark from time to time to reduce the weight of the car so that it could pass over the softer ground, or to tow the truck that was stuck in the mud. Fifteen hours after leaving Schuster, I arrived in Bransa. The joy derived from the unwavering experience had completely disappeared at this time, because a German, Slovak, for the sake of pleasing other passengers, threw a long and venomous speech on the unfair trial in Vienna at me, he believed that the British were responsible for this matter.

### Siamese Government Heavily Levies Registration Fees; Overseas Compatriots Forced to Return to Their Homeland in Increasing Numbers; Hundreds Have Been Expelled in the Past Month; Another Group Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday; Do Not Lightly Journey Southward Given the Inability to Make a Living Under [Censored]

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Siamese authorities recently amended the Foreigners Registration Ordinance, increasing the burdens on our overseas compatriots and implementing harsh restrictions on the export of overseas children, making it impossible for overseas Chinese to gain a foothold in Siam. Recently, many local overseas compatriots have been expelled and returned to their homeland due to being unable to bear the heavy burdens. Over the past month, ships arriving in Hong Kong from Siam have carried deported overseas compatriots returning home. Statistics show that the number has reached hundreds. Yesterday, the 23rd, another group of Siamese overseas Chinese returned to their homeland aboard the Taikoo Shipping Company's American South vessel, arriving in Hong Kong to wait for ships to return to their original hometown of Shantou. A reporter had an interview to discuss the difficult living conditions of overseas Chinese in Siam after the promulgation of the new regulations, which are recorded below,

The Burdens on Overseas Chinese are Increasing

It is claimed that the Siamese government authorities, through the Ministry of Interior's amended Foreigners Registration Ordinance, stipulated that all foreign residents in Siam, adults, regardless of gender, must pay a registration fee of four baht per year. When the news spread, the entire overseas community was shocked. The Siamese government, since the appointment of Finance Minister Panpalit, had abolished the public service fee from next year, and the general poor overseas compatriots were feeling relieved, but the Siamese government has this registration fee collection, which will make the general poor overseas compatriots feel as burdened as the public service fee. The public service fee was five baht per person per year, but women did not have to pay, while the foreigners' registration fee is not like this. Therefore, if a small family has several parents, brothers, wives and children, they will have to pay dozens of baht a year. This is not a problem for the rich, but the general poor overseas compatriots feel even more difficult. Moreover, most women do not have productive capacity, so paying this fee of four baht, no [censored] added to men, at a time of difficult life and extreme environmental pressure, this unexpected burden is really difficult to cope with.

Poor Overseas Compatriots Forced to Return Home

It is found that overseas residents in migration, the Chinese are the most. Although there are no formal statistics at present, there should be at least 2 million people. Apart from children and disabled people, if each person pays four baht a year, the government will increase its revenue by 10 million baht a year, the large number of which cannot be taken lightly. Moreover, the ordinance also stipulates that any foreigner who is unable to pay this four-baht fee will be treated as a vagrant and deported. At present, the date of implementation of the ordinance is imminent, so most of the poor overseas compatriots feel that it is difficult to cope with and are forced to return home. It is believed that in the future [censored] many others will return home.

Overseas Compatriots Note: Do Not Lightly Journey South

Recently, news came from Siam that the Siamese government will amend the Immigration Law Enforcement Act, and the foreigners' entry tax will be reduced from 200 baht to 100 baht. However, according to various speculations, reducing the entry fee by 100 baht will not increase the number of overseas compatriots going to Siam. The first reason [censored] is that in the current environment, if you enter without a suitable job, you will be regarded as a vagrant and deported. Second, making a living here is not easy. Even if you can land as desired, the subsequent life problem is difficult to solve. Third, the Teochew and Swatow area is now very peaceful and the people can live and work in peace, so there is no need to go abroad. Fourth, the inspection of trachoma is very strict. If you manage to raise a sum of money after repeated preparations in the countryside, but end up being turned away when you arrive in Siam, the result is wasted money and time. The past experience has made many overseas compatriots hesitate to go forward. For these reasons, it is believed that although the Siamese government has reduced the entry fee, the number of overseas compatriots going to Siam will not increase. However, it is found that there are many speculative water passengers in Hong Kong who are luring villagers in the countryside to journey south. It is hoped that the relevant overseas groups here will send letters to those in charge of overseas affairs in the country to explain the Siamese environment to those who are journeying south, so as to avoid unnecessary losses. Otherwise, it is feared that there will be a large number of unkempt and ragged overseas compatriots being deported at the port of Siam.

### French Ambassador to China to Arrive in Hong Kong Today, Will Stay Briefly Before Visiting Shanghai and Tianjin for Inspection

According to sources from the French Consulate in Hong Kong, the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, along with his entourage, will arrive in Hong Kong from Haiphong aboard the French postal ship "Guangdong." They are expected to arrive around the 27th of this month. After a brief stay in Hong Kong, the ambassador will transfer to Shanghai to inspect the current situation of the French Concession in Shanghai. After completing his official duties in Shanghai, he will also visit Tianjin. The purpose of his mission is to investigate French commercial goods in North China, as the French government is particularly concerned about the situation following the announcement of the abolition of the legal tender by the puppet regime in North China.

### Hong Kong Fire Insurance Company Held Annual Meeting Yesterday; Profit of 490,000 Last Year; Lo Man-kam and Others Appointed as Advisory Committee Members

The Hong Kong Fire Insurance Company held its 70th annual meeting yesterday morning in the boardroom of Jardine Matheson & Co. Chairman Landale, in his report, stated that before proceeding with the normal proceedings, he would like to express the regret of the management and advisory committee members regarding Sir Robert Ho Tung's resignation from his position as an advisory committee member. Sir Robert Ho Tung has guided the company for many years, but due to health reasons, he is unable to continue his service. He requested that sincere gratitude be expressed to him and wished him good health. In addition, it is gratifying to inform everyone that Mr. Lo Man-kam has agreed to accept our invitation to succeed Sir Robert Ho Tung as an advisory committee member of the company. Regarding the financial report, he stated that the profit for the previous year (1937) was $495,866. It is now recommended to pay a dividend of $12 per share, totaling $480,000, and to transfer $15,866 to the insurance fund. The aforementioned surplus cannot be considered small. The typhoon that hit Hong Kong in September of that year resulted in considerable compensation losses for the company. In the past year (1938), there were already $762,452, an increase of approximately $46,000 compared to the same period in the previous year (1937), making it the third-best year in the company's history. Due to the blockade of many ports in China, significant losses were incurred. These unfavorable factors are what I must particularly emphasize. Previously, the business income from places like Guangzhou and Hankou was quite good, but now it has become a drain on resources. The business in Shanghai should still be maintained, but when the earnings are converted to Hong Kong dollars, the loss has reached 75%. The insurance industry, like other industries, naturally has its difficulties during this period. The financial report presented by the chairman was passed by Stephenson and others. The proposal to elect Biass, lawyer Lo Man-kam, Brown, Kinton, Degre, and Williamson as advisory committee members was passed by Armitage and others.

### Coal Worker Tragically Buried Alive on the Sandana En Route from Japan to Hong Kong

Body Discovered Several Days After Death, Already Decomposed

The ironclad steamship "Sandana" arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Kobe, Japan. En route, a decomposed corpse was discovered in the coal bunker, having been crushed to death. It was determined that the ship had taken on coal in Lukmun on its way north before heading to Kobe. Upon arrival in Kobe, a report was received stating that a coal worker had gone missing during the coal loading process. It was suspected that he had stowed away on the ship, and a full search of the ship was conducted, but to no avail. Later, on Sunday, en route from Kobe to Hong Kong, a cook noticed a foul odor emanating from the coal bunker. Upon opening the bunker for inspection, a corpse was discovered, crushed in the coal. The coal was immediately removed, and it took nine hours to extract the corpse, which had already begun to decompose. The matter was reported to the Japanese consul. It was also determined that on the previous voyage from Calcutta to Hong Kong, a cook had died of illness on board and was given a sea burial.

### Kowloon Robbers Becoming Increasingly Rampant; Westerner's Residence on Prince Edward Road Robbed; Three Robbers Claimed to Be Delivering Goods, Tricking Their Way Into the House; Over a Thousand Dollars in Gold Jewelry Stolen; One Suspect Arrested

In Kowloon, armed robbery cases have been occurring frequently recently, causing unrest among the residents. The local residents' association has sent a letter to the police authorities, requesting that more detectives be dispatched to maintain law and order. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a Westerner's residence on Prince Edward Road was again tricked into being robbed, resulting in a loss of over a thousand dollars. The homeowner was also injured. One suspect has been arrested after the incident, and two robbers are at large. The police are stepping up their investigation. The details are as follows:

Tricked Their Way In

The victim was Mrs. Kammis, a Westerner residing at 194 Prince Edward Road, Ground Floor. Mrs. Kammis had been living in Shanghai and only moved to Hong Kong last month. She employs a maid, Guo Liu (37 years old), to assist with household chores. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Mrs. Kammis went out, leaving only Guo at home. Suddenly, the doorbell rang loudly. Guo listened and asked who it was. A man outside the door, holding a package, said that he was a partner from a certain restaurant and was delivering food. Guo, suspecting no foul play, opened the door and let him in. As soon as the door opened, three large men rushed in, all holding sharp knives. They threatened Guo and forbade her from making any noise. They then tied up Guo and gagged her before proceeding to search the house.

Homeowner Wounded by Knife

The robbers were in the house for about 30 minutes. Mrs. Kammis happened to finish her errands and returned home, ringing the doorbell. The robbers heard the sound, remained calm, and prepared for a fight. They opened the door and let her in. As soon as Mrs. Kammis stepped inside, one of the robbers lunged forward to subdue her. Seeing that the situation was not good, Mrs. Kammis turned and ran out, shouting for help. The robber also chased after her and engaged in a struggle. During the struggle, Mrs. Kammis's right finger was cut by the robber's knife, causing blood to flow profusely. She shouted "Robbers!" The three robbers, realizing that they had been exposed and that they had already plundered enough, abandoned Mrs. Kammis and fled in different directions. While Mrs. Kammis was struggling with the robbers, Guo Liu, who was inside, managed to untie the ropes and ran out to help.

One Suspect Apprehended

Xu Song, a partner at the Milk Company branch at 188 Prince Edward Road, suddenly heard the robbery and ran out from the store. By the time he reached Flower Market, two robbers had already disappeared. The remaining robber threw away the knife he was carrying in an attempt to escape, but was caught by Xu and others. They immediately called the police. The police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to investigate. They took the suspect to the police station and sent Mrs. Kammis to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was not serious and there was no major problem. The stolen gold jewelry included a platinum brooch with 30 diamonds, valued at $500, a diamond-studded platinum women's wristwatch, valued at $300, and other miscellaneous items, for a total loss of $1,087.80.

### Smallpox Spreading Alarmingly! Medical Director Urges Residents to Get Vaccinated Quickly

Nearly Two Thousand Died of Smallpox Last Year

The spread of smallpox is alarming. The uneven climate of spring is a cause for concern. It is already a matter of indifference whether one is infected. If one is infected, only one in four can be treated by doctors and regain their health. Therefore, the Hong Kong health authorities are paying special attention to this matter. Director of Medical Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke, issued a notice yesterday urging residents not to neglect the matter and to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The original text of the notice reads: "In 1938, 2,327 Hong Kong residents contracted smallpox, and 1,811 died as a result. That is, three out of four died. Infants and young children accounted for three-fifths of these cases. Even those who were fortunate enough to survive often had pockmarked faces or even lost their sight. If everyone could be vaccinated and take precautions in advance, this would not happen. You must protect yourselves and your families and get vaccinated quickly. Those who have not been vaccinated within three years should also be revaccinated. Do not delay until tomorrow, as tomorrow may be too late, and you will regret it. If you wish to be vaccinated, you can go to any government hospital, public medical bureau in each district, the Port Health Office at 11 Ice House Street, or the vaccination clinic at the Naval Office on Connaught Road to request vaccination. It is free of charge."

### Increase in Heavy Oil Tax to Be Implemented; Gasoline Prices to Soar; Mixed-Brand Oil Has Become a Rare Commodity and Is Gradually Disappearing from the Market

Following the publication in the Gazette a few days ago that the Hong Kong tax authorities will request the Legislative Council to raise the tax rate on heavy oil to be equal to that of light oil, general gasoline merchants are well aware that this is inevitable. They are treating the original mixed-brand oil (i.e., gasoline distilled from kerosene residue) as a rare commodity. In the market this month, there has been very little retail sale. Currently, the market prices of genuine oil from the three major companies, Mobil, Texaco, and Asiatic Petroleum Company, have also remained firm. The latest market price is $1.05 per gallon, but the listed price is $1.10. According to experienced gasoline merchants, although the Hong Kong tax authorities' move to raise the heavy oil tax to be equal to that of gasoline is intended to protect the operating profit margin of the three major companies, the reduced competition will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in gasoline prices in the future. It is expected that there will be a considerable increase in two weeks. No wonder mixed-brand oil is being regarded as a rare commodity.

### Central Government Considers People's Hardships; Tax Exemption for Imported Rice Confirmed; Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce and Others Hurry to Purchase Rice to Be Shipped to the Mainland for Price Stabilization

Gu Yiqun in Hong Kong Planning Food Relief

The rice shortage in Guangdong Province is severe. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are concerned about their hometowns and have repeatedly petitioned the authorities to exempt imported rice from import duties. Until a few days ago, it was rumored in Hong Kong that the Ministry of Finance had approved the tax-free import of 1.2 million metric tons of imported rice. The distribution method was said to be 700,000 metric tons for Shantou, 200,000 metric tons for Jiangmen, and the remaining 300,000 metric tons for public use. As reported earlier, there was no explicit confirmation, which led various overseas Chinese organizations to be skeptical. The Chaozhou Eight-Counties Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong sent a telegram to the Shantou Chamber of Commerce yesterday to inquire about everything. Last night, they received a telegram from Qiong, stating that "the tax-free quota for Shantou is confirmed," proving that the above rumors were not groundless. Yesterday, relevant overseas Chinese organizations such as the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, Heshan Chamber of Commerce, and Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce have begun purchasing rice to be shipped to the mainland for price stabilization. It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Councilor Chen Shouming yesterday, stating that regarding the case of purchasing and transporting imported rice to Guangdong Province, the Executive Yuan has approved the tax-free import of 700,000 metric tons of imported rice through Shantou and 200,000 metric tons of imported rice through Jiangmen. Rice merchants are free to purchase and transport the rice, with August of this year as the period for tax-free imported rice. The Guangdong Provincial Government will supervise the rice merchants to sell the rice at a fair price to prevent speculation. For the above-mentioned tax-free imported rice, the foreign exchange required for the rice purchase should be raised by the shipping merchants themselves. Gu Yiqun, Director of the Guangdong Finance Bureau and President of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, flew to Hong Kong from Chongqing after the closing of the Provincial and Local Finance Conference. He has been in Hong Kong for many days. It is said that in addition to inspecting and reorganizing the Provincial Bank and its branches, Gu is also paying attention to the food relief situation in the province. He will stay in Hong Kong for several more days to plan everything before returning to Shaoguan.

### Fanling Races Scheduled for Tomorrow

The Fanling Race Club is holding races at the Fanling Racecourse tomorrow (Sunday) to raise funds for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. The St. John Lottery for the fourth race has already sold over 40,000 tickets. In recent days, people have been flocking to the top floor of 17 Connaught Road Central to purchase tickets. The situation is very lively. It is unknown who will win the first prize of over 20,000 dollars. It is also heard that many people have purchased package tickets. The Hong Kong Jockey Club will be open as usual this afternoon, Saturday, to meet the demands of the people of Hong Kong.

### YMCA to Hold Choral Music and Sports Meet Tomorrow at Blake Garden

The YMCA has been organizing singing classes, connecting students from various schools and promising youths, to practice singing. This singing class has been held for five sessions, with each session divided into six teams. Each team has about 300 people, and the total number of people in the six teams is over 2,000. They are now gathering to perform in order to allow all sectors to review their progress, stimulate the students' interest in physical education, and seek to strengthen their physique. A choral music and sports meet will be held at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month (Sunday) at Blake Garden on Tai Ping Shan, Sheung Wan. At the same time, they will take an oath to fulfill the public covenant of people. The order of the sports meet will focus on group games, and the association's scout troop, fitness class, and children's association will participate in the performances. The singing competition for the singing class will be particularly rich in content.

### [Long Live China]!

— Qi Zhuo

Performed by True Light Girls' Middle School at the YMCA Last Night

[Our Correspondent's Special] Under the slogan of "Long Live China," the auditorium of the YMCA was crowded with a large group of admirers and pursuers of "Long Live China."

This time, True Light Girls' Middle School performed "Long Live China" to expand salvation and propaganda and promote drama movement. Therefore, tickets were not charged and all sectors were allowed to freely request coupons to visit. This is necessary under the urgent requirement of "in-depth propaganda" and "popularization of drama".

At seven o'clock last night, the lights flashed and the curtain was drawn, and more than a thousand pairs of eyes were all concentrated on the stage. A three-act national defense drama with profound significance changed and proceeded on the tortuous plot.

The scenery, lighting and makeup are quite exquisite. It's just that the night scene of the third act, for a while, was so dark that the audience couldn't see it at all. I don't know if it was intentional or unintentional. In short, the quiet order was also disrupted in an instant.

Each actor's lines are very well prepared, and everyone is very focused and hardworking. The only shortcoming is that girls play male roles in terms of appearance, words, and actions. There are many places that need to be exerted, but they are not strong enough. This is an inevitable problem for general girls' schools to perform dramas. It also tells us a very simple truth: male roles should be played by men, and female roles should be played by women. Drama is originally a manifestation of real life, and it is not easy to imitate the real thing vividly and vividly.

The plot of the prologue in the first act did not leave any special impression. In the second act, when revolutionary groups collectively criticized, jointly planned, and struggled with × people, they gradually became nervous. At the same time, in addition to drama propaganda, it can also receive the side effects of promoting collectivism and self-education.

The war scene with × people in the third act was very tense, but unfortunately the performance ××××× was not strong enough and not realistic enough. It was really too preferential to × people. If men and women were to perform together, this act would definitely have greater gains. In the end, our army exchanged the freedom and liberation of the Chinese nation with a heroic sacrifice. At ××××××, our great and brilliant national flag fluttered!

——Everyone stood up to salute in joy!

The majestic and moving song of salvation sent the guests out of the venue in droves. A touched heart was still beating nervously!

### Hong Kong Women's Great Solidarity: A Review of Women's United Work – Let us Expand Women's National Salvation Work with Collective Wisdom and Effort!

— Luo Xia

The overseas Chinese women residing in the bustling and extravagant Hong Kong, influenced by the prevailing atmosphere, have earned a well-known name both domestically and internationally: "Miss Hong Kong." Foreign friends often consider them interesting figures to discuss. However, the cannons of the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident shattered their illusion and propelled them to participate in various national salvation efforts, contributing what they should to the arduous War of Resistance against Japan. This proves that Hong Kong women are not merely individuals who indulge in frivolous entertainment and adornment; they are equally capable of performing the work that daughters of the motherland can do!

Following closely on the heels of the Lugou Bridge Incident that initiated the War of Resistance, the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association was established. Many of its members were renowned women from Beijing and Shanghai residing in Hong Kong, as well as leaders in Hong Kong's women's circles. The president was Madam Chen Shuying, wife of Sun Ke, and the chairperson was Madam Zhang Leyi, wife of Song Ziwen. Subsequently, the China Women's War Disaster Relief Association, presided over by Madam Liu Qingxuan, wife of Tan Shifan, and the Hong Kong branch of the Women's Work Committee of the Guangdong New Life Movement Promotion Association, presided over by Madam Ma Fengqi, wife of Wu Tiecheng, along with other women's national salvation organizations, were also established one after another, actively participating in national salvation work. This truly reflects a shining moment for Hong Kong women. Due to the public's enthusiastic expectations for women's national salvation organizations, everyone further demanded that they unite swiftly to achieve more significant and effective results. However, this proposal ultimately failed to materialize due to environmental obstacles.

Not long after, the Women's Comfort Association, the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, the Women's New Life Movement Association, and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), four women's national salvation organizations, united due to the needs of their work and formed the Four Women's Joint Association. They decided to hold joint meetings every two weeks to exchange ideas, enabling them to maximize the effectiveness of their collaborative efforts. During the first joint meeting, Madam He Xiangning attended and proposed three pressing issues that needed to be resolved: promoting domestic goods, training cadres, and actively advancing the women's labor literacy movement. Later, the formation of the Domestic Goods Promotion Group, the holding of the Domestic Goods Exhibition, the establishment of the Four Women's Propaganda Training Classes, and other meaningful initiatives can all be said to have originated from this association.

On the Double Tenth Festival of the 26th year (of the Republic, 1937), a commemoration was held at the South China Athletic Association Stadium on Caroline Hill, with the participation of over twenty organizations and thirty schools, creating a lively atmosphere. Subsequently, the commemoration of the March 8th International Women's Day and the March 12th memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the 27th year (1938) achieved excellent results. These were all initiatives promoted by the core members of the Four Women's Joint Association.

Following closely the unfolding of the war, the Wartime Children's Relief Association of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Soldiers Fighting Against Japan was established in Wuhan, providing shelter for all orphans of soldiers and homeless children in war zones. Branches were established one after another in various places. The General Association then sent Madam He Xiangning, Madam Wang Xiaoying, and Madam Hu Mulan to collaborate with the Women's Joint Association to begin preparing for the Hong Kong branch. By mid-May, preparations were declared complete, and relief work gradually unfolded. The first home in Yuen Long, as well as the second and third branch homes, were established one after another, sheltering Guangzhou refugee children who had escaped from the bombing flames, as well as refugee children and infants from Hankou. Currently, the new site for the relief home is under urgent construction and is expected to be completed soon. In the future, it will continue to shelter refugee children from war zones and preserve the national spirit, training future warriors for the new China. This should be a special contribution to the motherland!

During May of last year, the enemy crazily bombed residential areas in Guangzhou and the transportation lines of the Yuehan and Guangjiu railways. Corpses of citizens were exposed for miles, and homes were reduced to ruins. Those who were spared from the brutality fled to the countryside or came to Hong Kong in droves. Along the skirts of the roads, refugees wandered and lost their homes, belonging to the roads. As a result, the Four Women's Joint Association, together with various organizations in Hong Kong, promoted and organized the Hong Kong All-Circles Joint Relief Association for South China Refugees, providing relief to refugees in various parts of South China and Guangzhou, especially those provinces that suffered from enemy bombings. The recipients benefited the most. The number of medical supplies provided to various ambulance teams and service groups was also not insignificant. In addition, on the anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance Against Japan and National Founding last year, a vegetarian food fair was held; on the anniversary of the August 13th Songhu War of Resistance, a donation drive was held; and the charitable sales and donations of street vendors also emerged at this time. This movement caused a sensation throughout the country and was extremely enthusiastic. Following that, there was the large-scale flag donation campaign during the Mid-Autumn Festival of the 27th year (1938). These were all meaningful activities that caught the public's eye. In these activities, women's organizations contributed significantly.

At this time, on the war front, the enemy was fiercely attacking the Nanxun Line. Many of the commanders on this front were brave generals from Guangdong. In order to comfort the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines and strengthen their combat capabilities, the Four Women's Joint Association also promoted and organized the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Group to the North. The comfort group, which had a sacred mission, included students, young ladies, school principals, and even married women who wore black rubber shoes and carried copper helmets, marching along the dusty roads. This was such an exciting event! The comfort group played a significant role when it reached the battlefield, inspiring the soldiers, who were so moved that they won a victory the very next day. It also encouraged other women's organizations in other regions to go to the front lines to provide comfort. This is truly a source of pride for Hong Kong women!

All of the above sacred tasks are good manifestations of the unity of Hong Kong women's organizations. This proves that as long as there is unity, any difficult and arduous task can be solved easily. Naturally, contrary phenomena such as infighting and friction are still unavoidable. However, considering that this was the first time that Hong Kong women had united and cooperated in an unprecedented way, the achievements they have made are already remarkable. However, we should not be overly optimistic. Our work is still far from sufficient, and there are many other tasks that urgently require women to undertake. Therefore, further cooperation is necessary among the women's national salvation groups in Hong Kong. Thus, at the general assembly on March 8th International Women's Day, Madam He Xiangning immediately proposed the formation of the Hong Kong Women's Organizations Joint Assembly. At the same time, Madam Soong Ching-ling also had a deep hope for the unity of women.

As the War of Resistance enters a more difficult stage today, women's organizations in Hong Kong really should no longer hesitate. They should quickly hold hands tightly, intensify their efforts to shoulder various unfinished tasks, and further promote the spirit of overseas Chinese women in Hong Kong. Two days ago, at the closing meeting of the March 8th Festival, this proposal to form the Xiangjiang Women's Joint Assembly was enthusiastically supported by everyone. We look forward to this joint assembly发挥ing a greater working effectiveness!

Finally, we offer a station of advice with the utmost sincerity: First, our unity must be thorough and consistent, not just a momentary burst of enthusiasm. Second, whatever personal opinions or rifts may have existed in the past should be quickly eliminated in the work of unity. Third, expand the effectiveness of our work with collective wisdom and effort in sincere unity. If we can achieve these things, the future development of the Hong Kong Women's Joint Association will be limitless!

### Our Counteroffensive in the Southern Battlefield is Imminent; Enemy Aircraft Frenziedly Bomb in an Attempt to Threaten; After Several Months of Adjustment, We Have Reached Completion; Enemy Aircraft Run Rampant in the Lower West River and Northern Guangdong

[Special Dispatch from the North River] In the Southern China theater, there has been no major battle for several months. However, both sides are seizing this opportunity to urgently replenish and reorganize, actively preparing for the arrival of a major battle. It has been learned that our counteroffensive military operations in the Southern battlefield, after several months of adjustment and deployment, and the recent decisions made at the Southwest Military Authorities' meeting, have reached completion. The date for the overall offensive on Guangzhou City is not far off. According to reports, the head of the Guangdong bandits heard of this and is extremely fearful, showing signs of restlessness. Therefore, they have been frequently mobilizing and constructing fortifications at various strongholds in an attempt to strengthen their defensive capabilities for stubborn resistance. Furthermore, they are employing the deceptive tactic of "advancing in retreat," actively sending troops to harass us. According to military intelligence, the Guangdong bandits, in order to contain our military advance, have been implementing a policy of indiscriminate bombing for the past ten days. Large numbers of enemy aircraft have been frantically bombing various parts of Guangdong province. Heshang, Gaoming, Zhaoqing, Sihui in the lower reaches of the West River, and Qingyuan, Yingde, Wengyuan in northern Guangdong have all suffered brutal bombings. On the 21st and 22nd, enemy aircraft again launched separate air raids on northern Guangdong. It has been learned that on the morning of the 22nd, the sky was overcast. A squadron of nine enemy aircraft took off from Guangzhou, flying north along the Yuehan Railway, first circling over Huaxian and Juntian for a long time for reconnaissance. At around ten o'clock, they passed over Yinzhan Ao and went straight for Yingde. At the same time, a second batch of four enemy aircraft continued to take off, heading directly north, flying low and strafing with machine guns near Yinzhan Ao. At eleven o'clock, the two batches of enemy aircraft merged and flew northeast. Half an hour later, they returned to Yingde, dropping more than ten bombs in the Lidong Hengshi area. The losses are unknown. After the enemy aircraft acted violently, they turned south and left. It has also been learned that the people in various parts of northern Guangdong, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices due to the continuous and indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, have been evacuating themselves.

### Huang Gu Takes Command of Four Districts; Defense of Leizhou is Further Consolidated; The Qiongya Guerrilla Force is Gradually Expanding; Collecting Refugees from Xuwen, Requesting Resettlement

[Special Dispatch from Xuwen] Since the fall of Hainan, the districts of the Leizhou Peninsula have been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, and enemy warships have been cruising offshore, posing a threat. Xuwen is the first to bear the brunt. However, our military and civilians have a high awareness of resistance and are spirited. Huang Gu, commander of the newly formed XX Division, has been appointed commander of the four districts, making every effort to reorganize the defense. On the one hand, he is taking in refugees who have escaped from Qiongya, and relief organizations are separately providing assistance and resettlement. Public order in Xuwen is still good, and inspections of entrances and exits are particularly strict to prevent evil people from leaving traces. Many of the refugees who have fled here are not familiar with the inspection regulations, and some complain about the harshness and detail. The various organizations have requested the defending army to provide convenience to the refugees.

Military Preparations in Leizhou are Fully in Place

The reporter once went to the command to visit Commander Huang, but Huang was out inspecting the defense. According to a senior staff officer of the department, the enemy has been spreading the idea of invading the Leizhou Peninsula for more than a day. Our military strength in Leizhou is strong. Although the land is coastal, it is different from the isolated island of Qiongya. The terrain is favorable to us. Attacking Leizhou and invading Guangxi is easier said than done. There are three reasons why the enemy cannot invade: (1) manpower does not allow it, (2) geography makes it impossible, and (3) supply is difficult. The enemy cannot break these three points, so there is no way to have the conditions for combat. Our military deployment in Leizhou has been in place for a long time, and all preparations are complete. The only fear is that the enemy will not come. The enemy's invasion of Qiongya is nothing more than a threat to the international community and a hasty attempt to seek peace. After the strategy failed, they began to clamor for invading Leizhou and Guangxi, which shows its impossibility even more.

Guerrilla Teams on Qiongya Island Unleash Their Power

The reporter continued to inquire about the situation of the guerrilla forces on Qiongya Island. The staff officer introduced the reporter to Wang Yifeng, a wealthy merchant who had just escaped from Qiongya Island. According to Wang, after Qiongya Island fell, Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang, who was originally stationed in Wenchang, led his troops to carry out guerrilla warfare, while mobilizing the armed forces of the people. The strength of the guerrilla force grew stronger with each battle. The enemy occupied the coast around Qiongshan and Haikou, but they were never able to penetrate deep into the interior as far as Wenchang. After the enemy entered Wenchang, our troops dispersed and operated in small units. On the 12th of this month, they reorganized and annihilated 300 enemy cavalrymen near Sanjiang (the midpoint of the Haikou-Wenchang Highway). After this battle, more and more people joined the guerrilla force, reaching more than 20,000 people. They also became more skilled in the use of guerrilla warfare. The main reason why the enemy cannot penetrate deep into the central part of Qiongya is the surprise attacks by our guerrilla forces. Regarding the statistics on the number of refugees who have escaped from Qiongya Island, the reporter investigated various parties. In addition to those who have gone to Nanyang and Hong Kong, there are about 3,000 people currently staying in various districts of Leizhou and Guangzhou Bay. In addition to the local charitable organizations providing assistance, they have also consulted with wealthy Qiongzhou overseas Chinese in other ports to donate funds to send all the refugees to Yunnan Province for resettlement as a fundamental solution. At the moment, this proposal has been suspended. The relief organizations are discussing sending telegrams to Song Ziwen, Chen Ce, and various prominent fellow villagers, requesting that the resettlement be implemented as soon as possible.

### On the West River Front, a Small Encounter Occurred Between Us and the Enemy; More Than Ten Enemy Soldiers Were Killed; One Enemy Motorboat Was Sunk

[Special Dispatch from the West River] The West River front has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday (the 19th), several dozen enemy soldiers in six motorboats approached Jinli from the Makou direction for reconnaissance. Our troops waited until they were about 50 yards from Jinli, and then opened fire with machine guns, killing more than ten enemy soldiers who fell into the sea. The remaining enemy soldiers, seeing that we were prepared, dared not approach the shore and fled back the way they came. In this battle, more than ten enemy soldiers were killed and one enemy boat was sunk.

### Military Situation in Guangdong is Rapidly Unfolding; Large Numbers of Eastern River Troops are Reinforcing the Defense; The Enemy Pontoon Bridge at Shilong Was Destroyed by Us; 200 Enemy Troops Harass Hengli and Changping

[Special Dispatch from the East River] Since the highest military conference in South China decided on the overall plan for our counteroffensive against Guangzhou City, the deployment and distribution of military forces in the east, west, and north have been carried out in accordance with the plan. It has been learned that General Commander Wu Qiwai of the Ninth Group Army has already actively planned for the eastern front, and the entire line of military operations has entered a new stage. The various situations obtained are listed below:

The Main Counteroffensive Force Continues to Move East

It has been learned that after General Commander Wu Qiwai of the Ninth Group Army was ordered to lead his troops back to defend the eastern front, in addition to the XX Army under Ou Zhen, which had already moved south and reached its destination, the XX and other units were still on their way back due to the need for replenishment. General Commander Wu believed that the military situation on the northwest rivers had been deployed, and the counteroffensive order could be issued quickly. Therefore, it was necessary to quickly complete the eastern front line to wait for orders to advance. He specifically telegraphed the various units in the Central Plains to rush south. It has been learned that a certain unit that recently arrived in Guangdong has departed from Jiangxi and arrived in Longchuan Xinfeng, rushing east to split up and reinforce the front lines of Zengcheng, Boluo, and Dongguan, pressing toward the enemy.

The Fourth District Holds a Guerrilla Conference

Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla Column, recently went to a certain place in the North River under orders to attend the provincial guerrilla war zone administrative conference. He has now returned to a certain place in the East River after completing his official duties. Commander Wang, in order to instruct his subordinates on the progress of the conference and to determine the political work and enemy annihilation plans for the guerrilla zone in the future, has scheduled a meeting of county magistrates and team leaders in the district within a week to thoroughly improve the guerrilla warfare plan and political education issues in order to enhance the basic strength, improve combat capabilities, and assist the regular army in winning the counteroffensive.

The Enemy Pontoon Bridge at Shilong is Destroyed

Since the Fourth District Guerrilla Force was reorganized, its momentum has been enormous, and its range of activities has gradually expanded. It has launched surprise attacks on the enemy several times, inflicting heavy losses. Furthermore, the XX Brigade under Yin Zhongming of the district learned last night (the 21st) that the enemy troops in Shilong were lying dormant in the town due to continuous rain. Therefore, they secretly went to the riverbank south of Shilong Nanbian in the dark of the moon and rain, and destroyed the newly completed pontoon bridge built by the enemy. At that time, several enemy sentries were shivering and guarding the bridge. Yin's unit took them by surprise and killed them with bayonets, and destroyed the pontoon bridge. Currently, due to the destruction of the bridge, the highway from Shilong to Guancheng cannot be connected.

200 Enemy Troops Harass Hengli Again

According to another military dispatch, the enemy troops stationed in Shilong have been harassing various villages lately. Although they have been punished repeatedly, their ambition to promote their political propaganda plan has not diminished. Yesterday (the 23rd), they again sent more than 200 infantrymen with two cannons to harass the villages of Changping and Hengli. In addition to looting food and livestock, they continued their consistent policy of forcing the village chiefs to accept fake orders, establish local maintenance societies, and levy military pay. They withdrew to Shilong at around 3:00 PM. However, the people of our various villages all deeply understood the great righteousness and vowed not to be humiliated, unanimously rejecting the enemy's orders. It has been reported that the Fourth District Guerrilla Command has again increased the deployment of a certain unit to the area of Hengli and Changping, and ordered the newly appointed Changping District Chief and Police Chief Zhu Weishen to earnestly protect and lead the people in the area to avoid being used by the enemy.

### More Than 300,000 Miao and Yao People in Guangxi Participate in the War of Resistance; After Several Years of Strict Training, They Have Now Become a Strong and Vigorous Army

[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou Bay] The Guangxi area is mostly mountainous, so the Miao and Yao peoples are concentrated in the mountains, numbering more than 300,000. These Miao and Yao people have long been isolated from the Han people, so they are not often mentioned in the same breath as the Han, Hui, Mongol, and Tibetan peoples. However, if one examines the history of the Yellow Emperor's battle with Chi You in Zhuolu, it can be seen that the culture of these Miao and Yao people, who created a thick fog to intimidate the enemy, is not low. Later, they migrated and moved, and then lived for a long time in the deep mountains, isolated from the Han people. If they can be organized, given good training, and their intelligence and physical strength developed, they can enrich the ranks of the War of Resistance and make a great contribution to the country and nation. Therefore, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Guangxi Provincial Government authorities have been working hard on this. A special normal school training institute has been established to train Miao and Yao ethnic teachers, so that after graduation, they can go back to train and organize the education and culture of their ethnicity. In these two or three years, the best of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups have been selected and trained into more than thirty types, totaling more than a thousand outstanding young teachers. Others, such as Yao, Black Yao, Ling, and Dong, have also selected young people to participate in training. The students are between the ages of fourteen and twenty-four, mostly around twenty years old. According to the students' level, they are divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Books and clothing are provided by the school. The educational policy is to emphasize both teacher training and intellectual training, with educational principles, national language, arithmetic, hygiene, rural technology improvement, and the improvement of the students' lives. The aim is to first improve their lives and then extend it to political training and cultural development. A large farm has also been opened for students to practice on. Currently, the students of these more than 300,000 Miao and Yao people can all write very fluent Chinese characters and speak very fluent Mandarin. Young men and women over the age of fourteen can also perform the most accurate and skillful shooting methods, so they have now become a new and vigorous force in Guangxi's war of resistance.

### The Enemy is Pulling New Tricks Again, Urgently Seeking to Prosper Guangzhou, Holding Registration of Shops and Land, Wanting to Lure the Bourgeoisie Back to the City

[Special Dispatch from Jiangdou] It has been more than five months since the violent enemy luckily occupied Guangzhou. They have already designed all kinds of ways to prosper the market. At first, they used poisonous means, opening opium dens, casinos, and brothels to attract the people. Therefore, most of the rogues, hoodlums, bandits, and other riffraff also followed their example. Then, they forced the shops to open and sold enemy goods at low prices. Therefore, some small merchants were forced by the environment to return to the city. Therefore, for several months, most of the residents of Guangzhou have been propertyless classes in rags and tatters, and bandits who live by looting. There is absolutely no prosperity to speak of. According to recent news, the enemy chiefs feel that Guangzhou has not been able to prosper because the bourgeoisie and legitimate merchants have not returned to the city, social finance is exhausted, and order is disrupted. Recently, they have changed their tricks. In addition to instigating traitors to lure our people to certain ports and villages, they have also established a so-called "Property Registration Office" by the puppet court to conduct the registration of shops and land. After registration, the shops must all be occupied by someone. The deadline is the end of April. Shops that are not registered or are not guarded will be confiscated and nationalized. The attempt is to attract our people with property back to the city. Fortunately, most people with a little property have national and ethnic concepts. Since Guangzhou has fallen into enemy hands, everything can be sacrificed. They do not care about the existence or destruction of their property. Therefore, not only will they not return to the city to apply for registration, they will not send people back to the city to guard the shops, so as not to increase the number of docile subjects.

### Enemy Intentions are Unclear; Enemy Warships Leave Qionghai and Head East; Enemy Military Losses in the Invasion of Qiongya are Heavy; Military Expenses for Two Months Consume 2 Million

A telegram from Beihai received here reports that the eighteen enemy warships surrounding Qiongya suddenly gathered at Haikou yesterday (the 21st) and then sailed east, with unclear intentions.

[Special Dispatch from Beihai] After the enemy occupied Haikou, in order to make up for its military expenses, it has ordered the puppet organization to levy various taxes. The enemy's military losses in the capture of Qiongya are extremely heavy. According to a precise estimate, the total number of enemy troops deployed in various places is about 10,000. The military expenses for these two months include 600,000 yuan for food and supplies, 300,000 yuan for replenishment, 700,000 yuan for ammunition consumption, more than 100,000 yuan for the construction of fortifications, and medical expenses of 100,000 yuan. Other transportation expenses are not included, and the total amount has reached 2 million yuan. On average, about 1 million yuan is needed each month. Even with active taxation in Qiongya, it cannot make up one-tenth of the total amount of military expenses lost.

### After Arriving in Hollywood with Five Hundred Dollars: Continued from Yesterday

An opportunity arrived, and I began my journey on the path to fortune. He clearly saw my excitement, smiled, and invited me to dine at the Brown Derby restaurant. He said his female companion would arrive soon. However, his girlfriend never appeared, which didn't matter much. But when it came time to pay the bill, he was somewhat embarrassed; he had forgotten his money. I happily lent him three dollars to cover the bill for two cocktails and two meals. Afterwards, I quickly ran back to the apartment to tell them about the appointment for tomorrow.

"What did you say his name was?" one of them asked me. I somewhat boastfully showed her the business card. They passed it around, each silently understanding something. Finally, a tall blonde woman said, "Of course, you paid for the meal..."

These three dollars went into my "experience" column. Such scams aren't common in Hollywood, but newcomers are often the victims. The next day, I tentatively went to the address on the business card, only to find a pile of junk. I now had only one thing to do: buy a few things.

Evening dress... thirty-five dollars

Makeup box... eight dollars

They laughed at me for buying such an expensive makeup box. It was a small green tin box, like a fishing tackle box. One of the women explained that it was worth only two dollars at most. However, they had nothing to say about the evening dress; it was very beautiful. I felt this dress distanced me even further from my homeland.

A month passed, and one day, I assessed my current situation and became somewhat anxious.

Waiting for opportunities in places frequented by film people was costly and yielded no results. Not even a glimpse. Dining in those famous restaurants cost at least one dollar, plus tips, which was another big expense, because everyone tipped with flair. I went about three times a week. I also attended a premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, paying five dollars for a ticket and two dollars for a flower, but I wasn't noticed. I visited numerous talent agencies and saw eight agents, all of whom rejected me due to my lack of experience. I wrote fifteen heartfelt letters to fifteen directors (which sank without a trace). I loitered, either standing or sitting, in front of various theaters, studios, hotels, and restaurants, all public places. I consulted with the women in the apartment. Whenever a new film began production, I would rush to the studio to find a way in. I stopped directors on the street and spoke to strangers who looked important—but these actions only seemed to make me a conspicuous, pitiful, and repulsive person. Everywhere I went, I met with a polite but firm rejection. People in Hollywood are very, very busy, and I don't have any special talents that make me more valuable than Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers, or Norma Shearer. I'm just one of many thousands, a very ordinary one at that.

Every trivial thing made my hopes even dimmer. The apartment was also constantly changing. Today, this woman had great hope; tomorrow, it was someone else. "Agnes's screen test wasn't good... Mary went back to marry her boyfriend next door... Qin waited six months for a screen test, but failed... Betty pawned all her belongings..."

As for me, after a whole month of effort, I was two hundred forty-six dollars and fifty-five cents poorer.

The first two days of the second month were uneventful. On the third day, there was a slight earthquake that broke a few window panes and toppled some chimneys. This minor event was blown out of proportion by the sensationalist newspapers. I immediately made a long-distance call home to tell them I was okay, to prevent them from rushing over in tears to find my body in the ruins. That one call cost four dollars and fifty cents.

On the fifth day, the first car payment was due, and I paid twenty dollars. The car company's warranty against breakdowns had also expired. As if the car were deliberately trying to cause trouble for me, it broke down the next day. The car company wasn't responsible, so I had to pay for the repairs myself. That was another four dollars and sixty-three cents.

After a good cry, I spent three dollars on some stockings, and things seemed to improve. Wei Yun, one of my roommates, invited me to dinner with her and a female friend (who was a friend of an acting coach). This was a great opportunity, so of course I went. Fortunately, this person seemed to like me and accepted my invitation to dinner the next day. The next day, I spent another five dollars at Bickford's, but it was worth it. She finally agreed to introduce me to the acting coach.

This person also liked me and took me to dinner, introducing me to a female secretary of a producer. She took me to a preview screening and introduced me to an assistant director. After all the introductions, I finally had some hope, but it cost me a lot of money: lunches, dinners, cocktails. However, it was beneficial. I never let my distinguished guests (or perhaps victims) off easily. Each time, I subtly hinted at my hopes: "I want a screen test."

One day, this assistant director heard me say it too many times and got a headache. He suggested that I should first join a small theater to act. He said, "Talent scouts often go there. As long as you stand out, they'll come looking for you. For you, I'll even get a director to come and watch you perform."

So, I began to look for these kinds of small theaters. I ran into a lot of obstacles. It seemed there were hundreds of people looking for the same kind of work as me. I realized that very few theaters actually paid actors. Most of them relied on subsidies from writers, who paid to have their scripts performed in the theater, or unknown directors who paid to direct, or unknown actors who paid to act. In a word, their purpose was only to attract attention.

I also paid twenty-five dollars to get a role in the world's worst opera, under the direction of the world's worst director, with a group of the worst-managed actors. During the three weeks of rehearsals, the director couldn't even tell the left from the right of the stage, and the male lead almost broke my neck in a love scene due to excessive "effort."

In addition to the twenty-five dollars mentioned above, this also cost me a lot of money. I rented a long, black wig, a grass skirt, and a lei.

The good times didn't last long. On the afternoon of the official preview, the assistant director called and said that the director had gone to Santa Barbara to shoot on location and wouldn't be back for two weeks. But our play was only running for one week. It was terrible, a waste of effort.

The performance also went terribly. I performed in that awful play for seven nights. The audience each night was suspicious; they were probably relatives of the actors or people with other connections. In any case, they weren't outsiders. Even so, after watching one scene, they all expressed some dissatisfaction. After seven days, I resigned and spent a day reflecting on the illusion.

I only had seventy-five dollars left, and my brain was empty. Hollywood lived up to its reputation; it was indeed not easy to break into, especially for someone like me. I gradually began to hate Hollywood.

When I had only one dollar more than the price of a ticket home, the landlady came to tell me I had a phone call. Her voice didn't have anything particularly exciting about it, but my legs trembled, and my heart pounded. It was him, the assistant director.

"Hello, are you... are you the one who asked me for a screen test... are you still here... hello, hello... I thought I wouldn't be able to find you. I showed your photo to the boss, and he wants to see you. Can you come in twenty minutes? Bring that black evening dress... can you make it... hello..."

Coincidentally, I had another flat tire. To get to the studio, I'd have to call a taxi, which would cost about three dollars. This meant that going to the studio would require using the money for the train ticket. This was tantamount to cutting off my lifeline to home. Dozens of women who had had screen tests before were still waiting for another chance. And this was only my first time.

Did I call the taxi after all?

Guess.

### Whether to Subdue the Dragon Hinges on This Move: South China Goes All Out to Pounce on the Stubborn Team; Eastern's Battle Against US Military Is Also Fierce

(Our Newspaper Special Report) All those concerned about soccer events have been discussing the South China vs. Kowloon Football Club match in recent days. Because South China is crossing the sea north to do battle, the terrain is unfavorable; the slightest mistake could lead to failure, hence the worry over whether South China will be able to defend itself when subduing the dragon.

Kowloon rarely leaves its home base and acts like a local tyrant, its might terrifying. Many have lost color in the face of this team, perhaps not knowing how much strength they possess. Many have sacrificed themselves to its claws, and view its soccer field as a formidable path. Even with South China's strength, it could not win the special silver shield rematch there previously, achieving only a draw. It was only when they left the Kowloon field that they were eliminated. This shows how important the terrain is.

Today, the stubborn team, undefeated on its home field, welcomes the visiting team with the highest hopes of winning. One relies on the advantage of the terrain, and although it is defending, it wants to display its strength. The other relies on its superior skill; if it passes this hurdle, its future will be bright. Therefore, this competition will be fierce and certainly not a waste.

What Kowloon is fighting for is to maintain its undefeated record at home. What South China is fighting for is the glorious championship. Although the meaning of the fight is different, the goal of victory is the same.

The reporter, based on the facts observed during the South China vs. Eastern silver shield semi-final last week, in which South China marched in the rain and defeated Eastern, believes that all of South China's players are able to use their true skills and are not controlled by the environment. Today, they also possess this spirit, so victory is not difficult. It is hoped that today's weather will be like the intermittent rain of the Eastern battle, which would make victory even more assured.

Discussing the weather issue, some may find my words inappropriate. The majority believes South China is skilled in short passes, and that fighting in the rain is not suitable. How could I consider it beneficial? Do I alone have a superior view?

What I am referring to is specifically fighting in the rain on the Kowloon field. Because Kowloon relies on the advantage of the terrain, if it rains today, the field will be wet and the ball heavy, and their accustomed steps will lose their regularity, and there will be no terrain advantage. Conversely, South China's players, because they are experienced, can control the ball well, and are not greatly affected by the rain. Therefore, my thoughts are a reversal based on the situation.

With the championship in sight, one more step to reach hope, South China players, good luck! If you break this stubborn team today, no one will dare to take the league champion position.

The Eastern vs. US Military match is also important. If Eastern wins, it will have hope for second place, and then it can profit by watching how South China and the Navy perform afterwards. The lineups for the South China and Kowloon teams are as follows:

(South China)

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan

Li Guoqi, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai

Mian Douwen, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Deng Guangsen

### King's College Anniversary Sports Meet: Huang Jilian Wins Senior Championship

The last one was the best, with a new record of 5 minutes 26 and 2/5 seconds, shortening the 5 minutes 33 and 4/5 seconds record set by Xi Jianhui in 1937 by several seconds. As a result of the competition, Huang Jilian won the grade championship with 13 points, and Xi Guobin won the junior championship with 15 points. The first place in the house competition was won by the South House, with a total score of 104 and a half points. In addition to the track and field events, there were also fitness demonstrations, varied and wonderful. The open Hong Kong schools' 1,200-meter relay race was attended by La Salle, Wah Yan, St. Joseph's, etc. La Salle College was still the first to reach the finish line. It is noted that the school has won a total of three relay championships this year, with satisfactory results. After the competition, the awards were presented by Mrs. Sulingdun, the principal of King's College.

The First Division game is quite interesting, because both teams are brave in battle, and there will be a fierce competition at that time.

### Hong Kong Interport Team: Selecting Generals to Fight Singapore China; The Battle Lineup for the Philippines Is Also Planned

[Our Newspaper Special Report] Although the Hong Kong Interport Football Team has not yet reached the point of setting off, everything is ready and the candidates have already been decided.

Before the Hong Kong Interport Team went to the Philippines, it happened that the Singapore China team came to Hong Kong from the Philippines. Such an opportunity is rare, so the Football Association specially consulted with South China to change the two games of the Singapore China team in Hong Kong to be played by the Hong Kong Interport Team. It is said that the Hong Kong Interport Team's lineup for the match has been planned as follows:

(Eastern)

Tan Junqian

Shi Han, Hou Rongsheng

Yi Shilan, Bilu, Feishi

Du Houchengtao, Zhi Gaoshan Nu, Du Li Huitang, Wo Ge Ni, Da Yanba Chen

The above lineup is to cope with the Singapore China team and is only for practice. As for the official lineup when they go to the Philippines in the future, it is what the general concern about the football affairs wants to know. According to reliable sources, the Hong Kong Interport team will send the following personnel to the first battle in the Philippines:

### Exciting Soccer Match: Li Wah Cup Final Tomorrow Wah Luen vs. Western Members at Hong Kong Club Field

[Our Newspaper Special Report] The Li Wah Cup Football Final will be held tomorrow afternoon at the Hong Kong Club Field. Two famous actors will take the stage to perform, which will surely cause a sensation.

Li Huitang made great contributions last time, and this time he was re-elected, which greatly strengthened the attacking power of Wah Luen's forwards. I once said, "He will definitely be happy to personally accept the glory of the award," and this will be guaranteed to be realized tomorrow. If you don't believe it, wait and see.

The strength of the Western Members does not seem weak, and with Gao Shannu as the forward, it is not to be feared, but compared to the whole team, there are many places where it is not as good as Wah Luen. Let's see Wah Luen win the championship. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

(Wah Luen Team)

Tan Junqian (South China)

Li Tiansheng (South China), Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua)

### Looking Back and Forward

— Lai Duannan

I have been engaged in sports writing for nearly twenty years, and I have seen many intense sports events, but I have never seen a soccer game as tense as this year's. What is even more exciting is that not only do Chinese and Western soccer teams in Hong Kong have extremely fierce battles, and the league is in a tug-of-war, but also that Lidu in Shanghai won the Scotto Cup as a third division soccer team in the league. Also, the Hong Kong basketball league, the Xingdao team, which had a great reputation, suddenly lost to Zhong Sheng, and after that, it will become an unprecedented spectacle of competition, oh, magnificent, sighing and laughing.

Secondly, in recent years, Hong Kong football has repeatedly opened unprecedented and unique spectacles. After Colingdon arrived, the Saigon team followed, and this year, the Philippines also came to play an unprecedented Hong Kong-Philippines international game. Not long after, the Singapore China Progressive Association team also came, and at the same time, there was news that Lidu planned to come to Hong Kong in early May. From then on, thousands of fans will be like being on the Shanyin Road, with no time to see everything.

Promoting sports requires money, and Hong Kong sports developed the earliest in the Far East, especially the lively soccer games. However, although the Football Association has decades of history, it still feels financially lacking, which is a pity. It is said that this year, because Li Qiguai made a comeback, the Hong Kong-Philippines game had a large appeal, and the income of the first game exceeded 8,000 yuan, and the income of the three games exceeded 10,000 yuan. Now, the Eastern vs. Navy runner-up final, which seems to be realized soon, will also be added. The Football Association may use one-third of the income of this game to increase its revenue. Also, South China's sudden defeat to the police in the league will certainly add a lot of income to the special silver shield final game. The Football Association's surplus is soaring, and Hong Kong football will be even more prosperous because of it.

Li Huitang sent a letter to Sangyu, saying that the new wave does not push the old wave, so that the "outdated old man" is still superior to everything, which is a feeling of emotion, not self-promotion. Looking at the rising stars in the football world today, some have a skill or strength, and they are immediately arrogant, or once they are praised by the newspaper, they are immediately arrogant. From then on, they focus on complacency, and if they show their ambitions to others, they will have no progress because of this difference in thought, and instead feel decadent. This is the most undesirable phenomenon. People then blame us for not praising too much. However, our responsibility is to promote, not to belittle. If the players have self-awareness, how can they seek improvement? What's more, if we criticize more than praise, those who are competitive will hate us for no reason. If we criticize correctly, people will hate us and even ask unreasonable questions. Although we don't care, it is difficult for the writer. But I hope that the younger generation must seek a way for the new wave to push the old wave, and not be concerned with temporary false reputations, then our country's sports will be reliable.

A week ago, some people thought that soccer teams could not avoid suspicion under intense competition. From this, they speculated that Eastern might not go all out when fighting the Navy, and that South China might not seek a stable victory when fighting the Navy after winning the championship. This is no less than worrying unnecessarily. Now the facts tell us that Eastern's generals fought the Navy, and all the injured generals came out, and they still won in the end. South China had just been defeated by the police, and it had to strive for victory against the Navy. The theory of suspicion has been broken down, and the glory of the Chinese taking the championship and runner-up is in sight, which is very gratifying.

Putting oneself in a dead end and then being reborn is the secret of using troops. South China often has the disadvantage of underestimating the enemy, and in the dark, it still deliberately plays tricks, so that it accidentally loses to the police, so that it strives for self-reliance. Then South China's recent defeat is really a blessing to South China. It is expected that the championship will reach three championships (League, Special Silver Shield, Xuhe Cup), two kinds because of its defeat on the Boundary Street field.

In the basketball league, there has been no new show of replacing the old for many years, and the technical level of Hong Kong has not been able to surpass it. Now, Zhong Sheng, who once lost to South China, suddenly defeated the multi-term champion team Xingdao, then Xingdao will definitely not dare to despise South China in the future, and there are still strong Eastern and Pui Ying, which can pose a great threat. Others such as South China and the police are not easy to deal with. The road is full of thorns, so the training of the Xingdao team will definitely be more diligent, and they will no longer dare to underestimate the enemy during the competition. This alone is enough to show that future events must be fierce. If so, the improvement of Hong Kong's basketball level is in this, it is in this. If we further seek a more perfect management organization, I know that with our "Guangdong spirit," we will definitely not be inferior for a long time.

Since Xu Weipei's sudden rise in tennis, there has been no successor. As a result, the competition for the championship has returned to the point where it is predetermined before the game. Once entering the third week of the game, the viewers can no longer see new faces, and there is a feeling that it has been the same for more than ten years, which is not a blessing for the tennis world. This year seems to be slightly more lively, with Gao Shannu and Ding Ding Leimi Di winning Hui Huizhao and Qian Cha in doubles, university medical student Lin Tiande's entry into the third week, Cai Yongshan's narrow victory over Da Linzhen, Li Huitang's Yao Dezhu's fierce battle against Lin Zhen's brother, and both brothers are invaluable new spirits. However, is it possible for the championship to change hands? Is Xu Runpei's art already overwhelming his brother's qualifications? It is still a big question. Because Da Xu has no opportunity to travel, although he has innate talent, he has not been able to develop to the international level. Runpei, who is young and promising, is also in danger of the same fate. I am very sorry for it. How can my wish to win the horse lottery in the end come true, and self-fund those like the Xu brothers to seek art abroad to honor the motherland? There are many rich people in our country, why is there no one with the same feelings as me? It is sighable, it is sighable.

### Artillery and Engineering Units Desire to Participate in the Upcoming First Division League: Discussion on Promotion and Relegation Issues

[Special Report from This Newspaper] It is remembered that during the 1935-36 football season, the number of teams participating in the First Division League set a new record, totaling thirteen teams. Consequently, the schedule was extended, starting in mid-September 1935 and ending in mid-May 1936.

Football is a strenuous sport and not suitable for summer. Therefore, the English Football Association stipulated that each tournament must end within the first week of May. All rules and regulations for organizing tournaments by the Hong Kong Football Association are based on and implemented according to the guidelines set by the English Association. Therefore, before the start of the 1936-37 football season, to prevent the schedule from being extended, it was resolved to end the tournament within the first week of May and to limit the number of teams participating in the First Division League to no more than twelve. This rule is still in effect today.

In the past two seasons, the number of teams participating in the First Division League has not exceeded the limit. However, it is unknown what will happen in the upcoming season. Yesterday, the reporter learned that the Fifth Artillery Battalion and the Twenty-Fourth Artillery Battalion, which have achieved considerable success in the Second Division League this season, intend to unite and participate in the First Division League under the name of the Artillery Battalion. The Western Engineering team also has this idea, but it is unknown whether the Association will approve their application.

It is also remembered that when the Association resolved to limit the number of teams participating in the First Division League to no more than twelve, it also included a clause stating that any Second Division team that achieves excellent results during the competition and wishes to be promoted may be given the opportunity by the Association after considering the situation. Since the number of teams participating in the First Division is limited, what will happen if a strong Second Division team is accepted for promotion, causing the number to exceed twelve? Will the established limit be overturned? If such a situation does occur, the Association has the right to accept a strong Second Division team for promotion and also has the right to relegate the team with the worst performance in the First Division League. Therefore, if the Association allows the Artillery Battalion and the Western Engineering team to be promoted to the First Division in the upcoming season, the team that finishes last and performs poorly in the First Division this season may be relegated.

However, the team that finished last in the First Division this season is undoubtedly the Hong Kong team. This team holds a significant position in the history of Hong Kong football and is also known as the "gentlemen of football." The current chairman of the Association, , is a key figure within the team. Although the team's performance has been extremely poor this season, it has a good reputation. If the Association enforces the rule of relegating the team with the worst performance in the upcoming season and applies it to this team, it is believed that it will not be effective. As for the St. Joseph's team, which is one place ahead of last place, although their performance is not good, they have good talent, and most of them are representatives of the Portuguese team in international competitions. The Portuguese team has qualified for the finals, and with this fact, there is no reason to relegate the St. Joseph's team. Therefore, whether the Artillery Battalion and the Western Engineering team can be promoted in the upcoming season is quite questionable.

In my opinion, the football movement in Hong Kong has developed considerably. In principle, the Association should not restrict the number of teams participating in the First Division too strictly. Nominating fourteen teams would not be too many. The Association was established to promote football, so it should support players in advancing towards technical excellence and not suppress them. If the Association feels that the schedule is too long and unsuitable, it can start the tournament earlier. I wonder if the gentlemen of the Association will agree with me. (Stadium Tycoon)

### Essays and Personality

— Gao Gao

Qin Gui and Yan Song committed the crimes of harming the loyal and bringing disaster to the country and the people. Even their essays, as precious as pearls and jade, were subjected to capital punishment and could not be "preserved in famous mountains and passed on to future generations." Zhou Zuoren, in Peiping, had some suspicion of being a Han traitor in his actions. Many middle schools in Shanghai removed his works from the Chinese textbooks, although his personality had not yet reached the stage of "final judgment."

If the saying "A gentleman does not abandon words because of the person" is to be believed, I feel sorry for people ancient and modern. Judging essays by essays, I have "no way to see" the great works of Qin Gui and Yan Song! I have always had a "high mountain to look up to" for Zhou Zuoren's essays, and I still hope that he can prove his pure personality with strong facts.

Because of the perversity of conduct and the baseness of personality, essays are implicated. The general public believes that this is a kind of punishment, depriving him of his spiritual property and causing him more profound pain, whether dead or alive? It also contains the meaning of killing a chicken to scare the monkeys, so that talented scholars dare not follow in his footsteps.

In fact, it is not so. Art cannot be separated from life, and works are entrusted to personality. Painting, sculpture, and music are all like this, and literature is even more obvious. It must exist in the heart before it can take shape on the outside; it must have a "compassionate heart" before it can write the supreme essays of the world. Han Yu said: "The so-called essay must have something in it, therefore, a gentleman is cautious in reality, and the beauty or ugliness of reality cannot be hidden when it is expressed." Tolstoy directly believed that art must be "for life," or even not limited to art. He said: "The prerequisite for all sincere occupations is not love for work, but a love for humanity that must be loved. This work cannot be loved without the belief in improving humanity. Only those who fill their minds with love can do valuable work." You think, just this general kindness and compassion, loyalty and enthusiasm, is enough to illuminate eternity; and what about those with keen eyes, transcendental insights, and artistic skills, who express them in essays, naturally have an incredible power. With this power, they arouse the resonance of mankind; with this power, they promote reforms in politics, law, morality, and thought; with this power, they universally save the masses from deep water and fire. This is why Tolstoy is Tolstoy, and similarly, this is why Gorky is Gorky, Romain Rolland is Romain Rolland, Confucius is Confucius, Mo Di is Mo Di, Han Yu is Han Yu... Then, we know that establishing words must be based on establishing virtue. "Preserving it in famous mountains and passing it on to future generations" cannot be achieved by chance.

The most taboo thing in art is hypocritical expression. One does not drink alcohol, but wants to play a few songs of drinking wine. One indulges in wild drinking and drunkenness. One is extremely enthusiastic, but wants to play a high tune of fishing and woodcutting. One's chest is full of selfish desires and evil thoughts, but one wants to talk about moral righteousness and saving the people, etc. If "rhetoric does not establish sincerity," how can there be good essays? Even if one has "writings that fill the body," it is only a temporary addition of many imitation pearls and many rough products to the universe, not precious jade, and cannot be passed on to future generations.

Even if his writing skills are very clever and can deceive the eyes of everyone in the world, his hypocritical life will sooner or later be exposed, especially in the time of "severe winter." Once exposed, the essays of "words not from the heart" and the "moment of expensive paper in Luoyang" are over, and they are still not worth half a penny, serving only as waste paper. No matter how lifelike the actor on stage plays Yue Fei, he cannot be pointed to as a national hero.

I deeply hope that young people who aspire to literature and art, in addition to devoting themselves to the cultivation of skills, will devote themselves to the cultivation of a great personality and a fulfilling life. With kindness and compassion, loyalty and enthusiasm, write essays of true feelings and true nature, for themselves who have not lived in vain, and for the Chinese nation that is fighting against resistance and building the country!

### "The Usefulness of Scholars"

— Ge'er

"Scholars are useless," the "uselessness" of cultural people is obviously not like this now. "Life begins with the confusion of recognizing characters," therefore, "characters" really cannot be "recognized." This is a clear annotation of "Scholars are useless." Everyone knows the "uselessness" of "confused" people.

Now is the time of resistance against Japan. "Throwing the pen and joining the army!" is admired by everyone. This shows that the "pen" is ultimately inferior to the "gun," another clear proof. Therefore, some people criticize cultural people who make great arguments in newspapers and magazines, and cannot help but despise them, saying: "If you have the guts, go to the front line. Talking incessantly in the rear is oral resistance. This is the degradation of cultural people!" Therefore, "scholars" are still "useless," but the tone has changed.

However, are "scholars" really "useless"? I say "yes," and also "no." Isn't this contradictory? In fact, all things in the world are contradictory. There is a "good" side, and there must also be a "bad" side. There are "useless" "scholars," but it cannot be denied that there are also "useful" ones. Otherwise, why would Mr. Lu Xun study medicine so well, and then abandon medicine and engage in literary and artistic work? Just with a copy of Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?" in my hand, it is said to be an "enlightenment" for young Russian women in the 19th century. This is only in the field of literature and art. It is also true in other social sciences.

To deny the uselessness of cultural people, to despise the "pen" and value the "gun," it can be said that such people only have one eye and only see one side of all things in the world, and it is necessary to correct this.

In fact, some cultural people are indeed useless. What they write is not only useless to the country and society, but harmful. This can be said to be above "useless." There is also a kind of "bookworm" who holds books and reads dead, chewing on words, with a "scholarly air." The saying "Life begins with the confusion of recognizing characters" is really appropriate for them. Because such people only see the "dogmas" in books and do not see the turbulent world outside of books, they use "dogmas" to measure the turbulent world. Therefore, their eyes become blurred, and they feel a little "confused." If Mr. Dong Hong looks at modern women from the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius, he will definitely be "confused" and will definitely "begin to worry," and he will inevitably shake his head and sigh: "The world is going downhill."

Such "cultural people" can be said to be "useless." And I think that resistance against Japan does not need to seek any help from such "cultural people." However, this is only the "bad" aspect, and to deny the combativeness of all cultural people from this "bad" aspect is either "ignorant" or somewhat "malicious."

The Guilin telegram of the 15th of this month said that General Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Military Affairs Headquarters, hosted cultural circles on the 14th. During the meeting, he gave a speech, the gist of which was: "The nature of this war against Japan is resistance against aggression and defense against invasion. We are in a semi-colonial position, and the method to win depends on total war in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. The work of cultural people, although biased towards the rear, is no less helpful to the War of Resistance than the heroic warriors who shed blood in the front." The "usefulness" of cultural people can be said to have been clearly demonstrated by General Bai. General Bai also pointed out that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, we will take a defensive posture in the military field and an offensive posture in the political field. Therefore, this shows that the pens of cultural people can be said to be one of the most excellent weapons in strengthening the spirit of the nation.

We will not be "useless" "doctors," nor will we be "confused" by recognizing characters. We will not listen to other people's "nonsense." We will pick up our "pens" and display our fighting spirit. In short, we are "cultural people" who are no less than the heroic warriors who shed blood on the front lines!

### The Singing Procession

— Huang Chengsheng

Here, I don't often hear children's songs.

Children's songs do exist: however, without rhythm, without beat, without the ability to stir my soul, it's as if I haven't heard them. They often just hum a few lines on the road in twos or threes; they may not be students, right? I see several times they are shoe-shiners. No one gives them practice, and humming a few lines is still learned from self-imitation. Naturally, this is an angry expression for them. ——Probably they have already traded begging-style servitude for the sustenance of a day's life.

I don't often hear children's songs, but in my mind, the resounding echoes of children's melodious songs occasionally burn.

Three months ago, in the countryside, I encountered a glorious festival. The night sky in the countryside seemed particularly bright early. Waking up, the clock struck four. The air in the ancestral hall was very fresh and seemed clear. A primary school nearby blasted out "My × people are as fierce as wolves, seizing my land." In the silent space, the singing seemed particularly cheerful and resonant, stirring beautiful echoes in the surrounding wilderness. The drooping golden ears of rice in the fields outside must be bathed in the cool autumn breeze, bathed in the sound waves of the singing. The cool breeze and singing, like a pair of butterflies, flew across the golden felt of the fields. The dense sorghum and millet must also be starting a moving dance, right?

Village children. At the time when city people are sound asleep, they get up and move their voices. This day is the most glorious festival of Greater China. The children's hearts leap with hot excitement. They want to use the dawn's roar to express their love for the motherland, for their hometown. The singing is higher and higher pitched, with occasional soft and melodious pauses; you can hear that there are still adults leading the singing, perhaps even holding a small baton to beat the rhythm, directing, right? However, there is no accompanying piano music. The village primary school is poor and cannot afford an organ, let alone a "Pianola." But what does this matter? Every word and every sentence clearly and uniformly reverberates, becoming a small rhythmic tide, sometimes surging, thundering, sometimes subtly sinking down, flowing to the distant places. Who says village children are stupid!

I got up, and my friend got up too. We threw on our pajamas and walked out of the ancestral hall, deeply breathing in the "morning air." ——That can only be called "morning air." It is refreshing, but not gentle, assailing your nostrils. The breeze wrinkles the pond water in front of us. In the distance, there is still a hazy mist, unable to see the famous Centipede Mountain on the opposite side. The singing seems to never stop. This time, it is not just in the small school here reverberating. Over there, vaguely, there are rhythmic sound waves coming. Looking far away, there is clearly a faint light flickering. Is it a small lantern? Over there, it is clearly a swaying lantern: not only lanterns, but also a line of short, dark figures wriggling. It's children again. They are coming from all directions.

We crossed the village gate, carefully stepping on the mud road: the dew was not dry; it was slippery. I remembered that we should bring a flashlight: but my friend insisted on walking like this, saying that even if we slipped, it would be an unforgettable memory of this festival, filled with strangeness and joy. Finally, we arrived at the head of a bridge, and a beautiful picture unfolded before us. The eastern sky had a hint of dawn. On four or five field paths, children formed single-file lines, with one at the head carrying a lantern, leading. The rice plants were tall, and their bodies were small, only half their waists visible, winding forward in the golden straw. You could hear them singing about defending China, singing about the singers of the masses, singing about the national general mobilization, and singing their most familiar "My enemy is as fierce as a wolf." Most wonderfully, there were probably stone slab roads there. Besides the singing, you could also hear the children's clogs, "tuk-tuk-tat-tat," like the clacking of castanets.

We didn't know how many "armies" were coming towards us here. We were still wearing pajamas, not very presentable—— they were so solemn! Almost threatened, we wanted to retreat from the head of the bridge; but they all "opened" up and came. Coincidentally, the "five armies" almost converged on that side at the same time. Two of the roads first turned into one road, four teams turned into a long dragon, punctuated with light, singing the same song——of course, the most familiar "My enemy is as fierce as a wolf," crossing the bridge. The lanterns were raised high, illuminating us, seeming to want to see our faces clearly, truly embarrassing. ——They were so solemn! We could only applaud them, but we didn't sing along with them. Several of the children stopped singing, looked at us with hazy smiles, and all went to that small school. The eastern clouds began to shoot out brilliant red light.

This was three months ago; but a vivid impression still remains in my mind, occasionally the enthusiastic singing of that group of children still echoes. I came here and occasionally listen to the songs of the shoe-shiners. That place, in the thick and thin smoke of war, has forfeited a lot of its essence; those rice fields must have been harvested already, right? In the soil, only the dead roots of rice straw remain. The cold wind blows up dust, a bit desolate and sad, right? All the middle schools have dispersed, but the gates of the primary schools are still wide open. I believe that group of children is still there singing "My enemy is as fierce as a wolf!"

### Loyal Souls of March

— He Chengjiang

—Written for the Commemoration of the Martyrs of Huanghuagang—

For happiness, freedom,

The Great Unity and Universal Love

So that twenty-eight years ago today,

Our revolutionary martyrs:

Sacrificed the individual

And gave their lives to achieve a noble cause!

And so, heat and blood dyed: ——

Kapok, plum blossoms, azaleas and red apricots,

Also dyed the Blue Sky White Sun flag,

Look, all of this:

Isn't it all as blood-red, as fiery hot?

A gust of desolate wind,

A gust of bitter rain,

Paying respects to the loyal souls of March,

The stillness of midnight,

Then the cuckoo's miserable and wounded

Bleeding cry,

And so it cries out for the spirit of struggle of an excellent nation,

And weeps away the Pearl River moonlight of the Qing Dynasty.

The undying loyal souls of March.

Forever accompanying the yellow flowers and green grasses.

The green grass shakes itself for justice!

Three feet down in the loess layer, in a wooden coffin,

Lie buried the seeds of people's freedom.

Every year in March at Huanghuagang,

Excellent Chinese sons and daughters:

Solemnly and piously worship the revolutionary martyrs.

This year on this day, the Huanghua Festival,

On Huanghuagang, I fear there is only the tramp of barbarian cavalry

No! No! Perhaps there will be a second generation of

Martyrs, gloriously shedding blood!

We grieve and rage at the fall of Guangzhou,

If we do not recover Guangzhou, how can we face the revolutionary martyrs?

Today, we are in a faraway place,

Let us offer our respects to the sky!

Undying loyal souls of March!

We vow to continue your great spirit,

And rebuild China's beautiful and splendid mountains and rivers.

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

She silently stared at his dark figure, wanting to cry, but unable to.

"It's too cold outside, you should put on more clothes!"

Still silently staring at his dark figure—as if he were the source of all human misfortune.

"You can take some necessary little things. You love to play the piano, right? Take your sheet music!"

She was slightly surprised. She thought:

"You bandit, do you even know about sheet music?"

Then, she asked him:

"Have you ever studied?"

"Idle talk!" he thought. He said: "Hurry up and find what you want to take!"

So, she went to the table, opened an iron box, and immediately closed it; there didn't seem to be anything she needed there. When she opened a small box on the ground, there was a metallic sound. He took out a flashlight from his pocket and shone it. He bluntly asked:

"Is it a gun?" (Seventeen)
