### On Improving the Conscription System

"The rise and fall of the nation concerns every individual," is the most glorious traditional spirit of our Chinese ancestors. "Wielding weapons to defend the nation" is the most glorious right and duty of every citizen. However, this spirit of sacrificing for the sake of the world, the motherland, and society, has been suppressed layer upon layer through thousands of years of imperial and feudal systems. Even if not entirely hijacked by autocratic despots and local feudal forces, it has encountered numerous restraints and suppression, preventing its normal development. Consequently, cunning and fierce individuals resort to risky ventures, while honest and kind civilians regard military affairs with aversion. As a result, soldiers form a special class, and the state gradually loses the great significance of protecting national independence, freedom, and welfare.

When the all-out war of resistance began the year before last, the supreme leader proclaimed to the world: Regardless of north, south, east, or west, regardless of men, women, old, or young, all must rise up to resist the common enemy for the sake of national territory and sovereignty. Not fearing hardships, not sparing sacrifices, the enemy's aggression will not stop and our resistance will not cease. For nineteen months, our national soldiers, regardless of party affiliation or faction, have concentrated under the unified leadership of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, advancing wave upon wave, striving for national survival and seeking national liberation. The people from all walks of life across the country are also united as one, following the leader's instructions, supporting the government's national policies, and doing their utmost to serve the war of resistance and nation-building. However, we have ultimately failed to avoid losing territory and troops, and causing unprecedented losses to the masses of the people. Apart from the special political, economic, and historical conditions of our countries, and what we anticipated long ago, the failure to effectively concentrate all dynamic forces of the country under unified control to serve the war of resistance and nation-building is a major reason. Therefore, at this time when the second phase of the war of resistance is unfolding, we must fully accept this lesson, earnestly mobilize the nation's strength, support the protracted war of resistance, and strive for final victory.

The resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to establish the Supreme National Defense Council and to pay special attention to improving the conscription system are mainly intended to more effectively launch and concentrate all the dynamic forces of the country, especially the national manpower, to replenish the needs of the soldiers in the protracted war of resistance. Regarding the significance of the nature and significance of the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, this newspaper's editorials have provided detailed explanations in recent days, and I will not repeat them here. Regarding the improvement of the conscription system, after discussions at the Fifth Plenary Session, a complete plan has been decided. The Conscription Department of the Ministry of Military Administration has been formally established, and the Conscription Law has also been properly revised. The supreme leader has encouraged the gentry and educators of the country to assist the government in implementing conscription, and the central authorities have subsequently issued strict orders to civil and military officials across the country to make the implementation of conscription and the general mobilization of manpower the current priority. The government and the leader's efforts to improve and promote conscription in response to the needs of the war of resistance can be seen from this. In addition to urging compatriots across the country and overseas to do their utmost to support and assist the government in fulfilling its mission, we would like to offer our humble opinions for the government and related authorities to consider, which are roughly as follows:

Actively participating in conscription and striving for victory in the war of resistance is not only the duty of every citizen who does not want to be a slave, but also the sacred right of every citizen who loves freedom and justice. To enable every citizen to bravely grasp their rights and fulfill their obligations, we must first carry out widespread and in-depth propaganda and persuasion work, enhance every citizen's national self-esteem and self-confidence, break down pessimistic psychology, eliminate defeatist arguments, and eradicate the propositions of national traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and those advocating peace and anti-communism, which would destroy the country and exterminate the nation. This is the first point. Secondly, the main reasons why past conscription movements and mobilization work failed to achieve full results or even gave rise to various malpractices were the inadequacy of laws and regulations and the embezzlement of those who implemented the laws. Regarding the former, after this Fifth Plenary Session, major revisions have been made, such as the exemption of only sons and eldest sons from regular military service, and the general improvement of the treatment of conscripts. Regarding the latter, it is hoped that local civil and military officials, as well as the gentry and educators, will work together to assist the government and correct past mistakes. This is the second point. However, we believe that attention should also be paid to the following: First, the full development of the spirit of democracy and the universal realization of democratic politics, so as to enhance the enthusiasm and initiative of the people to participate in the war of resistance. Second, the considerable improvement of the people's livelihood and the thorough elimination of corrupt and inferior forces, so that the people's close relationship with the government and the country will be more keenly felt. In addition, the unification of the national youth movement, and the widespread absorption of all youth into the Three People's Principles Youth League, making it a strong cadre for mobilizing the people, promoting conscription, and completing the tasks of war of resistance and nation-building, are also key points that urgently need attention in improving the conscription system today.

### A Week in World Affairs

— Pan Lang

From January 28th to February 3rd, Year 28

This week, as January and February change, it's like finding a ray of sunshine in a storm. There are many gratifying news items to report to you. Domestically, it is the successful conclusion of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and there will be significant progress in politics, military affairs, economy, party affairs, civil affairs, and military affairs. Internationally, as the Fascist aggressive front becomes more frantic, the front that supports democracy, freedom, world peace has finally united more firmly. This unity can at least prevent the cruel imperialist war from progressing more frantically. However, behind the good news, the shadows of devils are still active. These devils will attack us more fiercely and ruthlessly, and we must unite to resist them resolutely!

General Review of the Fifth Plenary Session

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, held at the beginning of the new stage of the War of Resistance and National Construction, opened on January 21st and closed on the 30th. Its resolutions and declarations have been announced. It has a very important historical significance for the Chinese national liberation movement and the future of Eastern national revolution. The first thing to pay special attention to is that the Fifth Plenary Session declaration and the Sixth Plenary Session declaration of the Communist Party in October last year hold the same spirit, promote national unity, adhere to the protracted war of resistance, and determine that the purpose of China's revolutionary war of resistance today is to drive out the Japanese fascist aggressors, build a new China based on the Three People's Principles, and defend world peace and the progress of human culture. Secondly, in specific resolutions, the foundation for promoting national politics, military affairs, party affairs, civil affairs, and economic development has been established. The main ones are: (1) The establishment of a Supreme National Defense Council, absorbing leaders from various parties and circles to participate, with the National Government Military Affairs Commission and the central party departments serving as the executive organs for political, military, and civil affairs respectively, forming a national alliance or embryonic people's national defense supreme organ led by the Kuomintang and composed of various parties and circles. (2) Clearly stipulating that strengthening mass organizations, unifying mass movements, relieving people's suffering, and improving people's lives are prerequisites for winning the victory of the War of Resistance and National Construction. (3) Other resolutions on politics, military affairs, civil affairs, party affairs, and economy, such as expanding the War Zone Party and Government Committee, establishing a Conscription Department, revising the Conscription Law, improving the conscription system, appointing Chen Cheng as the Minister of Military Administration to actively improve military administration, appointing Ye Jianying to preside over the training of central guerrilla cadres and generals, improving the administrative organs of various provinces, cities, and counties, rebuilding the administrative power in Jiangnan, North China, and Northeast China, mobilizing Muslims and various ethnic minorities in the Southwest and Northwest, and the four major outlines of economic construction, the wartime finance, trade, education and other new plans, have laid the cornerstone for the bright future of the War of Resistance and National Construction. The above is the great achievement of the Fifth Plenary Session. However, how to implement all the plans based on these established foundations and strive for the glorious victory and future happiness depends on the cooperation of the people of the whole country!

### Summary of the Week's Military Situation

January 25th to 31st

[Dispatch from Central This Chongqing, 1st] The military situation this week is becoming more and more favorable to us on the northern and southern lines. Judging from the evolution of the overall war situation, it can be judged that the enemy army is increasingly trapped in the mire, and our army is moving towards a turning point of victory. Since the tenth week, the enemy has claimed that it will gather its ugly forces to attack the Shaanxi border in the west and the Beihai in the south, in order to compensate for our cutting off the international routes in northern Hubei and the southwest. In fact, the enemy military headquarters cannot absolutely fulfill the request of the Huabei and Shandong enemy divisions to separately assist in four and a half divisions of troops. Therefore, the threatening sounds of many days have provided fodder for laughter. Now, regarding the entire military situation, excerpts are listed on the left:

Guangdong Area

The enemy troops along the Guangzhou-Hankou, Guangzhou-Jiujiang, and Guangzhou-Sanshui lines have been quiet this week, showing a state of tranquility. After the enemy forces of about 1,000 troops occupied Huaxian last week, they were actively counterattacked by our army this week. The enemy suffered heavy losses and could not withstand it, and retreated in defeat. Now, Huaxian has been formally recovered by our army, and there is no trace of the enemy in the neighboring Juntian, Shiling, and other places. Also, the enemy troops who attacked our Jiegang and Shajing positions were jointly eliminated by a certain division of our army and the local police force, and have also slipped away towards Taiping. The enemy troops trapped in Guangzhou are still trapped in our encirclement and cannot move. As for the enemy troops in Wuzhou, although there are more than 2,000 of them, most of them are Taiwanese, Korean, and Shandong puppet troops, and there are very few regular troops. The enemy continues to cruise uncertainly in the waters near Beihai, which seems to be a bluff. Only a small aircraft carrier is currently docked in Wuzhou, which is a microcosm of the enemy's depleted strength.

Shanxi Area

Currently, after our army successively recovered important points such as Jixian, Daning, and Xiangning last week, the enemy's attempt to cross the river to invade Shaanxi has become a bubble. In a fit of shame, the enemy turned to plan from the southwestern Jin triangle, disregarding the lesson of mobilizing troops for several months and sacrificing thousands of people last time, and once again launched a desperate fierce attack on the heroic soldiers defending the Zhongtiao Mountains, hoping to use the clearing of this triangle area to lay the foundation for future attacks to the west. Starting on the 25th, about 3,000 enemy troops from Jiexian advanced towards our Zhongtiao Mountain positions in three routes, accompanied by cannons and bombers. At the same time, more than 2,000 enemy troops were sent to attack Heshun from Shouyang in eastern Jin, echoing each other remotely. After our officers and soldiers fought desperately in recent days, the enemy troops in Jiexian have collapsed and fled after suffering heavy losses of more than 1,000 casualties. On the Heshun front, after our army seriously wounded their senior commander, they temporarily withdrew. However, our army annihilated more than 1,000 enemy troops in Guandimiao, Zijing, and Shangchuan, making them dare not advance again. Our goal of consuming the enemy's army has been achieved.

Hunan-Hubei Area

The military situation in northern Hunan is calm. Most of the enemy troops in the Yueyang area have withdrawn to Hubei Province and concentrated in Huangpi and Xiaogan, seemingly planning some action. However, the military situation in Jingshan in central Hubei and Xihe in northeastern Hubei in recent days has shown that whatever plans the enemy has, they will eventually become dreams. Although Jingshan and Tianmen successively fell last week, after our army fought bravely and counterattacked, Jingshan was once recovered. We are still fighting fiercely with the enemy troops in the western suburbs of the county seat. We are still holding our solid positions and actively advancing. In the Battle of Guanyin Rock, about 800 to 900 enemy troops were killed. In the Battle of Xihe a few days ago, the enemy unit's Major General Wei Teng and Captain Ota were both killed by us. The enemy troops in that area have suffered a total of more than 3,000 casualties in the past month, smashing the enemy's planned invasion conspiracy.

Other Military Situations

In the Henan area, the enemy troops in northern Henan launched an attack on our positions from Bo'ai and Xiuwu this week with more than 2,000 main forces. After our army desperately resisted, more than 400 enemy troops were killed, and the remaining enemy troops fled back in panic. The enemy troops of more than 2,000 in Weishi and Fengwan in southern Henan attempted to cross the Yellow River to invade the west, but were completely annihilated. In the southern Anhui area, the more than 2,000 enemy troops who attacked us from Wanzhi continued to be annihilated this week, and only about 800 remnants fled, losing more than one-third. In the Hebei area, our army engaged in fierce battles with the enemy troops in Zhulu and captured many of them. In the Suiyuan area, after the enemy's attempt to attack Dongsheng failed last week, there is currently no movement. However, the 3,000 to 4,000 puppet troops of the 4th and 6th Divisions of the puppet Autonomous Army stationed in Guyang and Wuchuan, and the puppet army unit of Gong Shengzu in Delinghe have successively defected and returned to us in recent days, causing a great blow to the enemy troops in that area.

Conclusion

Looking at the military situation this week, although the enemy army has claimed that it will do this and that to us, in reality, it only shows its outward strength and inner weakness, and the embarrassment of being exhausted. However, the enemy's final attempt will never be abandoned. Looking at the enemy's stupidity in the southwestern Jin triangle and the continuous increase of the enemy puppet troops in Wuzhou Island, it is enough to prove the enemy's future trend. Moreover, the enemy has recently been forcing our young men to join the army everywhere in the occupied areas in the north and south, making the voices of our people's resistance stronger, making the enemy's plan impossible to implement, and their intention to remedy the lack of military strength, and their ambitious cunning to launch a large-scale offensive are becoming more and more intense, then it can be asserted that the prelude to our fierce battle with the enemy is unfolding, just like a drawn bow ready to be released.

### Enemy Submarines Collide with Each Other Tank Brigade River

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] According to the official gazette issued by the Japanese Naval Ministry today, two submarines collided in the "after waterway" while participating in exercises yesterday morning. One of them sank immediately, and efforts are being made to rescue the crew. The submarine was built in 1928, and the equipment is new and conspicuous. It can cross the Pacific Ocean. The cause of the collision is still unclear.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 1st] The Second Half New City southeast of Jukou was occupied by the enemy, who massacred civilians. The day before yesterday, our army launched a fierce counterattack and recovered the area. In this battle, we suffered more than 30 casualties among officers and soldiers, killed 41 enemy soldiers and more than 180 puppet soldiers, and destroyed 9 enemy vehicles. Because the enemy retreated in panic at night, one tank and two armored vehicles fell into the water when passing through the Yellow River.

### Yu Bin's Talk in France Our Military Strength is Getting Stronger Mechanized Units are Increasing Daily National Defense Industry is Growing Extremely Fast

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 3rd] Yu Bin, the Catholic Bishop of Nanjing, told a reporter from the French Radical Party yesterday that the strength of the Chinese army this year is stronger than last year. There are currently 200 divisions of soldiers, more than five mechanized brigades, and 4 million guerrillas, most of whom are farmers in the Japanese-occupied areas. 2,000 people are killed in the rear of the Japanese army every month. Since China received a large amount of economic aid last November, it has been able to prepare for a long-term war of resistance. China is now manufacturing guns, artillery, and machine guns. According to the above conversation, it was released after Yu attended a banquet given by the Chinese Ambassador to France. Yu will go to the United States during the day to promote the significance of China's war of resistance.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Zeng Baofang (transliteration), the founder of Yifan Women's University in Changsha and the granddaughter of Zeng Guofan, came here today for the Ulas International Publicity Conference. She gave a speech here via wireless teleprompter, becoming the first Chinese woman to transmit a teleprompter. She described in detail how Chinese women are engaged in treating wounded soldiers, relieving refugees, and participating in training in the midst of gunfire. Ms. Zeng is the only female cadre in the training camp. She said that she agrees that the clothing of women and men in the training camp should be different, but other cadres agree that they should be treated equally. Currently, young women also love military training and long-distance marching. Ms. Ding will stay here for two or three months to chat with old friends from Xitian University.

### This Port's Foreign Reports Wang to Go to France and Italy Mei Siping to Go to Henan

[Report from This Port's Public Society] According to yesterday morning's Tenth-Class West Newspaper, Wang Jingwei previously sent a brilliant telegram in response to the proposal of the enemy Prime Minister Konoe to advocate peace, which led to unanimous criticism from the people of the country. In order to uphold the law, the authorities have permanently expelled him from the party. After secretly leaving Chongqing on January 8th, Wang has been living in Hanoi. He has now requested the central authorities to issue a passport to go abroad, which has been approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing. He will leave Vietnam for France within the earliest period. Those traveling with him include his wife, Chen Xuejun, and Zeng Zhongming. Seeing this, since Wang is determined to go to Europe, the rumors that the Japanese will appoint him to a puppet organization in Nanjing are certainly unbelievable.

[News from This Port] According to reliable sources, Mei Siping, who co-signed Wang Jingwei's brilliant telegram with Lin Baisheng, recently secretly left Guangzhou for Shanghai. Mei's trip was to discuss matters with the Wang faction figures in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he visited important figures.

### Mr. Hu Yuzhi's Lecture: The Current Situation of the War of Resistance (Continued and Completed)

— Notes by Our Correspondent

——At the Hong Kong YWCA——

What will happen to us if a world war breaks out? If we can stand on our own feet, we have nothing to fear. Our strength to resist the Japanese can also be expanded. A world war is beneficial to us.

Although Germany and Italy are allies of Japan, they have their own contradictions and interests. It is not easy for Germany and Italy to help Japan. Because Germany and Italy also understand that after Japan invades China, it will never share the benefits with European countries. Germany's current collusion with Japan is originally intended to demonstrate its strength to various powers. From Germany's perspective, it is very eager for Japan to stop its use of force against China. Because every bit of strength that Japan consumes today is one more difficulty that Germany will face against the Soviet Union and Britain tomorrow. So, can Japan accept Germany's advice and withdraw its troops? The Japanese warlords have already ridden the tiger's back and have no choice but to risk making mistakes to the end. The contradictions between them will naturally deepen gradually. In particular, it will cause Japan to sink deeper and deeper into a difficult situation. Therefore, no matter from which aspect we look at it, the current situation of the second phase of the War of Resistance is indeed much more favorable than the first phase. We should seize these favorable conditions and continue to work hard and fight to the end.

We must know that although we should be optimistic, we must not forget our difficulties. Fortunately, there are now solutions to these difficulties, but we hope to use everyone's strength to strengthen them and make them more practical: First, is the problem of political institutions.

In the past, the Party, the military, and the government were quite complex and had not been properly adjusted. The [blanks] Plenary Session decided to establish a Supreme National Defense Council, with progressive generals who are bravely resisting the war as the main force. This is in line with the needs of the current phase of the War of Resistance. At the same time, it can also make all parties and factions more united and ensure the final victory. We should strengthen this developing trend from the perspective of the country.

Second, is the problem of military service.

The replenishment of soldiers is very important. We must strengthen the political education of strong men, eliminate the malpractice of conscription, and provide compensation to the families of soldiers… Although there are solutions to these [blanks] problems, they all urgently need our efforts.

Third, is the problem of economic construction.

A long-term [blanks] war needs economic [blanks] support. Now there is a shortage of capital and talent in the inland economic construction. In fact, we are not fundamentally without capital and talent, but they have not been properly coordinated. This point is especially hoped for by patriotic overseas Chinese.

In summary, whether they are compatriots at home or abroad, they must stand on their own posts and contribute everything they have to the sacred War of Resistance—Although Hong Kong is not the front line, and it is a place managed by foreigners, as long as we have the heart to resist the war, there will be ways to resist the war. For example, wounded soldiers [blanks] urgently need us to rescue them, and domestic economic construction urgently needs us to help with capital or manpower [blanks]. These are all necessary tasks for the War of Resistance and national construction.

The most important thing is that our spirit must be concentrated and our strength must be united. The enemy is not only on the front line, but also mixed among us. We should have sharp eyes to distinguish everything and let the strength of the entire nation form a solid force. The god of victory is already smiling and greeting us! The future of the Chinese nation has already been ignited with bright sparks! (The End)

### Circumstances of the Assassination of Ma Yuhang, Councilor of the Puppet "Renovation Government": Shot in the Head in the Xin Xin Hotel in Shanghai, Died of Serious Injuries That Night

[Shanghai Correspondence] An assassination case occurred at approximately 7:00 PM on the evil 29th of last month at the Xin Xin [blanks] Hotel on Guizhou Road in the Shanghai Public Concession. The culprit has not been apprehended. The inside story has political implications. [Blanks] I will describe the situation as follows.

From Hong Kong

Around the 26th of last month, a male traveler, nearly sixty years old, arrived at the Xin Xin Hotel on Guizhou Road. Judging by his demeanor and conversation, he did not seem to be a wealthy person. At that time, the hotel receptionist guided him to room number 605 on the sixth floor, providing him with accommodation. He wrote "Mr. Cai, Cantonese, age 41" on the hotel guest registry. When asked where he came from, he replied that he came from Hong Kong and claimed that he was visiting relatives and friends.

Guests Filled the Room

In recent days, he has rarely gone out, but there have been quite a few visitors every day, all of whom are upper-class guests. Therefore, the room is often full of guests, and the host [blanks] receives [blanks] them frequently. The waiters [blanks] serve [blanks] diligently and provide attentive service. At around 7:30 PM on the 29th, more than a dozen guests were chatting with the host in the room. At that time, the host was wearing a gray serge cotton-padded jacket, white corduroy pants, and slippers. He sat on the sofa chair to the right of the door, holding the evening newspaper and reading and talking with a satisfied expression.

Suddenly a Shot Was Heard

At that moment, Chang Kou, a waiter near the room, suddenly heard a gunshot from [blanks] inside the room. He then saw many of the guests who had been in the room rushing out and fleeing for their lives, and shouts of alarm also arose. The waiters hurried to investigate and saw that there was no one in the room. The traveler surnamed Cai had [blanks] fallen to the ground, covered in blood, and was still crying out. The waiters were terrified and reported to the front desk, who then reported to the police.

Only a Trace of Breath Remaining

The Lao Zha Police Station was nearby. Upon receiving the alarm, they immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. At that time, this reporter also rushed to the scene after hearing the news. The tables and chairs in the room were overturned and in disarray. The injured person was still lying stiffly on the ground, with bloodstains covering the surroundings. Upon examination, only a faint trace of breath remained. At that time, detectives carried him to the ambulance and rushed him to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. At the same time, they searched for clues in the room, picking up a bullet casing and photographing all the footprints and fingerprints in the room, [blanks] and returning them to the police station for storage [blanks].

Died of His Injuries

After the injured person was sent to the hospital [blanks], the hospital examined his injuries and discovered that the bullet had entered from the left Taiyang point and exited from under the right ear, completely damaging the brain. Therefore, despite various treatments, he was ultimately unable to [blanks] recover. He died at 9:45 PM that evening. At that time, the hospital [blanks] informed the police station and [blanks] sent [blanks] officers to investigate. [Blanks] A business card and a travel permit issued to him by the "Renovation Government" were found next to his body. Thus, his name was revealed. The body will be sent to the Zhou Road Morgue for examination on the 30th.

Name Discovered

The name printed on the business card was Ma Yuhang. The travel permit also bore the name [blanks] Yu [blanks] Hang, issued by Wen Zongyao, a [blanks] official of the puppet "Renovation Government" [blanks] Legislative Yuan. The position field stated "Councilor of the Puppet Renovation Government." At that time, this reporter recalled that Mr. Ma had served as a Councilor of the National Government Military Affairs Commission, [blanks] served on the National [blanks] Resources Committee, and was the Shantou General Manager of the South China Rice Company. [Blanks] At this time of the War of Resistance, if he had any conscience, he would never do such a heartless and insane thing. Perhaps there is another [blanks] person. [Blanks] After comparing the photograph with the real Ma Yuhang, it was confirmed to be the same person.

Brief Biography of the Deceased

According to [blanks], Ma Yuhang was from Huizhou, Guangdong [blanks], and was sixty years old. He was a Xiucai in the late Qing Dynasty. [Blanks] He entered the Guangdong School of Law and Politics and was a fellow villager of Chen [blanks] Ming. In 1920, he served as the General Manager of the Shantou [blanks] Military Payment Bureau. In 1921, he served as the Head of the Hainan Island Civil Administration Office, Director of the Guangdong Department of Finance, and Director of the Economic [blanks] Investigation Bureau. Since this case occurred, the police have been investigating tirelessly. As for the circumstances of the [blanks] incident, how the culprit entered, or whether he was mixed among the guests in the room, it is still difficult to analyze at this time and is still under close [blanks] interrogation.

### Soviet Union Severs Relations with Hungary; Hungary Joins Anti-Comintern Pact, Has Lost Qualifications for Independent Diplomacy

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov today notified the Hungarian Minister to Moscow that since Soviet-Hungarian diplomatic relations have been severed, the Soviet Embassy in Budapest will be closed immediately. Therefore, the Hungarian Embassy in Moscow should also be closed immediately. Furthermore, the Soviet view is that since Hungary has been forced to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, it has lost its independent status and become a vassal of the German-Italian Axis, naturally losing its qualifications for independent diplomacy. Therefore, the Soviet Union has decided to sever diplomatic relations, it is said.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov yesterday notified the Hungarian Minister to the Soviet Union that the Soviet government, in view of Germany's oppression of Hungary's internal affairs and Hungary's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, has decided to sever diplomatic [blanks] relations with Hungary, it is said.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 2nd] The Soviet government recently severed diplomatic relations with Hungary and issued a communiqué stating that since the Munich Agreement was concluded on September 5 of last year, Hungary has been under foreign pressure and its independence has been partially lost. More recently, the country signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which in fact all signatory countries, especially Japan, have aggressive goals. This is completely contrary to Hungary's interests, and Hungary has no reason to agree to it. It is undoubtedly due to foreign pressure. Under these circumstances, there is no need to send an ambassador to reside in the other capital to maintain diplomatic relations. This relationship can be handled by representatives of both parties residing in the capital of a third country in the future, it is said.

Major Blow to German-Italian Anti-Communist Plan

[Associated Press, Moscow, 3rd] According to an official announcement, due to Hungary's signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, the Soviet Union has severed normal [blanks] relations with Hungary. The Soviet Embassy in Budapest has been ordered to close. At the same time, the Hungarian government has been notified to close its embassy in Moscow.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd] [Blanks] The Soviet Union's sudden announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with Hungary has aroused extraordinary attention from official and diplomatic circles here. There is much speculation as to whether the Soviet Union will take the same steps against countries that have joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. According to some [blanks] sources, Germany and Italy intend to pull as many European countries as possible into the Anti-Comintern Pact this year to increase their strength. Therefore, the Soviet Union's unusual move may be a prelude to the continued severance of diplomatic relations with small countries such as Czechoslovakia. It is reported that Germany, in addition to attacking in newspapers, is also planning retaliatory measures. However, it is generally believed that [blanks] the Soviet Union will not break with Germany.

Pro-Soviet Conspiracy Exposed; Germany Recalls Director Shi

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd] Shi Nule, Director of the Eastern European Section of the Commercial Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came here a few days ago, originally intending to go to Moscow for official business. He has now given up and returned to Berlin today. According to German sources, sensational news was released about Shi Nule's trip, even saying that he intended to consult with the Soviet authorities on the issue of Germany supplying military equipment to the Soviet Union. Berlin has now recalled him, perhaps for this reason, it is said.

Soviet Union Promulgates New Regulations to Improve Military Trials

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The "Times" correspondent in Warsaw reported that the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party has approved the request of senior Red Army officers to reduce the power of political commissars over judges. New regulations have been promulgated, stipulating that when officers of the rank of colonel or above are to be tried for dereliction of duty or other political offenses, they should not be handled by meetings organized by their subordinates or lower courts, but must be tried by a court composed of officers of the same or higher rank, it is said.

Japan Discriminates Against Soviet Envoys; Soviet Union Protests

[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] The Japanese Foreign Ministry recently requested the Soviet Embassy to release the "Shirakaba Maru" and "Tsurukong Maru," two ships previously detained by the Soviet Union. At that time, Shiba, the secretary of the Soviet Embassy, also protested against the Japanese side's discrimination against [blanks] the [blanks] personnel.

[Reuters, Tokyo, [Blanks] day] "Manchukuo" has lodged a serious protest with the Soviet Consulate in Harbin regarding the alleged border conflict between Manchuria and the Soviet Union on the first of this month. It is said that 100 Soviet soldiers crossed the border near Han Ke Xili and opened [blanks] fire on the Manchurian defense forces. The "Manchu" soldiers returned fire. After more than an hour of fighting, the Soviet troops were defeated, leaving five corpses and three wounded soldiers. There were no casualties on the Japanese side. However, the Soviet report stated that 18 "Manchu" soldiers attacked five Soviet guards, resulting in seven wounded "Manchu" soldiers and only one wounded Soviet soldier, it is said.

European Public Opinion Considers Small Countries as a Major Lesson

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 2nd] After the Soviet government suddenly severed diplomatic relations with Hungary, diplomatic officials from various countries here, including personnel from the Hungarian Embassy, were surprised. People in Soviet political circles said that since Hungary has signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, its position has been determined. The Soviet government resolutely severed foreign relations with it. This move is not only used to deal with Hungary, but also to warn other countries that want to follow in its footsteps, such as Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Turkey. As for Yugoslavia, although the country [blanks] recognizes [blanks] the Soviet Union, it can also learn a lesson from this.

### The United States Aids Democratic Countries; Britain and France Enthusiastically Support; Sufficient to Restore European Balance of Power; Thereby Saving the World from the Scourge of War

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] After Roosevelt announced aid to European democratic countries, newspapers everywhere published this news in the most prominent positions. Britain and France, in particular, paid close attention. The public opinion expressed great favor, believing that this move by the United States is sufficient to restore the balance of power in Europe, strike at dictators, and perhaps save the world from the scourge of war.

### Germany and Italy Panic Upon Hearing the News; Newspapers Ordered to Slander

[Associated Press, Berlin] German newspapers and news agencies are attacking Roosevelt's foreign policy, [blanks] saying that Roosevelt's move is an interference in European affairs and is intended to divert attention from domestic affairs. Although officials have no intention of expressing opinions, newspapers under government control are writing extensively about it, which shows a glimpse of the German impression of the United States.

[Associated Press, Rome, 3rd] Gai Da published an editorial in the "Italian Daily" stating that after Roosevelt issued his declaration, the German-Italian defense line must be extended to the Panama [blanks]. Gai Da said that the US President's declaration was a kind of "premeditated provocation." We really do not understand why Roosevelt had a sudden mental disorder and made this declaration to the military committee. But [blanks] the painstaking efforts of European politicians to seek peace will surely be shattered. This declaration seems to have the suspicion of an open challenge. Roosevelt has openly taken an offensive against Germany. He has moved the American offensive line to the Inn River. Germany and Italy have to move the defense line to the Panama Canal.

### American Opposition Opposes Roosevelt

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The sale of American planes to France and Roosevelt's foreign policy have aroused the opposition of some congressmen. The criticism from some quarters is very severe. Among them, "I, Mi, Yi" is expected to be revealed today, because Congressman Gala will raise questions at today's Senate Car Committee seat and request that the content be announced. Some people believe that Roosevelt's foreign policy is using European issues to gain popular sympathy and support [blanks] in order to prepare [blanks] for a third presidential election.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Nine Republican members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee issued a statement yesterday saying that the President's secretive and neutral attitude of selling arms to France is something they strongly oppose. The United States sells aircraft and military equipment to countries that have diplomatic relations with the United States, and no one expresses opposition to this. However, this kind of transaction should not violate the United States' neutral policy, or cause the United States to be involved in foreign disputes and threaten the peace of the United States. They advocate that the government should adhere to the traditional foreign [blanks] policy of the United States, namely, a policy of neutrality, non-interference, and maintaining peace.

### Roosevelt's Position is Stable; The Entire American People Unanimously Support; The Activities of the Reactionaries are Groundless

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] According to people close to the government, after observing the recent development of foreign policy, it is believed that Roosevelt's position remains as strong as ever. They declared four points of freedom:

1. Roosevelt's recent declaration was non-public, so no one can attack it based on it.

2. There is no doubt that President Roosevelt has the power to decide policy.

3. Former President Hoover's attack speech was initiated by his former Secretary of State Stimson, who was actually a supporter of anti-fascism and the abolition of the embargo on arms to Spain.

4. Anyone who opposes President Roosevelt will surely receive the praise of German, Italian and Japanese newspapers, but this is what the American people most hate, it is said. (Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd) Interior Minister Ikes declared here yesterday that there is no danger of the United States being involved in an international war during the current administration.

### American Relief Bill Passed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] [Blanks] The government's relief fund bill, which stipulates the allocation of $725,000,000 to continue the relief program until June 30, has been formally passed by Congress after many twists and turns and has been signed and promulgated by the White House.

### British-American Mail Flight to Commence Next Month

[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] According to this morning's Daily Mail, British Imperial Airways will dispatch mail planes to and from Britain and the United States regularly starting March 15. Each flight will take off from [blanks] Ton early in the morning and arrive in New York in 18 hours. The route will take the direction of Ireland, Putwood, and Montico. For the first few months, there will be one flight per week, and then the frequency will be increased. It is estimated that the cost of crossing the Atlantic each time will be £2,000, it is said.

### British House of Commons Discusses Sino-British Construction Cooperation; The Amount of Credit Guarantees is Extremely Large; The Total Should Not Be Disclosed According to Law

(Central News Agency, London, 3rd) The Department of Trade authorities replied in the House yesterday to a question from a Member of Parliament regarding the Export Guarantees Act, saying that if the Chinese side requests to invoke the Export Guarantees Act to purchase railway materials and other materials, the total amount of the transactions in their minds is extremely large, and the amount of credit guarantees required may exceed the scope stipulated in the Export Guarantees Act. Therefore, if the government decides to take action, it will naturally prepare another bill for discussion in the House. From an international point of view, the total amount of credit guarantees given to various countries should not be disclosed, it is said.

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain Reports on Military Expansion Plan: Army, Navy, Air Force, and Treasury Cooperate; Arduous Work Nears Completion

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the Military Expansion Advisory Committee has submitted its report. According to the report on the military expansion plan, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, together with the Treasury, have worked diligently to overcome extreme difficulties and complete arduous tasks. All relevant departments can maintain high efficiency and possess foresight. For example, some new industries were created single-handedly by the authorities. The greatness of this kind of construction is probably not fully understood by all sectors of society. Without the enthusiastic cooperation of the relevant parties, it would not have been possible. The shortcomings of Britain's national strength in the past have either been remedied or are in the process of being remedied, and everything is proceeding at the highest possible speed.

Air Defense Has Made Progress

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The report of British Minister of Health Elliot today stated that British air defenses have made progress. He said that the Ministry of Health has formulated a plan to allow existing hospitals to accommodate 200,000 people within 24 hours in an emergency. Afterwards, the attached parts of each hospital can be used to accommodate tens of thousands more people. Anderson reported on the fire protection situation, saying that 3,500 fire engines are now available. Since September last year, the government has ordered a large number of fire engines and is trying to accelerate this manufacturing.

Protective Organization is Complete

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Home Defense Minister Anderson reported today on the British public protection organization plan. The plan has been completed, and it already has a prototype in peacetime. In an emergency, it will be implemented in full. According to the plan, the country is divided into zones, each zone is equipped with a commissioner, who is a person who understands national affairs and bears great responsibility. Scotland and Wales will also have a commissioner. When local and central governments lose contact, the commissioner will have full authority to handle everything. Although the commissioner's power does not extend to every aspect, it will become a liaison between the people and the military authorities. The plan establishes a defensive organization and establishes 38 local officials responsible for handling local issues on the spot, in order to share the labor of the central government.

### Belgian Veterans Hold Demonstration; Prime Minister's Forehead Injured

[Reuters, Belgium, 2nd] Belgian veterans held a demonstration here today. Near Prime Minister Pierlot's residence, they attacked Pierlot. At that time, Pierlot was driving back to his residence and was attacked as soon as he got out of the car, injuring his forehead.

### Hitler's Demonic Hand Reaches Memel

— Qiu Xuan

Memel (also known as Klaipėda) is located on the right bank of the Neman River in Lithuania. The area covers a total of 2,848 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 150,000. Among them, 57% are Lithuanians, and the rest are Germans. It originally belonged to Germany. In 1923, it was assigned to Lithuania according to the Treaty of Versailles. Its Klaipėda port is Lithuania's only gateway on the Baltic Sea, occupying a special and important position in the country's economic life.

In 1924, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and the Lithuanian government signed the Memel Agreement, granting the area extensive autonomy. It stipulated that the people of the area would elect 29 members to form a parliament as the legislative body, with a term of three years. It was also responsible for the establishment of the Executive Yuan, which was responsible to the parliament. The Lithuanian government has always complied with the agreement. Since Hitler came to power, the Fascist running dogs have been plotting to incorporate the area into the German territory as early as 1933. However, this conspiracy had no basis among the people in the area. It was subsequently exposed by the Lithuanian government, and the main culprits, Neumann and Sass, were arrested and imprisoned. As a result, German-Lithuanian relations broke down. The two countries used the boycott of Lithuanian agricultural product imports as a threat, but Lithuania quickly obtained a better market in other countries, and exports continued to sell unhindered. Germany's plan failed. In February 1936, it used threats and inducements to change officials and negotiated with Lithuania to restore commercial relations. The Lithuanian government accepted its request and made some concessions in politics, the most important of which were the release of Neumann and Sass from prison in the summer of 1937 and the declaration of the dissolution of the Klaipėda country. Hitler's followers in Memel were like beasts let out of a cage, acting recklessly. They organized the so-called "Klaipėda German Cultural Alliance." They used various crude and despicable methods to threaten the Germans in Lithuania to join and be driven by them. On November 1, 1938, Fascist party members paraded and demonstrated to celebrate the lifting of martial law in the Klaipėda area, shouting "Heil Hitler" and other slogans; at the same time, they also destroyed Lithuanian schools and institutions. They arbitrarily insulted passers-by. In small towns such as Shelut and Pagėgiai, they did not hesitate to buy off backward workers and farmers to participate in this celebration. There were riots every day in theaters, markets, and other public places. Fascist thugs shouted "Kill all Jews, kill all Lithuanians." German students in schools also violently beat Jewish and Lithuanian students. After the Munich Conference, the poisonous flames of Fascism were like adding fuel to the fire, and they have already spread to Lithuania.

Hitler's purpose was to lure Poland into dividing Lithuania, intending to recover the lost territories of the corridor and East Prussia from Poland, while falsely promising Poland to seek compensation from Lithuania and Latvia.

Hitler's followers in Memel, taking advantage of the fact that German members occupied the vast majority in the parliamentary re-election on September 29, 1938, demanded to be incorporated into Germany. Later, after the Lithuanian government appealed to the great powers to intervene and prevent it, it was spared. As it stands now, the so-called guarantors of the Memel Agreement have long been softened after the Munich Conference. Even if the Lithuanian government goes to cry, it is like begging for nothing from a wooden puppet. It will not have any effect. Hitler promised with great certainty at the representative conference held by the Memel Party members in Königsberg in Germany that they would be "liberated" in the summer of 1939.

Lithuania's national fortune is in jeopardy. Its future depends on (1) whether it can realize that it must thoroughly clear out the Fascist thugs in the country and pull closer to the Soviet Union, and (2) whether Poland can establish an international anti-Fascist barrier with Eastern European countries to seek self-defense together. Currently, Hitler is using the "Great Ukrainian Independence Movement" to coerce Poland into becoming his accomplice in invasion. Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to Hitler in Berlin will certainly discuss this issue. If these two prerequisites cannot be achieved, then not only will Lithuania be Hitler's possession, but also the small countries of Eastern Europe will inevitably be defeated individually and perish together.

### French Leaders Meet to Purchase Arms Abroad

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] Former Prime Minister Daladier, Finance Minister Reynaud, Army Minister Campinchi, and Foreign Minister Bonnet, and other cabinet members, held a meeting today to discuss the proposal to purchase arms from foreign countries, especially focusing on the United States. Daladier and others carefully considered the issue of payment for orders. The aviation reporter of "Le Grand Soir" claimed that Campinchi had informed the Aviation Committee of the Ministry of Commerce a few days ago that the government had ordered 50 of the fastest Dutch fighter jets, which will soon be shipped to France.

Germany's Seizure of Colonies Will Undergo Significant Changes

[Reuters, London, 3rd] A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Mail here claimed that the way Germany seizes colonies will undergo new and important changes in the near future. According to what I have learned, the branches of the German Colonial Union have been ordered to end their research on "our old colonies" and concentrate their efforts on demanding new colonies of equal value to those ruled by European countries today.

Germany Decides to Increase Submarine Tonnage

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] The Foreign Office issued a communique today stating that the British and German naval representatives held friendly talks in Berlin on December 30th last year. After consultation, the German government submitted a written note on the 18th of last month, deciding to gradually increase the total tonnage of submarines to be equal to that of Britain from 1939 onwards, according to the rights conferred by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and to change the two B-class cruisers (K) currently under construction into A-class cruisers.

Italian Premier Mussolini Will Make Wild Remarks Today

[Reuters, London, 3rd] A Berlin correspondent for the Times claims that "well-informed sources here speculate that Mussolini's speech at the Fascist High Council on the 4th of this month will explain his definite wishes for France, and the European crisis may unfold as a result. However, the tense period should be two or three weeks later." The correspondent concluded, "It is difficult to predict how long this crisis will last."

French Senator Secretly Colludes with Spanish Rebels

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] Senator Billard took a train today through the French-Spanish border to the rebel government's location. When leaving the station, Franco's representative in Paris, De Lion, saw him off and shook hands in farewell. Billard claimed that he was only "visiting the Franco government as a friend." It is understood that Billard had been working hard to arrange for Spanish refugees to return to their homeland as a preliminary step for France to recognize the Franco government. Although Billard did not intend to act as a mediator on this trip, he will do his best to collect information and report to the government in preparation for signing a commercial agreement with Franco.

### British Budget for This Year is £1.2 Billion

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] According to a dispatch written by a political reporter for the News Evening Post, the total British budget for 1939 to 1940 is £1.2 billion. Today's cabinet meeting discussed the budget proposal, of which £200 million is used for the Air Force. Last year's budget totaled £1.034 billion, of which only £75 million was allocated to the Air Force.

### US Naval Maneuvers to Be Held in the South Atlantic; Promote Cooperation between South American Naval and Air Forces

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] The United States will hold naval maneuvers in the Lower Caribbean Sea and the South Atlantic. These maneuvers will inform Latin American countries that any joint defense plans in the Western Hemisphere require close cooperation between naval and air forces. According to senior naval authorities, the United States will notify the naval and land armies of various Latin American countries of the results of this exercise. It is understood that the fleet participating in the exercise is divided into two aspects: attack and defense. The aircraft involved in the exercise include about 600 new bombers and fighter jets. It is generally expected that the results of this exercise will have a serious impact on future military construction.

US Establishes Naval and Air Force Base in San Juan

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] According to responsible sources here, the Navy Department has drafted a plan to establish a permanent air force base and military port in San Juan. The Navy Department's plan is not affected by the protracted independence of Puerto Rico. Cuba has a similar situation. According to reports, a local department of Puerto Rico will carry out activities to seek administrative independence, and the petition has been submitted to Congress, but it has not yet begun to be discussed. Puerto Rico is an autonomous region under the rule of the US government, and the government allows it to establish its rights.

US Naval Committee Debates the Construction of Base Case

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The US Naval Committee is currently hotly debating the construction of naval base bills. The bill includes the construction of a naval base in Guam. Republican member Myers, "According to the accurate information I have obtained, Japan has built strong defenses on the Caroline Islands. I propose to amend the current bill and immediately build solid fortifications in Guam." Republican member Chiu asked whether the Navy Department could guarantee that the construction of defenses in Guam would not exceed $500 million. Navy spokesman General Mallory remained silent.

US Treasury Secretary Denies Allocating Funds to Help France Purchase Aircraft

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters today that the claim in Congress that the government had transferred $200 million from the financial balance special fund to help France purchase aircraft in the United States was completely untrue. The government has not directly or indirectly assisted any country in purchasing goods in the United States. The Treasury Department's accounts are open and can be inspected by the Congressional Committee at any time. However, for the sake of public interest, some transactions are not convenient to disclose, and representatives of other countries are willing to keep their actions secret when they carry out activities in the United States with their own country's money.

### Brief Commentary: Soviet Union Severs Relations with Hungary

Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov announced yesterday (3rd) that the Soviet Union had severed diplomatic relations with Hungary. The reason given was that Hungary had joined the Anti-Comintern Pact and, under the strong pressure of Germany and Italy, had become a vassal of the German-Italian Axis, fundamentally losing its national independence and independent diplomatic qualifications. The Soviet Union could not continue to maintain diplomatic relations with a "country" that had lost its national character.

From the Soviet Union's announcement of the severance of relations with Hungary, the following facts can also be recognized:

First, the Japanese aggressors and others recently promoted Hungary and Manchukuo joining the "Anti-Comintern Pact," claiming that it "strengthened" the forces of the anti-communist bloc. The Soviet Union's move is a merciless satire and refutation of this so-called "strengthening."

Second, recently, the advance teams of the Fascist aggressors have spread rumors of so-called "Sino-Soviet rapprochement" in order to insult the Kuomintang government. The Soviet Union's move shows its uncompromising attitude towards the anti-communist bloc and shattered all shameless rumors and insults. (The head of the Eastern European Department of the German Foreign Ministry, who was rumored to be responsible for the "alliance with Russia," has now been summoned back to Berlin, which further proves that the so-called German-Soviet rapprochement is purely a rumor spread by the aggressors' pre-planned.)

Third, the Soviet Union's move can not only punish Hungary's willing lackeys but also warn and teach Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, etc., which will follow in their footsteps due to German and Italian activities, which is of great significance for maintaining British and French and European democracy and peace.

Finally, the Soviet Union's move is enough to strike at Germany's plan to conquer Europe and expresses the Soviet Union's response to US President Roosevelt's remarks about assisting democratic countries in resisting dictatorships. It is very clear that Germany has now revealed a panic-stricken appearance. What else do the fools who comment on the Soviet Union's peace policy have to say here?

### Nutrition Research Committee Holds First Meeting Yesterday; Situ Yongjue Says That the Health Problems of the Poor Are Serious; Malnutrition Can Increase Mortality Rate; The Destitute Are More Generally Threatened

The Hong Kong government, in order to improve the nutrition of residents, specially appointed Hong Kong Financial Secretary Situ Yongjue (Chairman) and seven other members to form a strong Nutrition Research Committee to be responsible for handling this matter. After accepting the mandate, the members went to investigate the actual situation in detail. Yesterday afternoon, the first meeting was held in the Department of Health. The attendees included Medical Director Situ Yongjue (Chairman), Professor McGillivray Wright, Justice of the Peace, Rossby, Dr. Li Zuyou, Professor Chaterly, Dr. Hu Susi, and Dr. Duwei, to discuss the following matters in detail:

(1) Committee regulations and operating rules; (2) Appointment of a secretary; (3) Steps for investigating prominent nutritional problems, including (a) food survey, (b) nutritional survey office, (c) research on beriberi prevalent in Hong Kong, (d) nutritional value of tofu; (4) Appointing various sub-committees, such as the scientific group, social group, publishing group, etc.; (5) Methods for transmitting various publications; (6) Submission of reports, etc. Before starting the agenda, Chairman Situ Yongjue delivered an opening speech, saying that under everyone's leadership, he deeply hoped that the committee would make special contributions to the health and welfare of Hong Kong residents, especially the majority of the poor. If we agree with what Sir Heskins said that ordinary consumers almost completely consume food, and as Dr. McCannis said, food expenditure is the economic factor that dominates the lives of ordinary people, we should understand the severity of the problem that we are responsible for solving. A large part of the Chinese people in Hong Kong live below the poverty line. That is, last year, one-third of the babies born in Hong Kong died before reaching twelve months, while in England, it was almost one in twenty. In the same year, nearly 5,000 people died of tuberculosis, and diseases of the respiratory tract ranked first among fatal diseases. 2,623 people died of beriberi (this is just an obvious cause. Examples of diseases caused by malnutrition can be seen every month in the wards of various hospitals. What we see on the streets or in the refugee tents is the destitution, how many people show rough skin, eye pain, bluish lips, and white lips, all of which show the degree of malnutrition they are suffering from. Here we will ask what the main function of this committee is. This is clearly stipulated in the operating rules. Our job is to clarify the facts about nutrition and malnutrition within our authority, and thereby seek to improve the current situation. Because refugees are more crowded than the usual population, there are more poor people, and the wage level is also particularly low. On the other hand, we can therefore make large-scale observations, collect data, and conduct food experiments in refugee tents. I would like to express my firm belief that the committee will definitely make indelible contributions to the residents of Hong Kong and to the government that is responsible for them.

### Awarded Medal by the Italian Emperor for Saving the Conte Verde; Awarding Ceremony Held on the Ship Yesterday; More Than 200 People Attended the Ceremony

On September 2, 1937, a severe typhoon occurred in Hong Kong, with a tragic situation. The losses of merchant ships at sea were countless. The Italian mail ship Conte Verde was also one of the victims. It was blown by the hurricane and ran aground outside Lei Yue Mun. After the disaster, the Whampoa Dockyard sent personnel to try to rescue it from danger. Although it suffered panic and loss, it was fortunately spared from sinking. The ship arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday afternoon and left Hong Kong at 4:00 p.m. to return home. Two hours before leaving Hong Kong, the shipowner and the Italian Consul in Hong Kong held a memorial meeting on the ship to commemorate the escape of the Conte Verde from the September 2nd typhoon and to award the Royal Crown Medal to Mr. Crook, the manager of Whampoa Dockyard, on behalf of the Italian Emperor, in recognition of his meritorious service.

After the meeting was held as scheduled, Mr. Valusni, the shipowner, spoke first, followed by Mr. Crook's speech of thanks. After the Italian Consul's speech, the awarding ceremony was held.

### Our Country's Main Export: Tung Oil Control Not Yet Implemented; Hong Kong Oil Merchants Still Procure Large Quantities; Our Authorities Actively Encourage Increased Production

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Tung oil is one of China's special products, with a large output. The annual export volume is substantial, making it one of China's main exports. The largest market is the United States, accounting for about 70% of the total exports. The Sino-American loan is also based on tung oil as collateral. According to official sources, China's loan from the United States is US$25 million, while China's annual tung oil exports to the United States average about 63 million national currency. The loan amount is 2.4 times the value of tung oil exported to the United States, so the loan can be fully repaid in about two and a half years. Since the success of the Sino-American loan, news about the implementation of tung oil transport control has been widespread. Until recently, it was even said that the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance would entrust the control affairs to the China Vegetable Oil Company. The company, with the approval of the Trade Commission, would set the prices of tung oil producing areas and distribution markets, and the company would prepare funds for purchase. All losses would be borne by the state.

Transport Control Not Yet Implemented

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China's tung oil exports were completely concentrated in Hong Kong and Mengzi. Last year, the total export volume from Hong Kong reached 3,612,907 national currency. Many merchants depend on tung oil for their livelihood. All parties are paying close attention to the issue of tung oil transport and sales control. The reporter visited various parties to inquire about opinions and control news. According to the person in charge of the China Vegetable Oil Company, the company has signed a contract with the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing and has begun to implement it, but the control methods are still unknown. However, when the reporter relayed this news to a certain oil merchant, he said that the tung oil transport and sales control has not yet been implemented, because recently, oil merchants can still procure large quantities of tung oil from the mainland to Hong Kong. On average, each ship carries about 10,000 cans. Until now, it has not been interrupted, indicating that the news of the implementation of control is not accurate. As for the news of tung oil price control, although there were fluctuations, it has now been confirmed to be inaccurate, so it has returned to stability. The current price is about 57 yuan per dan, without major fluctuations.

Foreign Exchange Settlement Must Be Controlled

The authorities have been planning tung oil transport and sales control for a long time. In the past five months, the rumors have been particularly prevalent. However, according to reliable sources, the authorities currently do not have concrete intentions to implement tung oil transport, but the foreign exchange from transport and sales must be controlled, and all must be sold to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. It is expected that in the future, the purchase of mainland tung oil will be entrusted to several larger companies, and there will be no restrictions on foreign sales. Currently, except for Wenzhou, the control has not been implemented in Hong Kong and Burma.

Central Government Encourages Increased Production

The provinces rich in tung oil production in China include Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang. Sichuan has the largest output, and Hunan has the best quality. White tung oil, also known as "Ling oil," is sold exclusively abroad, while red tung oil, also known as "colored tung oil," is sold exclusively domestically. Its effect is waterproof and antiseptic. In ancient China, tung oil was used to paint doors and windows to make them durable and non-corrosive, and to manufacture oilcloth and oil paper for rain protection. Most European and American countries use tung oil instead of linseed oil as the only raw material for manufacturing paint. In addition, it is also used as a raw material for automobile varnish, motors and generators in electrical appliances, as well as for manufacturing leather and soap. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance regard tung oil as one of China's main commodities. In addition to being exempt from transit tax and export tax, they also encourage farmers in various oil-producing areas to plant tung trees, especially in the southwestern and border provinces, because tung oil trees can grow not only on plains but also on rocky mountains and streams. Although it is not cold-resistant, it can grow if the average temperature is above 18 to 20 degrees Celsius.

Output Greatly Increased in Southwestern Provinces

Since the authorities implemented the incentive measures, the output of various provinces has greatly increased. Sichuan's annual total output reaches 28,000 tons, followed by Guangxi with an annual output of 12,000 tons. Xiangxi, the border areas of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi each produce about 10,000 tons. Ebei, Hubei, Guiyang, and Shaanxi each produce about 3,000 tons per region annually. Yunnan and Guizhou each reach 4,000 tons. The total annual output is more than 70,000 tons. Although the war zone is expanding, the tung oil producing areas are still under the protection of the National Army. Therefore, the collection and refining have not been affected by the war. Currently, the authorities use American-made grading tables to distinguish the quality and quantity. For refining methods, the latest methods are used as much as possible, and officials are sent to guide the process in order to achieve practical results. (Jiao Ren)

### Flying Hotel "Cathay" to Conduct Test Flight to Hong Kong

### Made by Feng Dequan, World's Smallest Mail Ship, Model of the Queen Mary, Structure is Realistic and Capable of Long Voyages, Public Exhibition This Afternoon

Feng Dequan of Hong Kong, 22 years old, has always been interested in scientific research, especially skilled in making mechanical models. The small airplanes and small pistols he makes are lifelike. In March of the year before last, he and three brothers began to make a model of the "Queen Mary" ship. The ship is five feet eight and a half inches long, eight and three-eighths inches wide, and eight inches high. The hull is entirely made of oil wood and iron sheets. All the equipment and painting on the ship are very exquisite. The size comparison is no different from the original ship. It was originally powered by a steam engine, but the furnace fire was too hot, which might damage the hull and the black smoke would pollute the surface of the ship, affecting its beauty. So, four electric motors were made and powered by batteries. A speed and reverse device was also installed at the stern for operation. It has now been completed. Friends encouraged him to display it publicly. It was decided that this Saturday afternoon from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, the exhibition will be held at Kowloon Tong School, 27 Cumberland Road, Kowloon Tong. After the exhibition, a test voyage will be conducted in the nearby reservoir. All sectors are welcome to visit. The ship is entirely handmade. Even the smallest gear is not purchased from modern suppliers. Therefore, it took one year and seven months to complete. It is worth seeing.

### Youth Relief Association to Perform a Play to Raise Funds for Medical Supplies for Rescue Team

Although the Hong Kong Youth Relief Association has only been established for three months, its work has been very diligent. The first time was to raise donations for the education expenses of Kam Tin refugees, and the second time was to raise cold-proof gloves for the 9th Army Corps. Now, in response to the request of the Student Relief Association, and to strengthen the force of the fourth batch of returning service teams, a first returning service rescue team was specially organized. The team will work together with the fourth batch of students from the Student Relief Association. Now, in order to raise funds for the rescue team's medicines, the association has decided to invite the China Art Troupe to perform "Thunderstorm" on the evening of the 11th of this month at the Ko Shing Theatre. It will be directed by the famous playwright Ouyang Yuqian. All the income will be used for medicines and travel expenses for the returning rescue team. At that time, there will be a warm performance.

### Various Relief Associations of Hong Kong Held Temporary Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Selection of Rescue Team

The Hong Kong Federation of All Circles Relief Associations held a temporary standing committee meeting in the morning. Many people such as Lin Peisheng, Zhou Xingchi, Lu Guomian, Xu Wanjun, He Yuzhen, Lin Yi, and Liu Zixuan attended to discuss the issue of dispatching a rescue team to the Dongjiang River to serve with the 453rd Brigade. The origin of the issue is that the 453rd Brigade requested the dispatch of a rescue team to serve with the army. The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Team and the Youth Overseas Chinese Rescue Team volunteered to be dispatched by the General Assembly. In order to deliberate the matter, the General Assembly entrusted the two rescue teams to the Women's War Relief Association for assessment. After being ordered to assess, the War Relief Association entrusted the training director of the association, Li Dezhang, and teachers Zan Liang to preside over the matter. After many days of inspection, it was completed yesterday and submitted to the Standing Committee for a decision. According to Li Dezhang's report on the assessment process, he indicated the necessity of re-training and suggested: (1) As a temporary solution, the better performers from the two teams should be trained for three months before departure. (2) As a fundamental solution, the General Assembly should organize its own rescue team to specialize in the matter and inquire about the standards of frontline rescue personnel from the Central Government and train accordingly for good results. After discussion, it was decided to send a letter to the two units to ask whether they could accept the General Assembly selecting the better performers for training. After receiving a reply, further discussions will be held.

### Actively Imparting Air Defense Knowledge; Training Implemented for Civil Servants; Police Officers Have Taken the Exam, Others Are Preparing

The Hong Kong Air Defense Authority, in preparation for the arrival of extraordinary times, has specially appointed responsible personnel to organize an air defense monitoring committee in order to guide residents in peacetime to make necessary air defense preparations. In extraordinary times, each will, within its jurisdiction, coordinate with related parties, such as the police and fire departments, to implement rescue and firefighting work. The transmission of information is its primary responsibility. The names of the conveners of the aforementioned committee have been published in previous reports. Yesterday morning, according to Mr. Spurgeon, the Hong Kong Air Defense Commissioner, since the recruitment of air defense personnel was announced, Hong Kong residents, regardless of Chinese or Western, male or female, have been very enthusiastic to participate. Some of the Hong Kong government service personnel have already been trained, and other departments are also actively carrying out the process. The police force has already taken the exam, and the personnel of the Government Secretariat have been trained. The staff of the Public Works Department and the Municipal Health Bureau are currently preparing. The staff of the Import and Export Department and the Shipping Department are currently undergoing training. There are currently 22 air defense monitoring committee district branches in Hong Kong. Each convener can effectively take responsibility and recruit various volunteer workers. Among the businesses that have responded to this air defense movement, the Hong Kong Tramways Company is the first. Preparations for preventing poison gas, extinguishing fires, and avoiding strong explosions have been arranged. The Hong Kong government has been requested to assign a staff member to receive poison gas instruction. The staff member has passed the exam and is training the company's staff. The company has spent a lot of money to strengthen this equipment.

Special Feature

### The Ruins of Shenzhen

— Falling Sunset

Interviewing Bao'an County Magistrate Liang Baoren

Taking advantage of the visit to the Shenzhen Refugee Camp, I ran to wander around the destroyed Shenzhen Market. Walking along the railway tracks, the rice in the fields had already been harvested, leaving only a few clusters of green winter vegetables, interspersed with star-like yellow rapeseed flowers, swaying in the scorching sun. The scenery was so serene and pleasant. Who would have thought that such beautiful scenery had been imprinted with the filthy traces of the × people!

Arriving at the market entrance, I saw sentries with guns, their sharp eyes scanning every passerby. Upon entering the market, the shops in every household were peacefully doing business, children were happily jumping, and women were quietly doing their work, all showing a leisurely atmosphere. When the × people invaded, they almost all ran away, leaving the × people to strike empty. But when the × people rolled away, they came back and lived and worked in peace. The × people's method of conquering China has failed, and the × people's dream of conquering China has been shattered!

Around the market, one can see the traces of the × people everywhere. Jiancun School, a well-known primary school in Shenzhen, had been turned into a wounded soldier hospital during the war. On the eve of the occupation, the reporter had a full day of conversation with the rescue team leader here, but now, all I see is withered vines clinging to dilapidated walls, and broken plants falling in piles of ruined houses. Next door, on Yunheng Street, the scorch marks are still fresh. The entire street has been reduced to ashes! In front of the house, a series of deep "erhu" sounds and the choked singing of a merchant girl drifted over. Lamenting the desolation, a sour taste welled up in people's hearts. Further ahead, a primary school attached to the Rhenish Church was also destroyed. From this, one can see the sinister heart of the × people who do not care about the church and are single-mindedly destroying our cultural institutions.

Going around to the big house behind the house to visit the responsible official here—Bao'an County Magistrate Liang Baoren. On that side is the Shenzhen Primary School, also a refugee shelter, but now it is the county magistrate's office, in a clean room. I saw County Magistrate Liang, who was talking calmly with a smile. Talking about the situation of the post-disaster reconstruction work here, he said: 'The most important thing in post-disaster reconstruction is how to find ways to relieve the refugees. We are already planning to set up sub-stations in various places to accommodate the refugees who have fled. In a few days, this plan can be implemented.'

Talking about the war situation with the × people, he leaned forward closer, propping up his waist, and said: 'We are now actively planning a counterattack. The night before last and early yesterday morning, clear artillery sounds could be heard in Nantou. That is the roar of our brave soldiers counterattacking Dongguan!' Speaking of this, he continued happily, 'The × people have no use for the land they have gained. Now they occupy a bit of our territory, not daring to leave that place five miles away, fearing our surprise attacks! Every day they are in Shatou and Huangsonggang, making unreasonable and disturbing the villagers, which shows their narrowness of heart.'"

After a pause, he continued, 'Now the × people see that their terror tactics have failed, so they have changed their methods, promoting their appeasement policy, giving each villager two cents, hoping to subdue the villagers by inducement. However, we believe that the hearts of the villagers cannot be bought!'

He said it sentence by sentence, without any anger. We looked at his thick eyebrows with insufficient spirits, his sturdy body, and his round face. Although he was wearing a Zhongshan suit, he did not show any martial spirit. If we were on the other side of the wall, we would really not believe that these words were coming out of his mouth. Because we had to catch the train, we said goodbye in a hurry. At dusk, we left the lovely rivers and mountains of our motherland, stepping on the same journey!

### A Week in World Affairs

— Pan Lang

From January 28th, Year 28 to February 3rd

【　This is on the Second Page of Today's Newspaper】

New Situation in the All-Out War of Resistance

Within this week, there have been no major changes in the war situation in various war zones across the country. Firstly, because the "general offensive" launched by the × army at the end of the year was exploratory and has completely failed under the full implementation of our new strategy, exposing its weaknesses. Although they are now restless everywhere, they have lost their confidence in "winning by general offensive" and have to rely on the assistance of their political offensive. Secondly, our army is stepping up the adjustment and preparation for the full implementation of the war of resistance plan, and each line can adopt new offensives under the coordination of the new air force and mechanized units, successively stopping the larger-scale offensives of the × army. The current situation in the various war zones is as follows: In North China, after the failure of the × army's plan to invade Shaanxi from Jin, it concentrated its forces in southern Jin on the one hand, and on the other hand, it massively transferred troops from Hebei and Henan provinces to invade the west. Now, our army is developing guerrilla warfare in the Zhongtiao Mountains to disrupt the × army's planned offensive in southern Jin, and on the other hand, it is launching × × war in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan to disrupt the rear of the × army invading the northwest. In South China, the situation is still tense, and the fighting in the West River and North River has not stopped at all this week. The × army is still massively reinforcing the West River on the one hand, and two companies of poison gas troops have been transferred from Taiwan to Sanshui and other places, and on the other hand, it is actively deploying military forces along the western coastal areas of Guangdong Province, preparing to advance into Nanning. Our army has set up strict defenses on both sides of the West River, and the battlefield including the border areas of Guangdong and Guangxi and various places in Nanlu has also been largely completed. Although the war clouds in northern Qiongya are looming, but it has not yet arrived, when the war breaks out. The two sides of the Yuehan Railway have never allowed the × army to advance an inch, and the counter-offensive on the eastern route is particularly smooth. The reactivation of our army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has not only made the enemy in Zengcheng and other places feel annoyed, but also shattered the illusion of the × army's large-scale harassment of Chaoshan. In Central China, the war situation is gradually becoming more intense. The reason is that our army preemptively struck to disrupt the × army's large-scale mobilization plan with an offensive. The × army on both sides of the Yangtze River in Hubei is now being monitored by us. The Gan-Xiang × army is still blocked on the north bank of the Xiu River. Generals Xue Yue, Xiong Shihui and others held a meeting in Nanchang on the second to discuss the counter-offensive plan, and it is expected that the war on both sides will have new developments. As for the various guerrilla areas, although there are no amazing victories, there are continuous battles in the provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, and their contribution to defeating the × army's offensive plan cannot be underestimated.

Japanese × Crisis and Conspiracy

The difficulties of Japan's war of aggression against China and the crisis within Japan are increasing in severity day by day. The surrender of the commander of the Shanxi × army to us, the simultaneous uprising of the puppet troops in various places, the successive losses of offensives on various lines, the fierce questioning in the Japanese parliament, and the successive convictions and imprisonments of many intellectuals and university professors such as Kawai Eijiro, all prove this point. In particular, from the debates in the parliament on the war of aggression against China and financial and economic policies, it can be seen that the Japanese people have already keenly felt that China's unexpectedly long-term war of resistance has forced Japan to demand huge sums of money and food, and has actually begun to destroy Japan's intricately structured national economy. On the one hand, due to military needs, international boycotts, lack of raw materials, etc., the export industry has been destroyed, and the national economy is on the verge of an unprecedented predicament; on the other hand, the war expenses are continuously increasing, the cost of living is soaring, inflation is becoming increasingly worse, deficit public debts cannot be absorbed, people's income is declining, the turbulent situation in Taiwan and Korea is serious, the anti-Japanese movement in Manchukuo and North China is becoming increasingly widespread and the voices are loud, and the fascist military閥 dictatorship is intensifying, and the class contradictions in the country are gradually deepening. Every Japanese people will understand that the war of aggression against China is just a war of extracting their × × to benefit the ruling class of a few wealthy people. The small but heroic Communist Party in Japan has launched a united front with ×××××× people under the most cruel and barbaric persecution, shouldering the great task of saving the people at home and fighting for peace abroad. The Japanese rulers are intensifying their conspiracies under such difficulties and crises: (1) Strengthening collusion with Germany and Italy in the international arena, and adopting a policy of baiting and intimidation towards Britain, the United States, and France; (2) Strengthening fascist dictatorship at home, expanding anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda, squeezing the last drop of blood from the people, and pushing forward more insane adventurous wars; (3) Doing its best to exploit traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and defeatist debaters to achieve Japan's "quick battle and quick victory" plan by using slogans such as "anti-communism," "pro-Japan," and "truce." And plotting to use Wang Jingwei to organize a puppet central government, and using Wu Peifu to organize fascist troops, to achieve the plan of "using Chinese to control Chinese" and permanently conquer China.

Germany and Italy Plot to Conquer Britain and France

The rampant conspiracy and actions of Japan ××, the eastern aggressor, to conquer China and dominate the Far East, and the ambitions of the rulers of Germany and Italy, the western aggressors, have a wonderful use of mutual collusion and mutual response. This week, the German and Italian aggressors, building on the new situation of their victory in Spain, have begun their further plan, which is to conquer Britain, enslave Britain and France, and compete for hegemony in Europe. Hitler, the head of the German aggression ××, delivered a speech on the evening of January 30th that was like a bomb disguised with many kind words: He put forward the demand for the redistribution of colonies, which is to demand colonies from Britain, and incidentally stated that Germany was prepared to fight, aid Italy, and support Japan's brutal aggression against China. Mussolini, the spokesman for the Italian aggressors, declared wildly on the 31st that the plan to turn the Mediterranean into an Italian lake, (1) to find waterways in Africa, including seizing French Tunisia and × state's North African and East African interests, and even monopolizing the Suez Canal; (2) to concentrate its strength in the Mediterranean, including seizing French Corsica and controlling England's route through the Mediterranean to connect the Near East and the Far East. Today (February 4th), the head of the Italian aggression army, Solcani, will give a speech at the Supreme Council of Fascism, which is probably nothing more than this. What will Britain and France do about this? We know from the facts since Munich that Chamberlain's and Daladier's appeasement diplomacy has and will continue to lead both Britain and France to the road of surrender ××, and the slightly tougher attitude shown by the British and French governments since last week is in fact mainly intended to ease the anti-government anger at home, and cannot be regarded as a true demonstration of preparation to resist or even sanction aggression. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech and the attitude of the French National Assembly on the first day of this week contained more encouraging elements than before, we still cannot have too much hope. What we should solemnly point out is that under the increasing pressure from Italy and Germany, the people, public opinion, progressive parties, and communist and socialist parties of Britain and France have begun to take more extensive joint actions. They oppose the policy of compromise, oppose non-resistance, oppose the cession of colonies and the sacrifice of small and weak countries, and they resolutely demand to strengthen Anglo-French cooperation, strengthen friendly relations with the United States and the Soviet Union, and oppose fascist aggression. This movement is developing and will be the main force in promoting the democratic peace front.

The United States and the Soviet Union Make Important Statements

At a time when these eastern and western aggressors are jumping and dancing wildly and the democratic countries are swallowing their anger, the United States in the west and the Soviet Union in the north have begun to take bolder and more active steps against aggression, which has made the countries and peoples who have been invaded and oppressed cheer and be excited, and has made the aggressors ×× be shocked and curse. On January 31, US President Roosevelt gave a speech to the Senate Armed Services Committee, deciding to resist fascist aggressor countries in order to defend democracy and world peace and as a backing for countries like Britain and France. He also made it clear that "France should be regarded as the real border between democratic countries and dictatorial countries," and was prepared to abandon neutrality and supply Britain and France with a large number of munitions (France alone ordered 600 airplanes from the United States, worth about 35 million US dollars). This not only helps France out of the precarious situation of being invaded by Italy, Germany, and Britain, but also deters the German and Italian aggressors, and has the power to support the precarious situation of the entire Europe. At the same time, the United States is also drafting a joint defense plan for the United States and Canada, and according to a Washington telegram on February 1, the United States is discussing a national defense plan centered on strengthening the defenses of the entire Pacific, which is also a very significant blow to the Far Eastern aggressors, and strengthening the defenses of Guam can simultaneously restrict the activities of the aggressor countries' fleets in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This expression of the United States has naturally been immediately approved by the public opinion of Britain and France. However, domestic 反動派, such as Hoover, are still trying their best to oppose and destroy it, and Germany is even propagating the communistization of the US government. At the same time, some reactionaries, with the aid of the German, Italian, and Japanese aggressors, deliberately released rumors of Germany and the Soviet Union approaching each other, and rumors of the Soviet Union changing its foreign policy, in order to confuse the world and even shake confidence in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, facts speak louder than rumors and sophistry. The Soviet Union is now actively preparing for its third five-year plan and is actively preparing to strike at fascist aggression ××. The recent strong expression of the United States towards aggressors has given the Soviet Union's anti-fascist and anti-aggression policy a variety of advantages in its implementation. On January 27, British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky, and Maisky clearly stated that "If Germany invades France, the Soviet Union will definitely use military force to aid France in accordance with the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact. If France is invaded by Italy, the Soviet Union will also aid France if the members of the League of Nations can invoke the covenant." Those who spread the "mystery of German-Soviet rapprochement" are either deliberately trying to incite disorder on behalf of the aggressors, or they are blind and ignorant fools. Although the threat of war is serious, a bright future has already emerged, so what are we still hesitating about?

### Talking about Kunming's Landscape

— Sha Ou

In the past, Kunming was regarded as a remote, barbaric place plagued by miasma, and due to inconvenient transportation, few Chinese people had the opportunity to visit. Now that the Southwest Highway has been opened to traffic, many people have come to Kunming due to national difficulties, and Kunming's scenery has gradually spread by word of mouth. But before going there, people only knew it was good, but didn't understand how good it was. To know the benefits of Kunming, it is not only that spring lasts all year round and the climate is mild, but also that there is beautiful landscape everywhere, comparable to Qingdao and Mount Lu in one place, for people to visit.

Upon entering Kunming City, one can immediately feel that the city is clean and orderly. The city's streets and avenues are all paved with bluestone produced locally by hand. On these neat and wide roads, cars run in the middle, rickshaws run on both sides, and sidewalks are outside the shops. Furthermore, the people coming and going, regardless of gender, age, or youth, can automatically keep to the left, so that the two sides of the street naturally form two major rows of "coming" and "going." Stone roads do not have the disadvantages of ordinary asphalt roads: they do not melt in hot weather, do not become muddy in rainy weather, and usually have very little dust and sand. Their advantages are many. Although there are few tall buildings in the city, the general city houses and shops are very neat, and the decorations and colors are also very bright. The main trunk roads in the city include Jinbi Road, Huguo Road, Zhengyi Road, and Wucheng Road, among which Zhengyi Road is the most majestic and straight, and it is also the most prosperous and lively place. This is similar to Nanjing Road and Hankou's Jianghan Road and Zhongshan Road, where both sides of the road are mostly large shops, and the windows and display cases are decorated with beautiful red and green advertisements, and pleasant music is played from the radio. Here, the lights are brilliant at night, and red, green, and various neon lights are shining on the blue edges, creating a magical street scene. Tourists are bustling and shoulder-to-shoulder, as lively as a New Year's festival. The police on the street wear yellow uniforms and copper helmets, directing the traffic. Their clothes are neat and clean, their actions are relatively energetic, and they are very polite and friendly to people.

There are many parks in the city. Among them, the most famous and best scenery are Cuihu Park and Yuantong Park. Other places such as Jinbi Park and Zhanbi Park also have many tourists.

Cuihu is located in the northwest corner of the urban area. Tang Dike is located in the east and west, and Ruan Dike is located in the north and south. The four long dikes are connected, and the Haixin Pavilion is in the center. Long bridges are like rainbows, connecting the dikes. Lotus leaves are emerald green, nodding to welcome people in the breeze. The lake surface is wide, and the trees and pavilions are shadowed by each other. The sparkling waves surround the long dike lined with green trees. Listening to the birds and watching the shadows in the quietness is especially poetic and picturesque. The majestic buildings of Yunnan University (formerly Donglu University) are nearby on the hillside by the lake. The panoramic view of Wuhua Mountain is in sight, and the Provincial Library is also nearby.

In addition to the picturesque Cuihu, we must talk about Yuantong. Yuantong Temple was rebuilt into a park in the sixth year of the Republic of China, and after years of management and construction, it has become a grand sight. Yuantong Mountain is behind the temple, higher than Wuhua Mountain, and is the highest point in the city. Upon entering the gate, one sees a magnificent and splendid archway, standing tall and upright, with the inscription "Yuantong Scenic Spot." Inside the gate, the edges are shady, with towering ancient trees, and the scenery is quiet. After passing this grand archway, there is a wide and square pool, with green water as clear and calm as a mirror. An antique octagonal pavilion stands alone in the center of the water. There is a long stone bridge leading to the Yuantong Hall. Behind the hall, there are cliffs, decorated with vines and flowers, and the walls are covered with inscriptions by celebrities. After visiting the towering halls and the dignified Buddha statues, you can follow the path and climb the steps to the county rock. Jieyin Hall and Zhouwen Terrace are halfway up the rock. Below, there is the Chaoyin Cave, with strange rocks and twists and turns that can be passed through. However, it is deep, dark, and shaded, so you can only enter with a candle. Above the cliff, the ground is quite open, with pavilions, towers, flowers, and trees arranged in a spectacular manner. Next to the artificial pool, there are several lawns, and the stone path is flat, circling the pool on all sides and reaching the pavilions and teahouses. To the left of the mountain, there is the cemetery of the martyrs who died in the past during the aid to Guizhou and West Dian, and the magnificent tomb of General Tang Jiyao is also built nearby. Tourists admire and must not forget his achievements, and will also recall General Cai Songpo's Yunnan Uprising to create the great cause of the Republic. From the high point of Yuantong Mountain, you can take in all the scenery inside and outside the city, and looking far away at the West Mountain, the water of Dianhai is presented like a painting, which is especially spectacular!

The scenery in Kunming city is already so beautiful, and there are many scenic spots outside the city. West Mountain overlooks Dianchi Lake, stretching for dozens of miles, with thousands of feet of blue cliffs, reflecting the green waves of thousands of acres. Looking around from here, how magnificent the distant and near views are! The famous Jizu Mountain, Gaogiao Mountain, Taihua Mountain, and Huating Mountain are just branches of West Mountain. Daguan Tower is located seven miles outside the west gate, with a long embankment directly reaching the city, and boats and vehicles can all travel to it. The Daguan Park is also named after it, because Daguan Tower faces Dianhai Lake. Climbing up the tower and looking far away, the vast waves, combined with the mountain scenery everywhere, are particularly magnificent, so the tower is named "Daguan" (Grand View). The long couplet, which has been famous in the country for a long time, writes: "Five hundred miles of Dianchi Lake rushes into view. With open collar and leaning against the railing, one is happy to see the boundless vastness. Looking at the eastern galloping horses, the western flying birds, the northern winding dragons, and the southern white silk. High-minded scholars, why not choose a scenic spot to climb and enjoy the wind and frost on the crab islands and snail continents, and add some emerald feathers and red clouds to the reed marshes? Do not waste the fragrant rice around, the endless expanse of sunny sand, the hibiscus in summer, and the willows in spring."

"Thousands of years of past events flood into the mind. Holding wine and soaring into the sky, one sighs at the heroes who have rolled by. Thinking of the Han training in building ships, the Tang marking with iron pillars, the Song wielding the jade axe, and the Yuan crossing with leather whips, their great achievements and feats exhausted the strength of moving mountains. Now only the beaded curtains and painted rafters remain, and only the twilight rain and morning clouds are left to be chanted. Even the broken tablets and steles are entrusted to the misty smoke and setting sun, and only a few sparse bells, half a river of fishing lights, two rows of autumn geese, and a pillow of clear frost are gained."

The park is also decorated with many garden scenes such as Lansheng Hall, Yongyue Pavilion, Guanjia Hall, and Penglai Paradise, which further enhance the scenery of the park. The bronze statue of General Tang riding a horse stands majestically in the park. The lotus pond in front of Daguan Tower can lead people to Dianhai, with long embankments and green trees surrounding the entire park.

Outside the west gate, in addition to Ren Guan Park, there are also many famous scenic spots such as Haiyuan Temple, Zongzhu Temple, Sanqing Pavilion, Taixuan Temple, and Huating Temple. Because some are far away, more than 20 or 30 miles away, or are located between mountains, there are fewer tourists than at Daguan Tower.

Kunming covers hundreds of miles and is full of plains. Because the climate is mild and the wind and rain are well-regulated, rice, wheat, grains, and everything else are available, and the melons, fruits, vegetables, and are fat, beautiful, and inexpensive. The original population was more than 190,000, divided into eight districts and 48 townships. Now that the national crisis is serious, many people have come to Kunming, and the city has suddenly increased by tens of thousands of people, and newcomers are still coming in an endless stream, resulting in housing difficulties and overcrowded lodgings. Although the problem of housing is difficult to solve in Kunming today, the problem of eating is much easier. Because the cost of living here is originally very low, and it is calculated in Yunnan currency, one yuan of Yunnan currency (old currency) is only worth one dime of national currency. A plate of famous Yunnan ham in a restaurant costs six jiao, which is equivalent to six cents of national currency. The cost of an ordinary meal is less than 15 cents of national currency. The new currency that has been recently introduced is also only worth 5 jiao of national currency per yuan. Because the climate is mild and pleasant, there is no need for heavy fur coats or light summer clothes, and you can't buy cool mats and stoves in the city either.

The architectural style of the houses in the city, the towering arches on the main streets, and the many alleys like hutongs, all have many similarities with Beijing. Especially the street scenes and gatherings near Jinri Lou are exactly like the scenery of Qianmen Street in the old capital!

Whenever I walk into Yuantong Temple, I remember Biyun Temple in West Mountain, and when I pass Cuihu Dike, I feel like I am in Beihai in the old capital, which often evokes the feeling of being homeless. Therefore, now that the homeland has been lost for a long time, I feel even more that today is a time of life and death, and everyone should strive to be enterprising.

Education here also has considerable achievements. Below the provincial university, there are Kunhua Normal School, Boys' High School, Girls' High School, Vocational School, and Chenzhong School, etc. Primary school education is also very developed. The National Literary and Art Circles Association has established a Kunming branch to engage in cultural work. There are four or five newspapers, each of which publishes a full sheet every day. Publications include "Cultural Post," "New Trends," "South," and "Wartime Knowledge."

During the nation-building period, Kunming has shouldered the responsibility of innovation and contributed its strength, not just providing beautiful scenery for people to visit!

### Special Silver Shield: South China Athletic Association vs. Kowloon Cricket Club, Second Division League: South China AA vs. Royal Artillery Also Crucial

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Today's soccer games include two particularly exciting matches: one is the First Division Special Silver Shield, South China AA vs. Kowloon Cricket Club, and the other is the Second Division League, Royal Artillery vs. South China AA. The former will determine who advances to the semi-finals, while the outcome of the latter is crucial for the overall league championship.

Previously, when South China AA and Kowloon Cricket Club clashed, Kowloon Cricket Club took advantage of home-field advantage, preventing South China AA's short-passing forwards from displaying their skills, resulting in a 0-0 draw. As the winner was undecided, there is now a rematch today to determine the victor.

This time, the battleground is at Caroline Hill. Without home-field advantage, Kowloon Cricket Club is less intimidating. It is expected that South China AA has a better chance of winning. However, as this match means elimination for the loser, careful preparation is essential.

Lee Tin Sang, Mak Siu Hon, Lau Hing Choi, and others have foot injuries that have not fully healed, but they can still play without any problem. Therefore, it has been decided to field the same lineup, which is reassuring to most fans.

Regarding the Second Division League match between Royal Artillery and South China AA, regardless of the championship battle, based on the current points earned by both teams and considering the number of matches played, South China AA is one point ahead. However, South China AA must win against Royal Artillery today to secure their championship position. If they unfortunately lose, the championship may belong to Royal Artillery. It is hoped that all South China AA players will exert their utmost effort. If they can overcome this hurdle, the future will be worry-free. The lineups for South China AA and Kowloon Cricket Club are as follows:

Eastern Lost Unluckily

The second half began, and Westerners changed their lineup. Victor was moved to the back, Pete took over as the right inside forward, and Jebson became the left halfback. This adjustment increased their momentum. Woodburn's shot was saved, and Pete followed up with a chip. The ball landed near the goal, and Chow Tat Wan was blocked and unable to save it. Fortunately, Chiang Siu Cheung rushed back and kicked it out, averting the danger. Soon after, Whittle received a short pass from Pete and swept the ball in sideways. Chow caught it, and Whittle attempted a long-range shot, but it was saved again. Eastern was in a precarious situation and urgently sought to attack. O'Day charged straight into the penalty area alone, but Sun Fai Cheung was offside, and the play was disallowed. Woodburn then scored from a pass by Whittle, making it 2-0 with exactly twenty minutes remaining in the second half. Eastern counterattacked, and Sun Fai Cheung and Ng Bing Ho advanced side by side. Ng's shot went wide. Eight minutes later, Jia Yau Leung hooked the ball in, and Walter failed to catch it. The ball landed in the goal area. Siu Ho Te wanted to kick it but couldn't. Sun Fai Cheung rushed forward and scored, bringing Eastern back one goal. However, one minute later, Whittle took a corner kick, and after the ball was cleared by Chow, he got another corner kick opportunity. Whittle's second kick was perfect, and Westcott volleyed it into the net, sealing Eastern's fate. As a result, they lost 3-1, and their hopes of winning the championship were extinguished.

### Shanghai Eastern Lost to Western, Championship Hopes Extinguished, Ground Wet and Ball Heavy, Eastern Unable to Perform

(Shanghai Correspondent) The Shanghai Eastern vs. Western Union Plate Division soccer match was held at 1:30 PM yesterday, the 29th, in the rain at Recreation Ground. Due to the rain, the audience was limited to less than 400 people. The ground was slippery and the ball was heavy, but the competition was intense. Eastern's offense was strong, but luck was not on their side. They trailed 1-0 in the first half. In the second half, Western became more dominant. After Woodburn scored, Sun Tung pulled one back. Finally, Westcott scored again, resulting in a 3-1 victory for Western. The afternoon matches, such as the North China Daily News Cup match between Lido and Yuen Cheong, were postponed due to rain.

Western Takes the Lead

Western's initial attack was blocked. Eastern penetrated twice from the right but failed to score. Ng Bing Ho took a shot, but it went wide. Shortly after, Willie touched the ball outside the penalty area and was penalized with a free kick. O'Day rushed the shot, and the ball flew out of bounds. Western launched several corner kicks, but they did not amount to anything. Eastern passed the ball forward, and O'Day seized the opportunity to advance and shoot, but he missed the goal, which was a pity. Soon after, Western was awarded a free kick outside Eastern's penalty area. Huit took the kick, and Chow deflected it into a corner. Woodburn took the corner, and Chow saved it again. After twenty minutes, Woodburn passed to Whittle, who passed it to Hutt in the penalty area, and Western took a 1-0 lead. Eastern vowed to counterattack. Ng Bing Ho received a pass from O'Day. Jebson came out, and Ng quickly shot, but it went over the crossbar. Western attacked. Greenburgh hooked the ball from 20 yards away, which was very sudden. Chow held the ball. Eastern's Shen Sap Yin dribbled the ball aggressively and was fouled. Jia Yau Leung rushed forward to chip the ball in, but the provincial technical college alumni association in Hong Kong held

### Provincial Technical College Alumni Association in Hong Kong Holds Sports Academic Research Conference

—and prepares to organize a basketball team—

The Alumni Association of the Guangdong Provincial Technical College of Physical Education in Hong Kong held its second sports problem symposium at Overseas Chinese College the day before yesterday at 4 PM. Attendees included overseas students Yu Anbin, Ruan Yan, Huang Dunhan, Chen Yingchun, Liu Guangxin, Feng Zheng, Wu Huaying, Ye Lixin, Deng Jixi, Zhou Jun, Tan Rongxu, Bei Jiade, Zhai Huaquan, Chen Ruiyuan, Situ Chen De, Su Guangchi, Wu Hua, Kong Qinghua, Zhuo Deguang, He Baiji, Lin Zhongwei, Huang Xinxiong, Zhou Yingwei, Xu Tiexian, Rao Huizhen, Ou Diyi, Lin Hongtong, Wang Xiuhui, Ruan Zhouquan, Chen Yingqi, Liao Kunxian, Zheng Ruifang, Zhou Jin Juefei, and others from the sports field, totaling more than thirty people. Deng Jixi chaired the meeting, and Ruan Zhouquan served as the recorder. The meeting began with formal rituals, followed by reports on the recent activities of the association by Chairman Deng Jixi and General Affairs Director Lin Hongtong. Subsequently, Professor Ruan Yanming and Liu Guangxin reported on the recent situation of the Provincial Technical College of Physical Education, and Mr. Chen Hong gave a lecture on the mystery of insurance. Then, the discussion and research problems began. Zhuo Deguang suggested that, although we have been engaged in the research of sports academics for several years, the progress of academics is constantly evolving, especially in the most adverse sports environment of Hong Kong, it is essential to continue studying academics as a basis for improvement. During our school days, Professor Liu Xuesong often encouraged us, saying that if you want to become a progressive sports teacher in the new China, you should regard sports as a career, not a profession. If you want to become a sound sports teacher, you must have the three qualities of being able to do, speak, and write, and the cultivation of personality and temperament is even more important. At this critical moment for the country, the training of physical education is particularly important, and the duties of sports teachers cannot be ignored. Today, I specially propose this to organize a sports academic research committee, inviting overseas education, sports, medical, and other experts, as well as professors from the alma mater, to give lectures, and have alumni present their special insights for joint research, with meetings held twice a month, emphasizing both academics and practice. As a result, a resolution was passed and handed over to the board of directors to be responsible for the preparation. Following a proposal by Yang Hua, a resolution was passed to collect books, delegating the responsibility to the General Affairs Section to send letters to alumni and sports comrades, soliciting and discussing with Overseas Chinese College to borrow land. Lin Hongtong proposed a case to visit the sports facilities of famous schools in Hong Kong, and it was resolved to be handled by the board of directors according to circumstances. Bei Jiade proposed a case to organize a basketball team, which was approved, and Huang Xinxiong was recommended to be responsible for organizing it. The next item was to contact the press and educational circles to promote sports in Hong Kong and to participate in the founding meeting of the Hong Kong Graduate Sports Federation, which was resolved to be handled by the board of directors. The meeting adjourned at around 8 PM.

### Yeung Shui Yik Denies Abusing Wife

Yeung Shui Yik, a soccer star from South China Athletic Association, was previously sued by his wife, Leung Sau, for abuse, seeking separation and alimony. The case was initially dismissed by Magistrate Bicester of the Central Magistracy, but the plaintiff appealed to the High Court last month on the 8th. The High Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff's appeal, finding that it complied with the separation and alimony regulations of 1935 and ordered it to be returned to the magistracy for handling. Yesterday afternoon, the case was reviewed by Bicester. During the court hearing, the defendant denied abusing the plaintiff. As a result, the judge ordered him to pay $2.50 per week to the plaintiff.

### Overtraining and Its Prevention

— Wang Xue Zheng

Malnourishment and lack of rest can weaken our entire body. Although physical weakness is not necessarily a disease, it is often just a temporary phenomenon. If we don't reduce the amount of exercise or even stop it completely during this time, we will suffer from the adverse effects of overtraining. In fact, the degree of exercise intensity varies from person to person. What people with strong physical strength consider easy exercise may be strenuous for people with weak physical strength. Naturally, we cannot do the same amount of exercise when we are physically strong and when we are physically weak.

Of all the parts and organs of the body, the heart is the most affected by overtraining. Overtraining can cause the heart to malfunction due to overwork, hindering the effectiveness of the heart muscle. Heart failure can cause problems such as panting and difficulty breathing. Other organs are also severely damaged, especially the nervous and digestive systems. When we are sick or physically weak, the function of the heart will definitely decrease, so we should reduce the workload of the heart.

The adverse effects of overtraining are not easily noticeable at first. However, if we do not take remedial measures at the beginning, it will be difficult to correct after a long time. Similarly, weakness, etc., is also not easily noticeable at first. If we continue to do strenuous exercise, it will cause the adverse effects of overtraining. The best ways to determine overtraining are the following three:

(1) Weight gain or loss - People with normal weight will at least be able to maintain their original weight without losing weight if their exercise is not excessive and the method is only slightly wrong. We should weigh ourselves at least once a week. If we find that our weight is decreasing, we should increase the number of weighings. If our weight continues to decrease within two weeks or cannot return to its original state, we can know that this is either an error in the exercise itself or the body lacks nutrition and rest. People who are obese should also not reduce their weight through exercise, and the amount of weight loss per week should not exceed two pounds; the adverse effects of excessive weight loss are even greater than obesity.

(2) Mental and physical strength after exercise - We should take a bath immediately after exercise. Our mental and physical strength may feel tired before bathing, but after bathing, we should fully recover to the state before exercise, be mentally energized, and still feel that we have sufficient strength. If we feel depressed after exercise, it is a sign of overtraining.

(3) The situation during exercise - If any of the following situations occur during exercise, we should stop exercising immediately, take a short rest, or reduce the amount of exercise. (In)

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment - A Rich Girl's Secret: There Goes My Heart

This is an American-style comedy. The story and the arrangement of the plot are entirely for comedic effect. The director's surprisingly effective techniques create many fresh laughs for the audience in this film. The insane and humorous plot also has a strong power to attract and captivate.

The film depicts the story of a wealthy girl who is naive and longs for freedom, running away and how she falls in love with a reporter under unique circumstances.

Fredric March and Virginia Bruce are not particularly skilled actors. They don't accomplish much in the film; the performance is just mediocre. Patsy Kelly, on the other hand, is cheerful and has a very outstanding performance. She is a lovable character. Nancy Carroll plays a vain and jealous female shop assistant, which is her second performance since returning to the screen, and the results are still not great.

(The rest illegible)

Empress... Simultaneous Screening

Peace... Sixty Glorious Years of the British Palace

Sixty Glorious Years

This film also depicts the glorious history of Queen Victoria's life, but it is more detailed than the previous one. It includes many of her important achievements in her sixty years on the throne. To be solemn and true, it was specially produced by the British Royal Company, giving it a bit of a propaganda feel for the history of the British Queen.

Because the material is particularly rich, and all the material is precious and cannot be rejected or deleted, the director is not easily pleased or handled well in this situation. This film suffers from this problem. The entire play, except for the first half, which depicts the Queen's life after marriage and is somewhat lively, the second half simply presents historical fragments as an institutional introduction. It is not strange that the director's skills are limited.

The film has several very superior scenes, such as the Queen's life after marriage, the British Royal Army's charge, the Queen's Jubilee celebration, and her going to visit her old palace maids. Worth mentioning, in terms of actors, there is not much change from the previous "The Great History of the English Queen". Anna Neagle, who plays the Queen, gives an excellent performance, especially in her old age. Anton Walbrook, who plays Prince Albert, is also extremely good.

Oriental... Three Comrades After the War

Three Comrades

This is the third immortal masterpiece by German author Erich Maria Remarque after "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "The Road Back". The background of this film is the same as the previous two, Germany after the Great War.

Under the lively techniques of director Frank Borzage, the entire film is handled with such elegance and emotion, and also has some humorous and wonderful depictions. It is particularly successful in capturing the personalities of the two heroes with extraordinary strength.

In terms of performance, Robert Taylor, Franchot Tone, and Robert Young are all very hardworking. It is a successful work. We certainly still remember Margaret Sullavan, the female lead, and her success in "The Good Fairy" with Herbert Marshall. She also has great achievements here.

Great China... Swiss Miss

Swiss Miss

This is the last second comedy film before the aging Laurel and Hardy shifted their career. The story tells of two ice cream salesmen (Laurel and Hardy) who go to Switzerland to do business. The two self-proclaimed clever men get into a lot of jokes, some of which are indeed weak, but that's precisely because it's a comedy.

There are also two European singers participating in the performance, especially the woman's singing is very good. The performances of the two treasures are no different from before. Cantonese film: Women's World

The plot depicts the story of a group of female boarders in a women's apartment. This apartment contains all kinds of characters. They each have their own occupations, but they are mixed and complicated. Among them are female students, female reporters, female saleswomen, singers, female dancers... etc. It includes almost all professional women in the city. They each have their own concerns and problems. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a microcosm of women in the city. However, the plot lacks excitement because there are no men involved, making it seem very loose and forced, failing to arouse the audience's interest. At the same time, this film can only depict the ordinary private lives of general women, such as disputes over powder, but it never portrays a broad range of women, which is truly the only reason for the film's failure. In the end, because the apartment is bombed, all the women realize the truth and unite to go to the front lines, which also seems unnatural and formulaic. However, even though we say this, we must also excuse the writers and directors, as it is also a very difficult thing to produce a play with an all-female cast.

Central... Black Shirt Squad

Cantonese Film

What is shown in this film are two disparate classes in society: on the one hand, the hard-working women of the masses, and on the other hand, some idle class men who engage in licentiousness and debauchery. However, the director's depiction of each plot is too focused on achieving "sensationalism" and ignores the representation of reality. At the same time, in order to pursue "sensational" effects, the entire film is filled with low-level and vulgar flirtation and fooling around.

The plot depicts a weak woman whose husband goes abroad to make a living. Her family is unkind, forcing her to work as a maid and suffer all kinds of bullying and oppression. When her husband returns home with honors, all kinds of misunderstandings arise.

Half of the plot is loose, and most of it is performed in the form of opera, attempting to cover up the emptiness of the content. The director's techniques are also not refined enough. However, the outstanding performance of the female lead, Huang Manli, in this film cannot be buried and is praiseworthy.

### Talking About "New"

— Ziyou

I casually flipped through the dictionary and saw that there are two explanations for "new": one is the opposite of old, and the other is the beginning. The reason why the New Year is the New Year is because it means the beginning of the year. "The opposite of old" is also the best explanation for "new forces" and "new institutions."

Everyone likes new things. There seems to be a saying, "Eating new and wearing old is human nature." But it can be difficult to judge what is new and what is not. Although the dictionary says: "New is the opposite of old and the beginning," a barbershop is clearly still the same old people and the same old tools, but the old sign has been changed, the facade has been painted with some new paint, and maybe even a string of firecrackers has been set off, but it is said to be newly opened. In fact, it is still the same old thing, gouging out people's pores until they bleed. A couple announces their marriage in public and are said to be "newlyweds." In fact, they have long been practicing "the way of husband and wife." The so-called marriage is just a public ceremony. The so-called "newlyweds" are not playing any new tricks; people are still people.

I think the meaning of "new," in addition to what the dictionary says, is that old things cannot adapt to new environments, so new things are created to adapt to new environments. It contains the function of metabolism. Take "new institutions" as an example; that is because the old institutions are too corrupt, indecisive, and complicated to adapt to the requirements of the new stage of the War of Resistance, so they are replaced by strict, active, concise, and powerful new institutions.

But new things do not fall from the sky; they are born from old things on the ground. New is not absolute; it contains old elements. In philosophical terms, it is a kind of "rejection function." Aren't new institutions transformed from old institutions? The emergence of new things cannot escape the three major laws of dialectics: the law of unity of opposites, the law of negation of negation, and the law of mutual transformation of quantity and quality.

The 20th century is a world of adventurers. Everywhere there are counterfeit goods exploring. San Francisco, of course, cannot avoid being used by adventurers to do business with regard to "new." Such as "East Asia New Labor," "New Statement," etc., people already have a "XX Publishing House," so they also come up with a "New XX Publishing House" to deceive people. This so-called "new" is still the same old thing!

It is said that people have a moment of clarity before they die. Now some people are using bright new signs to engage in shady dealings during the War of Resistance—ivory cannot come out of a dog's mouth!

For "new," we must pay attention to the content and not just be formal viewers. An old bottle can hold old wine or new wine. The problem is not in the bottle but in the wine.

### A Traveler in the Flames of War

— Yuren

I am a traveler!

My residence is in all directions: north, south, east, and west. In noisy cities, in quiet deep mountains, in silent forests, in misty waters!

I am a traveler!

I always carry the heart of a traveler. Wandering, wandering, wandering on the long journey of life. I have seen the things I hate most, and I have heard the voices I detest most. I have crossed high mountains of corpses and deep seas of blood. I have built my lonely, longing nest on piles of white bones.

Life is the tragic stroke in the poetry of my life's loose-leaf pages. It occupies the blood, death, pain, struggle... every thrilling word; it is also the autumn-like, melancholic, sad, and low melody that springs from my life's learning.

I am a traveler!

Today, the flames of war have burned my wandering, sad heart, burned my soul, and burned my life. The flames of war have destroyed me and given me a vigorous new life. I will no longer sing the songs of the Gypsies, drink the wine of the blood river, stagger in a drunken state, and embark on a wandering journey. I will no longer lightly recite and lament the sad poems of life. Like Byron, I will bravely write the most glorious part of the epic of national liberation!

I want to climb to the top of Tianshan. For my own liberation, for the liberation of the Chinese nation, and for the liberation of the oppressed people of the world, I will sing aloud. I want to see the dark curtain of the sky break, and I want to hold high the torch of struggle and welcome the glorious, bright golden light that shines on the vast six continents!

I am a traveler! A traveler wading through the flames of war.

### "Humph"

— Men Kan

Saying "yes" makes me think of the opposite of "yes," which is "humph."

"Yes" is the art of those below speaking to those above, while "humph" is the art of those above speaking to those below.

It is still the Qing Dynasty, the old ancestor of the current "Manchukuo," that perfected this art. When subordinates have something to say to their superiors, the superiors always respond with a "humph." You report something to him, and he "humphs"; you give him ten suggestions, and he "humphs." The function of this art is to show the dignity of those above and also to show the displeasure of those above. The most important thing is that he has meaning but does not say it, wanting you to guess his meaning and do it. If you want to bribe him, it shows that he didn't necessarily want it, but you voluntarily sought him out.

This "humph" and "yes" created the Qing Dynasty's empire. We can say: Those above "humph" and those below say "yes" is politics.

Has this art disappeared since the Republic of China? It doesn't seem so. For example, more than ten years ago, the public made suggestions to the government. The government didn't speak, which was actually the same as "humph," meaning, "Do you also have the right to interfere in our affairs?" Students petitioned the government, and the government also didn't speak, which was actually the same as "humph," meaning, "Do you dare to interfere in our affairs?" But this time, the result of the "humph" was that the military and police opened fire. A group of petitioners were killed. Although the government didn't speak, it was actually still using the art of "humph" to handle everything.

Later, although I don't know if people were still "humphing" in their mouths, the art of "humph" became more and more exquisite and widespread, which is a fact.

As for not expressing the meaning and wanting you to guess and do it, that tradition has not changed either. We only need to remember that whenever something big happened in the past, people would just "humph" lightly, or even without a sound, and many people would rush to take care of it. Of course, if they didn't take care of it well, those in charge would be angry, but they would still not move a muscle but just "humph." However, with this one "humph," those who took care of it wouldn't even have time to say "yes" before being kicked away. But this was only temporary, and those people would try to find new opportunities to listen to a new "humph."

These are all about internal affairs. When it comes to external affairs, it's the opposite. Those who used to "humph" at people now don't dare to "humph" anymore.

I don't know if China infected foreign countries or if foreign countries were originally like this. Foreign masters also understand how to use the art of "humph" towards China. Of course, those are foreign goods, which are a little different from the exquisite goods, but the essence of "humph" is always the same. And the Japanese "humph" and the national "humph" are also very compatible. The "order form" is also becoming almost the same as what we have always used voluntarily.

These are all about the past. When it comes to the present—unfortunately, we can still cite real examples.

And we can't help but involve Mr. Jingwei again. As soon as Konoe "humphs," Mr. Wang quickly says "yes," and even says "yes" to what the "humph" didn't "humph" out. But the fact is also very cruel. Then the "Foreign Ministry" issued a statement, saying, "If Mr. Wang thinks that Konoe's statement was made because Japan is encountering military difficulties in China, then that is a misunderstanding." This is saying: You didn't take care of it well—with this one "humph," Mr. Wang is in danger of being kicked out. Of course, if Mr. Wang is willing to live a life of "yes," he will still have the opportunity to listen to a new "humph."

What should replace "yes" is "no." When "humph" encounters "no," it will turn into "oh." This "oh" means: You can't be bullied—following this sound is an open mouth—what we want is those mouths that are open and won't close.

### Looking at the National Flag from Afar

— Jie Yao

On this isolated island of Hainan,

We gaze

The scent of the soil of our motherland,

People

In the furnace,

We on the isolated island of Hainan,

Although separated from the motherland,

But we will not give up the struggle,

We gaze,

We look forward to

The victorious flag of our motherland.

### How We Broke Through the Siege of Nanjing

— Liu Yong

A Remembrance by a Medic

Our entire team of forty comrades (twenty-five men and nineteen women) worked for the Suzhou Red Cross. When Dachan fell and Suzhou faltered, and the Japanese army approached the city walls, we finally left this ancient Suzhou and walked all the way to Nanjing without any boats or vehicles. The city of Nanjing and the government offices had already been frantically evacuated by the devils. Only a few military agencies were maintaining order. This was the situation after November 15th.

Due to getting separated along the way, there were only thirty comrades at that time. When we arrived in Nanjing, we wanted to find the Red Cross headquarters to arrange work, but the headquarters had moved to Hankou a month earlier. So the entire team joined the Capital First Temporary Hospital as nurses. The hospital was located in the Foreign Affairs Building, which was quite spacious. Since the front lines were still far from Nanjing, there were not many wounded soldiers in the hospital. We lived a militarized life. Because we were tired from traveling in the past, we now felt at ease in our location.

The Japanese army had advanced along the highway to Tangshan (18 miles from Nanjing). Tangshan fell. The news became worse day by day. Wounded soldiers came in a constant stream. We were busy working day and night. Every staff member was excited and showed no signs of panic.

On the evening of December 7th, we suddenly received an order to reorganize into a field ambulance team. The first to respond were our twenty-five members (the remaining five were women). We immediately set off near Zijin Mountain. Our job was to transport wounded soldiers. Because there were so many people (an endless sea of soldiers), although the fighting was so fierce, every comrade was fearless and able to do their job. There are many situations here worth mentioning: we lived with the reserve soldiers, and we often met and talked with them. They all had a considerable understanding of this war of resistance. Even the illiterate so-called "old men" said it was more enjoyable than fighting their own people. Judging from the soldiers who died and were injured at that time, we knew that they all had a spirit of fearlessness. When their close brothers "got painted" (i.e., were injured, also called "wearing flowers") (returned, they were excited and desperately shouting and screaming. There was only excitement and no sorrow. If you saw the situation at that time, you would be able to pick up a gun and rush to the battlefield to kill them. On our side, we only had ambulance two cars. Of course, in terms of the route and the battle, it was not enough. As soon as the car arrived, everyone was desperately squeezing into the car. Obviously, this soldier had a broken leg, or a bullet had penetrated his waist, and his injuries were of course very serious, but he could also automatically try to rush into the car. One mile after the car started, the groans of the soldiers began; curses, calls for doctors, occupied the entire space in the car. Those who were too seriously injured had already died in the carriage. I remember one time there were twenty people, and eight actually died along the way. On the one hand, the road was too bumpy, and when the car arrived at the hospital gate, the soldiers in the above situation could not get out as automatically as when they got in. Even if their arms were injured, they had to be carried out on stretchers. Nanjing pressed duck is famous. Generally, the teams and helpers from nearby pressed duck shops that participated in the service temporarily took advantage of the panic about food. So this comrade came up with an idea and led us to eat pressed duck. There were more than three thousand ducks. Although more than fifty comrades came, they still felt that they couldn't eat or take them all. It was also impossible to just fill our stomachs with duck. In the end, because we were too hungry, we couldn't care about so many things. We didn't even have water to drink. I only ate half a duck and stopped. Two comrades ate two each and had a big meal, and then each took five or six back to feed the brothers. A long line formed a pressed duck formation. If the enemy saw it, they might say we were using a new type of weapon. The order to transport the wounded soldiers to Xiaguan came down early in the morning on the 12th. Enemy troops were also found at the airport, and a hole had been made in Zhonghua Gate. The news could be considered terrible to the extreme. The wounded soldiers who were transported to the Jiangbian in Xiaguan (a considerable number) were all eagerly waiting for the boat from Pukou on the opposite side. At about 10 o'clock at night, no boat came. The cold wind blew around, and the flames of war, the sound of gunfire, was endless. The tension and chaos in the air were unprecedented. Our car arrived with another batch of soldiers. Because there were no boats to cross the river, we finally grabbed a few medics and asked them to think of a way to get boats. A steamship was found downstream, which could hold 200 wounded soldiers. And our comrade, surnamed Jiang, knew how to drive (the government originally sent a ship to transport soldiers, but the driver deserted and ran away. The ship was left behind by them). At first, we thought the ship was broken, but after inspection, there was nothing wrong with it, so we started transportation.

At 1 p.m. on the 13th (the transportation did not stop in between), we found our old comrades (who were not injured) and five female comrades in the wounded soldier group. Selfishness always exists to some extent, so we first asked all our comrades to get off the boat and transport it to the other side of the river to the middle of the river. Because the horsepower was insufficient, it stopped in the middle of the river. The garrison soldiers in Pukou on the other side became suspicious, and the sound of gunfire rang out. Also, because we were too far apart, we couldn't explain clearly to the garrison soldiers on the other side. In the end, they opened fire on us. Two comrades were injured in the legs on the spot, and a soldier with an injured hand was repeatedly hit with a bullet in the arm. Of course, we cannot bury ourselves for saying that he opened fire for no reason, but a garrison soldier should have a telescope, even though the weather was a bit gloomy. When the sky did not respond and the ground did not listen, the small motorboat with the sun logo, which was supposed to be coming to patrol, was already cruising downstream. Everyone thought that they would definitely die with the boat. Strangely, the propulsion of this boat was able to move forward after their continuous repairs. "We are the Red Cross, we are wounded soldiers, brothers, don't shoot..." We used a collective shout to stop our garrison soldiers from shooting. We kept shouting while they kept firing cold shots at us (shooting into the air so as not to hit anyone). In this way, we left the danger zone and reached the shore. It was already 7:30 in the afternoon when we arrived at the shore. Strangely, the garrison soldiers who shot at us were also gone. The only sight in front of us was that the houses were burning, and the river water was surging in the darkness. Looking up, Nanjing looked like a big brazier. The sound of gunfire, killing, and shouting occupied the entire sky above Nanjing.

The cold wind was howling, and the soldiers' cries for boats were sent from the long sky. Responsibility makes us still miss the many injured soldiers who have not been transported over. In the end, cowardice (seeing the enemy's motorboat) made us lose the courage to go back.
