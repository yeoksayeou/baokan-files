### Intensifying Improvement of Military and Political Issues

The all-out war of resistance has transitioned from its first stage to its second, and a stalemate has emerged in various battlefields, both north and south. The situation of the enemy being superior and us being inferior, the enemy advancing and us retreating, is undergoing drastic change. While we have not completely halted the enemy's offensive, we have indeed partially succeeded in containing and disrupting it. Furthermore, in some areas, we have even begun the task of dismantling the enemy's forces and recovering lost territory. In particular, coupled with the strengthening of national unity in the political realm, the resolute determination to wage a protracted war, the depravity of pro-Japanese traitors and appeasers, the active progress of the international peace front, and the materialization of Soviet, American, and British aid to China, the shifting war situation is developing at an accelerated pace. The recent reckless provocation by the enemy, the "September 18th Incident in the Pacific," has given the Sino-Japanese war a more concrete form as an international conflict, intensifying the two-front war. This will undoubtedly have a very significant impact on the future of our war of resistance. We must seize this opportunity to actively improve our military, political, party affairs, and people's movements, ensuring that we can gain more time in this stalemated war situation, implement all new military and political plans, prepare to launch a counter-offensive strategy, and complete the great task of driving out the enemy, recovering lost territory, and building a new China.

The Supreme National Defense Council was established recently and held its first meeting. Party and political committees in various war zones will also be established one after another. We sincerely hope that the relevant authorities, in light of the current war situation and domestic and international circumstances, will make further improvements to the entire military and political system, actively expand the all-out war situation, and drive the enemy into greater difficulties, in order to achieve the ultimate victory of our war of resistance. Here, based on our knowledge and insights, we offer several humble suggestions for reference, hoping that the people of the country will pay attention and work together to promote progress.

The Supreme National Defense Council is currently the highest authority in our country's war of resistance and nation-building. Its members are mostly responsible officials from the Kuomintang's party, political, and military departments. The earnest expectations of people across the country and around the world are self-evident. There is no need to elaborate on the numerous military and political aspects that need improvement. However, based on the experience and lessons learned from twenty months of heroic resistance, we deeply understand the hardships of the war's development. The enemy has not abandoned its conspiracies of "quick victory," "using Chinese to control Chinese," "dividing China," and "anti-communist armistice," precisely because its domestic and international crises are becoming increasingly serious; otherwise, its future would be unimaginable. And what we rely on to overcome all difficulties, strive for final victory, and save ourselves from peril is the intensification of national unity, the development of a united front, and the unwavering determination to fight the war of resistance to the end. Now, while the enemy is actively preparing for a larger reckless war, it is also continuing to instigate pro-Japanese traitors, using the pretext of "anti-communism" and "peace" in an attempt to alienate our internal unity, undermine our all-out war of resistance, and achieve the complete subjugation of our country. Meanwhile, a small number of stubborn elements and ignorant people within our country continue to adhere to defeatist views and partisan prejudices, effectively becoming a special operations force for the Japanese and traitors. At the same time, the compromise policy of foreign rulers toward the aggressor further facilitates the enemy's conspiracy to halt our war of resistance. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council should strictly adhere to the basic principles of "uniting the nation and persisting in the war of resistance" adopted at the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, on one hand, swiftly realize a sound and well-developed organizational form for the united front, enabling the vibrant forces of all anti-Japanese political parties, ethnic groups, social strata, and people from all walks of life to be quickly and effectively concentrated under unified leadership, striving for the final victory of the war of resistance and the ultimate success of nation-building. On the other hand, intensify the elimination of all openly treasonous traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and puppet organizations, intensify the purging of lurking traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and their secret organizations and propaganda organs, and intensify the crushing of all conspiracies such as "anti-communism," "peace," and "international mediation" that could destroy our country, harm our nation, and endanger the world.

The Party and Political Committee is currently the highest authority in each war zone for unified handling of military, political, party affairs, and people's movement work. It is the glorious and great culmination of twenty months of experience and lessons learned from heroic resistance. The successive establishment of Party and Political Committees in various war zones fills people with infinite joy and anticipation. We would like to offer two particularly important opinions for responsible authorities to implement or consider. First, while the unified leadership and execution of military, political, party affairs, and people's movements in each war zone are urgently needed, economic work is even more urgently needed to obtain appropriate adjustments and unified, planned promotion. Therefore, we believe that in addition to presiding over military, political, and party affairs, the Party and Political Committee should also be responsible for economic work. First, all expenses related to military, party affairs, political, and people's movement needs in the war zone should be managed by the Party and Political Committee, correcting all past malpractices and difficulties. Second, implement political mobilization, expand economic work in the war zone, on one hand, destroy the enemy and traitor's economic plunder, and on the other hand, concentrate and develop appropriate and necessary economic forces. However, two points should be particularly emphasized here: one is to thoroughly eliminate the tendency of bureaucratism and thoroughly eliminate corrupt officials and feudal remnants; the other is to re-employ young talents with a strong sense of national consciousness, revolutionary spirit, and prestige among the masses.

Second, while we believe that the final victory can be achieved earlier, we cannot have muddled optimism. We would rather anticipate that we may encounter more dangerous traps and more serious attacks in the process of our war of resistance and nation-building, and we would rather anticipate that our war of resistance and nation-building will go through a very long and arduous struggle. Therefore, how to cultivate cadres is a very important and urgent issue at present. It has recently been rumored that Chen Cheng and Ye Jianying have been appointed to organize cadre training schools, although this has not yet been confirmed, but the urgency of the situation requires it, and it is expected that there will be factual developments soon. What we want to remind the relevant authorities and the people of the country is that, first, not only should a national large-scale organization of this kind of military and political cadre training school be established, but also training classes should be established in various war zones and troops under the program of war of resistance and nation-building and unified leadership. On one hand, meet the increasing demands of the front line, and on the other hand, intensify the establishment of a new leadership for the counter-offensive, driving out the enemy, and building a new China.

Second, the Three Principles of the People Youth League's call to open its doors to patriotic youth across the country is still an urgent requirement today. Only by enabling the youth of the whole country to participate in the national united front and fight heroically can we guarantee the final success of our war of resistance and nation-building.

### The Enemy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds with Sophistry; Britain and France Discuss Countermeasures; The Two Governments Maintain Close Contact; The Enemy Lands in the Southern Part of Hainan Island

[Special Dispatch from Kunming by This Newspaper, 14th] The enemy occupies Hainan Island. Long Yun said that the occupied guard post of the Pacific gate is tantamount to the beginning of the Pacific War. The enemy's purpose this time is to directly threaten Annam and indirectly monitor Britain and France, not to attack Guilin, and it has little impact on our war of resistance. French diplomacy is weak and can only laugh and cry. Democratic countries should no longer protest verbally or in writing, but should adopt a tough attitude to be of practical help.

[Hong Kong News] According to enemy sources, at about 5:00 a.m. on the 14th, enemy troops landed again at Sanya Bay, west of Yulin, at the southern end of Hainan Island, and invaded Sanya Street from Xincun.

Britain and France successively Lodge Protests with the Enemy Government

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, the governments of France and Britain successively lodged protests with the Japanese government on the same day, demanding an explanation of the reasons and nature of this move, and how long it would last. According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already submitted a reply, which mainly consists of five points: (1) Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is purely for military reasons, to destroy China's resistance; (2) Japan will continue to occupy the island until its goal is achieved; (3) The Japanese government has no intention of infringing upon the interests held by Britain and France. The British Foreign Office is currently studying this reply, and the governments of Britain and France will consult with each other to determine the appropriate countermeasures.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tokyo News. Regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, Foreign Minister Arita explained the matter to British Ambassador Craig this morning, and the assurances he provided were exactly the same as those he gave to French Ambassador Henri yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tokyo News. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Foreign Minister Arita at 9:30 this morning.

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] Under-Secretary Butler stated in response to a question from a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons yesterday that the government has been in contact with the French government regarding the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island. Conservative Member of Parliament Milner asked whether Japan had notified Britain and France of its intentions before occupying the island, and whether it had notified them of relevant information after the occupation. The Under-Secretary said that the points raised by Mr. Milner were of utmost importance, and he hoped that the relevant parties would pay attention to them.

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Conservative Member of Parliament Milner raised an inquiry about the Hainan Island issue. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied that the governments of Britain and France were exchanging opinions on how to jointly safeguard their respective interests.

[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with Japanese Ambassador Shiratori today to discuss the international repercussions caused by the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island.

The Philippines Feels Threatened; An American Warship Sails to Qiongzhou for Investigation

[Reuters, Shanghai, 14th] The U.S. destroyer "Edsall" has been ordered to proceed from Hong Kong to Haikou, Hainan Island, to investigate the situation there and provide assistance to American expatriates. The ship is expected to arrive tonight.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] The Navy Department has announced that the destroyer USS John D. Edwards, belonging to the U.S. South China Fleet, is scheduled to proceed to the northern coast of Hainan Island, China, on the 14th of this month for a routine voyage.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] The U.S. naval community heard that the U.S. destroyer Edsall will make a one- or two-day stopover in Haikou this time, and then sail to Hong Kong. If there are American expatriates living in Haikou who wish to leave, they can take the ship back to Hong Kong. Also, the U.S. ship Alden left Hong Kong yesterday and is expected to arrive in Haiphong tomorrow. The ship carries supplies for warships and five U.S. sailors to replace those on American ships. After arriving in Haiphong, they will report to Chongqing.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] In the southeastern Pacific, speculations are rife about the motives of Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, and a widespread sense of unease is growing. According to sources in Saigon, some well-informed people say that Japan intends to turn Hainan Island into a submarine base. Because Hainan Island is located in a strategic location, it is an ideal base for attacking Singapore, the Philippines, and Annam. Moreover, it straddles the main trade routes in the Far East, and the importance of its position can be imagined. Hainan Island is very close to the Philippines, no less than the gateway to the island. Therefore, if Japan occupies the island for a long time, with the weakness of the Philippines' national defense capabilities, it will lack a sense of security. For this reason, people in the Philippines who advocate independence are greatly discouraged. Military experts say that if Japan uses Hainan Island as a naval base, it will be easy to blockade Hong Kong, and its position as a hegemon in the Pacific will become more consolidated. It is reported that France is currently making every effort to strengthen the defenses of Tonkin Bay in Annam.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] Philippine officials and newspapers are still paying close attention to the Hainan Island issue. The Philippine Vanguard recently commented on Chairman Chiang's remarks on the Hainan Island issue, saying that Chairman Chiang's analysis of the situation may indeed have some basis in fact, which is an undeniable fact. If we are convinced that Hainan Island does not have a significant impact on the current Sino-Japanese war in terms of strategy, then we cannot but reach a conclusion, that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island must have a greater purpose. Some say that Japan's move is only one of Japan's military plans to invade China, but if Chairman Chiang's predictions unfortunately come true, then his warning to the countries of the Pacific should not be ignored, and the Philippines should listen to his warning and know what to be vigilant about.

### The Han and French Clash Again; The Japanese Blockade the Concession Again Starting Yesterday

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] This agency received a special report from Hankou stating that the Japanese authorities today once again strictly implemented a blockade on the transport of various food items into the French Concession. The Japanese army had previously banned food from overseas from being transported to the French Concession. After the French and Japanese authorities signed an agreement for the sake of the sustenance of the Chinese people in the concession, the ban was lifted. It is reported that this incident was caused by a new dispute between the French and Japanese sides.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] According to a report from this agency's reporter in Hankou, the origin of the Japanese authorities' sudden prohibition of food from entering the French Concession was because the French authorities did not allow the Japanese army to pass through the newly opened street in the French Concession. Therefore, the Japanese authorities took retaliatory measures, not only strictly prohibiting various food items, but also strictly restricting the entry and exit of all people, both Chinese and foreign. It is also said that the Japanese authorities do not allow the International Red Cross to transport food to the French Concession to relieve refugees, and demand that it be distributed by the Hankou Puppet Security Committee.

### Enemy Planes Attack Gansu and Shaanxi

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] Enemy planes have been reconnaissance and bombing in various parts of Shaanxi and Gansu for days, doing their utmost to vent their brutality. According to people from Pingliang, when enemy planes wantonly harassed Pingliang a few days ago, it happened to be the time of the mule and horse market, and merchants returning home gathered in the county town. The enemy planes then indiscriminately bombed civilians and livestock, and strafed with machine guns, killing more than a hundred unarmed civilians and eighty mules and horses.

### The Government Attaches Importance to Education in the Border Areas; The Border Education Committee is Established; Chen Lifu Serves Concurrently as Chairman

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper, 14th] The Border Education Committee has been established, with Chen Lifu serving concurrently as chairman, to thoroughly improve education in Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Xikang. The National Education Conference is scheduled to be convened in early March, focusing on the education of the occupied areas.

### Responding to Britain and the United States, France Sends a Note to Japan, Denouncing the So-Called "New Order"; Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Publishes the Full Text

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] After the governments of the United States and Britain successively sent notes to Japan, refuting its so-called "New Order in East Asia" and declaring their intention to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and not allow Japan to unilaterally revise it, the French envoy to Japan also submitted a similar note to Japan on the 19th of last month in response. Although there were records in domestic newspapers at the time, the content was brief and unclear. This agency has obtained the full text from the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the translated version is published as follows for the reference of those who are concerned about foreign affairs. The translated version is as follows: "The undersigned has been instructed to inform Your Excellency that the Imperial Government has recently issued a declaration, which is intended to promote the policy of the Imperial Government in the East, and the French Government has taken special note of it. The French Government believes that this policy is inconsistent with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. The French Government wishes to point out that any changes in the situation created by the existing treaty in China, which have not been consulted and agreed upon in advance by the countries concerned, will be difficult for the French Government to recognize or accept. The French Government still believes that the principles stipulated in the Washington Treaty of February 6, 1922, have not lost any of their value, and only by respecting these principles can the problems caused by Japan's actions in China be satisfactorily resolved by third countries. The French Government does not believe that the Imperial Government intends to unilaterally abandon the provisions of the treaty that it freely acceded to, or to change the situation created by such provisions, and to place third countries before a fait accompli, the nature of which is sufficient to seriously harm the interests of third countries. If the Imperial Government believes that the situation in the Far East allows for adjustments to the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, then its first task must undoubtedly be to notify other signatory countries of the suggestions that the Imperial Government deems appropriate, and based on the same assumption, the French Government will give the most careful study to the opinions put forward by the Imperial Government."

### Bai Chongxi Talks About the Progress of the War of Resistance - Continued

At the Enlarged Memorial Week in Yunnan

Advancing is Safety, Retreating is a Dead End

In the military aspect, our supreme strategies are protracted war and all-out war. Strategically, based on the achievements of the war of resistance over the past nineteen months, the foundation for our victory has been laid. The enemy's dream of a quick victory has been shattered by us and suffered a major defeat. And we are getting more and more, fighting harder and stronger. In the future, in addition to mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare, we must also widely launch all-out war. Regardless of east, west, north, or south, it will become a battlefield, and men, women, old, and young will participate in the war of resistance. Even culture and education must be mobilized. Shanxi is a current example. Now I will report on the situation in the Guangdong area. Recent rumors in Guangzhou, not to mention their landing in Beihai, say that they have built large airfields in Dongjing or Weizhou Island. Many people are afraid that the enemy will attack Yunnan. I can guarantee that the enemy has no such strength or tactics. If it lands in Beihai and attacks Yunnan, it will have to pass through Guangxi and Guiyang. Due to traffic congestion, and the presence of high mountains and steep ridges, it will probably have difficulty even reaching Guangxi. Moreover, the Beihai-Nanning highway has been thoroughly destroyed by us, making it extremely difficult to transport mechanized units and supplies. In addition, the people of Guangxi have been universally mobilized under the leadership of young people. They are firmly grasping the belief that politics is more important than military affairs, and guerrilla warfare is more important than positional warfare, and are earnestly preparing to unite the army and the people and cooperate sincerely. If the enemy really takes the risk of advancing, then we will mobilize the whole nation to attack them, expand the southwestern theater, and strive for the glory of our nation. I am not afraid of my hometown because the Japanese are invading our land. We command hundreds of thousands of soldiers to travel thousands of miles, struggling in the Yangtze River area, where the climate and terrain are not suitable. How can we not fight them when they come to our door with suitable conditions? (Thunderous applause) We are not afraid of the enemy attacking Nanning and Liuzhou. If it really wants to try, it will inevitably repeat Napoleon's advance on Moscow. Everyone should not think about finding a safe place to retreat every day. You must know that advancing is safety, and retreating is a dead end (applause). In short, in the past nineteen months, the enemy has occupied our land, but only at points and lines. As for the vast area, it is still in our hands. The future of the war of resistance is bright.

The Entire Far East Question is a World Question

Economically, we are an agricultural country, so even though the enemy has blockaded our seaports, it does not matter much, because our economic strength is in the countryside, not in the cities. Even if our arms transport is more difficult than before, we can manufacture them ourselves, especially our guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, the consumption of arms is very small. At the same time, Britain and the United States have given us great help, and the trend of actively sanctioning Japan, I am afraid that there will be more partner countries in the future. This is the sympathy we have gained from the bloody battle of millions of soldiers.) (Applause)

In terms of diplomacy, the League of Nations is powerless in the Nine-Power Treaty, but it is still a line of assistance. The importance of the Nine-Power Treaty is that Britain, the United States, and France have all risen up to provide assistance. Especially the peace and democratic front of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, we must grasp this assistance. We must understand that Japan's aggression against China is a problem for the entire Far East and also a world problem. As long as the United States deploys troops in the Pacific, and a large number of Russian planes are sent to Siberia and Vladivostok, and Britain and France are prepared in the Indian Ocean. At that time, will Japan not submit? [Continued on page four]

### The Western Transportation Network is Being Intensively Completed

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] A Hua source reports that the 1,200-kilometer railway project from Yunnan to Myanmar will be completed within two years. At present, China can only obtain foreign arms supplies through highway transportation. It is also reported that the National Government is now negotiating with France and the Soviet Union to establish air routes to connect China with the Soviet Union and Vietnam. In addition, the Sino-British air route connecting Chongqing and Yangon may be established in mid-March.

### An Enemy Bomber Forced to Land in Shayang, Central Hubei; Four People on Board Attempt to Escape by Boat; None Escape After Our Pursuit

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 13th] On the morning of February 1st, a strong wind and rain struck central Hubei. An enemy heavy bomber was forced to land in the air above Shayang on Shazhou, about thirteen miles northwest of the nearby area. It was discovered by our army, who opened fire. The enemy plane then struggled to fly again, but the nose of the plane was damaged. It only managed to cross Xiangyang before finally landing at Guankou. The people in the plane found a small boat in the river, killed the boatman, and sailed downstream in a hurry. When they passed Shayang, our river defense sentries called them to shore for inspection. The boat ignored the order, and our guards immediately pursued in a boat. At that time, the wind and waves were surging in the river. When they were chased to Xincheng, about twenty miles from Shayang, the front boat was about a hundred meters away. The people on the boat immediately opened fire on us. We returned fire. At this time, the enemy quickly threw the documents, objects, and machine guns in the boat into the river. The boat also stopped at this point. Our army boarded the boat for inspection and found that four people had been killed, and two others were seriously injured and died shortly after reaching the shore. Many important charts and other items, as well as amulets, talismans, and diaries, were found in the boat. The reporter personally saw the symbols, armbands, collar badges, and business cards worn by the six enemies in Shayang, all belonging to enemy aviation Colonel Watanabe Hirota, Majors Okuda Yuzo, Takahashi Fukujiro, wireless employee Izumisawa Nobuo, maintenance worker Warrant Officer Tani Satakashi, and Shimmura Shigejiro.

### Chairman Chiang Orders All Military Districts to Strictly Prohibit Illegal Conscription; New Recruits are Specifically Allowed to Report Derelict Officials

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper, 14th] The Ministry of Military Affairs, upon the order of Chairman Chiang, telegraphed all provincial military districts, stating that after new recruits enlist in the army, the training officers should first inquire in detail about their family situation, background, and experience. If they were illegally conscripted, they are allowed to report it. After verification, the person in charge of the conscription agency and the Baojia chief in the district will be thoroughly investigated and punished.

### Fierce Battles on the Northern Front: We Recapture Ren County, While Gan, E, and Xiang Provinces Adopt a Defensive Posture

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 14th] Gan, E, and Xiang provinces are all adopting a defensive posture, and the battle situation is quiet. The provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, and Hebei are more active, constantly engaging in fierce battles with us. Teng Jing is currently in southern Hebei, and Umezu has arrived in Taiyuan. In the areas of Xinxiang, Xiuwu, Yangwu, and Yuanwu in northern Henan, there are approximately eight to nine thousand [Japanese troops], with over a thousand in Yuanwu. An attempted southward advance was repelled, and we recaptured Yangqiao Lai Tongzhai and other places. Guerrilla warfare is intense on the border between Shandong and Hebei. A portion of the [Japanese] forces in western Shandong opened up towards southern Hebei, and we are intercepting and attacking them separately.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 14th] In southern Shanxi, a certain brigade of our forces engaged in a bloody battle with the [Japanese] for seven days and nights in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Yesterday, they advanced towards Wenxi and encountered the [Japanese] in battle, inflicting heavy casualties. The [Japanese] forces in Linfen have increased to three thousand, and the [Japanese] forces in Yicheng and Qinshui are being transferred towards Hejin. Fierce battles have been taking place near Jishan since the 11th. The main force of the [Japanese] Ushijima Division is also gathering in this direction. Ren County in Hebei Province was recaptured by the troops of Shi Yousan on the 11th, annihilating over five hundred [Japanese troops]. The remaining [Japanese troops] fled in defeat to Xingtai. Our North China Guerrilla Force has shattered the [Japanese] encirclement line.

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 14th) The [Japanese] forces in Heshun fled in defeat towards Tulianping and Niuchuan. We are currently in pursuit. Xiyang is under our counter-offensive. The [Japanese] 'mopping-up' operation in eastern Shanxi has failed. Transportation between Houma and Xinjiang is very busy.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] Military news, the situation in southern Hebei in brief is as follows: (1) Fierce battles are raging in the suburbs of Julu. Our troops annihilated hundreds of [Japanese soldiers] in the area of Dongnan Di Village and Yangliu Xing in the east of the city, capturing over thirty warhorses and a large amount of supplies. One unit of our [forces] in Liu Village, northwest of [Julu], defeated over two hundred reinforcing [Japanese soldiers], killing sixty to seventy [Japanese soldiers] and seizing over ten boxes of ammunition. (2) Several hundred [Japanese troops] from Dacheng advanced south towards Shizhuang but were defeated by a certain unit of our army, killing and wounding forty to fifty [Japanese soldiers]. The remaining [Japanese troops] fled back to Dacheng in disarray. (3) Over two hundred [Japanese troops] with two cannons from Xian County attacked our Maizhuang starting from the 30th, engaging in fierce battles with a certain unit of our army. The [Japanese] gradually increased their forces to six to seven hundred. Another unit of our [forces] intercepted the [Japanese], defeating them and killing over a hundred [Japanese soldiers]. We captured a large amount of military supplies.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] On the 4th, over three hundred [Japanese troops] departed from Yangquan for Meng County in over ten automobiles. On the same day, over four hundred [Japanese troops] departed from Shijiazhuang for Shouyang in over thirty automobiles. The [Japanese] in Pingding have been reinforcing Xiyang for days.

[Min Ge News Agency, Beile, 14th] The [Japanese] troops in Renqiu, Hebei Province, were thrown into great panic after being subjected to several fierce attacks by a certain unit of our army. On the 2nd, they fled in disarray across the river. After our army recovered [Ren] County, they advanced towards Hejian. The [Japanese] reinforced with four to five hundred troops from Xian County, joining over a thousand retreating [Japanese troops] from Renqiu. They clashed with our army in Dacaocun, west of Hejian. The [Japanese] initially bombarded us with fierce artillery fire, followed by the release of large amounts of poison gas. Many of our officers and soldiers were poisoned, but they did not retreat. They fought a bloody battle with the [Japanese] for three days and nights, engaging in hand-to-hand combat five to six times, and finally defeated them completely. In this battle, over three hundred [Japanese soldiers] were killed. We captured over fifty rifles, three machine guns, and countless other military supplies.

Both sides suffered heavy casualties, and it is said that there were nearly four thousand abandoned corpses from the battle.

### The Newspaper Industry in the Wartime Capital

— Zhi Wo

[Special Chongqing Airmail Dispatch] After the fall of Wuhan, several newspapers with a long history and a large readership retreated with important government agencies in order to preserve their strength in using words for war propaganda. Chongqing is now the center of our military, political, and economic efforts for resisting Japan, building the nation, and reviving the nation, and it is also our temporary capital. Cultural undertakings are inseparable from the concentration of national power, so after the fall of Wuhan, newspapers from various places mostly moved to Chongqing one after another to continue publishing. Not only newspapers moved, but also various publishing houses and magazine publishers all moved to Chongqing to resume their responsibility for war propaganda.

Chongqing formerly had a population of over 200,000. Since the beginning of the war of resistance eighteen months ago, the number of people who have moved in from various places has gradually increased. As of recently, it has reached a population density of 750,000. It can be said that, excluding the major cities in the occupied areas, Chongqing is now the only large metropolis in the country. Before the war, there were five or six large and small newspapers, including the Xinshu Daily, Guomin Gongbao, Shangwu Daily, Jichuan Gongbao, and Dalu Evening News. Among them, Xinshu and Guomin both had a history of twenty or thirty years. They were published daily on three large sheets and had very good circulation. They were relatively healthy newspapers in the local area. Last spring, the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao, Nanjing Xinminbao, and Nanjing Evening News moved here one after another. At the same time, the [Nationalist Government's] Headquarters also started a Southwest Daily, which aroused a great wave in the newspaper industry of this wartime capital. Although all newspapers reduced their size and changed to one sheet as required by the Central Propaganda Department, business competition was fierce. The Xinminbao was published daily on one sheet of four-open paper. It was short, concise, and well-arranged, and it was able to compete with the larger newspapers. For a time, its circulation even exceeded that of the major newspapers, and it became a pivotal voice among Chongqing's mid-sized newspapers.

After November of last year, the major newspapers of Wuhan and Changsha retreated here. The Dagongbao, Zhongyang, Xinhua, Saodang, Dajiang, and Wuhan Shibao were published in Chongqing one after another. For business reasons, the Xinshu Daily also started a Xinshu Evening News at this time. As of now, there are eleven major newspapers, two mid-sized newspapers, and three evening newspapers in Chongqing. In a metropolis with a population of 750,000, after deducting seven-tenths for illiteracy, there are only less than 300,000 readers. Yet there are sixteen newspapers, large, medium, and evening, which can be said to be suffering from indigestion. Therefore, the reputable major newspapers have a maximum daily circulation of only 12,000 to 13,000 copies, the average is only 5,000 to 6,000 copies, and the lowest is only about 2,000 to 3,000 copies.

Generally speaking, Chongqing's newspapers are clearly divided into local newspapers and newspapers from other places. The Xinshu Daily and Guomin Gongbao are naturally the best of the local newspapers. Among the newspapers from other places, the Dagongbao, Shishi, Zhongyang, Saodang, and Xinhua are all about the same. The biggest difference in their circulation is only 1,000 to 2,000 copies. The Shishi Xinbao moved here several months earlier, so its roots are slightly deeper, and its circulation and advertisements are slightly better.

Except for the Dagongbao, the others all have their own printing facilities. However, because it is difficult to find a complete building, the Central, Saodang, and Xinhua, which moved here later, all have their printing plants and editorial departments located in two or three places. The editorial department of the Central Daily News is located on Ducheng Street, squeezed into the upstairs of a grocery store. In the same courtyard, there is a billiards room, a Shenping Book Tea House, and others... In short, the environment is a noisy place. When the editor looks out, he can really 'be dazzled by a riot of color, and deafened by the din of pipes and strings.' The machinery of the Dagongbao was transported by boat when it retreated from Wuhan, but it has not yet arrived. Someone asked Mr. Wang Yunsheng, and Mr. Wang said, 'It has been transported, but only God knows when it will arrive.'

Because of transportation, printing materials such as newsprint and ink are extremely scarce here. Neither rolled nor flat newsprint can be purchased. The Saodang, Dagong, Shishi, Xinshu, Xinmin, Guomin, and Dajiang are using old stock that was transported here six months ago. It is feared that it will soon be exhausted. The Xinhua, Central, Southwest, Jichuan, and Shangwu have all switched to using local paper a month ago. Sichuan has produced local paper for more than ten years, and newspapers have been using it for more than ten years as well. The first local paper produced was only flat, and it was too soft and not durable. Since the war of resistance, demand has exceeded supply. The paper mills have added strength and strived for perfection because of the development of business. Mass production has reached its peak, and rolled paper has also been produced. The paper has good toughness. The only difference is that, due to raw materials and technology, it cannot be changed from the yellow color of grass paper to the white color of Western newspapers, which is even inferior to the domestic newspapers in Jiangxi. Locals call this paper 'Jiale Paper.'

There are five or six factories specializing in the production of "Jiale Paper" in Hechuan, Yongchuan, Bishan, and Rongchang counties in Sichuan. Only one factory in Yongchuan makes rolled paper. The Central and Xinhua both use "Jiale rolled paper." This kind of rolled paper is not priced by weight but by ream, and each ream costs 24 yuan. Flat "Jiale Paper" sells for 18 yuan per ream. There are also various inferior grades, which sell for 16 yuan and 14 yuan. The factories are operating day and night, but demand still exceeds supply. Some people worry that in five months, when the other newspaper offices run out of their stock of paper, they will have to switch to local paper, and it is feared that soaring paper prices will be a minor issue. A paper shortage will be inevitable.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently making great efforts to encourage the relocation of inland paper mills or the revival of local closed paper mills as a way to alleviate the paper shortage. It is said that some people are preparing to invest heavily in building a large factory, but 'distant water cannot quench present thirst.' The immediate difficulties will probably remain unresolved.

Most of the publishing houses that retreated to Chongqing with the fall of Wuhan have already resumed operations. But since paper is scarce and printing is difficult, the printing factories that each had special contracts with in Hankou are all operating at full capacity and cannot handle large-scale printing, which has had a very dire impact on the publishing industry. Several houses, including Shenghuo, Datong, Tianma, and Xinzhi, have not published a single new book in six months, and they are still selling the old stock that they brought back from Wuhan.

There are over seventy kinds of magazines, weeklies, semi-monthlies, and monthlies, as well as war songs, literary and political commentaries, and military celebrations, including those originally published locally in Sichuan and those that have retreated from various places. Everyone is still working hard as before. The only difference is that traffic is inconvenient, sales in other places are stagnant, and paper and ink are too expensive, so they dare not print too much. Among them, "China's Air Force," "Digest," "National War of Resistance," and "Guoxun" have the best sales, but the most is only 10,000 copies, and the least is 3,000 to 4,000 copies. Over twenty houses such as "Guoxun" cannot afford to use newsprint and have switched to using local paper.

Although there seem to be so many newspapers and magazines in the wartime capital, and the prospect of operating them is so difficult, everyone is in good spirits. Everyone knows its mission and struggles hard. In the rear of the overall war of resistance, it has built a spiritual supply station, and it has contributed its due responsibility to the path to final victory. (Chongqing, 6th)

### Anti-Aggression League China Branch Exposes [Japanese] Ambitions: States that Landing in Hainan Has Direct Conflicts with Powers

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League has sent a telegram to the Geneva General Assembly, stating the fact of the Japanese military landing on Hainan Island and its serious impact. The telegram stated roughly, "This association wishes to notify all countries of the world, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, that the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island intends to control the Gulf of Tokyo, so that Japan can surround the Philippines and cut off traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore. If a war occurs in the Pacific, Japan can resist the joint actions of the British and American navies. If Japan builds fortresses and enhances defenses on Hainan Island, then the power of the Japanese will expand to the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, Japan's invasion of Hainan Island is not another Sino-Japanese 'incident,' but part of the entire Pacific problem and has a direct relationship with some powerful countries. If the Japanese military resolutely occupies Hainan Island, then the entire international situation will inevitably change."

### Acknowledging the Spanish Rebel Army Issue: French Cabinet Meeting Discussed, With Lebrun Attending in Person. The British Steps Will Be Presented to Parliament.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the British government is in close contact with the French government regarding the recognition of the Franco government, but no decision has yet been made. A member of parliament asked whether Parliament should be guaranteed a discussion before any steps are decided. Chamberlain replied that the government would naturally be responsible. Chamberlain replied to other questions, stating that Senior Naval Officer Palma, a senior naval officer of the Spanish Rebel Army, admitted that the bombing of the British cruiser HMS Devonshire in Mahon Harbor was a violation of orders and expressed his deep apologies.

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The French Cabinet held a meeting this morning under the personal chairmanship of Lebrun to discuss the issue of reversing the Franco government.

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet informed British Ambassador Phipps today that the French government's cabinet meeting will decide to recognize the Franco government in principle. However, legal recognition of the Franco government will be decided after the situation in Madrid has calmed down. In addition, Palada is now returning to Burgos to maintain diplomatic contact with the Franco government. The Spanish Republican government's ambassador to France visited French Foreign Minister Thérèse today to convey Prime Minister Negrin's note to France, stating that the Spanish Communist government has been re-established in Madrid.

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Local political figures believe that the French cabinet will decide on the principle of recognizing the Franco government no later than tomorrow, and will send Bérard to Burgos again to exchange views again. Leftists will severely oppose the immediate and unconditional recognition. French citizens will also greatly oppose it. It is heard that the French government's recognition of Franco will include the transfer of the Spanish Embassy in Paris to the rebel envoys, the French government severing relations with the Madrid government, and the transfer of Spanish gold in France to Franco. According to the Paris Evening News, Franco will use the gold to pay off his German-Italian war debts. Everyone feels that the handling of the Spanish government army that has entered French territory will become a very difficult problem.

Spanish Government Forces Resolve to Defend Madrid to the Death

[Central News Agency, Madrid, 13th] Today, the Spanish government authorities here distributed countless pamphlets with slogans, advising residents to defend Madrid to the death and not to retreat even a single soldier. All workers in the national defense industry are adding twelve hours of work each day. Even women and disabled soldiers are being conscripted to participate in defense work. All disabled soldiers are being re-examined, and those who are still able to serve in the military are being sent to the front for combat. Those who are semi-disabled are being hired as workers by various factories. Military experts have inspected the Madrid defense line and are preparing to set up new fortifications.

[Associated Press, Perpignan, 12th] Barcelona reports that in the past 24 hours, the rebel army has occupied the Llivia area in northern Catalonia. The enemy has also been cleared west of Figueras, and more than two hundred trucks loaded with ammunition have been seized. It also stated that in the fifty days of the rebel army's attack on Catalonia, the government army's transportation on three sides has been cut off, and 110,000 people have been captured and over 30,000 have been killed or wounded. The rebel army currently has a military force of approximately 300,000, of which 80,000 are reserves. Reports from Madrid say that the lines are quite quiet, but rebel aircraft are constantly bombing Madrid and Valencia, causing heavy civilian casualties. The Spanish government army is now headquartered in Madrid and has resolved to continue the war of resistance.

[Central News Agency, Burgos, 14th] The Spanish rebel army government recently issued a decree stating that its purpose is to prevent local authorities from taking retaliatory measures against the people under the jurisdiction of the current Republican government. The decree stipulates that local authorities may refer to the specific circumstances of each case when considering the provisions for punishment. According to the penalty rules, the government may confiscate all or part of the property of the parties concerned, and sentence them to imprisonment for three months to fifteen years.

### Senior U.S. Naval Officials Closely Watch the Large-Scale Exercises: Ships and Aircraft Sail to Designated Locations. Hull Refuses to Convene Disarmament Conference.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Senior naval officers are currently closely watching the development of simulated warfare between the two fleets in large-scale exercises. The purpose of this exercise is entirely to test the navy's defensive strength. The Black Fleet, led by Admiral Gages, has secret orders to sail to the Atlantic Ocean and then attack the Panama Canal from there. The White Fleet, under the command of Admiral Andrews, is preparing to repel the above attack. However, because the exact direction of the attack is not yet known, it is necessary to conduct extensive reconnaissance, and even the coast of South America is included in the defense line, as the attackers may inevitably use it as a base for air operations. All the battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers, and submarines participating in the exercises departed from their bases at midnight on Sunday. It is said that it will take two or three days of sailing to reach the "battlefield" area. In this exercise, senior officials are trying to give both sides an equal opportunity to show their abilities. They will also go to sea on ships to observe the "battle" and calculate the points of victory or defeat for both sides. Heavy artillery exercises have been conducted in the past few days, and the results of the shooting will also be the result of the large-scale exercises. According to naval experts, this exercise is the first of its kind in American history, and its purpose is to check whether the national defense strength in the Western Hemisphere is sufficient.

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The warships, aircraft, and submarines participating in the large-scale Atlantic naval exercise are heading to their designated locations. This exercise is very important. Roosevelt arrived at the exercise site to inspect the exercise. U.S. officials maintain extreme secrecy about this exercise and do not allow any journalists to visit.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Senator Parr proposed to the Senate to expand the national defense air force and start training 80,000 civil aviation personnel at the same time.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The largest naval exercise in American history opened yesterday in the Caribbean Sea. 114 warships, 61,000 officers and soldiers, and 100 aircraft participated.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] Democratic Congressman Lu Luli requested that the government convene an international disarmament conference. This proposal has been rejected by Secretary of State Hull, who believes that the international situation is such that it is not appropriate to take this step.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The Army and Navy Journal is the most authoritative publication for U.S. Army and Navy officers and soldiers. This issue of the weekly carries a full-page editorial, believing that the U.S. has legitimate reasons to allocate huge military expenditures. It is important to know that once the colonies of the United Kingdom and France fall into the hands of totalitarian countries, then the U.S. will have extremely difficult responsibilities in terms of national defense. If the British and French navies can always maintain their strength, then the U.S. will be absolutely safe, and any enemy will find it difficult to approach the U.S. border. If the British and French armies "fail," then the U.S. will become the target of attack by various totalitarian countries. Consider that if war breaks out again in Europe, who can say that the British and French armies will necessarily be safe? According to a special article by famous military reporter Colonel Palmer in the New York Times on the 22nd of last month, the U.S. is absolutely not afraid of any enemy ships approaching the U.S.

[Associated Press, New York, 14th] U.S. Admiral Huo Huochi recently gave a speech at the Mining and Metallurgical Engineers Society, stating that although the U.S. has begun to build 100 warships, including 6 battleships, and is actively expanding the air and ground forces, the U.S. strength is still not enough to cope with war. Huo Huochi pointed out that the obstacle to national defense expansion is that various manufacturing machines are not fully available. The government is now strongly urging factories to pay attention to this point. The countries of Europe and Asia spent 16 billion yuan on the arms race last year, but the U.S. will not be so "enthusiastic." The U.S. Army is also ranked nineteenth in the world, and the Navy is only ranked third. This is probably because we are not currently in danger of being invaded, but we must also prepare for any eventuality.

### British House of Commons Debates the Far East Issue: Members Are Dissatisfied with Japanese Aggression, and Dian-Burma Transportation Is Under Development.

[Reuters, London, 13th] In the British House of Commons today, several questions concerning China were raised again for debate. Conservative MP Hanna asked about the relationship between the British Concession in Tianjin and the Japanese authorities there. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that regarding the various restrictions imposed by the Japanese on the movement of residents within the Concession under the pretext of preventing anti-Japanese activities, the local British Consul has sent a note to the Japanese authorities, and the British government has also sent a note to the Japanese government. He also said that the government will pay close attention to the situation there. Butler then replied to Conservative MP Moore-Brabazon, stating that the blockade of the Pearl River was first by the Chinese government, and after the fall of Guangzhou, it was by the Japanese government. The British government has protested to each government and will take all possible steps to achieve the opening of the Pearl River. Regarding the British government's negotiations with the Japanese government on British interests in the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Beining railways, Butler said that he reported this matter on December 21st of last year, and the situation has not changed. The question of what more effective methods will be adopted in the future is being re-examined. Moore Brabazon asked the Under-Secretary to pay attention to this matter, saying that it has been under consideration for several months since December 21st of last year. The Under-Secretary replied that he would pay close attention. He also answered other questions from Moore Brabazon. Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's restoration of its administrative rights in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, the Municipal Council is negotiating with the local Japanese authorities. We are waiting for the results of their negotiations and do not want the government to negotiate directly with the Japanese for the time being. The Under-Secretary then replied to Conservative MP Marsden, saying that the British Consul-General in Shanghai has reported that there is little progress in organizing the Yangtze River Shipping Company. It is very doubtful whether the company currently has any ships. In other aspects, the situation on the Yangtze River has not changed. British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has sent another note to the Japanese government. Then Hanna asked whether the Japanese government does not allow the Joint Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan to sell foreign exchange to those who do not use Joint Reserve Bank banknotes. He asked the government to send another note to the Japanese government, stating that it is invalid to recognize counterfeit currency. The Under-Secretary replied that the government believes that sending such a note at this time will not achieve a useful purpose. Japan is now clear about the British government's view, that the issuance of inconvertible banknotes in North China is harmful to the interests of all trading countries. He said that he would keep this matter in mind.

[Reuters, London, 13th] In the British House of Commons today, a member of parliament questioned the authorities about the transportation situation between Burma and India, what steps the government will take to improve the existing transportation, and what new transportation methods it will open. Under-Secretary for Indian and Burmese Affairs Colonel Muirhead reported on the situation of the new road from Lashio to Kunming. He also reported that only when the weather is clear can traffic pass through the section from Bhamo to that road. He also said that regarding the route from Bhamo to Tengchong, the government has agreed with the Chinese government to establish an air route between Burma and Kunming. The establishment of other routes is also under consideration. Labor MP Gilson asked whether these transportation routes are important in terms of military strategy and transportation since Japan occupied Hainan Island, and whether the government has considered ways to promote transportation convenience. Under-Secretary Muirhead said that this must be considered before a reply can be given.

### Britain's Note to Japan Has Not Yet Been Answered

[Reuters, London, 13th] The British Foreign Secretary said during question time in the House of Commons today that the British government sent a note to the Japanese government on January 14th, stating that the British government cannot accept or recognize the situation changed by force. The Japanese government has not yet answered the note.

### Palestine Talks Continue; Jewish Delegation Issues Statement: The Fundamental Problem Lies in Residence

[Reuters, London, 13th] The Palestine Conference continued this morning. Colonial Secretary MacDonald and Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Butler jointly met with the Arab delegation. The theme of the meeting was to discuss the document presented by Pasha concerning the neighboring states of Palestine. According to well-informed sources, Pasha made efforts last week to reconcile the disputes between the two Arab parties.

[Reuters, London, 12th] The Jewish delegation to the Palestine Conference issued a statement today, saying, "The fundamental problem for Jews lies in having nowhere to live. We believe that the Jewish and Arab nations can find a mutually beneficial method to solve this problem. This method must be based on the League of Nations mandate system. The number of Jews immigrating to Palestine should be based on the region's economic capacity and absorptive capacity. The interests of minorities in Palestine should be effectively protected. Jews do not want to rule the Arabs, but they will never be ruled by the Arabs. As for the plan to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, it will take a long time to realize. The Arabs say that Palestine is an Arab country, but this is impossible to realize. Jews account for one-third of the population of Palestine, and their economic and cultural activities account for two-thirds. The construction work of Jews in Palestine in the past sixty years has been remarkable. The British government's plan to amend the mandate system to weaken the basic rights of Jews is beyond our expectations. The world must have a land for Jews to live in, where Jews can determine their own destiny and not be ruled by others. Palestine has become prosperous through the efforts of Jews for sixty years, with excellent agricultural and industrial conditions, and a Jewish society has been established. Palestine can now accommodate millions of refugees. If Palestine cannot accommodate all the refugees, it should still accommodate as many Jews as possible. We are extremely willing to reach an understanding with the Arabs. Although Palestine is a holy land for the Arabs, it is not a holy land for the British. The area has never been a center of civil development for the Arabs."

### U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Brandeis Resigns

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Brandeis, has now resigned. He is eighty years old and in poor health. He assumed this position on January 28, 1916. Brandeis was the first Jew to serve on the highest court.

### New German Battleship "Bismarck" Launched; Hitler Presides in Person

[Reuters, Hamburg, 14th] Germany recently built three 25,000-ton battleships. One of them was launched today. Hitler personally attended the ceremony. The ship was named "Bismarck," and Bismarck's granddaughter performed the naming ceremony. Hitler delivered a short speech praising Bismarck as the creator of the Second German Empire.

### U.S. Congress Passes Resolution Mourning the Pope

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The U.S. Congress adjourned until tomorrow. Both the Senate and the House passed resolutions expressing deep mourning for the Pope's death.

### Government Wins Majority in Czech Provincial Elections

[Reuters, Prague, 13th] In the elections in the provinces of Kapes and Ukra, the government won a majority of 92%. 93% of voters were involved.

### Italy to Make Demands: Seeking Tunisia, Gibraltar, and Participation in Suez Canal Management; Italian Warships to Concentrate in Preparation for Any Eventuality

[Associated Press, Rome, 14th] According to diplomatic circles here, Mussolini may issue a public statement on the 19th, explaining Italy's natural inclinations to the world, especially regarding the Mediterranean and North Africa. Because of his successes in Spain, Mussolini is increasingly confident. The current statement may focus on the following three points: (1) Italy's population is rapidly increasing, and it is indeed necessary to reclaim Tunisia. (2) Italy urgently wants to participate in the management of the Suez Canal. (3) Gibraltar naturally belongs to Italy geographically in East Africa.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] Italian officials announced that several Italian warships previously dispatched to patrol the Central American region have completed their mission and have decided to return to Italy and no longer advance westward. According to foreign naval observers, the sudden return of the Italian warships this time is due to the anti-fascist movements that have taken place in Central America. In addition, the Italian government, due to the serious international situation, urgently wants to concentrate Italian warships in Italian territorial waters in the shortest possible time in preparation for any eventuality.

Brief Comments

### The Backing of Protest

Japan's invasion of Hainan Island has effectively expanded the war of aggression against China into a major war for supremacy in the Pacific. Britain, France, and the United States are under serious threat. Therefore, it is inevitable that Britain, France, and the United States will protest against Japan. Yesterday, Britain followed France in protesting against Japan's occupation of Hainan Island.

However, verbal and written protests must have strong strength as backing in order to be effective. What is the backing for peaceful countries protesting against aggressors now? We saw the British Prime Minister's statement yesterday, after consulting with the French government, to jointly protect interests in the Far East. We also saw the fact of the U.S. Navy's exercises. Yes, only the unity and cooperation of peaceful countries, only the demonstration of military strength, is the most powerful backing for all protests. But there are also forces that we have not yet clearly recognized. The first is the power of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, and the second is the power of the international labor masses in Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Germany, and Italy in their anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggles. We must organize and unite these forces and coordinate them with our country's and Spain's struggles against aggression and for liberation in order to become the backing for protesting against fascist aggressors.

### The Spring Festival Has Arrived

The Spring Festival has arrived, or, to put it bluntly, the Lunar New Year has arrived!

According to Chinese folk customs, the common people work hard day and night, and when the New Year comes, they take the opportunity to celebrate wildly through the rituals of worshiping gods and respecting heaven. From a human perspective, this is indeed not something to be criticized, and many praiseworthy reasons can be cited!

However, if we think about it, in such an unreasonable society, who really gets to celebrate wildly during the New Year? Isn't it those who are usually oppressed by heavy economic shackles and can't even catch their breath? If we think of our homeland under the bombardment of invaders' artillery fire, and our fields, houses, elders, sisters under the oppression and murder of invaders and traitors, we really have to wonder: whose is the New Year after all? Whose is the Spring Festival after all?

Wealthy people living in special areas, don't let yourselves forget your place in the earth-shattering sound of firecrackers, gongs, drums, and laughter! In order to protect eternal freedom, security, and happiness, everyone should save some consumption to dedicate to our motherland, to support our frontline soldiers, and to help our refugees in various places. The motherland, soldiers, and refugees are holding up their passionate hands to you. Don't lose your chance to make a glorious offering!

### Italy and Germany Sign Trade Agreement; France and Germany Also Hold Business Negotiations: Exchanging Coal and Iron, Selling Agricultural Products

[Associated Press, Rome, 14th] According to the Italian official news agency, the Italian-German trade agreement was signed yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th] French-German business negotiations began yesterday. Germany's exchange of coal for French pig iron and the issue of the German market accommodating the sale of French agricultural products are the themes of the negotiations between the two sides.

### Bai Chongxi Speaks on the Progress of the War of Resistance (Continued from Page 3)

Eliminate Cultural Traitors

In the cultural field, we should strive to enhance the people's awareness of the war of resistance. This is an important task for cultural figures. But there is a kind of cultural figure who is a believer in national defeatism. We must guard against him. He specializes in spreading rumors and disseminating all kinds of deceptive fallacies that shake people's hearts. The fallacies of these defeatists are even more harmful than tangible traitors. I call these people "cultural traitors." We must eliminate them (applause) in order to establish our people's belief in resisting the war.

Finally, I would like to report on the departure of Mr. Wang Jingwei. On this point, I want to make it clear that I am not attacking individuals. I am thinking for the country and the nation. Originally, Mr. Wang was a senior member of the Kuomintang, and I had a very good personal relationship with him. But the fact that he sought peace and left is obvious. I cannot but report it to everyone so that everyone has an understanding. Mr. Wang's seeking peace and leaving this time is a consistent policy of his advocacy of peace. After the fall of Nanjing, he advocated peace. After the fall of Wuhan, he sought peace again. This time, after the fall of Guangzhou, he sought peace even more actively. Before he left, he reported at the memorial week in Chongqing: He said: China must now seek peace. Today, I am here to say this. Even if someone takes a gun and shoots me three or even thirty times, I will still advocate peace. Everyone in Chongqing knows that he said this! Once, he asked me to visit Chairman Chiang. He also talked about peace and asked what I thought. I said: I am a soldier, and obedience is my duty. I don't know whether to seek peace or not. I will do whatever the supreme commander tells me to do. I am following the national policy of resisting the war. In history, I have never seen a country perish because of resisting the war. But people like Tao Xisheng have read history too chaotically, so they have their current behavior. Mr. Wang is a person suffering from a pro-Japanese disease. Every time he sees a victory on the front line, he is annoyed. When he sees a defeat on the front line, he is happy instead. When he was in Chongqing, he proposed five conditions for seeking peace. The recent telegrams are related to his considerable contact with X chief Konoe. In short, Mr. Wang is not a great statesman. If he were a great statesman, then, like Eden and Chamberlain in Britain, if their political views were not in harmony, they would frankly resign and stand aside without hindering others. Our current war of resistance is an established national policy, is the claim of the people, and it is also the resistance for peace, but the X have closed the door to peace. How can he advocate peace? Moreover, peace must be achieved on the basis of equality. How can unequal demands be peaceful? Furthermore, individuals cannot act alone and casually negotiate peace. At present, besides traitors, who else does not want to resist the war to survive? (Applause) Therefore, after Mr. Wang left, the pro-Japanese and moderate elements in Chongqing were uprooted. (Mulin)

### The New Crisis in Europe

— Translated by Dong Ping

Original by Politicus. Adapted and translated from "Moscow News"

In London, groups of students paraded the streets with signs that read, "We Demand American Aid!"; in Montmartre, French crowds were gazing at Mount Vesuvius and shouting slogans; similarly, Roman parliamentarians, fascist cadres, and Mussolini's henchmen were loudly demanding "Corsica," "Nice," "Tunisia," and "Gibraltar"; in fact, such antics are all the same, simply making unreasonable demands.

Unfortunately, in this world, democratic countries have failed to uphold a firm policy and force; therefore, the arrogance of fascism has grown increasingly intense; and Mussolini's demands have become a significant matter. Of course, no one has forgotten that Hitler did not demand the annexation of Austria without reason last year, and he got it. Nor was Czechoslovakia quietly handed over at Munich not long ago? None of these events were justified from a historical, national, or legal perspective.

Perhaps some might think: if Tunisia had never belonged to Italy, if Corsica had long been sold to France, if Nice had been generously ceded to France by King Victor Emmanuel I after a plebiscite in 1860, then these complications might not have arisen. But, would that be the case? Fascist aggressors rely entirely on their own rhetoric and would never honor treaties signed by their ancestors. Naturally, they would pay even less attention to the opinions of the people in those lands. All their actions are always determined by two questions: "Do we need it?" "Can we get it?"

Perhaps someone will ask, does Italy really want to seize these territories from France? Why not? If she could control Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia, she would completely dominate the western Mediterranean, establishing a close connection between her mainland and the naval bases in distant Sardinia and Pantelleria.

Similarly, Mussolini disregarded the agreement he signed with Laval in 1935—in which France agreed to return Doumerea to Italy on the condition that Italy would not make further demands—and demanded the return of Somaliland and Gibraltar. If Italy were to seize these two territories, Britain's defensive strength in Africa and Asia would immediately drop to zero. At present, Asia serves as an important base for British ships traveling to India and French ships traveling to Annam.

Can Italy get it? The answer to this question is also positive. Recent history provides clear evidence. And it leaves behind the best method for fascist aggressors to adopt. That method is: "No matter how much you want, use the threat of war to demand it, and you will always be able to return fully loaded from Chamberlain and Daladier. Even if they know that Fascist Italy's power is far inferior to that of Nazi Germany, they will still spare no effort to compromise and seek peace." So, demand and take whatever you want!"

Thus, with Germany's support, Italy has voiced its demands, demanding the division of French colonies and her mainland. After the Munich Conference, Daladier was smugly convinced that he had established peace in Europe. In an instant, he did not expect that Mussolini, who had been "in good spirits" with him not long ago, would come to trouble him. In a state of panic, he naturally had to seek help from Britain again. This time, Britain's attitude is unpredictable. Help the "traditional friend"? Or, like in Munich, give Germany a boost and also give Italy a hand?

Chamberlain did not stay in Rome for even forty-eight hours before quietly returning to England—(translator).

We cannot speculate on how Chamberlain "cultivated peace" with Mussolini in Rome, and it is unnecessary. He may have adopted the "cooperation" method, giving Italy the railway rights from Gibraltar to Addis Ababa. He may have advocated improving the treatment of Italians in Tunisia. He may have suggested helping Italy in securing an administrative right on the Suez Canal. He may have had many other methods. Naturally, Chamberlain would have bargained a lot in Rome, because at least he always knew that letting Italy gain less of an advantage was not only good for France, but also good for the British Empire. But undoubtedly, Chamberlain was still willing to come and discuss this deal. When a person does not simply say "no" but says, "Okay, let's discuss it": then things are somewhat promising. So, this time Mussolini will probably be able to get something from Chamberlain, unless Mussolini's appetite is too big.

Naturally, Mussolini's promises are worth zero. But Chamberlain had declared in the British Parliament that the Anglo-Italian agreement would not be implemented until the Spanish volunteers had withdrawn. But now? On the surface, Italy has withdrawn 9,000 volunteers—but has exchanged them for a larger and stronger contingent of fresh troops, who are catching up with the major offensive on the Catalan front, building a merit for Franco.

This fact naturally also made Chamberlain a little unhappy, but it was very subtle. Many people rumored that Britain, like Germany and Italy, was hoping for the early collapse of the Spanish government, which may not be entirely without reason. Recently, Britain has been brewing to recognize the rebels as belligerent groups (and is now brewing to legally recognize the Franco government—).

France's situation is of course extremely difficult. If Mussolini's demands are only one-tenth realized, the blow to France would be ten times greater than when she lost the barrier of Czechoslovakia. Therefore, he is now firmly declaring: never give up an inch of land. May she be able to keep this belief forever unchanged.

Everything now seems to be in a period of gathering clouds, but undoubtedly, the storm is coming soon. A new European crisis is upon us. At that time, we will see: what new ways will Italy use to invade? What means will France use to resist? And, who knows, is this not the fuse for World War II!

### Tung Wah Hospital Board Held Re-election Yesterday: 27 New Merchant Directors Elected; Letter Urging Selection of Retail Merchant Directors Has Been Sent; Zhou Zhao Wu Reports on the Progress of the Issue of Abolishing Traditional Chinese Medicine

The current term of the Directors of Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong for the year of Wu Yin (戌寅) expired on the first day of the eighth lunar month and have resigned according to precedent. In addition to the election of new Directors by the various trade associations, new Merchant Directors were also to be elected. Tung Wah Hospital specially held the election of new Merchant Directors for the year of Ji Mao (己卯) at the hospital auditorium at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, in order to hand over hospital affairs. More than ten people attended, including Zhou Zhao Wu, Lin Pei Sheng, Yang Yong Sheng, Lao Mian Nong, Luo Xian Sheng, Feng Wei Xuan, Xu Tie Ru, Kang Jing Bo, Yun Guan Zhan, Xu Li San, Huang Chi Pu, Tang Yi Tang, Chairman Zhou Zhao Wu, and Secretary Gong Jian Ming. It is heard that after the meeting, the secretary read the notice calling the meeting to order.

Chairman Announces the Reasons for the Election

The Chairman then announced the reasons for the meeting, stating that today is the date for Tung Wah Hospital to elect the new Merchant Directors for the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). The chair has been nominated by the local community to serve as chairman for the two years of the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China. At present, the country is facing a serious crisis, and the hospital's responsibilities have become even more onerous. The domestic war is still in a serious state, and the hospital's relief responsibilities cannot be terminated. Looking back over the past two terms, Dong et al. have been sincere and devoted to repaying the community. Although there have been no achievements, fortunately, the colleagues have had the same heart and mind, and the consultants have given timely instructions. Upon the expiration of his term, he will announce his resignation according to precedent, so that capable people can be elected to continue the hospital's affairs. In recent years, the hospital has been affected by the economic downturn, making it difficult for each session to find capable people to succeed. The reasons are that the burden on the three hospitals is increasing day by day. However, past predecessors have pioneered the sources of income, and the hospital's expenditures and reforms have all been put on track. It is expected that the next capable people will be able to display their talents. Considering the current financial difficulties of the three hospitals, the Hong Kong government is concerned and is doing its best to maintain them. Therefore, the directors of the three hospitals are only required to contribute their talents to seek happiness for the community and the endless stream of refugees. The remaining financial problems can be observed at any time and addressed according to the environment. This section is sincerely to comfort the new directors. The chair knows that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are all patriotic and enthusiastic. It is hoped that the new directors elected by you will regard the current relief work of the hospital as their own responsibility, each contribute their talents, and also serve the country. As for the next retail merchant directors, the hospital has sent a letter urging them, sincerely hoping that each trade association will nominate the new directors in the short term, etc.

A Total of 27 New Directors

After Lao Mian Nong briefly delivered a speech, the election of Merchant Directors for the year of Ji Mao (己卯) began. The process went smoothly, and a list of candidates was approved, totaling 27 people. A total of 9 current directors were re-elected. Observers said that Yang Yongkang is the most popular candidate for the position of chairman. The list is as follows: Chen Youfu, Yang Yongkang, Han Runlin, Ma Zewen, Kuang Xiang, Chen Bocheng, Kuang Baotian, Ruan Weiyang, Zhou Guan Nian, Chen Lanfang, Lin Zheng Feng, Lao Yingqun, Lin Shao Dong, Wu Ren Huai, Luo Xian Sheng, He Zhaoji, Wu Yi Sun, Xie Yuchun, Zhou Shiyuan, Chen Zhenhua, Lao Mian Nong, Wei Wenwei, Deng Wentian, Jiang Yutang, Zou Jieren, Zhou Chengtai, Tang Yi Tang.

Abolishing Traditional Chinese Medicine Was Not Hastily Implemented

Zhou Zhao Wu then gave a written report on the discussions with the authorities regarding the issue of whether to retain or abolish the traditional Chinese medicine physicians of the three hospitals, stating that the hospital's negotiations with the government on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine are a matter of concern to all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, and also a matter of national essence. The brother has been serving as chairman of the three hospitals for two years and has long anticipated that the expenses of the three hospitals would increase day by day. After taking office, he immediately drew up a budget and requested assistance from the government for the annual deficit. The brother deeply feels that the government empathizes with the situation. The government has already accepted and allocated assistance for the previous deficit of more than 150,000 yuan, and has also agreed to increase the subsidy by 30,000 yuan per year in the future, that is, the annual subsidy for the three hospitals will increase to 121,000 yuan, and has also agreed to subsidize the annual deficit. However, when requesting subsidies for the deficit, the authorities put forward several conditions, one of which was the issue of retaining or abolishing traditional Chinese medicine. Our colleagues believe that this is a serious matter. According to the medical superintendent, they wanted to abolish traditional Chinese medicine. Our colleagues, in order to maintain the status of the three hospitals and for the sake of the national essence, argued strongly. The brother asked the authorities whether they recognized the Tung Wah Hospital as an independent organization of overseas Chinese, and whether the government should provide various forms of assistance to public welfare undertakings. The authorities understood the importance of the issue and did not hastily implement it. Today, the brother announces the result of this issue, fearing that rumors will spread. However, I believe that all parties will read the newspaper and also know that in the previous Legislative Council session, the advanced member Sir Brook questioned the issue of the Tung Wah Hospital's management responsibilities. The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Mei, replied as usual, with no change. From this, it can be seen that the authorities have a clear attitude towards the three hospitals. During the brother's two terms, the authorities provided various forms of assistance, which is deeply appreciated. The brother is about to step down, but because of the importance of the Tung Wah Hospital in the current national crisis, I sincerely hope that our enthusiastic fellow countrymen will always maintain it, and create the ambition of the three hospitals, and forever protect the three hospitals as the only independent charitable organization of our overseas Chinese. The meeting adjourned until after 5:00 p.m. It was found that the 27 Merchant Directors who were elected will be sent letters of appointment by Tung Wah Hospital within the next few days to formally assume their posts.

After the meeting began, Mrs. Situ Yongjue first reported on the recent developments of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Association, stating that it had been in existence in China for a year, with the government allocating a huge sum of five million yuan for its establishment. Production facilities need to be located in areas with abundant raw materials. Therefore, the Chinese government is preparing to establish more of these industrial cooperatives in the northwestern and southwestern provinces, and recently plans to establish a branch in northern Guangdong to manufacture goods using local materials. Hong Kong is not a raw material production area, and it is quite difficult for manufactured goods to enter the mainland. Furthermore, the Hong Kong government has not budgeted for long-term refugee accommodation, but only for temporary relief in emergencies. Therefore, vocational training centers should be established in the mainland. She hoped that the Relief Committee would pay attention to this point. The finance department then reported on the number of expenditures and receipts for the past week, from February 7th to February 13th of the 28th year of the Republic (Hong Kong dollars): the Jinyang Chamber of Commerce contributed 50 yuan, bringing the total income to 100,4829 yuan, 3 jiao and 2 fen. 5,000 yuan was disbursed to the headquarters, bringing the total expenditure to 90,099 yuan, 3 jiao and 1 fen, leaving a balance of 14,730 yuan.

### 海口海關　被×強佔　廣東輪今開往

Haikou Customs Occupied by the Enemy; Guangdong Ship to Sail Today

海口陷落、該地我國海關，有被×强　壓迫、該關稅務司史蔑夫交出所有文件消息、記者昨向此間我國海關叩詢、據發言人答稱、日軍强佔海口海關、信必有其事、本人料日軍佔港口後、其對于海口海關、與日軍佔　上海、南京、廣州、厦門等地時所取手段相同、可無疑問、故彼間情形、準此可測知、本人從可靠方面得悉、海口海關人員、現尙安全、現此間無直接消息云、又據中國電報局訊、香港與海口電報，自昨十一日巳不能通訊云、故此間相信、我軍將電機自動炸毁、或×軍將海口電報强佔、都在意中、故一切訊悉間絕、又據　古輪船公司華經理莫慶鏘謂，太古輪仍照常行走該　、今午有廣，號　開往彼間云、

Haikou has fallen. It has been reported that our customs office there has been oppressed by the enemy and that the customs commissioner, Smith, has handed over all documents. Reporters inquired with our customs office here yesterday. According to a spokesperson, it is certain that the Japanese army has occupied the Haikou Customs. It is expected that after the Japanese army occupies the port, their treatment of the Haikou Customs will be the same as their methods when occupying Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Xiamen and other places. There is no doubt about this. Therefore, the situation there can be inferred accordingly. I learned from reliable sources that the personnel of the Haikou Customs are currently safe. There is currently no direct news here. According to a report from the China Telegraph Administration, telegrams between Hong Kong and Haikou have been unable to communicate since the 11th yesterday. Therefore, it is believed here that our army automatically destroyed the motors or the enemy army forcibly occupied the Haikou telegram, which are both expected, so all news is cut off. According to Mo Qingqiang, the Chinese manager of the Taikoo Steampship Company, Taikoo ships are still sailing as usual. The "Guang" ship will sail there this afternoon.

The Municipal Health Bureau convened a meeting at 4:15 PM yesterday. Attendees included Todd (Chairman), Situ Yongjue (Vice Chairman), Gong Shengsi Gande Chen, Huamin Political Affairs Secretary Carli, Police Secretary Jing Henry Zhou Xinian Tan Yashi, etc. After the meeting began as usual, Chairman Todd first congratulated Mr. Zhou Xinian on his reappointment as a member of the council. Then Tan Yashi asked about the declaration of tuberculosis as a contagious disease, and asked the chairman to explain three points: (1) The reasons why the Hong Kong government took this step; (2) The measures the Hong Kong government plans to take to deal with this disease; (3) Whether the provisions of the 1936 Ordinance on the Prohibition of the Sea and Prevention of Diseases concerning infectious diseases will be implemented, especially Article 3 of Regulation No. 7 of 1936 concerning disinfection, isolation, inspection and detention.

肺病列入　傳染理由

Reasons for Listing Tuberculosis as a Contagious Disease

由醫藥總監司徒，永覺代表答覆，（第一項）因肺癆爲流行本港死症之一。去年統計、居民死于是症奢達九千餘人、在公衆衛生立塲、欲確知該問題之廣闊、非調查息病者之實數、實無從措乎、列肺癆爲頒行通吿傳染症、實欲使註册醫師、必須將到診之肺癆　者呈報政府、使衞生當局得以調査其年齡、性別、听傳染疾、　其營養居屋及衛　、狀况、俾從中尋求辦　、以遏止此症之　染、同時使衛生當局得以决定採取何種步驟以隔離病人、及施行醫藥檢驗、與屋宇消毒、以滅　該症之傳染、

Situ Yongjue, the Director of Medical and Health Services, replied on behalf of the government: (1) Because tuberculosis is one of the common deadly diseases in Hong Kong. According to statistics last year, more than 9,000 residents died from this disease. From a public health standpoint, in order to know the extent of the problem, it is necessary to investigate the actual number of patients. Listing tuberculosis as a declared infectious disease is intended to require registered physicians to report tuberculosis patients who come to their clinics to the government, so that the health authorities can investigate their age, gender, source of infection, nutritional status, housing and sanitary conditions, in order to find ways to curb the spread of this disease. At the same time, it enables the health authorities to decide what steps to take to isolate patients, implement medical examinations, and disinfect houses to eliminate the spread of the disease.

政府施行　預防步驟

Government Implements Preventive Measures

（第二項）至于政府擬採行何種辦法、此時言之未免過星、有待于實施呈報後所得結果、始能决定、現所可言者、如委任專員處理肺癆事件　　建設肺癆病院、及拆除發生該症特多之稠陋民居等、皆在可能施行範圍內（第三項）關於實施禁海及防止疾病例則、視病人之環境而定、如設法防止傳染他人、病人所處之黃精、決定屋宇應否實施消毒、醫治病人方法、醫院中應有設備是也、權由主席宜佈下次會期、展　至三月二日舉行、此次申請發給牌照者六宗、均議决不准、最後宣讀各項衛生報吿畢，遂散會云、

(2) As for what measures the government plans to take, it is too early to say at this time. It will be decided after the results of the report are implemented. What can be said now is that appointing a commissioner to deal with tuberculosis events, building tuberculosis hospitals, and demolishing densely populated houses where the disease occurs frequently are all within the scope of possible implementation. (3) Regarding the implementation of the Sea Ban and Disease Prevention Regulations, it depends on the patient's environment, such as finding ways to prevent transmission to others, the patient's environment, deciding whether to disinfect the house, methods of treating patients, and the equipment that should be available in the hospital. The chairman announced the next meeting date, which was postponed to March 2. All six applications for licenses this time were rejected. Finally, after reading out the various health reports, the meeting adjourned.

The news that the firewood shortage crisis had passed has been widely reported in Hong Kong newspapers. Residents were all celebrating. It is customary for residents to purchase and store large quantities of firewood in advance every winter to prevent prices from rising. However, since the news that the crisis had passed, everyone has been waiting and seeing, and dare not buy too much, waiting for the price to drop. Therefore, the firewood market has been extremely sluggish in recent days. A reporter met with a firewood merchant yesterday. According to him, there is no hope for a drop in firewood prices in the short term. Taking the two types of firewood, Po firewood and Haiphong firewood, the moisture content is about the same. If the issue price of Po firewood is about 80 catties per dollar, then the price of Haiphong firewood can only be a few catties more at most. As for the retail price, you can buy about 50 catties of Po firewood for one dollar, and about 60 catties of Haiphong firewood. According to another firewood merchant, the transportation of Haiphong firewood to Hong Kong has been quite active recently, but since Qiongya issued a warning last week, the source has been cut off, which has affected the Hong Kong firewood market. It is expected that in the short term, firewood prices will not only not recover, but will also rise after the New Year.

At 4:30 PM that afternoon, it arrived at the sea near Guo Zhou near Po Toi Island and suddenly encountered a robber boat carrying five pirates, all armed with pistols, who ordered it to stop. The people on the cargo boat saw that the situation was not good, and they rowed away in an attempt to avoid the robbery, which angered the robbers, who opened fire. Bullets rained down, and a boat companion, Mr. Jia, was injured by a stray bullet, bleeding profusely and falling into the boat. His boat companions, seeing the fierce banditry, had to stop advancing. The robber boat quickly caught up, swarmed over, threatened all the companions, and transferred all the 47 live pigs, 150 chickens, and 12 baskets of eggs they were carrying to their boat and left. After the robbers left, the cargo boat sailed to Hong Kong. The boat owner, Wang Naicheng (37 years old), went to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station to report the case and sent the injured person to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The loss from this robbery amounted to several hundred yuan.

At 11:00 AM on the (12th), when sailing to the Ma Zhou waters opposite Chi Wan, a robber boat suddenly came head-on. There were five robbers on the boat, who shouted loudly for Yu's boat to stop and raised their guns as if to bombard it. Yu obeyed the order to stop. Later, the robber boat approached and docked next to the boat. The three robbers holding pistols jumped over to Yu's boat and forced Yu and others to drive the boat near. Yu also cleverly obeyed and landed on the shore. Unexpectedly, the robbers Tong Erqiang forced Yu and others to go ashore, and then drove Yu's boat away. Yu's boat can carry 153 piculs and is worth 100 yuan. The department's police officer has recorded the case and is investigating according to the information provided.

### 香港兒童保育院

Hong Kong Children's Care Home

去年九月九日的夜晚，九龍車站來到了由漢口出發的二百四十五名難童，因此籌備了相當的時日的，中國戰時兒童保育會，香港分會的兒童保育院，立即充實起來，由於港地人口日增，尋找適合的院址，這是困難，幸虧院長何艾齡博士，各方奔忙，得到當地政府及各團體的援助，借得國家醫院暫用。這批從炮彈逃出，又經過長途跋涉的孩子們，總算有了歸宿。

On the night of September 9th last year, 245 refugee children from Hankou arrived at Kowloon Station. The Children's Care Home of the Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Care Association, which had been in preparation for some time, was immediately filled. Due to the increasing population in Hong Kong, finding a suitable location for the home was difficult. Fortunately, the director, Dr. He Ailing, worked hard and received assistance from the local government and various organizations to borrow the National Hospital for temporary use. This group of children who escaped from the bombs and traveled a long distance finally had a home.

爲丁完成戰時兒童保育的宗旨，馬上舉行甄別試騐，嚴格地分了七班，計初中一班，高初小共六班。每天上午六時起身，然後早操，早飱，　會，九時至上二時上課，下午一時至三時上課及勞作。下午六時以前的時間，爲學生洗衣洗澡，及課外活動。晚飯後有一小時自習，九點鐘　燈睡覺。每日三餐，均爲會食，各隊長分菜，每人一份，食堂秩序由敎職員輪流監護。　作內容計巳開班的有籐工，木工，製肥皂，及女生縫紉，幼童下午則由敎師率領唱遊及習字自修，最近於晚上睡覺前，又加開一班敎廣東話，因此輩兒童皆爲外省人。兒童欲食三餐外，每星期三加食牛肉粥，星期一五飲牛奶，星期二四下午喝凉茶，星期日分食水菓。還有一批從廣州收來的八十餘名幼童及孤兒，另在元朗第一分院收養，他們的年齡平均幼小，但也過着小組分隊的生活。其中八個大些的組織一服務團，照顧他們幼小的弟妹。元朗地址在鄉村，環境優美，對於兒童發育，非常適台，只要天氣許可，都在戶外上課。在朝會時，各班由級任作時事報吿，課程內容，也在儘量採用適應抗戰的材料。每個星期六晚，舉行同樂會，救亡話劇，抗戰歌曲，佔去了所有的節目。簡陋的演出設備，却會收到良好的效果；緊張嚴肅的會場精神，這說明了大家的心情，在關懷着什末！

In order to achieve the purpose of wartime children's care, a screening test was immediately held, and seven classes were strictly divided, including one junior high school class and six senior and junior elementary school classes. Get up at 6:00 AM every day, then morning exercises, breakfast, assembly, classes from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and classes and labor from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The time before 6:00 PM is for students to wash clothes, take baths, and participate in extracurricular activities. There is one hour of self-study after dinner, and the lights are turned off at 9:00 PM to go to bed. All three meals a day are group meals. Each team leader distributes the dishes, one serving per person. The order in the dining hall is supervised by teachers on a rotating basis. The content of the work includes rattan work, woodworking, soap making, and sewing for girls, which have been opened. In the afternoon, the

### International Sympathy for Our Students Deprived of Education; Secretary of the World Student Christian Federation, Miss Tomlin, Dispatched to China to Inspect and Provide Relief; Miss Tomlin Has Arrived in Hong Kong and Set Off for Chongqing Yesterday; Fundraising for Student Relief in Europe and America Has Reached US$100,000

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the outbreak of war, × has been vigorously destroying our nation's cultural institutions. Countless schools in various regions have been destroyed by ×'s bombs and cannons, causing students in our war zones to be displaced and unable to seek education. Their plight is beyond description. People from all walks of life deeply sympathize with these young people deprived of education. In addition to the Student Mutual Aid Society and the Far Eastern Student Relief Association jointly organizing the National Student Relief Association with the Student Department of the National YMCA to specialize in providing relief to displaced students in various regions, the World Student Christian Federation has also worked hard to help. Last year, it raised US$53,000 to provide practical assistance to Chinese students. However, due to the complexity of relief efforts, this was merely a drop in the bucket. Therefore, a decision was made to continue fundraising. It is planned to raise US$94,760 this year. The organizations responsible for fundraising include the Far Eastern Student Emergency Committee in the United States, and the International Student Service Organization in Europe. It is reported that the funds raised so far have reached US$18,000. Fundraising in Europe totals 160,000 Swiss francs, equivalent to US$35,000. International student groups participating in this fundraising campaign include the Roman Catholic Student Association, the World Union of Jewish Students, and the International Student Federation. The domestic organizations in China managing this international fundraising effort are the National Student Relief Committee, jointly organized by the YMCA and YWCA, and the International Student Donation Management Committee, chaired by Mr. Zhang Boling. Recently, the donations received by these two organizations have reached over 100,000 yuan. In addition to initiating fundraising to provide relief to our nation's students, the World Student Christian Federation has specially dispatched Miss Tomlin, the secretary of the federation, from Geneva via the United States to China to inspect the mainland in order to determine relief plans. According to reports, Miss Tomlin arrived in Hong Kong on the 10th of this month aboard the Empress of Russia, and inquired about the affairs of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association, organized by the local YMCA. After a brief stay in Hong Kong, Miss Tomlin set off for Chongqing yesterday, the 13th. The main task of Miss Tomlin's visit to China is to attend the National YWCA Training Conference, which will open on the 6th of next month, where she will give a three-week lecture. After the conference, she plans to travel around mainland China, inspecting student organization centers in various regions in detail in order to collect rich materials and formulate effective relief plans upon her return to Europe.

### The Philippine Interport Football Team Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday; Hong Kong Interport Team to Hold Practice Match with Hong Kong League Team Today

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The much-anticipated Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Match, a first-of-its-kind event, is finally about to take place. This weekend at 3:30 PM, the two teams will officially meet at the Navy Ground.

The Philippine team, led by Mr. Carl, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning on the SS Lyemun and checked into the Astor House Hotel. In the afternoon, the entire team drove to the South China Stadium in Happy Valley for a light practice.

The reporter met with Mr. Carl at Happy Valley. In the conversation, he said, "Our football movement has a shallow history, and in the past, we rarely sent teams abroad to compete and seek technical improvement. On the contrary, Hong Kong teams such as South China have come to our country almost once a year in the past decade to provide guidance, which has gradually improved the technical level of our football. Therefore, our football community regards Hong Kong teams as a benefactor. This time, we are honored to be invited by the Hong Kong Football Association to Hong Kong for the interport match. However, our team is a junior and is visiting your country for the first time. We hope that people in Hong Kong will not dislike our team's poor skills and will give us guidance. It is a great honor. There are fifteen players in this trip. However, two starters were unable to come at the last minute, so two other players were selected to replace them. During the voyage, the wind and waves were quite strong, and everyone felt uncomfortable. "

According to Mr. Carl, the lineup for this weekend's (19th) interport match is roughly as follows:

Yao E (La Salle College), Ba Qigao (Letran), W. Miranda (La Salle College)

Neil Du (YCO Club), Yao Jidi (La Salle College), Wallace (La Salle College)

Bitch (YCO Club), Bao Yangli (YCO Club), Lala Salbilu (Captain, La Salle College), Hillit Da (La Salle College), Lithas (La Salle College)

Substitutes: Na Feilu, Xiang Nanadis, Jia Balashi, Zhang Lannuhua

The Hong Kong Interport team will hold a practice match at the Navy Ground at 5:00 PM today, with the Hong Kong League team as their sparring partner. Tickets are uniformly priced at two corners. The Hong Kong League lineup has been finalized, so it is slightly different from what was published in yesterday's newspaper. The two lineups are recorded as follows: (Dong Lang)

(Hong Kong Interport Team)

Tan Junqian (South China)

Shi Han (Middlesex), Li Tiansheng (South China)

Liang Rongzhao (South China), Dickson (Navy), Hannivelu (Navy)

Hou Chengtou (Eastern), Da Gaoshan Nu (St. Joseph's), Li Huitang (Captain, South China), Feng Jingxiang (South China), Fula (Hong Kong Club)

Hong Kong League Team

McAllister (Navy)

O'Reilly (Kowloon), Newby (Navy)

Gurney (Middlesex), Bidi (Middlesex), Redditch (Army Service Corps)

Liao Yachen (Kowloon), Jin Shi (St. Joseph's), Tuo Ban (Tram), Zuo Zhi (Kowloon), An Bachin (Artillery)

### Welcome Philippine Football Friends (Continued)

— Li Huitang

In recent years, they have strived for in-depth study and continuous progress. Schools have also paid more attention to it than before, so that the famous Shanghai general "Sai Li" went south to personally guide and inspire the younger generation, which has made considerable progress. The results were once amazing. Last year, they defeated the Gothenburg team in Hong Kong and the Eastern team. After Ai Lushi of the Army was hired to the south, he was also criticized several times. It is easy to imagine their strength. Their only advantage is "high speed", and their dribbling skills are also comparable to those of our country. The goalkeeper, because of basketball training, has produced many outstanding talents. If they do not have unique skills, it is not easy to break through their last barrier. Unfortunately, the Philippines does not have football referees of a certain level. The visiting team always suffers a little in the Philippines. They also know the point. Last year, they wrote to the Hong Kong Referees Association to send people to the Philippines to guide and explain fouls (no one from Hong Kong responded), which shows their great desire to learn and their spirit of humbly seeking advice, which are worthy of our admiration and praise.

In short, this Philippine team has come to Hong Kong to fight with strong people and horses. It is not the old Yang Bu A Meng. Although people are tired and avoid work, they should be careful and not take it lightly. You should know that they are mostly young calves who are not afraid of tigers. Our experience and skills may have a slight advantage, but "high speed" is their principle and goal. Technical problems must be secondary in this type of Cup-Tie championship. If we do not deal with it calmly and cautiously, I am afraid that we will repeat the mistakes of losing to the Shanghai team the year before last in an occasional negligence. I firmly believe that they have considerable preparation, considerable determination, and have undergone strict training, and will definitely have wonderful performances to satisfy the eyes of Hong Kong people. Their different attacks, defenses, advances and retreats, and strategies will definitely refresh the taste buds of the fans. I would like to say to the football public, who have always held the demeanor of scholars, please prepare applause to welcome them from the perspective of appreciators and with the doctrine of being good at praising those who are not capable, and wait quietly for the opening of the good show.

Before I put down my pen, I would like to offer a heartfelt wish to the new and old football friends from the Philippines, and wish them a pleasant journey and a happy journey! (End)

### Looking Back and Looking Forward

— Lai Duanfu

This time, the Shanghai University Students Tennis Team, with its fearless spirit, came to Hong Kong to learn from the advanced players with their rapidly improving skills, and achieved a record of two wins and three losses, which seems rare. However, I hope that the players will not be complacent because of this, because they only defeated Dashi Tang and the Western Club, which are not very famous in the tennis world in Hong Kong. In reality, I can only say that Li Guopan's tennis skills are good, and Shuba Jiabei is good at strength. His techniques and footwork need to be improved. The remaining three are all in their infancy and can only hope to make a name for themselves after several years of training. I heard that the players will take the French mail ship President Shemei back to Shanghai at noon today. I will send them a gift when they return to Shanghai to work hard.

Jia won over Li Guofan in Shanghai. I think this may be because Li took a steady approach and only used the resilience of baseline shots, and did not study the net attack method, so he could not stand Tang's bold attack. I criticize tennis skills and always pay attention to caution, so there are few mistakes. It is necessary to improve Tang's techniques and footwork. Naturally, he can be as skilled as Li today. If Li studies the net attack method in the future and still cannot win against Tang, I dare to conclude that there is no such reason.

On Saturday and Sunday, South China South finally defeated Xianglu Kowloon Club by two to one and entered the semi-finals, which made domestic fans happy. The reason why they did not win before and finally won after three battles is that the third time they started their best players. However, I think the focus is not so simple. The first reason is that Feng Jingxiang suddenly has a strong impact and Wei Douwen can slightly change the disadvantage of "more dribbling and less passing". Secondly, he can promptly use the fearless Zhang Rongcai as the goalkeeper. This time, the coach has made great contributions. In the future, if he encounters a stubborn team with good charge, Zhang Rongcai is an indispensable person.

It can be said that the police club is extremely lucky to have narrowly defeated St. Joseph's, which had no comparable players on the field, to win the special silver medal in the Group A football finals. The reason for their victory is not due to the Western players, but to the three Chinese generals, Chen, Fan and Huang. In my observation, if Fan Guicai can concentrate on the game, then with this height and technique, he will become a famous general in the future. Huang Wenzhi's right wing performance is also a talented player. Chen Guangyu is slightly stiff in the waist and does not turn well. Otherwise, he is also a top-notch person. In the future, if these three players can work hard on their skills in the finals with the Chinese team, they will be respected by their compatriots.

In the friendly match between the selected team and the Hong Kong League team last Thursday, the selected team performed poorly. Fu La is not a right winger at all, and his performance is much inferior to that of Deng Guangsen, who has made rapid progress. Gao Shannu is obviously not used to being a left inside forward. Yu Han and Han Nivelu did not perform well. Shi Han is far inferior to Hou Rongsheng, and Han Nivelu even lost to Little Stulland. Li Tiansheng and Liang Rongzhao were forcibly switched positions, and they did not perform their true colors. I am worried about fighting a strong team from afar with this. Fortunately, the Philippine team is not very strong, or each individual's skills still have hope of winning. I still think the strongest Hong Kong team today should be as follows:

Tan Junqian (South China)

Li Tiansheng (South China), Newby (Navy)

Bello Du (St. Joseph's), Xu Cheng (Eastern), Liang Rongzhao (South China)

Hou Chengtou (Eastern), Feng Jingxiang (South China), Li Huitang (South China), Gao Shannu (St. Joseph's), Armstrong (Army)

Yesterday, the Philippine selected team arrived. I saw them practice at Caroline Hill. Most of the players are not tall and their shots are not very strong. This may be due to the appearance after a long journey. However, I am not weak in vision. If you compare the characters, unless there is very good coordination, you can be better than others. Although the characters of the Hong Kong selected team are wrongly arranged, but the players are experienced, they should still have hope of winning. The China Federation team and the Hong Kong Federation team are very likely to win, because the China Federation is too good, and the Hong Kong Federation's forwards are all capable members, so they are more likely to win than the selected team.

Today, the Hong Kong selected team was originally scheduled to have a practice match with the Navy and Army United team, but the Navy and Army could not send a team due to something. Yesterday, the General Assembly has selected another Hong Kong League team to fight (see section for the list), which is also quite strong. It will still be held at the Navy Stadium at 5:00 PM as scheduled (not on Friday as rumored). Admission tickets are uniformly priced at two dimes. The Philippine team is scheduled to practice there from 4:00 PM. If you buy tickets early and enter the venue, you will have a double dose of enjoyment.

Li Huitang is called a genius in the football world, and he also has considerable tennis skills. Moreover, he is well-versed in both Chinese and English. He is a prodigy. This is known to everyone. I have not seen much extravagance, but after seeing his warm welcome to the Philippine team, I can't help but admire him. However, there is still one man of both literary and military talent in the football world who is not yet known, and is also worth introducing. Goalkeeper Tan Junqian, is also good at English, is currently serving in the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Corps, studying military knowledge, and is also quite accomplished in Chinese. He can write Northern Wei script and write small poems. He is also extraordinary. He and Huitang work together at the Swedish foreign company, and there is a record that the two have never lost on the same field. They can be called the "two difficulties" in the football world.

The vigorous and energetic Eastern Group A football team was originally scheduled to compete with the Navy team on Saturday. The Eastern team took advantage of the victory over South China South, and their momentum swallowed the mountains and rivers. They could even sweep away the Navy team and advance hand in hand with South China South towards the championship. However, the Navy team was too alert and asked to postpone the game. The Lunar New Year's Eve was not able to see that good show. However, according to the recent change in the schedule, the Eastern team will play against Middlesex that day. The Middlesex army is also a strong team, and it is also worth seeing. However, the Middlesex army has no hope of winning the championship, and the interest is not as high as fighting the Navy. However, there is still a Group A League match between Scott and St. Joseph's before the match, which will be closed at 2:30 PM. Since there are exciting games to watch, fans should also actively support the event.

The Philippine team chartered a ship to come this time. Many of the companions are Philippine fans who came to see Li Huitang and Gao Shannu, and are now staying at the Astor House Hotel, where the Philippine team is stationed.

### International Skating Finnish Champion

[Haidao News Agency, Sago Race, 14th] Yesterday, on Sunday, in the International Skating Championship 40-kilometer team relay race, the Finnish team still firmly held the throne. The team members are Bicker Nen, Arra Coreper, Kergan Nara, and Gasaini. The leisure time is 2 hours, 8 minutes and 35 seconds. Second place is Sweden, third place is Italy, and fourth place is Norway.

### Film and Theater

Entertainment... Troublesome Cupid

Love Is A Headache

This is a worn-out Hollywood romantic comedy. The story lacks appeal, the actors lack well-rounded performances, and the development of each plot point seems forced and unnatural.

The film depicts a Broadway star who, for publicity, reluctantly adopts two mischievous children. Although the two children cause her much trouble, they ultimately allow the pampered diva to experience maternal love. It also depicts a newspaper editor who deeply admires the diva but strongly opposes her publicity stunts, and the various jokes that arise between them.

Franchot Tone and Gladys George both work hard, but without great success. Barton MacLane's performance in this film, although not as brilliant as in films like "Judge Hardy's Family," is still passable.

Queen... A Slight Case of Murder

A Slight Case of Murder

Although this film is themed around bandits, it is full of humor, wit, and satire. The story depicts a group of cold-blooded murderers, but the impression given to the audience is not one of terror and tension, but rather one of lighthearted comedic fun.

Edward G. Robinson plays a reformed gangster whose brewery business is failing due to the poor quality of its products. He has always relied on his gang members using intimidation to sell his beer. Now that he has retired from crime, his business is facing huge losses. At the same time, his beloved daughter is in love with a rich man's son, but her condition for marriage is that the man must have an independent occupation. The young man is forced to temporarily work as a policeman, as this is the only job he can find.

Luck changes everything. Another gang of bandits, fighting over hidden gold, massacre each other in Edward's residence. When Edward and his crew arrive, they unexpectedly find a house full of corpses and a large amount of money. The prospective son-in-law, the policeman, shoots the corpses again and unintentionally kills the bandit leader, earning the credit for eliminating a menace to society.

Although Edward G. Robinson's style in this film has subtle changes, his acting is still as skillful and refined as in his previous films such as "Little Caesar" and "The Whole Town's Talking." He vividly portrays the character of a gangster with lifelike perfection. The supporting actors, all adept at playing gangsters, also give satisfactory performances.

Peace... Border Law

Border Law

The whole film is set in the American West, depicting a story of a hero seeking revenge by killing bandits. Although the film is not very long, it has the advantages of a typical Western: tense plots, lively action, coupled with Lupita Tovar's Spanish-style clear singing and passionate acting. In the midst of tense and exciting situations, it adds a lot of lighthearted romance. George O'Brien has superb skills in this film. Among all his works, this "Border Law" has a better performance.

Cathay... Battle of Broadway

Battle of Broadway

The film depicts two tough guys representing a certain factory who go to New York on a mission. At the same time, they are entrusted with a private task by the factory owner: to disrupt the love affair between the factory owner's son and a Broadway singer. Unexpectedly, the two men are also lustful and become madly infatuated with another singer. Subsequently, the factory owner also personally intervenes, leading to jealousy and chaos.

The story of this film is nothing to write home about, but the scenes are still lively and interesting. The performances of the two main actors, Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, who play rough and tough, and their mutual fooling around, are amusing. The climax of the film, the brawl in the mental hospital, is one of the most brilliant scenes in the film, both tense and riotous, while filled with comedic elements.

The film has a strong tragic element, and the plot resembles a Chinese familial drama. Apart from James Stewart, the other actors seem relatively unfamiliar to us, but their performances do not disappoint.

### Essential Knowledge for Physical Training

— Wong Hok-ching

This article is limited to people aged sixteen to forty years old and is not entirely suitable for children or the elderly, regardless of gender.

Physical training refers to both the mind and body. In terms of the body, it is nothing more than developing muscles and exercising the physique, which will increase qi and strength.

To have truly complete physical fitness, physical training must advance both mind and body together. We must recognize the purpose of physical training – health – and also recognize the purpose of health. If we ignore the training of the mind, even the strongest physical strength will not be as good as that of lions, tigers, apes, and other fierce beasts.

In terms of the body, developing muscles, exercising internal organs, and increasing qi and strength are also interrelated. If one is neglected, not only will the various parts of the body not develop evenly, but it may also harm the body. The body's training must also proceed from "inner" to "outer." People with a good foundation can advance "inner" and "outer" together. "Inner" training refers to the training of internal organs. Among the training of internal organs, the most important include the heart, lungs, large and small intestines, stomach, etc., as well as the circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems. If these three systems have normal and active functions, the entire system will definitely become stronger. If you strengthen the inside first, and then engage in external training to develop muscles, you can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Although there are slight differences in the methods of exercising strength and developing muscles, as long as the internal organs are strong and the muscles are developed, strength will naturally increase accordingly.

In the training of the mind, it is nothing more than a strong will, a spirit of hard work and endurance, bright and upright thoughts, a noble character, etc. If the training of the mind is lacking, not only will the true meaning of health be lost or the purpose of health not be achieved. In fact, the mind and body are also mutually related. If the training of the mind is ignored, while focusing on the training of the body, it will be difficult to obtain the greatest effect.

Exercise is not the only way to train the physique, but rather one of many methods. The only active method of training the physique is sports. The scope of sports is very broad and does not only refer to running and jumping. All active elements related to health should be included in the scope of sports. We must consider all sports methods at the same time and not focus on only one or several. Otherwise, not only will we not be able to obtain the greatest effect, but we will often harm our health.

Among the various sports methods, it is difficult for us to determine which is the most important. Among them, the most problematic and difficult method to understand is exercise. There are different opinions about exercise, each with its own words, and even theories that are completely contradictory. It is especially difficult for beginners to resolve the various problems of exercise.

Among all the exercises, the most effective are calisthenics and machine exercises. The characteristics of these exercises have been discussed with everyone, so I will not elaborate further. If we want to achieve the greatest effect from exercise, in addition to advancing both mind and body together and developing the body "inner" and "outer" evenly, we must also pay attention to the following points: one, two (one)

### Work on the Lunar New Year's Day

— Pang Tai

Suggestions to Comrades in the National Salvation Movement

The Lunar New Year is just around the corner. The common people seem to be wholeheartedly revering their ancestors to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and they cannot help but take time off at the end of the twelfth lunar month and the beginning of the new year to eat a meal and relax. This is the golden opportunity for comrades in the national salvation movement. National salvation workers should not let go of this opportunity and should pay attention to the following tasks.

1. Launch a thrift campaign: Everyone knows that burning incense, lighting candles, burning paper money, setting off firecrackers, and pasting door gods and couplets are customs that have little meaning. Completely abolishing them is sometimes not easy, so we should come up with a compromise. Like a certain village in Ping Shan, Huiyang last year, all the gods were invited to a forest, and it was enough to worship them twice. Haha, this kind of collective worship of gods is also a fresh and new trick. As for writing couplets, we should write them for them, and we should seize the opportunity to change the content.

Secondly, making rice cakes and pastries wastes food and is unhygienic. However, villagers cannot disobey us and lose face in front of their relatives because of old customs, so we must widely publicize and point out the harms. At a minimum, we must make them reduce this kind of consumption as much as possible.

We must also pay close attention to excessive drinking and eating at banquets and endless lingering. We should do these things according to the depth of the environment's acceptance, and we must start from our own families and villages.

2. During the New Year period, everyone will still be able to scrape together some money in their pockets, and the rich are even less of a problem. At this time, we can launch large-scale fundraising campaigns. In addition to donating money, food is also good, just like in Danshui Pingshan, Huiyang, where thousands of bags of peanuts were previously collected to comfort the defense army. Now we can raise money to make winter clothes or collect cakes to send to refugees in the rear and soldiers on the front lines. In short, it is easier to raise donations in the New Year, so let's launch a fundraising campaign for money and food!

3. Joint armed hunting: In the short period after the New Year, most people are relatively free. At this time, it is very easy for them to go to improper entertainment venues, so we should organize joint village and clan hunting, which is also a good way to organize guerrillas. From this activity, we can learn about their armed strength and at the same time give them tactical knowledge of guerrilla warfare. Oh, this meaningful movement is very meaningful to encourage in our counter-offensive. It is said that Danshui Pingshan is already preparing to do so.

4. Such as anti-gambling propaganda, spring farming propaganda, school resumption propaganda... etc., are also goals that we should strive to achieve.

Finally, I want to especially introduce that our propaganda team should cooperate with the village lion dance team, which will provide many opportunities for our convenience. Before, during, and after their lion dance, martial arts, and swordplay, we can intersperse songs, speeches, and street dramas. Then our propaganda effectiveness will be very reliable. Fundraising teams following this kind of lion dance team are even more suitable. The Zijin Guzhu Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team is now busy preparing to cooperate with this opportunity!

In the Lunar New Year, we must show our great work to achieve the two major goals of relieving the suffering of our compatriots and comforting the soldiers fighting against Japan.

### Orderly

— Cao Juren

——Random Thoughts on Travel in the War Zone——

An officer's wife asked me why I didn't bring an orderly. I said, "Originally, I did have an orderly, but he died in Nanjing. After I returned south from Shanxi, I deeply felt that using orderlies was unreasonable." I meant to tell her, "It is understandable for orderlies in the army to do military affairs. But it is not right for an orderly to act as a servant for an officer's wife." Not long after, her orderly 'went AWOL' and left on his own. She was furious and said, "Did I not treat him well? When playing cards, I gave him the starting money! He eats and wears better than anyone else. Look at those soldiers; aren't they shivering in this weather?" Because I had known her for a long time, I spoke frankly to her: "Madam, this is what you don't understand. You say he lacks nothing, but he lacks two important things: 'hope' and 'honor.' There is not much hope in being an officer's orderly, and even less hope in being an officer's wife's orderly. It is not glorious to be an officer's orderly. It is even less glorious to be an officer's wife's orderly. Think about it: even if he had hope and was promoted to a junior officer, others would secretly say that he used to be an orderly for so-and-so's wife. Where would he put his face? I don't know about others, but I myself would rather starve to death than be an orderly, unless my lover became an officer, she became Mu Guiying, and I became Yang Zongbao." They laughed at each other after hearing this.

My younger brother, Ji Ju, who has lived in the army for many years, once summarized the feelings of people in the army about orderlies: "A good king will appear every five hundred years, and a good orderly is hard to come by in a thousand years! Finding a good orderly seems even more difficult than finding a premier of the Executive Yuan. Thinking carefully, it is not that it is difficult to find the right person for the job of orderly. It is that the system of orderlies is fundamentally wrong. Those who curse the orderlies say that the smart ones will be slippery, freeloading, and have affairs with officers' wives, doing everything imaginable. The honest ones are stupid as cows, and everything must be pushed and poked to get them to move, causing constant annoyance. But examining all the tasks of an orderly, when the officer had not yet been promoted, he managed them himself. There is no reason why he cannot manage them himself after becoming an officer. And those orderlies who serve the officer's wife are actually just saving the wife the cost of a maid. Frankly speaking, it is also taking public funds for private gain, which is completely unacceptable. The reason why the officer's wife wants to use an orderly is partly to save money, but more so to show that she is the wife of an officer. This is also a very wrong mentality.

We, who live with the army, have agreed to take care of our own affairs and cultivate the habit of serving ourselves. The result of this habit is very good. Sometimes, serving each other can even enhance deep friendship. I often say that if bureaucratic politics are not broken, there is no hope for national construction. To break bureaucratic politics, we must first break the old master and mistress mentality of the bourgeoisie."

### Hesitation

— Bao Yi

A sheep separated from the flock, a boat without a rudder, drifting aimlessly in the vast and boundless life, unable to grasp anything real, sadness, anger, and hesitation surrounding me, everything I hear and see is a miserable sight—

I don't want to live like this anymore. If I live like this, I am convinced that my life will be meaningless. I want to drive away the evil people surrounding me, I want to break through all the dark environments, I want to seek a straight path from the midst of hesitation and reach the ideal paradise.

But, the powerful enemy of the ideal does not let me go, but more fiercely exerts his power on me, and uses more cruel means to intensify the pressure on me. The whip of life ruthlessly lashes me, without any room for relaxation, giving me a chance to breathe. The sinister nature of human relationships uses vicious tactics to control me everywhere. My fragile soul cannot withstand such attacks and oppression, I can't help but feel pain and tears!

However, just relying on tears, you still can't escape the sad, hesitating realm. This is tantamount to expressing submission to the dark environment, this is obviously the victory of the environment over one's own pain and no escape from the past. This only shows weakness instead of positive action to replace struggle.

I know that pain is spiral, and in the process of life, it is endless. People who do not understand life divide pain and happiness into two parts, but in fact pain and happiness are always connected together; without pain, you will not know happiness, and only when you know pain can you realize happiness.

I want to cheer myself up from the depths of pain: teach to use the greatest determination to overcome the dark environment, not be pessimistic, not hesitate, and wholeheartedly go to the ideal paradise. I must greatly change from today on the previous errors in the concept of life and the lack of the courage to fight. That is to use a strong determination to replace pessimism and hesitation to stabilize the future.

### In the Sunset Glow

— Hong Yan

The fields are quiet, and the north wind is blowing very gently. The setting sun climbed to the edge of life, its face flushed red, glaring at the people and the land.

A-Fu, Xiao Lu, and Lao Liu, three children slowly walked up the embankment, humming in unison the song newly composed by Lao Liu—a young, strong Dongbei person;

Thinking of the events of the 20th year of the Republic of China,

That can make a man of iron shed tears;
Our fields were trampled by Japanese devils,

Thirty million compatriots turned into beasts of burden!

We were forbidden to speak our own language,

We were driven out of our own homes.

We can no longer hear the sobbing tides of the Heilongjiang River,

Nor can we see the shining clouds on Changbai Mountain!

But, we need not complain.

We will never let the flag of the Japanese devils fly for long,

We will pay back with an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!

Compatriots, unite,

Use bloody battles as our answer!

Use bloody battles as our answer! Answer! Repeatedly shouting, only three miles away from Xicun!

"Lao Liu! You said, what should we do if we are searched, with these few weapons?" A-Fu suddenly asked the brave villager softly, while stroking the slightly protruding object on the left side of his chest.

"Fool, what are you afraid of! If they don't give us trouble, then forget it, let them live a few more days, otherwise, hum! If they're tired of living, we'll send them back!" Lao Liu replied briskly.

"However, this is a little inconvenient for our mission!" Xiao Lu said coldly.

No one else continued to speak, and the surrounding air became silent.

Suddenly, A-Er grabbed Lao Liu's sleeve, stopped on the road, and gently pointed forward with his mouth: "Hum! Be careful! They're coming!"

About ten lengths of road ahead. Two things hugging two three-eight rifles, walked towards this side laughing and joking.

"Never mind them, let's walk forward carefully! The sun is going down soon!" Lao Liu said as if nothing had happened.

Closer, the two sides were only about a foot apart!

The two things swaggered and swayed like drunkards, suddenly startled to see these three tall and strong partners, quickly picked up the three-eight rifles with bayonets, and mumbled:

"Stop! Stop! Bad guys! Guerrilla army."

"Damn it! Have to let Grandpa take action," Lao Liu cursed, and immediately made a look at Xiao Lu and A-Fu.

The two immediately took a step forward, stood in the middle of the road, and raised their hands. Lao Liu also followed suit, but his position was a little further back.

"Hahaha..." The other side laughed triumphantly, both holding a rifle in one hand, and reaching out to search Xiao Lu and A-Fu's bodies with the other.

Unexpectedly, Lao Liu snatched the shiny bayonet, and then quickly stabbed the one searching Xiao Lu's brain. He fell!

The other one was about to turn around and run, but A-Fu had already grabbed him. He wanted to shout, but Xiao Lu had already covered his mouth with one hand! His face flushed red, struggling desperately!

Lao Liu made a hole in the top of his head like the other one, while sighing hatefully:

"Little bastard, you've delayed Grandpa's time! Today Grandpa has to happily kill a few more of you! Humph, you're happy,"

The setting sun, with its blazing red face, had reached the horizon, and before setting, it still reflected a ray of afterglow.

### Three Dream Traces

— Zou Xiao

——Ethnic Novel Talk

During the reigns of Emperor Yingzong and Emperor Jingtai of the Ming Dynasty, Esen invaded, which is exactly the shadow of today's × people. He repeatedly demanded bribes, never satisfied. He looked down on China, thinking he could conquer it in one battle, but when Yu Qian resisted in the capital, he realized that China could not be humiliated, and he suffered a great setback. The "West Lake Anecdotes," Volume 8, "Three Dream Traces," is dedicated to Yu Qian's life. Most of the descriptions are based on Volume 170 of the Ming History, the biography of Yu Qian. However, the introduction narrates anecdotes from Yu Qian's childhood, which are taken from legends. Even the clay statues of gods feared Yu Qian, and those dispatched to Lingnan as chariots were afraid, and those ordered to kneel had to obey. These kinds of stories are commonly seen in Lin Lan's "Stories of Zhu Hongwu." As for his ability to speak eloquently and respond quickly, that is often seen in Lin Lan's "Stories of Witty Couplets." As for specifically engaging in conversations with monks, that was only because of the two sentences in his biography: "There was a strange person who said, 'In the future, he will be a fortunate minister who saves the times!'" In "Three Dream Traces," it is written: "That monk said, 'Gentlemen, do not laugh. This child has extraordinary bones and is eloquent. In the future, he will be a prime minister who restores order!'"

Regarding Yu Qian's defense of the capital against Esen, both the Ming History biography and Volume 8 of "West Lake Tour Records" have records. The Ming History is better, not as convoluted as the "Tour Records." The Ming History also depicts the war scenes in a more vivid manner, unlike the "Tour Records," which are lackluster. At that time, it was October of the first year of Jingtai. The Ming History says: "Esen, holding the retired Emperor, broke through Zijing Pass and directly invaded the capital. Shi Heng proposed to gather troops and defend the city, exhausting the enemy. Yu Qian disagreed, saying, 'How can we show weakness and make × even more despise us!' He quickly divided and dispatched the generals, leading an army of 220,000, and arrayed them outside the nine gates. He ordered all city gates to be closed and personally supervised the battle, giving the order: 'If a general retreats before his army, the general will be beheaded; if an army retreats before its general, the rear ranks will behead the front ranks.' Thus, the officers and soldiers knew they would surely die, and all fought with their lives. Initially, Esen advanced deep, thinking the capital could be taken in a day or two. But when he saw the officers and soldiers waiting in strict formation, his intentions were slightly frustrated. The rebel Yue Ning incited him to invite ministers to welcome the Emperor and demand gold and silk in the hundreds of millions. The Emperor refused, and Esen's morale was further diminished. On the gengshen day, the bandits probed Desheng Gate. Yu Qian ordered Heng to set up an ambush in empty houses and sent a few riders to lure ×. × came with ten thousand cavalry. Deputy Commander Fan Guang fired firearms, and the ambush rose up and attacked together. Esen's brother was shot and killed. Peng Yimen pursued the bandits to the earthen city. Residents went up to the roofs and shouted, throwing bricks and stones to attack the bandits. The sound shook the heavens. When reinforcements arrived, the bandits retreated. After five days of stalemate, Esen's invitation was not answered, and the battle was unfavorable. Knowing that he could not achieve his goals, he took the retired Emperor west. Yu Qian dispatched the generals to pursue them to the pass and then returned. For his merits, Yu Qian was promoted to Junior Protector and Supervisor of Military Affairs." (Excerpt) As for the full text of "Three Dream Traces," I think it is not necessary to quote it extensively here.

Two points can be noted in the above quotation. First, Esen "thought the capital could be taken in a day or two." This contrasts with the enemy's estimation of a quick victory at Taierzhuang. Only after suffering losses did they sigh, "I never thought that little Taierzhuang would be so difficult!" Second, the people went up to the roofs and used bricks and stones to resist, achieving success. From this, we can see the necessity of arming the people. If the entire nation were soldiers, and there were battles everywhere, then the × people would be impossible to defend against and would eventually collapse.

Yu Qian's patriotism can be seen in Volume 8 of the "Tour Records": "During the Jingtai era, the northern [enemies] and the southern expeditions made military affairs heavy. The Duke often settled several matters in a day and did not stop until late at night, often saying, 'Where will this heart's blood be spilled!'"

Five of his poems are preserved in Volume 11 of "A Collection of Ming Dynasty Poetry." The "Tour Records" also records fragments of poems, such as the poem about Su Wu: "Wealth or poverty, do not ask, A loyal heart repays the nation, that is what a man should do." And: "Do not laugh at the simple traveling bag, I alone keep my sword leaning against the blue sky." Both "can be seen as his isolated and upright character" and "his spirit of loyalty and integrity."

Ming people commemorated Yu Qian with poems, the more famous being Huang Fengxiang's "Visiting the Shrine of Junior Protector Yu," saying, "The nine tripods are as stable as a mountain, the borders are as calm as if rolled up." Also, Yang Zhuo's "Worshipping at the Tomb of Duke Zhongsu Yu," saying, "Remember the events of the Jingtai era, With one hand supporting the sky and assisting the heavens in punishment. The iron staff before the Sima Gate is cold, the spears sweeping outside Juyong Pass."

Someone made "The Soul of the Chinese Nation for Five Thousand Years" (?) and regarded Yu Qian as one of the four pillars, alongside Xie An, Li Gang, and Yu Yunwen, showing the utmost respect.

Regarding the novels written about Yu Qian, there is also Sun Gaochong's "The Complete Biography of Junior Protector Yu's Loyalty," ten volumes in forty biographies. There is also a Ming person's "Authentic Biography," which is dedicated to Yu Qian. The former survives, while the latter is lost, showing that "public opinion is in people's hearts."
