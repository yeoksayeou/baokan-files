### On Our Nation's Wartime Economic Construction —A Summary at the End of the 27th Year—

(1) Three Principles and Eight Guidelines

The greatest goal of wartime economic construction is to achieve victory. However, economic phenomena are complex and multifaceted. Without principles to guide us, how can we proceed? Therefore, the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, in its pronouncements, emphasized the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People, elucidating the relationship between resistance and national reconstruction, seeing them as mutually supportive. Within the Principle of Livelihood, it vehemently argued that the ultimate goal of Japanese aggression was, in reality, to use military force to carry out economic plunder. Therefore, during the war of resistance, our nation should first seek to maintain agricultural economies and develop productive forces. Secondly, newly emerging industries are deeply and significantly related, directly and indirectly, to the economic power of the war effort. We must exert the strength of the entire government and all the people to strive for recovery, thereby raising two principles: first, to accumulate capital and revitalize industry through extreme frugality and hardship in production; second, all plans for industrial recovery should focus on achieving victory in the war of resistance, eliminating daily differences in position or vested interests and feelings, and advancing toward a common goal; third, in economic construction, the government must, based on the tenets of the Principle of Livelihood, implement a planned economy. For enterprises suitable for state operation, the state shall raise capital to initiate and manage them, ensuring that production is rationalized. For those suitable for private enterprise, private individuals shall invest and manage them, subject to government guidance and encouragement within the framework of the overall national plan.

To ensure victory in the war of resistance and success in national reconstruction, seven categories of guidelines for resistance and nation-building have been formulated, of which eight relate to the economy: first, economic construction should be centered on military affairs while also paying attention to improving people's lives. Based on this goal, a planned economy should be implemented, investment from domestic and overseas Chinese should be encouraged, and wartime production should be expanded; second, rural economic development should be vigorously promoted, cooperation should be encouraged, food supplies should be regulated, wasteland should be reclaimed, and waterways should be dredged; third, mineral resources should be developed, the foundations of heavy industry should be established, the operation of light industry should be encouraged, and local handicrafts should be developed; fourth, a wartime tax system should be implemented, and financial administration should be thoroughly reformed; fifth, banking operations should be controlled, thereby streamlining commercial and industrial activities; sixth, the legal tender should be consolidated, foreign exchange should be managed, and imports and exports should be controlled to stabilize finances; seventh, the transportation system should be reorganized, combined water, land, and air transport should be organized, railways and highways should be added, and new air routes should be opened; eighth, unscrupulous merchants should be strictly prohibited from monopolizing, hoarding, speculating, and manipulating markets, and a price stabilization system for goods should be implemented.

Over the past year, China's economic construction has been in line with these three principles, and economic construction matters have followed these eight guidelines. Therefore, the important aspects are discussed separately to provide reference and discussion for those concerned about China's wartime economy.

(2) Financial Construction

In recent years, China's financial construction has made significant progress. The income tax, established in October of the 25th year, has added an important source to wartime finance. Since the official outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War on August 12, the National Government, to encourage donations for national salvation, issued 90 million yuan of national salvation bonds, fully subscribed, and now sold out. At the same time, it promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Stamp Duty in Extraordinary Times," consisting of nine articles, and the "Measures for Additional Levy of Local Wine Tax and Management of Local Tobacco Silk Tax," consisting of five articles, and implemented the "Provisional Regulations on Export and Re-export Tariffs," consisting of seven articles. With the increasing expansion of the war zone, the customs, salt, and consolidated taxes, which were the main sources of tax revenue, are now able to collect very little. For example, according to the Social and Economic Monthly Report, customs revenue from retained ports in the 27th year is estimated at about 80 million yuan. On the government side, it is necessary to find other sources of funds to supplement this. The methods of raising funds are nothing more than increasing taxes or levying new taxes, raising domestic and foreign debts, and increasing the issuance of subsidiary coins. As for increasing taxes, most of the places where taxes were collected have become war zones, and taxes cannot be collected, let alone increased. As for increasing the issuance of paper money, this would only lead to the disadvantages of currency inflation, disrupting wartime finance more than anything else. Therefore, to cope with this huge wartime expenditure, the only way to supplement it without causing unfair burdens is to levy new taxes and raise national debts.

(甲) Concerning the Levying of New Taxes

On October 28 of the 27th year, the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Excess Profits Tax in Extraordinary Times," consisting of seventeen articles, which stipulated: (1) all for-profit businesses, commercial firms, shops, factories, or individuals with capital above one thousand yuan, for-profit businesses jointly run by officials and merchants, and temporary for-profit businesses, whose profits exceed 15% of their capital; (2) profits from property leasing exceeding 12% of the property value. Tax rates range from 10% to 50%. The starting date for tax collection is July 1 of the 27th year, collected every six months, but according to the nature of each industry, it may be collected monthly or in one lump sum. On October 6, the government promulgated a "Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations," consisting of twenty-four articles, stipulating that taxes should be levied on property left within the territory of the Republic of China at the time of a person's death, and on property left abroad by citizens of the Republic of China who have a residence within the territory of the country. The so-called inheritance refers to the inherited real estate, immovable property, and all other rights with property value of the deceased. The tax is levied starting from a total inheritance of 5,000 yuan or more, with tax rates ranging from 1% to 50%, to be implemented on January 1 of the 18th year.

(乙) Issuance of Public Debt

Levying new taxes is indeed a fundamental plan for wartime finance, but the effectiveness of new taxes is difficult to predict. Furthermore, the need for funds is urgent both domestically and abroad, and the construction of the war economy also requires funding. Therefore, in addition to organizing new taxes, it is necessary to raise public debt to supplement resources. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the national debt raised amounts to 100,470,000 yuan in national currency, 100 million yuan in gold, 150 million francs in foreign currency, 10,144,000 pounds in British currency, and 10 million US dollars. See the table below:

From the above, it can be seen that the issuance of public debt is the main means of wartime financial construction in China. However, this is not necessarily a flaw in our country's wartime finance. Judging from the financial measures taken by various countries during the European War, there is much to be commended.

(丙) Concerning Local Finance

As for local finances, they are usually very strained. This is even more so during wartime. The methods of making up for this in financial terms, apart from some overdrafts from provincial banks, also have to rely on public debt policies. We are certain that about 60 million yuan has already been issued. The list is as follows:

In addition to issuing public debt, local governments are making every effort to increase tax revenue, increase tax rates, expand tax sources, and economize on revenue and expenditure. Taking the financial establishment in Guangxi Province as an example, it is not difficult to infer the financial situation of other provinces.

Regarding provincial finances, tax revenues are adjusted separately according to the nature of national and provincial taxes, and before adjustment, they are temporarily handled as before. State-owned and county-owned enterprises are expanded to make business revenue an important source of government revenue. Land taxes are consolidated by dealing with land certificates. City land price taxes will be implemented. The house tax will continue to be promoted. All kinds of taxes and levies in provinces and counties will be collected directly in principle, and the system of collection on commission and contracting will be gradually abolished. As a principle, administrative agencies will not concurrently collect taxes, and provincial and county tax donations will gradually be handled by the tax collection bureaus. Appropriate additional tobacco and alcohol tax surcharges and business taxes will be allocated to counties for local expenses, and the standard for their distribution will be determined. The addition of various taxes and levies will be restricted, or taxes and proportional donations will be levied under other names. It is stipulated that banks will act as county treasury agencies, and banks will gradually act as county treasuries. Regarding county finances: each county is responsible for urging districts, townships, and villages to effectively assist tax collection agencies in performing their duties; each county is urged to continue to survey land with unpaid taxes and collect donations based on its land value; each county is urged to improve county finance supervision and unify the revenue, expenditure, and custody of grass-roots organizations. Regarding accounting and auditing: the accounting system is strictly enforced; village budgets and accounting are implemented; pre- and post-audits are strictly enforced; on-site accounting is promoted; inspection matters are actively promoted; and attention is also paid to the general survey of the assets of various agencies.

(3) Currency and Financial Construction

After our country implemented the legal tender in the winter of the 24th year, the currency system was unified and finance was stabilized. However, due to political relations in Guangdong and Guangxi and geographical relations in Yunnan Province, the legal tender could not be promoted. Later, on August 21 of the 25th year and June 20 of the 26th year, the currency system of Guangdong was reformed twice, abolishing the subsidiary coins, but the currency systems of Yunnan and Guangxi provinces still could not be unified and the legal tender could not be promoted. However, after the outbreak of the war, the central political and economic power moved into the southwestern provinces, and the currency systems of Yunnan and Guangxi were also unified. Therefore, China's entire currency system became more unified due to the war.

In terms of construction on the financial front, at the beginning of the war, there was the promulgation of measures to stabilize finance, the approval of supplementary measures to stabilize finance, the organization of the joint office of the four banks of the Central Government, and the establishment of the four-bank lending committee. From March to June of the 27th year, the implementation of the general outline of measures for the control of foreign exchange for imports and exports and the improvement of local financial institutions, as well as the various measures decided at the Hankou Financial Conference, were implemented one after another.

(甲) Guangxi Promotes the Legal Tender

When the legal tender was implemented, the current subsidiary coins were prohibited from circulation. The Guangxi Bank took the opportunity to redeem them, and the provincial government's annual expenditure was insufficient, so the overdrafts at the bank were very large, and the amount issued reached more than 20 million yuan, still not meeting the demand. In the 25th year, military expenses were high, and more than 30 million were issued, and the value of the Guangxi currency continued to fall. Fortunately, the state of non-peace was announced, and the provincial government repeatedly requested relief from the central government. Finally, the dispute over the high or low exchange rate between the Guangxi currency and the legal tender had no results. After the Sino-Japanese War in the 26th year, two yuan of legal tender notes were legally equal to one yuan of legal tender. At the same time, in order to consolidate Guangxi's finances and enrich Guangxi's reserves, the central government issued a consolidation public debt of 17 million yuan in December.

(乙) Yunnan Promotes the Legal Tender

Yunnan Province did not start promoting the legal tender until May of the 26th year. The provincial government's pacification office decided to implement the following measures: (1) Starting from May 15, all public and private funds in Yunnan Province will be paid and received in legal tender, and cash will not be allowed to be used; (2) The use of legal tender will be limited to small denominations of less than one yuan in the paper money of the Central, China, and Communications Banks. The old and new silver banknotes of the Fudian Bank will be allowed to be used; (3) Those who hold silver coins and raw silver are limited to redeem them at the Fudian New Bank and its branches and legal tender exchange offices within three months from May 15. In the 27th year, the Ministry of Finance formulated measures to collect and end the US-printed banknotes issued by the former Fudian Bank, limiting the time for one-time collection to the end of November from September 1, but due to transportation inconveniences, the deadline was extended by three months to the end of February of the 28th year, to be handled by the Fudian New Bank, and will be void after the deadline.

(丙) Facilities for Controlling Foreign Exchange

Since the promulgation of the measures to stabilize finance, the funds needed by agriculture, commerce, industry, and mining should still be maintained. However, in order to cope with withdrawals and deposits, financial institutions were originally prepared to reduce loans. Although the China Central Trust and Savings Bank has not been established, the four government banks have always been responsible for rescuing financial panic in the past, so the Ministry of Finance ordered the four banks to handle rediscounting. At the same time, although the supplementary measures to stabilize finance temporarily prevented the outflow of funds, the organization was incomplete and failed to achieve universal results, and it was necessary to manage trade and control foreign exchange. In March of the 27th year, after the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank" in Peiping was established and issued unsecured and non-convertible paper money, in order to protect our country's foreign exchange funds, on March 10 of the same year, three articles of the "Measures for Foreign Exchange Application Approval" and six articles of the "Rules for Foreign Exchange Purchase Application Approval" were promulgated. Later, there were repeated increases. On April 12, the Shanghai Liaison Office was ordered to be established. On April 14, it was ordered to provide cash. On July 7, it was ordered that banks applying for foreign exchange should specify the names and amounts of importers, and the application line should only charge a handling fee of three pence out of six. On June 10, it was ordered that the application for foreign exchange should include detailed items such as the name, quantity, amount, and origin of the goods. On August 8, a fixed order approval system was implemented. The Central Bank Group had foreign exchange sales but no purchases, which was not a good policy. Furthermore, allowing export foreign exchange to circulate in the market had a significant impact on the future of exchange rates, and it should be concentrated in the Central Bank, both to generate foreign exchange and to stabilize the value of the legal tender. Therefore, on April 25, various measures for the control of export foreign exchange were implemented. The main measures include four types of regulations: (1) Measures for merchants to transport goods for export and sell foreign exchange, (2) Types and methods of foreign exchange that should be settled for export goods, (3) Matters for relevant agencies to pay attention to when investigating the production of foreign exchange from export goods, (4) Matters for implementing the "Types of Foreign Exchange that Should Be Settled for Export Goods" Should Be Settled for Export Goods. It is stipulated that exporters should sell the foreign currency obtained to the China or Communications Bank - in fact, the China and Communications Banks resold it to the Central Bank. The types of export goods that should be settled for foreign exchange were gradually expanded to 24 types, and then changed to 23 categories. Later, there were further deletions, and from New Year's Day of the 28th year, they were reduced to tung oil, palm fiber, cowhide, tea, mineral sand, gallnuts, leather goods, medicinal materials, wool, silk, ramie, casings, duck feathers, etc., three major categories.

(丁) General Outline of Measures to Improve Local Finance

Joint lending by the four banks is sufficient to enhance the strength of the central and specially authorized banks to lead financial regulation and industry and commerce, but the organization of local financial institutions urgently needs to be improved, and their capital needs to be enriched. Therefore, at the end of April, the Ministry of Finance promulgated ten articles of the General Outline of Measures to Improve Local Finance, specially allowing local financial institutions to receive one-yuan coins and subsidiary currency notes from the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, but only for handling the following industries related to agriculture and industry: (1) Operation of agricultural product warehouses, (2) Pledge of agricultural products, (3) Loans for seeds, fertilizers, plows, and agricultural days, (4) Loans for agricultural land and water affairs, (5) Acceptance or discounting of agricultural bills, (6) Mortgages of land and real estate with legal procedures completed and continued income, (7) Mortgages of factory assets, (8) Mortgages of industrial raw materials and finished products, (9) Acceptance or discounting of commercial bills, (10) Management, issuance, or mortgage of corporate bonds, (11) Mortgage of corporate stocks with interest paid according to regulations, (12) Pledge of agricultural, forestry, mining products, and daily-use domestic goods. The intention of this pilot project is to encourage financial institutions to move towards agriculture, industry, and mining, in order to correct the past emphasis on commerce, and to make funds fully invested in rural areas and used for production. Agriculture accounts for more than five items. The wartime measures to stabilize finance are passive restrictions, while the outline for the reform of local finance is an active construction.

(戊) Progress of the Gold Policy

In addition to the aforementioned, the progress of the gold policy, the establishment of British and American loans, and the extension of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement are also of great importance to our country's wartime currency.

Since China nationalized silver in the 24th year, gold can be bought and sold freely, and the gold price is only controlled by the customs gold settlement price. However, gold has the qualification of an international currency material. The more gold reserves a country has, the more it shows the country's strong external purchasing power. Since the War of Resistance, collecting gold in our country has also been an important policy of the wartime economy. When the national public debt was raised, it was stipulated that gold or gold coins could be used to purchase bonds. On October 10 of the 26th year, the Measures for the Exchange of Gold for Legal Tender and the Implementation Rules were promulgated, stipulating that those who exchange raw gold, goldware, etc. for legal tender will be given a handling fee of 3%, those who purchase national salvation public bonds will be given an additional 6%, and those who deposit it as legal tender will be given an additional weekly interest of 2%. On May 1 of the 27th year, gold public bonds were issued, stipulating that those who pay with raw gold and its finished products or gold coins will be issued customs gold bonds based on the amount of pure gold they contain, with each customs gold unit of 60.1866 milligrams of pure gold. On November 1 of the 27th year, the Measures for Supervising Silver Buildings to Collect and Redeem Gold were promulgated, stipulating that silver buildings are only allowed to buy and sell gold and finished gold bars in the form of ornaments and utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, placer gold, and mineral gold are not allowed to be bought or sold. Shops specializing in buying placer gold and mineral gold that do not operate silver buildings should contact the Central Bank to sign a contract for accepting and entrusting the Central Bank to collect gold, and all of them should be resold to the Central Bank and not sold privately. In mid-November of the 27th year, the Ministry of Finance restricted the private transportation of gold out of the country and to the occupied areas, stipulating that gold and gold jewelry of any shape are prohibited from being carried out of the country or transported to the occupied areas, unless specially approved by the Ministry of Finance. Looking at the progress of the wartime gold policy, the greatest goal is to collect gold from the people to increase foreign exchange reserves. In order to strengthen the value of the legal tender against foreign exchange, our country has to try its best to collect gold from the people.

(己) Extension of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement and Credit Loans

Raising foreign debt is also an important policy to consolidate the currency value and stabilize finances during wartime. In September of the 27th year, our country sent an economic mission, Chen Guangpu and Xi Ni Mao, to the United States. After three months, they discussed with the US Treasury Department and private groups, and the monetary agreement was extended and a credit loan of 25 million yuan was established. According to a Havas telegram on December 19, the US Treasury Secretary said that the monetary agreement previously concluded between the US and China on July 9, 1939, allowed our country to use the gold deposited in the US as collateral to obtain credit loans from the US. The Central Bank of our country had obtained this credit loan under certain conditions to protect the interests of the US and China in order to stabilize exchange rates. This agreement, which expired at the end of 1938, is still effective. According to the joint official statement by the Chinese and US finance ministers on the Sino-US Gold Wheel Exchange Agreement on July 9, 1937, continuing the 1936 silver-coin agreement, under mutually acceptable conditions, our country purchased a large amount of gold from the US, and the US continued to buy silver from our country in order to help China increase its gold reserves; and it was proposed to expand the agreed method between the two parties - that is, the Central Bank of our country can obtain US dollars to stabilize the circulation under conditions that protect the interests of both parties. Therefore, the monetary agreement and the credit loan are probably the result of expanding the agreed method. The impact is to further strengthen the stability of the value of the legal tender. Silver prices fluctuate constantly and do not have the qualifications of a world currency, and although various countries have now stopped the gold standard, gold still maintains the function of value storage in international financial relations. The extension of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement has given our country various conveniences to exchange silver for gold to increase the value of the foreign exchange reserves of the legal tender. Secondly, credit loans, whether in the form of currency or goods, directly or indirectly increase foreign exchange reserves and stabilize the value of the legal tender.

In addition to the US $25 million credit loan, the UK has in principle approved a £10,000 credit loan to our country. The first payment was £500,000, specifically for the purchase of trucks and transportation materials.

(4) Other Economic Construction

(甲) Transportation Construction

Today, the western and northern provinces have become the bases for China's war of resistance and national reconstruction. Therefore, our country's wartime economic construction is also concentrated in the western and northern provinces. However, the most important economic construction is the construction of financial currencies, which are used to promote other economic construction. The second is transportation economic construction. After the opening of transportation routes, the materials needed for "war resistance" and economic construction can be enriched, and the supply will not be lacking.

In transportation construction, it can be divided into highways and railways. Regarding highways: there is the Southwest Highway Network, which connects Hunan Province to Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan and other provinces and Myanmar; there is the Northwest Highway Network, which connects Bei Province to Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang provinces; there is the West-North Communication Highway Network, which connects Sichuan Province to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Regarding railways: the construction of Yunnan (Guiyang to Kunming), Sichuan-Han (Qianfu to Kunming), and Yunnan-Myanmar (Kunming to Manyun Town on the Burmese border and Mo-san Railway in Myanmar) railways is especially important. The construction of the Yunnan-Myanmar railway is of great significance for opening up European international transportation and can save travel time between the southwestern provinces and foreign countries.

(乙) Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Construction

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, efforts were made to adjust the domestic economy, especially those related to the state. On December 22 of the 26th year, the National Government promulgated the Wartime Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations, which were managed by the Military Commission. A Trade Adjustment Committee was established under the Military Commission, with a fund of 10 million yuan; an Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee, with a fund of 30 million yuan; and an Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee, with a fund of 10 million yuan, all of which were specially allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Over the past year, remarkable achievements have been made.

The Trade Commission is now under the Ministry of Finance and has been renamed the Trade Commission, which focuses on promoting the export of local goods and is carried out in conjunction with the control of export foreign exchange. For example, tea leaves from Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, silk from Jiangsu and Sichuan, palm fiber and fur from Sichuan and Hubei, and tung oil from Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. In mid-June of the 27th year, the Ministry of Finance revised the measures to promote export trade, dividing them into: (甲) Reducing export costs to promote export sales; (乙) Adjusting the market prices of local goods to maintain domestic production. Part A is a remedial measure because the international market is depressed and the prices of goods have fallen, causing export merchants to suffer occasional sales losses, which in turn affects production. Part B is a remedial measure because there is a difference between the official exchange rate and the black market, and merchants demand that foreign exchange be sold at market prices, or that the government compensate them in cash.

The Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee is now under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Agricultural Capital Bureau and the Agricultural Experiment Institute work together. The Agricultural Capital Bureau specializes in handling the lending of funds, and the Agricultural Experiment Institute specializes in improving agricultural technology. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has formulated measures to subsidize agricultural improvement funds in various provinces. Except for cooperative enterprises, all agricultural improvement agencies can apply for subsidies in accordance with this law. The Ministries of Finance and Economics have jointly formulated six articles on expanding the scope of rural loans, stipulating that financial institutions that receive one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes in accordance with the outline of measures to improve local financial institutions, and legally established cooperative treasuries, should make full use of various cooperatives to increase agricultural loans. However, during the War of Resistance, farmers' groups recognized by lending institutions may also be loan recipients.

The Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee is also under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and cooperates with the Resources Committee to consolidate the foundations of public and private enterprises. The former assists local private factories to move from war zones to safe areas and continue operations. It is estimated that more than 300 factories have been relocated to inland provinces with government assistance. More than 100 of them are in Sichuan Province. The latter specializes in various state-owned heavy industries in inland provinces - steel, electricity, machinery, and mining and metallurgy. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs assisted a certain agency in building a large-scale steel plant, which will be completed this year and will be able to produce a considerable amount of steel every day. It also assisted the Zhao Brothers Steel Plant, which will soon be producing. Chemicals such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and Albina will be handled by the Yongli Company, which has experience in this industry. In addition, the National Government promulgated the Industrial Incentive Law and the Special Industry Interest Guarantee and Subsidy Regulations on August 7 of the 27th year, which were handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The former stipulates that those who have international competition in domestic and foreign markets, those who use the latest foreign methods to manufacture, and those who have exclusive manufacturing rights may request reduction or exemption from (1) export tax, (2) raw material tax, (3) transportation costs of state-owned transportation enterprises, (4) granting of bonuses, and (5) exclusive manufacturing rights within a certain area for five years. The latter stipulates that special industries that manufacture power engines, electric motors, machine tools, metal materials, liquid fuels, and transportation equipment may request interest guarantees - 5% of paid-in capital, 6% of bonds, limited to seven years, or subsidies - based on the annual production cost and market price of each category, and a cash payment may be given.

In summary, the construction of wartime agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce is presided over by the Ministries of Economy and Finance and promoted by the three committees with the assistance of subordinate agencies. However, because this construction is based on "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Reconstruction," and due to the confidentiality of the relationship and the brevity of the information, it is regrettable that it cannot be elaborated in detail.

### An Overview of the War of Resistance in North China and an Estimate of Future Developments

— Speech by Peng Dehuai at the Mingfeng Journal

Respected comrades in the war of resistance, esteemed reporters from various newspapers, and friends from the cultural sphere, it is indeed not easy to gather here today. We should be delighted. Although we are divided into front and rear areas and have differences in our work, our overall mission is the same. At the same time, the cruelty and slaughter by the Japanese invaders are equally brutal in both the front and rear areas. The suffering endured by our Chinese people is the same. Therefore, our work objectives are also consistent: to strive for victory in the war of resistance against Japan.

Now, I will tell the comrades in the rear area about the situation of the war of resistance in North China over the past year and a half, and at the same time introduce it to all compatriots across the country, the national army, and people around the world, so that the people of the whole country and the people of the world can have a concrete understanding.

I. General Overview of North China

A. Objectives and Overview of Mass Work

A. Objectives:

The purpose of mass work is to mobilize and organize the masses to support the government, protect the national leader, support the army fighting the war, implement the program for resisting the war and building the nation, consolidate the unity against Japan, eliminate traitors, help and participate in the anti-Japanese army, so as to achieve victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation.

Mobilizing and organizing the masses is to make the anti-Japanese forces more effective and more united. This is not for the sake of any one party or faction, but for the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan. It is necessary to develop the mass movement. The front-line troops are fighting the Japanese invaders every day and need a large number of troop replenishment. Mobilizing the people of the whole country to participate in the war in the anti-Japanese army is sacred, but it is also necessary to strengthen mass work in order to have a solution. For the sake of the war of resistance, it is necessary to work hard in the rear to produce and increase production, and it is also necessary to mobilize the masses. Behind the Japanese invaders, striking, harassing, and destroying the Japanese invaders, destroying the puppet organizations, and attacking the traitors, require the strength of the masses. Otherwise, the Japanese invaders' organization of puppet organizations will achieve the goal of controlling the Chinese with Chinese. The wealth of our occupied areas will also be used by the Japanese invaders. At the same time, we also know that the past shortcomings of the Chinese army were that the army was a hired army. If we want the army's anti-Japanese sentiment to be high, we must have revolutionary masses participating in the army. At the same time, the anti-Japanese army must help the development of the mass movement. Only when the masses and the army are truly closely integrated can the combat effectiveness be truly enhanced. The final victory or defeat of the war mainly depends not on technology, but on manpower. If the 450 million people of China are mobilized and organized, it will be a powerful source of victory. Here, it is not to say that the army does not need new equipment and technology, but that the main condition depends on the huge number of the masses. Our insistence on fighting the war for eighteen months depends on the masses. Moreover, the future persistence and final victory of the war will still depend on the masses.

The "Program for Resisting the War and Building the Nation" clearly states that "the war of resistance will surely be won, and the nation will surely be built," but this is not an empty slogan, but requires practical work and hard efforts to achieve. A new China of the Three Principles of the People can be realized. The foundation for this realization and victory lies in mobilizing and organizing the masses.

North China is an important direction for China's war of resistance and the battlefield for the final decisive battle against the Japanese invaders. The war of resistance in the past eighteen months has fully demonstrated the importance of the masses. In fact, it is precisely because of giving play to the power of the masses themselves that continuous victories have been won, a vast territory has been recovered, and the foundation for the war of resistance in North China has been laid. Otherwise, North China might have become Manchuria II, which would be unthinkable. Some people still have misunderstandings about this. In fact, we have very different feelings from North China to the Yellow River to Xi'an, although there is only a river apart. I always hope that there will be no misunderstanding, and there is no need for misunderstanding. Boldly relying on the people, trusting the people, mobilizing the people, and organizing the people is the most correct way.

Therefore, we can definitely say that only by raising the anti-Japanese sentiment of the masses and consciously participating in the anti-Japanese army can we closely connect the army and the people. Only a revolutionary mass movement can produce a revolutionary army. Only revolutionary armed forces can cooperate closely with the masses. Only cooperation between military force and the masses can generate great power. Only by relying on the conscious help of the masses in the war can the war of resistance be protracted and can we overcome the difficulties inevitably encountered in the national liberation war. Only by mobilizing all the main driving forces of the entire nation can we strive for the final victory of the war and have a reliable guarantee that the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built.

B. Brutal Acts of the Japanese Invaders and the Righteous Indignation of the People in North China:

In the past eighteen months, the evil deeds of the Japanese invaders in North China have occasionally been revealed in newspapers, but in fact, only less than one ten-thousandth of them have been disclosed. There are many heinous acts that people cannot imagine. The barbarity and cruelty are indescribable. Just taking the burning of houses as an example, from Baoding to Shijiazhuang, a long distance, the villages within about fifteen miles on both sides of the Pinghan Railway were completely burned down. We know that these are all densely populated areas, so you can imagine how many people were innocently sacrificed. In Shanxi, countless people were burned and killed in Qinxian, Wuxiang, Liaoxian, Heshun, Xiyang, and other places. As for rape, it is not uncommon. Even old women are not spared, and children are also killed. These are all things that have never happened in history. It can be seen that in the past eighteen months, especially after April last year (1938), the people of North China, regardless of wealth or poverty, regardless of gender, regardless of age, were daily subjected to bombing by Japanese planes, and massacre, rape, and looting. Between the Pinghan, Jinpu, Pingsui, and Zhengtai railways, there were as many as ten million victims. What a huge and shocking number of people!

However, due to the Japanese invaders' brutality, it aroused the righteous indignation of the people in North China. A huge torrent of resistance was universally ignited in every corner. The masses spontaneously rose up to resist the Japanese invaders, and they created many methods from their own experiences.

For example, (1) In a place about thirty miles west of Shijiazhuang, the Japanese soldiers often went to rape and commit atrocities. The masses, filled with righteous indignation, had the men dress in red clothes to lure them. The Japanese soldiers, driven mad by lust, chased after them. The masses lured them into the mountains, killed them, and seized their guns. This is not to say that the people of North China seduced the Japanese soldiers, but it shows the extent to which the Japanese soldiers were driven mad. This kind of thing has happened several times. Now the people here already have hundreds of guns and have become a guerrilla team. The people called this story "The Clever Trick of Men Dressed as Women West of Shijiazhuang Kills the Japanese."

(2) In Xiyang, south of the Zhengtai Railway, Japanese soldiers robbed the people of food. The people picked up pot lids and beat the Japanese soldiers to death. The people called this story "Broken Pot Lids Dig Out the Japanese Soldiers."

(3) The director and his wife of the telegraph bureau in Puxiu County, Shanxi Province, still stuck to their posts when the Japanese invaders were approaching Jiexiu, thirty miles away. When the Japanese army surrounded the telegraph bureau, the couple chose not to surrender to the Japanese invaders and committed suicide. (Continued on page 6)

Guangxi Province Actively Prepares for War; Militia Reorganized into Guerrilla Units; Bai Chongxi Discusses the War Situation

[Special Dispatch from Guilin on the 14th of This Month] In Guangxi Province, the areas near the war zone and along the highways are implementing a scorched earth policy. The militia has been reorganized into guerrilla units and is stepping up training. Starting next month, gambling will be banned throughout the province, and special taxes will be abolished.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 14th] Bai Chongxi received a reporter from the New York Times on the 5th. He first explained why he had rarely met with foreign reporters before, saying that he was actually busy with military affairs and not out of contempt for the press. Bai then said: "Our country's stockpiles of military supplies are sufficient for two years. Japan still hopes for a quick victory, but after more than a year of resistance, our enduring strength is increasing. The reason why Britain and the United States have extended credit loans to aid our country is because they firmly believe that our country will win the final victory. These credit loans will inevitably expand and will be used to sanction Japan. Although our ports have been blockaded, the inland areas have been little affected. At the same time, military supplies and grain can still continue to be transported in. As for all the occupied areas, our authorities have properly planned good policies and will never allow the Japanese invaders to develop and enjoy them." Finally, Bai spoke of Wang's attempt to appease Japan and seek peace, believing that the Central Committee's expulsion of Wang from the party and the revocation of his official duties was extremely appropriate. From now on, all of Wang's words and deeds can only represent himself and have absolutely no impact on our country.

### Since the War of Resistance Began, Guizhou Has Sent 170,000 Troops; Southwestern Provinces are Striving for Development; Wu Dingchang Arrives in Yunnan and Delivers a Speech

[Special Dispatch from Kunming on the 14th of This Month] Qian Governor Wu Dingchang flew to Yunnan yesterday to meet with Chairman Long Yun. He will return to Guizhou in two or three days. Wu said, "Our country's war of resistance is to win victory through long-term resistance. The southwestern provinces should strive for development to lay the foundation for the war of resistance. Guizhou's various construction projects are working hard according to this goal. In terms of mobilization, since the war of resistance began, 170,000 soldiers have been sent to supplement the army. We should continue to supplement the army in the future. Now the international situation is improving, and the anti-Japanese forces have been further strengthened after Wang left Chongqing. Victory is not far away."

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 13th] Governor Wu Dingchang of Guizhou flew from Chongqing to Kunming this afternoon and stayed at the hotel. Chairman Long Yun visited him at 2:00 p.m. and chatted for about an hour before leaving. Wu told reporters that he came to discuss military service and economic construction matters with Chairman Long of Yunnan Province to enhance the anti-Japanese construction work in the rear area. He plans to return to Chongqing tomorrow and return to Guizhou within days.

Kangbian Adds 30 Counties; Sichuan and Yunnan Revitalize Industry

### The Yunnan-Burma Road is the Greatest Engineering Feat of Modern Times

[Haitong, London, 14th] The Times published an article today entitled "China's Back Door," in which the author discussed the possible development of the Yunnan-Burma Road. The completion of this road may be the greatest engineering feat in the world in recent years. The National Government can be proud of this. There is no doubt that Japan is now paying close attention to the development of this road. Whether anyone has any speculation about the Japanese actions can be postponed for the time being. It also said that the road is narrow, and shrewd observers criticize that it needs to be greatly developed to bear a large amount of military transport. From this month to May, the goods of the National Government can be transported on this road. It is certain that 100 trucks will pass by every day, carrying a total of 200 tons of goods. The round trip takes 14 days. In the three and a half months before the rainy season arrives, 10,000 tons can be transported. However, it will not be possible to use this road as a commercial artery until November or December. By then, the direction of China's war may have changed again.

### The Fifth Plenary Session Will Seek Further Unity Among the Parties; Discussions of Peace Talks Are Absolutely Not True

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 15th of This Month] A spokesman for the National Government stated to reporters that the foreign rumors that the Fifth Plenary Session will consider peace talks with Japan are absolutely untrue. If the government really had this intention, why would it immediately expel Wang Jingwei from the party? The fact is that the Fifth Plenary Session will propose a deeper consolidation of unity among the various parties.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] A Communist Party spokesman told a Associated Press reporter that he hoped that the Kuomintang's Fifth Plenary Session would consider the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party's Central Committee in Yan'an on November 5, organize a joint committee of various parties, and realize the Communist Party's joining the Three People's Principles Youth League.

### Air Raids on Sichuan and Hunan; Dozens of Students Killed in Wanxian

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] The local air defense headquarters recently received a telegram from Wanxian stating that on the 14th at noon, six enemy planes flew to Wanxian to wreak havoc, bombing Daximenwai, Xijiao, and Yimalu and Ermalu, dropping more than 20 bombs. Jiji Elementary School was bombed, and the houses collapsed, killing and injuring dozens of students. Efforts are now being made to excavate the debris. It is said that during this enemy air raid on Wanxian, the enemy wantonly bombed, killing more than 50 students and civilians and injuring more than 80 people. The situation was very tragic. In addition, it was reported that a few days ago, more than ten enemy planes raided Chongqing, dropping 17 bombs in a certain place in the suburbs, killing 3 people and injuring 21. They also dropped 12 bombs in a certain place, killing 4 people and injuring 5 people. Eight enemy planes also sneaked in and dropped more than 10 bombs, killing and injuring 28 people.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 14th] According to Chinese sources, 18 Japanese planes raided Hengyang, causing fires in the streets. The county government was destroyed, killing and injuring 200 people and destroying 180 houses in the city.

### The Southwest Theater Headquarters Issues a Statement on the Southwest Battle Situation — January 5 to 11 —

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 14th] The Southwest Theater Headquarters issued a statement on the Southwest battle situation on the morning of the 14th (January 5 to 11) as follows: (1)

Southern Anhui Front:

About 1,500 enemy troops near Wanzhi, with several artillery pieces, launched a fierce attack on the positions in the Jiu, Long, and Qiandunshan areas in three directions on the night of the 2nd. The fighting was fierce. Currently, the enemy is still fighting fiercely with us on the Jingting Mountain, Tongshan Changqiao line. Our army took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness in Fanchang and launched a fierce surprise attack on them. After several hours of fighting, the enemy could not hold out and retreated to the northeast. We once captured Junde County. On the 3rd, the enemy troops received reinforcements and launched a counterattack against us. A certain detachment of our army fought the enemy for about 4 hours. Due to the enemy's superior numbers, we are still confronting the enemy in the suburbs of Chenshan. In recent days, our army has been attacking Guichi, and the fighting has been extremely fierce. The enemy is in a state of panic and is in a dilemma. A certain division of our army is advancing towards Yinjiachong. Contact with the enemy near Langshanya has been helpful. In addition, a certain army engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy in the Dailing area, killing many enemy soldiers. The enemy suffered heavy losses and was defeated and fled in a panic towards Xuancheng.

Guangdong Front:

The enemy in Jiujiang was attacked by our powerful guerrillas, and the enemy suffered hundreds of casualties. One night, a certain unit of our army launched an attack on the enemy in the Shedoufang area of Zengcheng. The enemy relied on fortifications to resist, and our army pushed forward step by step. After 30 hours of fierce fighting, Shedouling was surrounded, and more than 100 enemy soldiers were killed. We captured dozens of rifles, steel helmets, and many gas masks. A part of our army broke into the north gate of Zengcheng and engaged in fierce street fighting with the enemy. The enemy suffered hundreds of casualties. Our army suffered slight injuries. On the morning of the 2nd, the enemy repeatedly sent reinforcements from Shitan and Guangzhou. Our army, having completed its mission, withdrew to its original position. In addition, a certain unit of our army has been constantly attacking Yangcun and Sanjiang recently. The enemy has suffered heavy losses and fled in a panic towards Sanshui.

After fierce fighting until 11:00 p.m., our defending soldiers heroically sacrificed their lives, while the enemy's losses were several times ours. Finally, with the continuous increase in enemy troops, Zhanggongdu was captured by the enemy on the morning of the 4th. On the morning of the 8th, a certain unit of our army launched a counterattack. Our army bravely advanced and charged, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Corpses were everywhere. By night, our army broke into the enemy's position and repeatedly engaged in close combat. The enemy army could not hold out, and Zhanggongdu was finally recovered by us. The enemy's military train between Yuezhou and Wuchang was destroyed by our guerrillas, killing many enemy soldiers riding in the train and capturing many work tools, military uniforms, clothing cans, and military supplies.

### We Purchase a Large Number of Aircraft from the United States; Total Value Reaches 8.3 Million Yuan; First Batch of 200 Aircraft Soon to be Shipped

[Reuters, New York, 14th] According to Japanese sources, the "New York Forum" received a shocking report from Washington that the Chinese government had ordered a large number of aircraft from the American "Blenheim" aircraft manufacturing plant, valued at 8.5 million yuan. The contract has been signed by both parties. The newspaper reported that 200 bombers would be shipped to China in March this year. Each of these bombers is equipped with nine machine guns and can carry seven 300-pound bombs.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] Chinese officials here denied the report that China had ordered "Blenheim" aircraft from the United States, saying that the previous "Blenheim" aircraft were not suitable for bombing or combat. If China purchased this type of aircraft, it must be from private sources. According to authoritative sources, China purchased 20 "Blenheim" aircraft last year, none of which were good combat aircraft. China currently has 99 of these aircraft, which are used as training aircraft.

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] Officials disclosed today that China had ordered aircraft from the "Blenheim" factory, saying that the aircraft would be shipped to China in September. Authoritative sources said that the aircraft were valued at 8.32 million yuan. The "Blenheim" aircraft manufacturing plant will use this to expand its facilities and mass-produce military aircraft.

### Commander of the ×th War Zone Wei Lihuang Speaks: The Terrain of Western Henan is Advantageous to Us; The Enemy's Attempt to Cross the River is Nothing But a Dream

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] General Wei Lihuang, who has been transferred to the ×th War Zone after repeatedly building meritorious service in Western Henan for more than a year, assumed his post in Luoyang yesterday afternoon. The reporters stationed in Luoyang visited him in the afternoon and were received by Wei. First, he spoke about the Shanxi War, saying: "After more than a year of continuous attacks by our army, the strength of the enemy in Shanxi has been exhausted. The points and lines occupied by them have also been continuously destroyed and attacked by us, and they have lost contact with each other, like isolated individuals. In the past, the enemy often took the initiative, but now they have become passive and are on the defensive. We are active on all fronts, launching night attacks, causing the enemy to lose sight of each other and exhausting themselves. Generally, people are worried that the enemy will cross the Yellow River and invade Henan. If we can understand the enemy's difficult situation and the strong strength of our army, we can resolutely defend the north bank. Our army will be the screen of North China, and the enemy's claim to cross the river is nothing but a dream." He then said: "This time, I have been ordered to command the Henan war. Henan is in the Central Plains of our country, the intersection of the southeast and northwest, and it is related to the entire war. I feel that my responsibility is heavy and my ability is meager. I hope that all sectors will sincerely help. The success or failure of the war of resistance is not a matter of profit or loss for one family, but is related to the survival of the entire nation. The people of Henan Province are strong, and the military force is strong, which has long been known to the people of the country. If this kind of latent power can be used properly, it is more effective than the army. Therefore, this time I come to Henan, I will first develop the strengths of the masses and allow them to fully demonstrate their great effectiveness in the war of resistance. At the same time, I hope that the masses can thoroughly understand that today's war of resistance is not the business of a few people. If the war of resistance fails, no one can escape their doom. He then cited the suffering of the people in the occupied areas of Shanxi, saying: "The enemy army, in order to achieve their vicious plan to destroy China and exterminate the race, forced the people to take dumb injections, making them disabled and used as beasts of burden. China has not been subjugated. Seeing such a painful lesson, we can see that the day of the failure of the war of resistance is the time when we will be reduced to hell and work as slaves. We must have this awareness. The enemy's weapons are stronger than ours, but as long as the whole country is united, we can overcome them with a fearless spirit. We only need to have firm self-confidence, that is, 'With me in the Central Plains, the enemy will not succeed.' If everyone is like this, the final victory will belong to us without any problem." The reporter then asked about the prospects for counter-offensive. He expressed an optimistic attitude, saying: "The terrain in the Western Henan area is advantageous to us. All the transportation lines that need to be destroyed have been destroyed, and the main routes are under our control. With our proper deployment and the assistance of the people, the enemy will never succeed." He instructed the reporter to pass on his condolences to the people of the country. At this point in the conversation, the reporter was very excited.

Japanese Hold Military Conference to Discuss Invading the Northwest

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese are planning to invade the Northwest with General Terauchi as commander-in-chief and General Umezu as commander of the first route army. The Japanese army is divided into three routes, with a total of Japanese soldiers, including some divisions of Mongolian puppet troops. The Japanese recently held a military conference in Datong, presided over by General Terauchi, to decide that the military actions of the Japanese army should not be neglected, so as to avoid slow progress. The Datong military conference decided that before the Japanese army invaded, three points should be closely watched: (1) Observe the presence of the Eighth Route Army and the guerrillas directly under the Central Command, which are constantly harassing the rear of the Japanese army. (2) The Japanese are attempting to use the Muslims in the west to disrupt the Chinese army, but this wishful thinking has failed. (3) The Japanese army should pay attention to the tactics of both sides, that is, the important strongholds that the Japanese army intends to invade are defended by a large number of Chinese guerrillas. The results of the Datong conference were that the Japanese army could succeed in the Northwest only if it increased its combat power and mobilized the Hui army. The Japanese army's military operations in southwestern Shanxi last week were aimed at suppressing the Chinese guerrilla units and were not a prelude to the invasion of Gansu. However, the strength of the Japanese army is obviously insufficient.

### Sino-Soviet Relations: President of the Legislative Yuan - Speech at a Reception for Chongqing Cultural Circles

Don't be impatient. Before Britain, the United States, and France are united, not only can the Soviet Union not act rashly, but we also do not want it to take action alone.

We often boast that we have a vast territory and abundant resources, but in reality, there is a country with even larger territory and more abundant resources than us, which is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's territory is three times that of China's. We all know that after the success of the Soviet revolution, with just two five-year plans, its industrial production has already ranked first in Europe and second in the world. However, we have not seen the Soviet Union pushing any goods abroad, because in fact, domestic production is far from enough for their own consumption. Originally, the Soviet Union is not a capitalist country, so workers' wages are increasing day by day, and because workers' incomes are abundant, their purchasing power is strong, so the goods produced every day are not enough for their own enjoyment. As for domestic natural resources, not to mention two five-year plans, even another hundred years would not be enough to exploit them. Therefore, the Soviet Union's national strength is very abundant. They sincerely hope that China will become rich and strong and have no intention of dominating the Far East.

Perhaps none of you have been abroad recently, so you don't know the recent foreign situation. I have been to several places last year and deeply know that China's propaganda abroad, even done by ourselves, is not as widespread as the Soviet Union's propaganda for us. The newspapers the Soviet Union uses to promote us, one from the government and one from the party, publish news that is beneficial to China every day, and they never publish any news about the Japanese. Why do they do this? It is to let their people know the greatness of China, to know that China will definitely win, and at the same time, their comments also say that China is resisting for the survival of the nation. Therefore, in their articles commenting on China, no matter which article or which sentence, there is absolutely no place that is unfavorable to China. This is not the result of our request, but their spontaneous, great sympathy and assistance. However, outside of the Soviet Union, the United States is sympathetic to China, and Britain and France are also sympathetic to China. But what is the situation in the newspapers of Britain and France towards China? Left-wing newspapers can still promote us and encourage us to work hard in the war of resistance. As for right-wing newspapers, they have different understandings and sometimes express doubts about the future of our war of resistance. They also say how rich and strong Japan is and that China should not fight Japan but should serve the strong with weakness, and that the current war of resistance is too inconsiderate of virtue and does not measure strength. Therefore, looking at it from abroad, the Soviet Union is completely on our side and is indeed our friend. But on the other hand, in our country, there are still several publications that select and publish articles opposing the Soviet Union. When Soviet friends see this kind of writing, they are naturally unhappy. It should be known that China needs Soviet help right now, and the Soviet Union is a country that asks nothing of others, let alone of our country. Furthermore, even if we oppose it, what's the use? As for the Soviet Union's view of China's war of resistance, from the beginning of the war, they said that China would definitely win the final victory. They use a scientific method to observe, and it seems that they see it more clearly than we do. They said that China has 450 million people. If everyone does not have the idea of resisting Japan, then it goes without saying that the country will be destroyed. But the Chinese people are not like this because, after decades of revolutionary thought, the people of the whole country have the awareness of national survival. Even ordinary people firmly believe that they must resist Japan. Now, not only can Japan not destroy China, but even the world's aggressors and tyrants cannot destroy China because they have historical experience. After the October Revolution, from 1917 to 1920, the domestic situation was very chaotic. There were counter-revolutionary factions causing trouble, and at the same time, the Allied powers Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Poland, and even Japan attacked the Soviet Union. From 1917 to 1920, they fought for two whole years, and the Soviet Union responded to domestic reactionaries on the one hand and resisted foreign aggression on the other. At that time, the Soviet Red Army only had Petrograd and Moscow. All the factories had been bombed, the economy was insufficient, and there was not enough food. It was through their strong resistance that they were able to achieve victory in 1920. Initially, the number of Red Army soldiers was only over 100,000, but by 1920, the number of Red Army soldiers had increased to more than 5 million. We must know that they carried out several revolutions at the same time. Internally, it was a social revolution to eliminate landlords and capitalists, and externally, it was a national revolution to defeat the Allied forces' invasion. Compared to China, our problems now are much simpler because China's only enemy is Japan. As for domestic traitors, they have no strength. We don't need to pay attention to them. Currently, the country is absolutely united, and the central government is becoming increasingly consolidated. Based on their historical lessons, they believe that the Chinese revolution must succeed.

Before the July 7th Incident, the army commanded by the central government had only 100 divisions. Some divisions were large, and some were small. The smaller ones had only 5,000 men per division, totaling only 1 million men. Now there are more than 240 divisions, all of which have been reorganized and strengthened. It can be calculated that the military strength is more than doubled compared to before. So, I say that we are getting stronger as we fight. The replenishment of other military equipment has increased several times compared to before the war. These are all true facts. As for combat experience, before the July 7th Incident, our army had not fought a war against a foreign country. Although there were wars every year, they were all domestic wars. Generally, officers and soldiers were influenced by Japanese propaganda and did not know how much strength they had, always thinking that the Japanese army was amazing. But now everyone knows that the strength of the Japanese is only so-so. During the Battle of Shanghai, on average, for every Japanese soldier killed or wounded, we had five casualties. During the Battle of Xuzhou, for every Japanese soldier killed, we had to sacrifice three. By the time of the battles along the Yangtze River, the casualties between the Japanese and us were roughly equal. As for the guerrilla warfare in North China, according to recent reports, our soldiers have to exchange at least three Japanese soldiers for one of our soldiers. In the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi, it is said that on average, we have to exchange fourteen and a half Japanese soldiers for one of our soldiers. With this kind of war of resistance, how can we not say that we will win? In the hearts of the Japanese, they always thought that after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, we would not be able to continue fighting them. They also felt that imports to Hong Kong were difficult, and our military supplies were cut off. In fact, we had long been prepared. According to the current situation, even if we fight for another ten years, the supply of military supplies will not be a problem.

When we withdrew from the capital, some people in Britain said that China's resistance against Japan might be defeated in every battle, but the final victory would belong to China because Japan would not be able to sustain it permanently. We know that the Japanese military plan originally wanted to subdue China without using force, just by mobilizing their troops and demonstrating to China, and China would surrender. But after the July 7th Incident, they knew that they couldn't do it without using force. Initially, the budget they proposed was only for one month because they thought they could solve the problem in one month. Later, they knew that one month could not solve it, so they came up with a three-month budget, thinking that they could eliminate China in three months. Now it has been eighteen months, and they have not done anything to China. Initially, they only sent 300,000 troops, but now they have increased to 1.5 million troops. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to fight a quick battle has been shattered, and now they want to make peace quickly. However, we are still fighting them. According to the recent situation, it seems that there is no news from the battlefield, and it seems that the war has stopped. In fact, this is because the Japanese cannot cope with it anymore because it costs them 20 million yuan every day to fight us, which is 7.2 billion yuan a year. In the past, they have already spent more than 80 billion yuan, and the budget for next year will definitely increase by another 80 billion yuan. Japan's annual income is only 8-9 billion yuan. According to the above figures, their war expenses for one year require the income of several years to offset. From this, the Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi said that if Japan's national debt reaches 10 billion yuan, it will inevitably lead to national ruin. Now their national debt has already reached more than 10 billion yuan. In another year, it will reach at least 25 billion yuan. Assuming an annual interest rate of 1%, the annual interest payment alone would be more than 200 million yuan, while their wartime income is only 1 billion yuan per year. If they use their income entirely to pay the interest on war bonds, it is not enough to distribute. Isn't this a big problem in finance? Therefore, they recently changed their cabinet, and the reason is that they want to implement total mobilization. It can be seen that the Japanese economy is already in trouble. If total mobilization can be implemented, they can confiscate people's wealth. I think that the Japanese economic mechanism may collapse as a result. Even if we continue to drag on with them like this, they will have to seek peace in another year. If they don't make peace with us in another year, they will have to get out. Therefore, the final victory has already been placed before our eyes.

Now that we know that the strength of the Japanese is so weak, we don't need to ask others to participate anymore. In the future, we will defeat Japan alone. Who dares to divide our spoils? Therefore, our future is already very bright. The war of resistance has now been going on for eighteen months. At least another eighteen months will be enough to achieve victory. It's just a matter of enduring one or two more years of hardship. After Japan is defeated, what will be China's position? What will East Asia be like? At that time, we will truly be able to stabilize East Asia and truly establish a peaceful order in East Asia. I believe that this ability is entirely in our hands. Heaven has already given us this qualification, and Japan does not have this qualification. Japan's future survival will depend on our support. At the same time, we will still establish the country based on the Three Principles of the People. Even after the revival, we will still be a peaceful country and will not need to invade others. At that time, although we will be the main country in East Asia, we will still be on an equal footing with other countries. Therefore, creating such peace and happiness is a responsibility given to us innately. Only we can take on this responsibility. Now we have all kinds of superior conditions that the Japanese do not have. First, we have the Three Principles of the People. In the past, there were still doubts about the Three Principles of the People in the country, thinking that the Three Principles of the People were not very new and that there were newer principles besides the Three Principles of the People. It should be known that we must be able to realize a principle we believe in before it is useful. If a certain principle is very good, but it cannot be realized until a hundred or five hundred years later, then it cannot save our emergency. Communism may be the highest ideal, but it is not applicable to today's China. If we do it, we will not be able to do it. Therefore, our friends in the Chinese Communist Party are now unanimously defending and implementing the Three Principles of the People. The Japanese have no principles. What principles do Konoe and Hiranuma have? Although we want to learn fascism, they don't know what fascism is all about. Second, we have a leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who is loved and supported by the whole country to lead everyone, while can the Japanese so-called Konoe be considered their leader? Hiranuma is not worth mentioning. Therefore, we are truly fortunate to be born in this era. If we were born a few years earlier, we would not be able to see this era. If we were born a few years later, we would not be able to catch up with this era. Therefore, we Chinese people are the most glorious people in the world. We should be so proud. After these eighteen months of the war of resistance, our overseas Chinese and ambassadors abroad have received such respect from people abroad. I remember when I was eating at the "Shanghai Building" in Paris last April, the owner of the building poured a glass of red wine in front of each guest. At that time, someone asked him why we didn't order wine, why are you pouring wine for us? He said, "Everyone, drink. Because the Chinese army won in Taierzhuang, this is a gift from this building to everyone." So everyone stood up together and raised their glasses and shouted, "Long live the Republic of China!" Therefore, it is said that the Chinese people today are the most glorious people in the world. Now we have been resisting Japan for eighteen months. Which country dares to fight Japan? Although Britain and the United States are strong, they have not come out to fight Japan. Therefore, now is the time for us Chinese people to hold our heads high and breathe. In the future, when we defeat Japan, how much respect will people in the world have for us?

In the past, some students who had studied abroad returned home and thought that everything in the motherland was not good, even that the moon was not as good as the moon in foreign countries. This is belittling oneself. I have also studied abroad, but every time I return home, I always feel that there is no place in the world that can compare to China. Take the Soviet Union, for example. Although it has a vast territory and abundant resources, because of its location, the atmosphere is too cold. Our China is much better. Take Chongqing, for example. Some people say that Chongqing's weather is not good, but I think Chongqing's climate is too good. In weather like today, Japanese planes cannot invade the sky. Isn't this a natural protection? None of you have been to Europe. What is so good about Europe? In my opinion, it's just that artificial organization is a little more than ours, but we can immediately start construction on this point. There is nothing we cannot do.

The largest country in Europe, except for the Soviet Union, if Eastern and Western Europe are counted together, has a population of just over 70 million, and its resources are not as good as China. Britain has a population of 46 million, and France and Italy both have a population of only 42 million. In the past, France's population had decreased a lot. Later, the French government felt that this would be very dangerous, so the government encouraged births, but as a result, there has been no increase to this day. This is purely natural. As for Germany and Italy, they are invading other countries because their domestic resources are not enough to distribute. Our China has abundant natural resources, a large population, and a vast territory. It's just that we used to be too careless in our lives and didn't know how to unite and work hard. Now we use the Three Principles of the People to raise everyone's spirits. Then the Chinese revolution will definitely be successful. For example, Czechoslovakia, before it was divided a few months ago, had a population of over 10 million. Among the small European countries, it was considered a strong country. They said that China has been resisting Japan for a year and can still maintain it. It is truly an amazing country, and they also said that China is not only a country, but also a strong country. And at present, China is already a strong country, but China itself does not yet know it. Now a few months have passed, and we still exist, but where has Czechoslovakia gone? Because Czechoslovakia is a small country, and its endowment is not enough. Some people say that China wants to purchase military equipment. This is a good opportunity. Now Czechoslovakia's heavy military equipment has no chance to be used. It can be seen that our natural endowment is absolutely incomparable to other countries. We should increase our self-confidence so as not to fail our endowment. Finally, I would like to conclude by quoting a sentence from my old friend Mr. Chiang Pai-li, which is "In a thousand words and ten thousand sentences, I only tell everyone one sentence: China has a way." (The End)

### Chamberlain Departs Italy and Returns Home; British and French Foreign Ministers to Meet Today; Rome Announces Meeting Progressed Well; Both Sides Willing to Uphold Peaceful Policies

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Chamberlain departed Rome this afternoon for London. Mussolini personally went to the station to see him off. The two walked back and forth together inside the station for several minutes, smiling and talking. Their expressions were visibly more intimate than when Chamberlain arrived here a few days ago. Ciano and British Ambassador Perth followed behind the two, also in a friendly manner.

[Haitong, Rome, 14th] Local officials stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain met with the Egyptian and Iraqi ambassadors to Rome yesterday afternoon. At 11:09 this morning, Chamberlain boarded a train via Paris to return home. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, along with all cabinet members, leaders of the Fascist Party, and military and political figures, as well as the ambassadors from the United States, Ireland, South Africa, and others, were at the station to see him off. Crowds lined the streets, cheering loudly. British Foreign Minister Halifax departed Rome at 7:40 this morning for Geneva to meet with French Foreign Minister Bonnet. After a short stay, he will rush back to London to attend the British cabinet meeting on the 18th, at which Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a report on his visit to Rome.

[Haitong, London, 14th] It is announced here that Duke Halifax will arrive in Geneva from Rome tomorrow morning and meet with French Foreign Minister Bonnet on the same day. Political circles here believe that the meeting between the British and French foreign ministers is extremely important because the two sides will exchange opinions on the results of the British-Italian talks.

[Haitong, Vienna, 14th] According to an announcement issued by the Foreign Ministry last night, the prime ministers of Britain and Italy, as well as the foreign ministers of the two countries, held a meeting here. Various current issues, especially those regarding the two countries, were brought up for discussion. Both sides exchanged opinions with sincerity and agreed to abide by the agreement of April 16, 1938, and to maintain friendly relations between the two countries. They are also willing to expedite the conclusion of a special agreement to amend said agreement. It was noted that both countries expressed their determination to maintain peaceful policies during the talks.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 14th] There are rumors that Italian troops have been concentrated on the border of French Somaliland. French diplomatic and military circles have heard nothing of this.

### Rumors of Italian Troops Concentrating in East Africa; Britain Decides to Assist if France is Invaded; Germany Also to Undertake Military Actions

[Reuters, Poti, 13th] According to information received here, a large Italian army has concentrated in Modera, Jawliro, and Sado (near Hargeisa), adjacent to the borders of French and British Somaliland. It is rumored that many locals from the Harar province have been conscripted and incorporated into the local army. Upon receiving this report, necessary steps have been taken here.

[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] According to reliable sources, Britain has today explicitly told Italy that if a conflict occurs between France and Italy, Britain will firmly assist France. Mussolini assured Chamberlain that Italy has no intention of conflict with France, but these "loudly proclaimed" British-Italian talks have clearly failed, and the result will be that Chamberlain abandons his "appeasement" policy. This is because Mussolini has demands regarding the Mediterranean and refuses to withdraw troops from Spain. The opinions of the two leaders on the Spanish war seem to be most contradictory. The Italian prime minister hoped that Britain could recognize the rebels as a belligerent group, as this would block the port of the government forces. The British prime minister repeatedly pressed Mussolini to fulfill his promise to withdraw troops. It is heard that the Italian side expressed to Chamberlain and Halifax that the Spanish war could end "within a few weeks," after which troops could be withdrawn.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent stated that London officials are not paying attention to the German anti-Dutch movement. It is widely rumored that Hitler will take military action, with targets including Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Memel, Danzig, the Netherlands, and Belgium. British authorities believe that Hitler's recent policies have caused panic on all sides, which is regrettable. Although Britain does not have treaty relations with the Netherlands as it does with Belgium, the historical relations between the two countries and the geographical situation of the Netherlands make the interests of the two countries even closer. It is rumored that Germany is intensifying economic pressure on the Netherlands, but there is no official confirmation. It is believed that Germany will not take military action against the Netherlands.

[Haitong, The Hague, 14th] It is announced here that regarding the shooting incidents at the Amsterdam and The Hague German legations, the police have thoroughly investigated, but external reports are somewhat exaggerated. The German legation in The Hague is connected to a building not inhabited by legation staff. A gunshot suddenly entered, injuring the person in the room. The police retrieved the bullet. Also, the window of the German consulate in Amsterdam was indeed shot through a small hole by a gun played with by a child.

### Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to Visit Yugoslavia; Yugoslav Officials Say No Agreement Will Be Signed; Deny Goering Will Visit Yugoslavia

[Haitong, Yugoslavia, 14th] On the evening of the 5th of this month, authoritative sources here announced that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will visit Yugoslavia on the 20th of this month, first going to Brioni for a two-day hunt, and then to Belgrade. Officials stated that Ciano's visit is of a private nature, to reciprocate the visit to Italy by Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović last year. Therefore, no new agreement will be signed. Furthermore, the rumor that German General Goering will also visit Yugoslavia has been denied by officials.

### Several Divisions of Spanish Rebel Army Cross the Ebro River; Other Units Also Advancing; Report from Burgos

[Reuters, Burgos, 13th] After fierce fighting, the rebel army has occupied Tortosa at the mouth of the Ebro River. Several divisions of Moroccan Legion soldiers, under the command of General Yague, crossed the Ebro River and the land on the south bank, and the performance of the cavalry in this large encirclement operation was also very important. Afterward, the infantry advanced to Piera, on the Valencia-Barcelona highway, located ten miles north of Tortosa. Currently, the three highways to Tortosa are controlled by the rebel army. According to frontline reports, the rebel army is continuing to advance rapidly in all directions. On the northern front, the Ugalde Group, under the command of General Monasterio, is advancing northeast along the Seo de Urgel highway and has occupied Perna and Coll de Ter. Also, the Amadeo Iturralde division, under the command of General Garcia Valiño, has occupied Monfalco, less than eight miles from Cervera. The Navarre divisions, commanded by General Solchaga, are operating from the Montblanc area and are advancing along the highway, occupying Riudavella and the Sierra de Codony. They are only four miles from Valls and its important factories and airfields.

### New York Financial Circles Believe Large-Scale War Will Not Occur, Based on Roosevelt's Arms Expansion Message

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Wall Street figures have concluded two points from President Roosevelt's arms expansion message to Congress. First, that Mr. Roosevelt's request for funds in the 1940 fiscal year is not large, indicating that a large-scale war will not occur. Second, that Mr. Roosevelt's proposal to expand the air force could increase the business of aircraft companies by 40% compared to 1938. Experts believe that countries not subject to U.S. neutrality laws will purchase American aircraft in large quantities, greatly developing the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry.

### British Prime Minister's Visit to the Vatican; Pope Expresses Gratification

[Reuters, Vatican City, 13th] Today's "Osservatore Romano" published a statement regarding Chamberlain and Halifax's visit to the Pope, stating that the Pope sent his regards to the British Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and expressed his gratification for their visit to the Vatican City. The Pope expressed particular concern for the recent situation of the British royal family and wished the British royal family prosperity and the British Empire flourishing. A number of issues concerning the relationship between papal jurisdiction and the British Empire were discussed, and satisfaction was expressed with the existing good relationship.

### Hungary Joins Anti-Communist Pact; Signing in Hungarian Capital Next Week

[Central News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 13th] The formal signing ceremony of the Anti-Communist Pact is scheduled to take place here next week.

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] It was officially announced today that Hungary has accepted the invitation to participate in the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. Berlin was very satisfied with the news. The Berlin Evening News stated, "Those who participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact must not only understand the dangers of Bolshevism but also know how to combat it. This cannot be achieved through empty words or resolutions. The entire nation must have an iron will. The Anti-Comintern Pact has no imperialistic goals; its sole task is to create world peace and order to avoid the threat of Bolshevism."

### British Imperial Air Route from West Africa to South America Will Not Be Established Due to Opposition from Spanish Rebel Forces

[Haitong News Agency, London, 14th] General Franco, the leader of the Spanish rebel forces, has refused British planes permission to fly over Spanish territory under his control, because Britain has not yet formally recognized the Burgos government. Therefore, Britain has decided not to establish the Imperial air route from Britain, via British West Africa, to South America.

### Heavy Fog in San Francisco Bay; Five Inmates Attempt to Escape by Swimming; Two Shot, Three Recaptured

[Reuters, San Francisco, 13th] San Francisco Bay was shrouded in heavy fog yesterday, the worst in years. Five inmates at Alcatraz Prison attempted to escape by swimming to the opposite shore. Prison guards were alerted, immediately issued a warning, and opened fire. The notorious kidnapper Berg, serving an unspecified sentence, was shot in the head and seriously injured. Another notorious criminal, Stanfield, was shot in the leg. The other three were also captured and returned, it is said.

### Japan's War Against China: Hu Shih, Ambassador to the United States

Editor's Note: This selection is from a public speech given in New York in December by Dr. Hu Shih, our Ambassador to the United States. The original text was lengthy and contained many historical references. Due to space constraints, we have translated a summary to share with our readers.

If someone were to ask me, "How would you describe the current situation in China in a single sentence?" I would answer without hesitation, "China is struggling for its life in a sea of blood!" Our opponent is the third strongest naval power and the fourth or fifth strongest army in the world. We have been fighting them for sixteen months now. Our casualties exceed one million. Vast territories are being swallowed up by the invaders. Almost all of our well-known industrial, commercial, educational, cultural, and transportation centers have either been ravaged or occupied by them. Our people have abandoned their homes, fields, shops, towns, and villages and are fleeing for their lives. They have no shelter, no medicine, and often not even the simplest necessities. There are no fewer than sixty million such people. And every day, countless innocent 'non-combatants' are brutally murdered by the enemy army. In light of this, is China not struggling for its life in a sea of blood?

After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, many of our people and leaders experienced temporary hesitation and even despair. But that period of hesitation was also a period of great determination. Our leaders soon came to the conclusion that there was no possibility of peace for China at the present time, because there was no opportunity for peace that we could reasonably accept. After carefully considering all the difficulties and possible changes, our leaders firmly decided to continue to pursue the policy of resistance and maintain the war effort.

When announcing this new determination, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically pointed out the following: (1) China will continue to pursue its national policy of protracted resistance; (2) the war has now effectively spread to the entire country. The enemy has penetrated inland, and both time and geography are in our favor; (3) the resistance over the past sixteen months has prevented the enemy from advancing further west, allowing us to develop transportation and logistics in the vast rear areas and to relocate some industries to the rear; (4) to hope for final victory, we must endure the greatest difficulties and sacrifices; (5) the current war of resistance against Japan must be regarded as a revolutionary war, similar in nature to the American War of Independence, the revolutionary wars in France and the Soviet Union, and the Turkish War of Liberation. In this "revolutionary war," the people's spirit of struggle will surely lead to final victory. The above is a solemn declaration of China's new determination.

Regardless of how people in the world may feel about our new determination, I can honestly say to you that a nation that has already sacrificed one million lives and is determined to fight for its survival, making the greatest sacrifices, cannot be blamed for placing its hopes on what may seem like a mere pipe dream. In the past sixteen months, we have experienced terrible but also extremely valuable wartime experiences. Our determination is based on this experience. In these terrible sixteen months, we have clearly seen that our soldiers and officers are brave and heroic, and they have made the greatest sacrifices. Our people have endured losses and suffering without complaining to their government, and there is no doubt about the unity and solidarity of the entire nation (including the areas temporarily under enemy military occupation). We also know that our enemy is indeed feeling the burden of a prolonged war. Japan's finances are on the verge of collapse. It is now using all of its military strength, and it is fighting a nation that it never considered capable of fighting. It is very anxious because a significant portion of its stockpiled military supplies, originally intended to strike against its reinforced enemy, has already been depleted. Therefore, as long as we can persevere and exhaust the enemy, it is not impossible to achieve victory.

During the American War of Independence (1776-1781), the circumstances of Washington's "Continental Army" were not much better than those of the Chinese army today. In fact, all "revolutionary wars" involve a war between a people with ardent ideals but poor equipment and a well-equipped regular army of an oppressor or aggressor nation. But without exception, final victory almost always goes to those who embrace ideals and courage and can overcome the greatest difficulties and sacrifices.

Furthermore, the success of the American Revolution was due not only to the protracted resistance of the revolutionary army but also to an equally important factor: the assistance of international forces at the time. For China to achieve ultimate victory, it must rely on two things: First, it must continue to resist; there is no other choice but to continue to resist. Second, in its protracted resistance, one day the international situation will be favorable to China and unfavorable to Japan. China does not expect any sympathetic nation to help it fight, but it has the right to expect the men and women of all democratic and peace-loving nations to prohibit the supply of weapons to that country, which is unanimously recognized by more than fifty countries as a destroyer of world peace. I can say without hesitation that this country is "Public Enemy Number One" in the international community!

### Large Numbers of American Warships Sail to the Atlantic, Taking Precautions While Passing Through the Panama Canal; Details of Transit Prohibited from Disclosure

[Associated Press, Cristobal, Panama Canal Zone, 14th] Eighty-nine U.S. Pacific Fleet warships (including several of the largest battleships) sailed from the Pacific Ocean into the 45-mile long Panama Canal, bound for the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Naval authorities took precautions as the ships passed through the canal, instructing reporters not to disclose details of the transit, but allowing them to comment on its effects. Army soldiers were also prohibited from approaching the canal, and army planes monitored the airspace at all times. The aircraft carrier USS Lexington, displacing 33,000 tons, led the way, departing Balboa at the western end of the canal at 14:59 hours.

Brief Commentary

### Sudden Increase in Tension in Europe

Sudden Increase in Tension in Europe -- What demonstrates the sudden increase in tension in Europe? First, the failure of the Anglo-Italian Rome talks; second, Germany and Italy's aggressive tactics to disturb Europe and Africa.

The Anglo-Italian Rome talks failed because they produced no results. But whose failure was it? First, we must see that Mussolini gained nothing from these talks. Second, we must see that Chamberlain did not continue to yield during these talks. Seeing these two points, we can understand that it was the aggressor, Italy, who failed. So what impact will the failure of these talks have? First, under the influence of the broad public opinion at home and the calls for international justice, especially the progressive policies of the United States, the Chamberlain government has begun to correct the policy of appeasement that followed the Munich Conference, and it is now possible that its attitude towards fascist aggressors will no longer be one of submission. Second, the Chamberlain government will gain domestic and international support, especially alleviating the anti-government fervor at home. If Chamberlain's appeasement policy can be further corrected, then the prestige of the Chamberlain government will hopefully be consolidated. Third, Anglo-French cooperation will become closer, and the situation in which the German-Italian aggressive axis opposes them will become more serious. Fourth, military expansion will progress rapidly, and the cries of impending war will become even more rampant. In particular, Germany and Italy will make greater preparations for aggression, and even launch larger wars of aggression. The opposition between the democratic peace front and the fascist aggressive front will become more obvious. In particular, the democratic peace front will rapidly become stronger, completing the steps to sanction the aggressors.

Now, the European situation has suddenly become serious due to the failure of the Rome talks. This is clearly a result of even more arrogant intimidation tactics by the German and Italian aggressors. In particular, while British Foreign Secretary Halifax is in Geneva meeting with French Foreign Minister Bonnet, events such as the concentration of Italian troops on the Bulgarian border, Germany's intensified aggression against the Netherlands, and even all kinds of covert activities to sow discord between Britain and France are bound to occur and are not surprising. It should be noted that this was expected when the peace-loving and democratic countries truly began to implement a tough plan against Germany and Italy. This tense and serious situation cannot intimidate any truly peace-loving country. What should be noted today is that the attitudes of Britain and France should become clearer, and even neutral countries such as Romania, Poland, the United States, the Netherlands, and Belgium should not allow Germany and Italy to touch them in the slightest. They should declare their opposition to aggression with force. Only then, even if the European situation is in great danger, is there still a chance of salvation.

### British Perceptions of the Sino-Japanese War

— (Continued from yesterday's London dispatch) Shudi [End]

The Daily Herald, with a circulation of over two million copies, is a well-known organ of the Labour Party. It is sympathetic to China, but sometimes likes to publish rumors that China will compromise through German and Italian relations, or doubts the consolidation of China's so-called "united front." The News Chronicle, which speaks for the Liberal Party, generally has an attitude very similar to that of Liberal Party leader Lloyd George's eloquence, strongly sympathizing with China and criticizing the incompetence of the current British government's policies. The Daily Mail is a newspaper of the opposition faction within the British Conservative Party. In general, its attitude is similar to that of The Times, the difference being in the writing. The Manchester Guardian's attitude is more religious than that of any other newspaper. Its correspondent in China is probably very close to the Church.

Parliament

The two houses of the British Parliament are a powerful source of public opinion sympathetic to China. Especially in the House of Commons, whenever questions about the Far East are raised, the sympathy for China is almost always completely clear. Each time, it forces the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who is responsible for answering questions, to a position where he has no room to retreat. Here, we must recall the voices and stances of many politicians who sympathize with China. Among them are the great orator Lloyd George and Lord Cecil, Lords Sidney and Cripps, the only Communist Member of Parliament, Gallacher, and female Member of Parliament, Wilkinson, and so on.

Aid to China Movement

The so-called "Aid to China Fund" is the most important organization in the open aid to China movement. Under its promotion, it has organized many demonstrations and marches, screened several films, held many gatherings, raised many medicines, and done some practical work. In addition, the largest in scale is the London Mayor's Relief Fund, which regularly calls on people to donate money to help Chinese refugees, and advertisements are regularly published in various publications throughout the United Kingdom. Under the organization of the "Trade Union," British dockworkers have launched several strikes refusing to load and unload goods for Japanese ships. The movement to boycott Japanese goods is also being promoted. Almost every few days, there is a case of a shop being fined by the court in a disgusted tone for disguising Japanese goods for sale, and this store is rejected by people in a short period of time.

Articles and Books

Recalling the articles on the Sino-Japanese war that have had a significant impact on the British people's perceptions over the past year, the first thing that comes to mind is more than ten powerful editorials in The Times over the past year. Next to come to mind are Mr. Churchill's insightful articles in the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, and then the articles in The Times by its correspondent in Beijing after personally visiting the guerrilla areas in the border provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Chahar, Shanxi, and Henan in China. As for books, the most influential is the recent "China" by world-renowned journalist Muriel, followed by Mr. Snow's "Red Star Over China" and Ms. Smedley's "China Fights Back." These articles and books, together with other scattered articles and books and magazines, have had a significant impact on the British people's views on the Sino-Japanese war today, forming the following picture: ——

A country larger than the United States, with a quarter of the world's most hard-working population, is fighting under the leadership of a great world hero in the most heroic, even all-out, and heroic sacrifice. The scenery of this country is as beautiful as the landscape paintings of Mi Fu and Wang Wei (this is the impression planted during the exhibition last year). The houses are elegant in the style of pavilions and towers, and the food is the best in the world (the Cantonese restaurants near Oxford Street in London are considered representative). What is especially important is that this nation is almost innately peace-loving (Lord Cecil said: "In the past hundred years, China has not waged a war of aggression").

However, this is only the obvious side: this side is created by more than a year of resistance. On the other side, there is also a temporarily hidden dark side. That dark side will immediately reappear as soon as China begins to compromise or submit: that is: disorganization, everyone is individualistic, bandits are everywhere, and even nature has changed, with endless wind and sand, people living in caves, and the Yellow River flooding everywhere like a monster. Together with the constantly crowded refugees running around, like the ants at the entrance of the Shanghai concession that often appear in movies.

### League of Nations Council to Hold Regular Meeting Tomorrow; Chinese Ambassador Visits French Foreign Minister to Discuss China's Appeal

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] The 103rd regular session of the League of Nations Council is scheduled to be held on the 16th of this month. The Chinese government's appeal regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute has been included in the agenda of this session, but it may not be submitted for discussion. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, recently visited Foreign Minister Bonnet to discuss this issue. It is reported that the League of Nations Council adopted a report on September 30 last year, advocating that member states should implement sanctions against Japan separately. The Chinese representative accepted this report on the condition that the appeal filed by his government would be kept on the agenda for discussion at any time.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] As the League of Nations Council is about to meet, the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement has sent a telegram to the general meeting, requesting that the chairman, Sir Cecil, and Mr. Coddington, following the example of the statement made for Spain, issue a statement on the League of Nations' minimum responsibility towards China, and urge the League of Nations to accept China's legitimate and reasonable demands.

British and American Sanctions Against Japan Clearly Taking a Step Further

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 14th] It is increasingly believed in Washington that defense plans are actually dominated by the Far Eastern dispute—rather than the European dispute. In the message that President Roosevelt submitted to Congress, he only solemnly pointed out that the United States should avoid being drawn into the vortex of Europe, but did not express the same view regarding the Far East. If the United States participates in the Far Eastern war, it will mostly begin with economic sanctions against Japan, and in fact, this sanctions plan is clearly taking a step further. The New York Daily News stated that the United Kingdom and the United States are actually at war with Japan, because the two countries are now aiding China's war against Japan.

[Haitong News Agency, Canberra, 14th] It is rumored that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will launch an economic war against Japan. However, Australian Prime Minister Lyons said in Leicester yesterday that he had not confirmed this. Mr. Lyons said that the Australian government had not received any information from the British government on this matter, so it had not been asked to explain its attitude towards it.

[Reuters, London, 14th] General Sir Hubert Gough wrote to the Financial Times today, stating, "The current situation in China will destroy all of Britain's commerce and the interests of the British Empire in the Far East. It is time for the government to deal sternly with this danger. Our investments in China are suffering heavy losses, national income is decreasing, unemployment problems are increasing, and the people's tax burden is becoming heavier. Although we are extremely unwilling to take strong action, the government, for our benefit and safety, must have a limit to its tolerance and cannot allow others to go any further. Protesting to Japan is ineffective, so the government must take a more decisive attitude, otherwise, in addition to commercial losses, it may endanger our territories in Asia and the Pacific (including India) and threaten the existence of Australia. But today, the cards being played are not entirely in the hands of anti-communist countries. We still hold a very strong 'trump card,' even the strongest one."

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The Daily Mail published a dispatch from its correspondent in Tianjin on its front page yesterday, describing the various events in which Japan is hindering British commerce in China. The correspondent said that the general opinion of foreign businessmen in North China is that if Britain does not find a way to stop Japan's unfair oppression, then British trade with China will decline.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Donations to the British China Relief Fund have now reached 163,000 pounds. The secretary of the China Relief Fund, Gordon Thompson, said that donations are pouring in every day, but the need is also increasing day by day.

### Refugees in Devastated Areas of Huizhou, Boluo, Etc. Are Starving, Cold, and Dying Daily; Relief Stations in the Interior Are Overcrowded with Refugees in Extreme Misery; Joint Relief Committee Resolved at Yesterday's Regular Meeting to Allocate $2,000 to Aid Boluo

Since the enemy withdrew from Huizhou, Zengcheng, Boluo, etc., the areas have been ravaged and the disaster situation is extremely severe. The Huizhou Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has previously dispatched a total of 40,000 yuan in relief funds and over a hundred batches of medicines to various places for relief and rescue. Recent investigations by the chamber, based on reports from relief stations in the interior, indicate that the refugees are extremely miserable, and the number of people is extremely crowded. It is estimated that the Huizhou station currently provides relief to more than 5,000 people every day, the Boluo station more than 1,000 people, the Pingshan station more than 1,300 people, the Baimanghua station more than 1,050 people, the Danshui station about 7,000 people, the Zhenlong station more than 800 people, the Xinhu station more than 180 people, the Jiazipu station more than 1,400 people, the Xiayong station more than 1,200 people, and the Tiantangwei station more than 400 people. The remaining Pingtan, Hengli, Renshan, and other stations have not reported due to the remoteness of the roads. In addition to obtaining food, the returning refugees are destitute, with nothing left. Clothes and bedding have either been burned or looted. Moreover, many are suffering from illness due to displacement and wandering. The medicines distributed by the chamber are difficult to adequately provide for due to the vastness of the disaster area. Therefore, the number of deaths in various places has been increasing daily. It is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will have mercy on the plight of the refugees and donate cotton clothes, hemp bags, and various medicines. It is especially hoped that charitable organizations will deeply engage in relief efforts, which would bring immeasurable merit to tens of thousands of refugees.

The Joint Relief Committee of All Circles in Hong Kong for South China Refugees held a special executive meeting at the Women's War Relief Association at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Those present included Liu Qingxuan, Li Jianfeng, Lin Peisheng, He Weiwu, Lu Guomian, Lin Ciming, Lu Fu, Zhou Xingchi, and many others. (1) Matters for report: The General Affairs Department reported receiving letters from Tung Wah Hospital, Guangdong Provincial Bank, Bank of China, Ye Yinqi, Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, 453rd Brigade, and Buddhist Relief Association. After the reports were completed, the following items were discussed: (1) The Boluo Refugee Relief Committee requested funding for relief. Lin Ciming, the representative of the Investigation Team from the Guanglian Chamber of Commerce, reported on his visit to Xu Rangcheng, the chairman of the Huizhou Chamber of Commerce. Subsequently, the Relief Team reported that it was deemed impossible to go to the area to distribute relief and asked whether the conference could transfer the funds to the Huizhou Chamber of Commerce to send representatives to distribute relief. After deliberation by all parties, it was decided to allocate 2,000 yuan in local currency for relief and send a letter to the representative of the association requesting that a list of the required medicines and the quantity of cotton clothing be provided to the conference for processing. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

### Hung Hom Gillies Avenue: Five Robbers Commit Armed Robbery in Broad Daylight, Breaking into Second Floor, Tying Up Everyone, and Looting Valuables Worth Over Three Hundred Dollars

Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, a case of armed robbery by five robbers occurred at No. 33 Gillies Avenue, Hung Hom, on the second floor. The tenant of the building, named Ou Yao, lives with his wife, two concubines, and several children. Also residing there are his niece, Lu Ping (13 years old), and a refugee who came to Hong Kong and is staying in the building. In addition, there are two maids, making a total of more than ten people living together. Ou is a foreman at Kowloon Dockyard, working in the new ship grinding department. Yesterday at 1 PM, after lunch, he returned to the dockyard to work. Only Ou's first wife, Li Zhang, second concubine, Chen Ying, third concubine, Zhang Yulian, and eleven children and women remained in the building. His daughter, Ou Yunhua (21 years old), was calculating accounts in the back hall, while others were chatting idly. At this moment, the building door was ajar, when suddenly,

Five Robbers

rushed into the building and immediately brandished weapons at everyone. The robbers were holding a gun and five sharp swords. Seeing the robbers with deadly weapons, everyone in the building was terrified and trembling. The robbers then tied everyone up with their hands behind their backs and stuffed their mouths with rags to prevent them from shouting. They were all imprisoned in the second room, guarded by one robber, while the other four robbers searched the front room. They snatched a gold ring and a coat from the hanger, two pairs of gold earrings, four hand darts. The gold-plated chains worn by Li Zhang and Zhang Yulian, as well as one gold ring each, were also stolen. Fortunately, Ou's second concubine, Chen Ying, was clever. When she saw the robbers entering the building, fearing that she could not escape, she secretly took off the gold chain and a gold ring she was wearing and hid them in her mouth, so they were not discovered by the robbers. It was also fortunate that Ou Yao had taken the safe key with him when he went to work, so the deposits in the safe were unharmed. The robbers were in the building

Searching Freely

for half an hour before carrying the stolen items out the door, going downstairs, and escaping. When the robbers were about to leave, they threatened the people in the building not to report to the police station, otherwise they would come back next time and stab them to death. After the robbers fled, the girl Lu Ping untied everyone. Ou's third concubine, Zhang Yulian, informed Ou at Kowloon Dockyard, who went to the Hung Hom Police Station to report the case. The officer on duty at the station, upon receiving the report, dispatched Chinese and Western officers with a large number of police detectives to the scene to investigate and searched pedestrians at nearby key traffic points, hoping to find the robbers. As a result, nothing was found and notifications were sent to police stations in various districts to file the case and

Issue an Arrest Warrant

to bring the robbers to justice. The stolen gold jewelry and valuables included two gold-plated chains, worth about one hundred dollars; three gold rings, worth over forty dollars; four hand darts, worth about eighty dollars; two pairs of gold earrings, worth about thirty dollars; and other silver items, totaling about three hundred dollars. It was also found that the robbers had prepared a letter in advance, addressed to "Second Wife of the Ou Household, For Your Review," intending to use it to trick their way into the building. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the building, the door was ajar, allowing them to enter directly. Before leaving, they left the letter in the building. It was later collected by the police detective as evidence.

### Jewish Refugees: Two Hundred Pass Through Hong Kong

The Italian cruise ship "Victoria" passed through Hong Kong en route to Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying about two hundred Jewish refugees. Except for two people who went ashore to find relatives and friends in Hong Kong to find a way, all of them continued to Shanghai on the original ship. Mr. Lan Du, the owner of the Jimmy Restaurant in Hong Kong, has been working hard to help Jewish refugees. That day, he went to the ship himself and distributed about one hundred blankets to the refugees. The Jewish Refugee Relief Association of Hong Kong also sent people to provide assistance and guidance. The plight of this group of refugees is not as severe as the previous one. Some even traveled in first-class cabins. However, there are already a large number of such refugees in Shanghai, and the issue of sustaining them has become very difficult. With the addition of this group, the number will reach two thousand. Without raising a large sum of money, solving the problem of food and housing will be extremely difficult.

### Hong Kong Government Pays Attention to Citizen Nutrition: Commission Appointed to Investigate

The Hong Kong government is paying close attention to the nutritional issues of citizens, believing that malnutrition affects public health. In order to study solutions, the government has appointed a Nutritional Investigation Committee to investigate nutrition issues and study the food rations that Hong Kong citizens should have. The list of members was published in the Gazette as follows: Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke; Chief Justice Sir Atholl MacGregor; Mr. Li Yingtang; Dr. Welch; Dr. Ross; Dr. Li Zuyi; Mr. Chihlan Chiao; and Mrs. Hu Fengyi.

### Happens Daily: Another Fishing Boat Robbed by Pirates, Boat Owner Also Captured

The burning and looting of fishing boats by warships off the coast of South China has been happening frequently lately. Yesterday, fisherman Li Xiyao reported to the Fishermen's Association about being robbed by pirates. At the end of last month, Li and several partners sailed out to sea to fish. In the waters off Wanshanwei, they suddenly encountered a warship and the entire boat was taken by the pirates. Only six partners escaped. Li himself was also captured. It was not until five days ago that he managed to escape by chance in the waters of Beikou. He sailed back to Aberdeen the day before yesterday. The loss in this incident was dozens of piculs of fish, several hundred dollars in cash and jewelry. According to Li Xiyao, a fisherman from Dianbai, his original fleet of ten fishing boats was burned by warships in September of the year before last. Now he has been robbed again, truly a case of one misfortune after another.

### Shek Kip Mei Village: Fire Last Night, Three Wooden Houses Burned Down

Yesterday at 6:00 PM, a fire broke out in Shek Kip Mei Village, Sham Shui Po. The area is mostly low wooden houses built by villagers themselves for residence. The villagers, due to unknown carelessness, suddenly caught fire, which spread quickly everywhere. In an instant, it had spread to other places. The villagers fled in panic. Upon receiving the report, the fire department dispatched fire engines to the scene for rescue. The fire was extinguished in about half an hour. As a result, three wooden houses were burned down, the fire area covering fifty feet wide and thirty feet deep.

### Governor Announces Milk Pasteurization: Implementation Changed to April 1st

The Legislative Council resolved a few days ago that the new milk pasteurization ordinance would be implemented on January 1st of this year. All milk must be pasteurized by high-temperature sterilization before it can be sold. However, according to yesterday's Gazette, the ordinance was postponed to April 1st. The notice reads as follows: "By order of the Governor in Council, due to special circumstances, it is deemed that the supplementary ordinance is not suitable for immediate implementation, as it may conflict with the content of the main ordinance. However, the Governor in Council has decided to postpone the supplementary ordinance to April 1st."

### Police Conduct Raids Night After Night to Arrest Prostitutes in Secret Dens: Multiple Cases Already Cracked, Severe Penalties Imposed, Authorities Determined to Eradicate Prostitution

After the implementation of the ban on prostitution in Hong Kong, private prostitution is still rampant. Secret dens of private prostitutes are everywhere in Hong Kong and Kowloon. People concerned about social welfare are deeply saddened by this. The genuine abolition of prostitution should be realized in Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong does not remain a major stain.

Private Prostitution Affects Health

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many prostitutes from the war zone have moved to Hong Kong. In addition, many poor women who have fled to Hong Kong have been lured into prostitution by pimps due to economic pressure. There were already a large number of private prostitutes in Hong Kong. Adding to this, the newly arrived "goddesses" has caused the numbers to swell. With so many private prostitutes, youths with weak awareness are often attracted to patronize them, resulting in many contracting venereal diseases. The large number of venereal disease doctors in Hong Kong and the brisk sales of venereal disease medicines can be used to gauge the state of private prostitution in Hong Kong. It is recalled that the Hong Kong naval authorities previously ordered strict prohibition of sailors patronizing prostitutes due to a sharp increase in sailors contracting diseases, showing how private prostitution can affect public health. According to statistics from the Department of Health, the number of venereal disease cases in Hong Kong last year increased several times compared to the past. The reason is the prevalence of private prostitution.

Government Authorities Strictly Crack Down on Private Prostitutes

The problem of private prostitution in Hong Kong has now attracted serious attention from government authorities. The government has now made the greatest determination to strictly crack down on private prostitution, striving to achieve complete eradication. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. Hallifax, is extremely vigilant in detecting organizations that traffic women and secret dens that harbor prostitutes, hoping to arrest them all. Multiple cases have already been cracked. The police are also paying close attention to private brothels (i.e., brothels that only arrange for customers to call prostitutes from outside) and gathering places for private prostitutes in various districts of Hong Kong, preparing to wipe them out in one fell swoop and remove the big stain on Hong Kong.

Police Mobilize to Arrest Private Dens

Regarding the crackdown on prostitution, the police authorities have reportedly formulated a complete plan, preparing to completely eradicate private dens and fundamentally prohibit private prostitution within a set time. The police have already mobilized, going to various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon for patrols. In the past week, multiple cases have already been cracked. In order to prevent pimps from resorting to all sorts of cunning tricks, the police have recently focused on arresting the pimps who run these dens and imposing severe penalties, so that those engaged in shameful business cannot buy people to take the blame and must suffer criminal punishment themselves. Because the police have been frequently mobilized night after night, the private brothel areas in the Central and Western districts have been in a state of fear. Pimps and private prostitutes huddle on the streets, returning to their dens only after the police leave, in an extremely embarrassing situation.

### Chairman of the Firewood Merchants Association Talks: No Fear of Firewood Shortage, Current Firewood Supply Sufficient for One Month, Prices Not Stable Purely Due to High Freight Costs

Although the firewood shortage problem in Hong Kong is gradually easing, and prices are gradually falling, with one dollar able to buy over sixty catties, it is still far from the past when one dollar could buy one hundred catties. In order to make everyone understand the current situation of firewood in Hong Kong, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Fang Meiquan, chairman of the Firewood Workers Union, yesterday to inquire about everything. According to him, there is currently no need to worry about the source of firewood in Hong Kong being cut off, because there are currently many ships coming to Hong Kong from various regions that are dedicated to transporting firewood. There are four ships traveling to and from Haiphong, five from Guangzhou, four from Sandakan, and six from Singapore. Each ship can transport over 10,000 piculs to Hong Kong. There are also small shipments from Shantou, Macau, and other places. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the source being cut off. As for prices, the reason why they have not returned to normal despite such a large amount of incoming goods is purely due to high freight costs. For example, transporting firewood from Haiphong to Hong Kong costs one dollar for over one hundred catties at the local wholesale price, but the cost of transporting each bundle of firewood to Hong Kong is as high as four cents. Adding various necessary expenses, the cost is still high. When firewood is released in Hong Kong, it only costs over seventy catties per dollar, while residents who buy it retail from firewood shops only get over sixty catties. Mr. Fang also said that the current firewood supply in Hong Kong is sufficient for the entire city's residents for one month, and sources from various places are continuously being shipped to Hong Kong. Therefore, although the Lunar New Year is approaching and firewood sales are higher than usual, prices should remain stable and not rise sharply.

### Flying Hotel Arrives in Hong Kong on February 1st

A recent report states that the first Pan American clipper of the new Boeing type will leave the United States at the end of this month, crossing the Pacific Ocean and arriving in Hong Kong on February 1st. This initial flight is purely for testing purposes and will not carry mail, cargo, or passengers. If there are no obstructions, it is expected that regular flights can begin on February 18th. In the future, there will be one flight per week between San Francisco and Hong Kong. Since the loss of the Hawaiian Clipper, Pan American has had insufficient aircraft allocation, causing frequent delays on the Pacific route. This issue can now be resolved. The new aircraft weighs 42.5 tons and can carry 84 passengers. After its maiden voyage, it will be the world's largest civilian aircraft, twice the size of the China Clipper, costing 400,000 US dollars.

### Luo Xuchu Asks the Authorities to Find a Way to Handle the Aftermath of the Wounded and Dead of Our Isolated Army Incident; Hong Kong Authorities Promise to Improve in the Future

The Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp holds nearly a thousand Chinese soldiers who mistakenly entered British territory. Due to verbal conflicts with Indian guards, there have been incidents of Indian soldiers opening fire. Since Christmas Day on December 25th of last year, similar incidents have occurred twice in just two weeks, resulting in one Chinese soldier shot dead and two wounded. Those concerned about this incident are increasingly worried that the biggest reason for these unfortunate incidents is the language barrier between the Indian guards and the Chinese soldiers, leading to misunderstandings.

Therefore, there is inevitably conflict, and there is a strong desire for the authorities to find ways to improve this situation and handle the aftermath properly. Sir Luo Xuchu, the leading Chinese representative in Hong Kong, is very concerned about this and specifically visited the Colonial Secretary and the Secretary for Chinese Affairs a few days ago to inquire about the strategy for handling the aftermath. Both Secretaries expressed their deep regret, saying that they will find ways to make improvements in the future to avoid similar unfortunate incidents from happening again.

### Various Import Merchants Request Extension of Delivery Period After Successful Negotiations: The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Response Letter Did Not Formally Agree, Various Firms Have Handled It Well, No Obstacles Ahead

The import firms (piece goods, foreign goods, electrical appliances, copper and iron) previously sent a letter to the four Chinese representatives, asking them to mediate with the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce to allow an extension of the delivery period. This matter has been reported in the previous issue. Now the merchants have received a reply letter from the four Chinese representatives, stating that regarding your association's request to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce for an extension of the delivery date and exemption of storage rent and interest, our representatives entrusted Sir Luo Xuchu to meet with the chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce yesterday. The chairman stated that this matter is a private trade, and the seller, buyer, and merchant have a joint relationship. Even if the seller is willing to consider it, the manufacturers may not be willing to accept it, and this matter is agreed upon by the three parties. All handling is at their discretion and cannot be interfered with by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the banks. For this reason, we are unable to assist, etc. Accordingly, we are writing to inform you of the situation. However, how the import merchants will respond is of great interest to the general public. Therefore, our reporter visited the chairman of each merchants association to inquire about everything. According to them, before discussing the request for progress at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, each firm had already started to proceed on its own, consulting with various foreign firms to extend the delivery period. Because of the long-term trading relationship, there is considerable affection between them. Most of them have been successfully negotiated. The reason why each party declined this time is because they are restricted by trade regulations and cannot formally agree. Therefore, they said that this is a private trade and cannot be interfered with by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the banks. However, each firm has already handled it well, and the delivery deadline for each firm should be resolved satisfactorily. There should be no major obstacles ahead.

### Eating in Hong Kong!

— Yu Lang

Sixty-Seven New Restaurants in Six Months

"Eating in Guangzhou" has long been famous throughout the country. Since Guangzhou is so particular about food, Hong Kong, which is close to Guangzhou, is inevitably influenced by it. "Guangzhou Delicacies" is already a sign held high by every restaurant in Hong Kong. After the fall of Guangzhou, "Guangzhou Delicacies" can only be found in Hong Kong.

Take the recent reality as an example: eating in Hong Kong is even better than eating in Guangzhou! Let's see, Hong Kong not only has Cantonese restaurants, Sichuan restaurants, Malay restaurants, and Javanese restaurants, but also foreign restaurants that are more sophisticated than those in Guangzhou.

This is an obvious fact. Since the outbreak of the war, Hong Kong's eating has not only changed in quality, but also increased dramatically in the number of restaurants.

In the seven or eight years before the war, Hong Kong's restaurants suffered unprecedented misfortune due to the impact of the economic downturn. Tangxi was a famous place for "opening banquets to enjoy flowers and toasting to the moon," but because of the economic downturn and the abolition of prostitution, several famous big restaurants also announced their closure. Other large and small restaurants in the city also declined sharply, with almost half of them closing down.

At that time, even the big restaurants had to rely on the tea market and mahjong games to survive, using the policy of "small profits and quick turnover" and offering "economic seasonal dishes" for three or five cents per dish to adapt to the low purchasing power of society. The "mahjong dishes" for nine dollars for four dishes or eight dollars for six dishes were also enough to attract many mahjong gamblers.

Seeing the improved business of the newly emerging ice rooms, middle and lower-class restaurants also changed their direction and switched to running ice room businesses. The so-called ice room does not only sell ice cream and soda. Originally, it was a food store that sold abalone, ginseng, shark fin, fish maw, seafood stir-fries, congee, noodles, rice, steak, coffee, and milk. Because this type of ice room did not have a tea charge like a restaurant, the "soft drink" was "small but complete," but the price was very economical, and one could eat a full meal for a few cents, so there were many customers, which conformed to the business principle of "small profits and quick sales."

The rise of ice rooms was a "new village" discovered by the restaurant industry when it was at its wit's end. In the beginning, business was good because it was "economical," but later, more and more were opened, and the number of customers did not increase, so the business was dispersed among everyone. Restaurants and food shops became very deserted.

After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, things changed. Many people came to Hong Kong to seek refuge, and the abnormally developed Hong Kong market benefited first from restaurants and food shops. Any restaurant, dining room, teahouse, ice room, food shop...was "three times as profitable." In the morning, noon, and evening, it was often impossible to find a seat even after visiting several restaurants. No wonder speculators stepped up the pace of opening restaurants and food shops to seize the fleeting "good opportunity."

Hong Kong's restaurant and food shop industry, which had been declining for many years, came to life. New ones were opened every day. Even streets that used to be very quiet now had food shops. The prosperous streets were even more numerous. According to the investigation conducted by the reporter with the "Municipal Health Bureau," the competent authority for issuing restaurant and food shop licenses, in the last six months—from July to December of last year—a total of 57 food shop licenses were issued in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Forty-one were approved and sixteen were not. A total of twenty-six liquor licenses were issued, all of which were approved. All twenty-six of these restaurants were in Hong Kong.

According to the above numbers, Hong Kong and Kowloon added 67 restaurants and food shops in six months. From this, we can extrapolate that since the outbreak of the war, Hong Kong and Kowloon have added at least a staggering number of more than 100 restaurants and food shops in one year and seven months.

Although Hong Kong is still in a housing panic, many houses have been demolished and rebuilt into large restaurants and hotels. Therefore, some people say that in the future, living in Hong Kong will mean sleeping on the streets, but one can go to restaurants to eat.

Speaking of eating in Hong Kong, it really is non-stop for 24 hours a day. At 4:00 AM, before dawn, the teahouses open to facilitate customers drinking morning tea. They stay open until about 11:00 AM. At 12:00 noon, the lunchtime business of the teahouses, Western restaurants, and restaurants is also booming. Those that do not sell alcohol open until midnight, and those that sell alcohol open until 2:00 AM. One hour later, the teahouses' morning tea session opens again. This cycle continues endlessly, and what is busy is eating.

Let's analyze the customers who eat in Hong Kong society: the customers for morning tea in teahouses are mostly from the middle and lower classes. The customers for breakfast in foreign hotels are mostly young gentlemen and ladies. At noon, wealthy merchants, tycoons, and gentlemen mostly go to restaurants. Small businessmen and freelancers mostly go to tea shops and tea rooms. Office workers and students mostly go to Western restaurants and ice rooms. The customers for afternoon tea are mostly young gentlemen, office workers, and ladies.

From 9:00 PM to 2:00 AM, it is a tense time for eating. Teahouses, tea rooms, ice rooms, restaurants, dining rooms, restaurants...are all crowded with customers. This time and noon are the most difficult times to find a seat. Many people stand in line waiting in every restaurant. It's not easy to eat extravagantly even if one has money.

Perhaps it is the decadent thinking unique to places where the sound of cannons cannot be heard. "Eating is paramount," "Eat first, then pay," and "eating and drinkingism" are very popular and fashionable. The owners of restaurants and food shops are "beaming with joy." Many large-scale restaurants, hotels, and teahouses in Hong Kong are speeding up construction, preparing to open before the Lunar New Year!

### Hong Kong Briefs

British Naval Commander in Hong Kong, Mr. Dickens, will be leaving Hong Kong to return home in the near future. Mr. Dickens came to Hong Kong at the beginning of 1937. His term will be completed this spring. The British Admiralty has not yet announced the successor.

According to the Hong Kong Gazette yesterday, the Governor has appointed Mr. Mullers to serve as Acting Postmaster General, effective from January 11th of this year. Mr. Healy has also been appointed to serve as Acting Deputy Harbour Master of Hong Kong, also effective from January 11th.

The Central Fruit Vendors Charity Relief Group sold fruits to raise funds for refugees in the New Territories. At this time, the refugees in various parts of the New Territories have been resettled in Shenzhen by the Relief Federation. The group's distribution of relief work has also come to an end. A total of six thousand eight hundred and ten dollars, four cents, and five mills have been raised.

### Two Tragic Accidents in Wan Chai and Kowloon: Boy and Girl Die Under Wheels, Bus Runs Over Boy in Front of Wan Chai Post Office, Girl's Liver and Brains Splattered on Lai Chi Kok Road

At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a tragic accident occurred in front of the Wan Chai Avenue East Post Office, where a child was run over and killed by a car. The area is a prosperous district in the Eastern District, with a narrow road and many long-distance buses and private cars passing by. At the time, a child of about eight or nine years old wanted to cross the road from the front of the post office to the opposite street. Suddenly, a China Motor Bus Company No. 491 long-distance bus traveling on Route 5 from west to east passed in front of the post office, and just struck the child as he was crossing. The driver desperately tried to brake to stop, but it was too late. The child was knocked down by the front wheels, and with a sudden thud, the rubber wheels ran over the child's body, crushing the child and causing serious injuries. The waist and feet were bleeding profusely. The driver quickly got out of the car to check, and nearby police also arrived at the scene. They first dragged the child out and reported to the police station by telephone. Before long, a police car from the nearby No. 2 Police Station was dispatched to the scene. Because the child's injuries were critical, they did not wait for the ambulance to arrive and first transported the child to the police station to report the case, intending to transfer him to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injuries, he reportedly died en route. Police detectives at the scene recorded the license plate number of the accident vehicle and filed it. They took the driver back to the police station to question him and take a statement. At about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Kowloon bus of a certain number was traveling from Yau Ma Tei to Sham Shui Po. When it was driving near the junction of Lai Chi Kok Road and Poplar Street, a girl of about eight years old suddenly ran out from under a building, intending to cross to the opposite side. The person and the car collided. The rear wheels of the bus ran over the girl's head, instantly causing it to explode. Brain matter and blood splattered everywhere, and the internal organs were also seriously injured. The girl died on the spot. The bus driver stopped to check the accident, saw that the injured person was dead, and immediately informed the Sham Shui Po Police Station. The police station dispatched a large number of traffic police detectives to the scene to investigate. Later, a black box car transported the body to the morgue, summoning the deceased's parents to come forward to identify the body.

### Approaching Date of Golden Gate Exposition; Busy Shipping Domestic Goods to America; By a Talented Writer; Those Participating in the Exposition are All Handicrafts and Antiques

To commemorate the completion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, the United States is holding the Golden Gate International Exposition to inspire people around the world with the elegance of great architecture. The opening date is set for February 18th of this year. As our government is preoccupied with the arduous war of resistance, it is unable to attend to this matter. The "Overseas Chinese Commercial Exhibition Corporation" organized by overseas Chinese in the United States will participate in the exposition by building a "Chinese Village." They have also sent a representative, Kuang Guangyin, back to China to collect goods for exhibition in the United States. As all the details have been reported in the newspapers, Mr. Kuang returned to the United States on the 6th or 8th of this month.

With just over a month until the exposition opens, the deadline is approaching, so the shipment of domestic goods to the United States is extremely busy. Amidst the intense war of resistance, the collection of domestic goods has been quite difficult due to the blockage of inland transportation, so the collection has been limited to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The general exhibition plan is as follows: The Overseas Chinese Commercial Exhibition Corporation has over forty booths. The nature of the goods exhibited in these booths is stipulated for merchants to contract. Shanghai merchants are contracting nine booths, and Hong Kong merchants are contracting four booths, responsible for collecting domestic goods and transporting them to the United States for display and sale. The Hong Kong merchants contracting are China National Products Promotion Center, Lok Hing Company, Wah Hing Company, China Tea Company, China Handicraft United Company; and consolidating all these is Kam Cheung Company. On December 10th of last year and the 4th of this month, there were two shipments of goods to the United States, but these were not goods but decorations for the exhibition site and props for opera troupes. The first batch of goods was shipped out on the President Cleveland, which departed at 6:00 AM yesterday (the 14th). This shipment contains a total of 193 boxes, valued at 70,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the reporter visited Kam Cheung Company to inquire about the shipment of domestic goods to the United States. According to the person in charge, "Chinese merchants are participating in the exposition with limited funds, so we cannot fully meet expectations. Moreover, because the production areas of many specialty products have been affected by the war, we have no way to collect them, so we feel even more difficulty. However, we are still actively trying to find these goods. Chinese industry is still in its infancy, and mainly consists of handicrafts, so most of the goods collected this time are exquisite artistic handicrafts. The goods collected in South China are Gu embroidery, antiques, calligraphy, and valuable handicraft products. There are also golden dragons, silver dragons, lion dances, Cantonese opera, and other performances to celebrate. In Shanghai, the wealthy merchant Lu Lian is responsible for collecting the goods, which will be transported to Hong Kong for consolidation and then shipped to the United States. We cannot neglect handicraft art products. This time, the Fuzhou lacquerware and Shantou drawnwork collected by the China Handicraft United Association are unique Chinese products. When these goods arrive in the United States, they will make industrial nations appreciate the delicacy and artistry of handicrafts, which cannot be matched by mechanical industry. But because the production of handicraft products is slow, after this batch is collected and shipped out, those still being processed will be completed and shipped to the United States batch by batch. In the future, even if the exposition has already opened, we can continue to ship goods. In short, our participation in this exposition is mainly based on domestic handicrafts. Also, the antiques and calligraphy by famous artists shipped out by the China National Products Promotion Center are sufficient to promote our country's inherent art."

It is heard that the second batch of goods is scheduled to be shipped out on the 27th of this month. In addition to the exhibition of goods, there will also be a variety of entertainment programs in the venue, managed by Modern Company. In the future, beautiful Chinese women will be selected to manage the goods in the exposition, adding to the visitors' interest.

### What I Hope For from the China Art Theater

— Ouyang Yuqian

The comrades of the China Art Theater, none of whom are over thirty years old, have all undergone many hardships. When they were in distress and at a loss, they asked me to help them. I could not bear to see them wander in foreign lands, nor could I bear to see them scattered in different places, causing a group of young people with relatively skilled performance skills to be torn apart and forced to abandon their profession for the sake of survival. Therefore, after a night of consideration, I decided to accept their request and agreed to direct plays for them.

A new theater troupe was established, and the first public performance began. This took more than a month. During this period, I saw their lives change very rapidly. Their living quarters were clean and tidy. They strictly adhered to a set schedule for getting up, eating, and sleeping. They were extremely focused during rehearsals, and there was no joking or noise. Another noteworthy thing was their increased desire for knowledge. They read newspapers and books, invited people to give lectures, and paid attention to social affairs, gradually moving towards the actual experience of life and society. In terms of thought, they gradually shifted from fantasy to the pursuit of reality.

They inevitably had youthful spirits and emotional outbursts, but their self-governance also developed accordingly. They deeply realized that if life was not organized seriously, the effectiveness of their work would be reduced. Recently, all their measures have been taken voluntarily, and there are no written rules of punishment or reward governing them. I am merely assisting and reminding them from the side.

I am quite self-aware and have never wanted to be a leader. My qualifications as a leader are not sufficient. A leader must be the central figure of a movement. He must not only be able to recognize the correct path, but also be able to maintain a firm stance. His personality, morality, knowledge, and writing must be exemplary. He must have ample energy and keen intelligence to cope with complex personnel matters and difficult environments. I feel ashamed when I examine my heart in the quiet of the night. I can only comfort myself with the constant effort and the belief that I will not fall behind. I am only a technical staff member, a worker with more experience, so I am only helping and serving the China Art Theater, not leading them as a leader. If they can do their work well under strict organization and make a full contribution to the theater movement—the movement to revive the nation, strengthen the foundation of the country, and transform society—I will certainly share in the honor. If they cannot govern themselves and their work declines, I will not evade any responsibility that I should bear. That is all.

I believe that as long as every worker truly has the courage to be a person and do things, they should not be afraid of admitting mistakes. The worst thing is to blame others. It is also worst to be arrogant and look down on others, which closes the door to progress and can lead to great danger. Theater is a group art, and a person without sociability cannot become a good actor. The idea of individual heroism must be overcome. If there is the slightest selfishness, it will destroy oneself and one's career. Even if there is occasional success, it will often affect greater achievements because of a lack of clear understanding. These are the most easily formed weaknesses. I hope that the comrades of the China Art Theater can pay attention to these things at all times, strive to establish self-criticism to improve efficiency, strive for the highest standards of technology, and gradually achieve the intended tasks. This is the most important thing.

Another point is that some people think that as long as an actor sincerely practices acting, there is no need for literary and political cultivation. This is completely wrong. In feudal times, actors were despised by society, and they also maintained a certain degree of mystery about themselves. Now the times have changed. Theater directly reflects contemporary society, so a good actor must be able to approach society and delve into society. How can a person who is engaged in social education movement succeed without understanding social conditions? How can a fighter for the nation be isolated from politics? Therefore, it can be known how the comrades of the China Art Theater should build their foundation. This is true not only for the China Art Theater, but also for other theater groups. This is recognized by all armed workers in the new era.

### A New Force in Anti-Japanese War Drama: A Visit to the China Art Theater; A Conversation with Mr. Ouyang Yuqian

— Qiuluo

The era is always moving forward. The alarm bell of the era is constantly ringing in our ears. The era does not allow "corruption" to exist, because "corruption" will hinder the progress of the era. Today, China is facing a great era of revival, and also a terrible era of danger. However, we are not willing to let China sink. On the contrary, we will do our best to support the glory and ultimate victory of our motherland. We are theater workers, and today, we should use our sincere and pure conscience, our heroic and hard-working spirit, to extensively promote and develop anti-Japanese war drama.

As a new force in anti-Japanese war drama—the China Art Theater. We look forward to it as much as we look forward to the victory of the anti-Japanese war. Everyone knows that this new force was split from the "China Travel Theater." Regarding the past of the "China Travel Theater," we will not repeat the old story now. From today on, we are paying attention to the China Art Theater. We will not let it go, because tolerance and weak love will often harm the cause and the future of people. Our attitude will be the same as that of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, decided by reason.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's first sentence was: "Cultivate yourselves, acquire knowledge, and live a serious life. Reverse the previous willfulness of taking acting as a play, and quickly develop political consciousness." Therefore, the members of the China Art Theater now have established reading groups and forums. They have invited Mr. Xu Dishan, Tao Zhixing, Hu Chuncheng, Xu Beihong, and others to give lectures in turn, and they are also engaged in the study of politics and economics. As for life? Now they get up at seven o'clock and rehearse until night, rehearsing one play and then another. They are trying to achieve progress in performance. All the previous bad habits have been swept away and they are starting anew.

Mr. Ouyang's second sentence was: "The members will be evaluated based on points. The difference in points between members cannot be too large. Those with outstanding achievements will be rewarded with increased points, but equality will still be the principle." This means that as long as members work hard, they will be treated the same. As for increasing the points for those with outstanding achievements, it is intended to be a reward. Life is not just about eating, but about interest. A life without interest is a dead life. Bookworms read books to death, read dead books, and die reading books. This is the reflection. Those who engage in drama are not individualists seeking fame and fortune like bookworms, but have a sense of the masses and perform for the masses. They are one of the masses, not arrogant like bookworms who think they are "cranes standing among chickens."

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's third sentence was: "The points are public, and the treatment is consistent. The China Art Theater is everyone's China Art Theater, not an individual's China Art Theater." What a frank and honest statement. Only by putting such honest words into practice can a troupe be united and developed. We reject dictators, ambitious people, and plunderers, because these people are not worthy of being in the realm of art. The China Art Theater is using a united will to form a mainstream. If this mainstream is maintained well, it will be as solid as steel. An iron-like theater troupe is especially needed today. We will sincerely support it and spur it on, not allowing it to be crooked or sluggish. Of course, the comrades of the China Art Theater will give us a factual answer and will not disappoint the good intentions of Mr. Ouyang's instructions.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian also has a valuable suggestion, which is to prevent the China Art Theater from becoming a commercial theater troupe. It is said that a businessman once offered to take out 10,000 yuan to manage the business of the China Art Theater. The members of the China Art Theater resolutely rejected it. This is one noteworthy event. The China Art Theater plans to use Hong Kong as a supply station, and when necessary, will go to the mainland. The mainland can provide more opportunities for performances and make it easier to improve acting skills; the mainland can get closer to the people, and it is easy to learn some knowledge in organizing the people, so the enthusiasm of the China Art Theater to return to the embrace of the motherland is always beating, but it is only a matter of time. This is the second noteworthy event. Mr. Ouyang humbly said that he is not a leader but a servant, because he saw the enthusiasm of the comrades of the China Art Theater, so he joined, nothing else. Mr. Ouyang repeatedly talked about his efforts for theater, using his fifty years of age and many years of experience to tell the younger generation what the world is like. What a kind teacher, but with such a modest attitude. This is the third noteworthy event.

After the establishment of the China Art Theater, in addition to performing "Song of Righteousness," for more than a month, they have been gathering in a small building in the Kowloon Peninsula, burying themselves in hard work. Under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, they are stepping up rehearsals for new plays every day, preparing for a large-scale performance. In addition to re-staging the old plays that the China Travel Theater performed in Hong Kong, they are starting to rehearse. The plays they are preparing to rehearse include "The Wilderness," "The Capture Record," "One Year," "Floating Corpse," "Bandits," "Resurrection," "Winds on the Stockade," "Behind the Green Gauze Tent," "The Power of Black Money," and other dozens of plays, all day long. The tense rehearsal state is full of active vitality. Attracted by this active vitality, many people have joined the troupe to work—initially there were only sixteen male members and three female members; now there are over eighty male members and over ten female members!

Since the China Art Theater has members who are willing to learn with humility, and also a teacher who is willing to teach with humility, the development of the future is a matter of course. Now, they will formally perform "Song of Righteousness," "Beside Oneself with Joy," "Thunderstorm," and "The Inspector General" at the Central Theater on the evenings of the 17th and 18th of this month, and perform in Hong Kong at the Puqing Theater from the 19th to the 22nd. In this place where theater is just growing, we always hope that the China Art Theater will take on the responsibility of cultivating it, clearing thorns and removing weeds, so that flowers can bloom and fruits can bear.

Lu Xun said: "We should create a large number of new internal warriors, because there are too few people now." Take this famous saying as the conclusion of this article.

### Unveiling a New Page in the History of Spoken Drama Movement

— Hu Chunbing

Since 1928, practitioners of the spoken drama movement have been shouting the slogan every year that this year is the "Year of Drama", but in fact, before the July 7th Incident, the Chinese spoken drama movement had never "become a great force". After more than ten months of baptism and motivation of struggle, on the Double Tenth of 1938, China started the first drama festival, and the organization of the China Art Theater was almost at that time, which was to unveil a new shell in the history of the Chinese spoken drama movement: 1939, which takes blood as the year of national revival, is the real, year of drama.

Because spoken drama is most able to reflect reality, the history of spoken drama development and the national liberation movement are mutually supportive. Just by looking at what the spoken drama movement has shown in the fighting for more than ten months, you can know what the spoken drama movement should do in this year of the beginning of light.

From the July 7th Incident to the present, the spoken drama movement has first changed from positional warfare to mobile warfare. That is, the large drama troupes that are generally concentrated in cities, and the drama organizations of multi-national groups that have sprung up like "wind" and clouds, have all been distributed to the mainland on a large scale and in a planned manner to work. This kind of mobile warfare has enabled the peasants in the mainland and even in remote rural areas to receive the baptism of spoken drama, to know their own destiny and the destiny of their family and country, and to know the mission that history has given them. Workers have also gained a lot of experience, and the dramas that truly meet the needs of the masses, and serve as the epic of the bloody struggle for survival for one-fourth of mankind, have been produced. This seed of culture, this enlightenment movement knows the needs of the masses, negates the simple copying or imitation of European and American dramas, negates the emotional preaching of intellectuals, and is not only the expansion of the spoken drama movement, but also the internal element of the inevitable victory. The yeast of the battle has taken effect.

Secondly, the spoken drama movement has closely linked its own destiny with the liberation of the people. Spoken drama work has become an organic part of the war. As a result, the drama has become armed; drama workers have gone to the army battlefield and into factories and farms to preach the gospel of liberation to them, and army camps, factories, and villages have also begun the spoken drama movement. This awakening of the national soul has become the most powerful weapon for the masses to educate and mobilize themselves. The spoken drama movement has been liberated from the narrow confines of the literati's preferences and the petty-bourgeois intellectual's circle, and has been able to actively become a link in the nation's movement for freedom. Spoken drama only began to have a soul, only began to have flesh and blood: only began to have life.

The increase in quantity naturally leads to a change in quality. The expansion of widespread activities will inevitably lead to a deeper understanding of theory. New requirements have been put forward: a large number of scripts that meet the needs of the masses are created, reports and studies on the conditions of drama movements in various places, the depth of technology, and the provision of diversified methods are urgently needed to be resolved. Secondly, the masses in the rear or the overseas Chinese residential areas are usually anesthetized by the entertainment brought by the old forces, and they also need new substitutes. These new substitutes of course have realistic new content, but they also need artistic forms of moderation and popular artistic skills. These can be solved in part by national organs and schools, and they are also working hard to solve them. And an organization that exists in the folk, such as a specialized art troupe, is especially necessary.

The basis for the existence of the China Art Theater is even more here; its meaning of production is also no more than this. Some people say that Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's position in the Chinese art world can be compared to Stanislavsky from Imperial Russia to the Soviet Union. In this analogy, the Art Theater will be the Chinese "British National Theater". This is not necessary. Because Mr. Ouyang has not received the rich tradition of Imperial Russia, his decades of artistic life have been revolutionary, creative, and non-academic. At present, his personal achievements may not be as many as Mr. Shi's, but his ambition and great strength to serve the nation are very healthy. The China Art Theater may not be so "standard" in art, but as a large "Larrey Force" (laboratory) of the national drama movement, a large supply station, and one of many powerful engines, isn't its task more important and sacred? For the free and happy survival of 400 million people, as drama workers, we should cooperate with reality, demand to enhance subjective strength, gather everyone together, and unveil a new page in the history of spoken drama movement.

Guangzhou Actors in Hong Kong Hold Meeting
After the fall of Guangzhou, drama workers left in the city scattered in various directions, and information was quite isolated. Several dozen people have arrived in Hong Kong one after another, such as the group members of Lanbai, Yixie, Fengshe, Rao Feng, Chunlei, and Hongliu. Recently, Guangzhou drama seniors Hu Qingshui and Lei Qinan have initiated and summoned a meeting of Guangzhou actors in Hong Kong. It has been scheduled to be held at Zhu Baishui's residence at 550 Nathan Road, Kowloon (telephone 58724) at 12 noon on the 15th of this month as a gathering place for a suburban trip to reminisce about the past and connect future work in various aspects.

The Times Theater Troupe Performs in Macao for Charity

In order to expand the anti-Japanese war propaganda, promote the Macao drama movement, and respond to the request of the second troupe of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association to serve the country and raise funds for charity, the Times Theater Troupe mobilized 27 or 8 members to Macao on the 27th of this month! On the evening of the 10th, they began performing at the most prestigious Victoria Theater in Macao. The repertoire for the first night and the second day was "Thunderstorm", which was extremely popular. The second night and the third day's matinee was "Luminous Cup", and the evening performance was "The Paint Is Not Dry". The above three days were for the relief of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association and the Macao refugees. From the 13th to the 14th, the troupe raised funds on its own. The repertoire performed on the 13th was "The Paint Is Not Dry", and the evening performance was "Promoting Officials and Getting Rich" (ie, Chen Baichen's "Devil's Cave"). On the 14th, the matinee was "Luminous Cup", and the evening performance was still "Promoting Officials and Getting Rich". The itinerary back to Hong Kong is probably today!

The Amateur Association Theater Troupe Performs for the First Time

The Hong Kong Amateur Association is a group composed of young people from the Hong Kong professional industry. There is an Amateur Association Theater Troupe inside. Although the organization has not been established for a long time, because the participants have a keen interest in drama, they have already had a very good work performance! That was on the day of the founding of the Hong Kong Amateur Association on the 8th of this month, they performed a national defense play "Song of the Night" (written by Ling He) at the Confucius Hall. Although it was the first performance, the results were quite satisfactory. It is said that they have engaged the famous actor Cai Chusheng to serve as the chief instructor of the troupe, and the future achievements will definitely be very real and very progressive.

### This Glory Belongs to the Hong Kong Drama Movement! Foreword to the 1938 Hong Kong Drama Performance Statistics

— Bai Shui

The Hong Kong drama movement has, over the past year, developed its new life drop by drop, and expanded its territory.

What is most unforgettable for us is the joint performance of "Frontline Storm" and "Blood-Soaked Sky" by the Shanghai Customs Long March Troupe's August 13th Singing Team and the Hong Kong Art Group, which brought about a new turning point. Following that, the China Traveling Drama Troupe and the Xinhuan Drama Troupe came to Hong Kong one after another, and the Era Drama Troupe appeared with a strong and steady posture, making the entire Hong Kong drama scene exchange a fervor of excitement.

On the surface, we see the public performances of large theater groups, embellishing the bustle of the theater scene, but in reality, the performances of small theater groups or associations operating privately are very frequent. Although they are not widely known, the actual effects obtained are very far-reaching.

Time flies; 1938 passed amidst the flames of war. It is doubtful whether the harvest of the Hong Kong drama scene in this year can be calculated in words or writing. However, if we use statistical methods to investigate the number of performances, large and small, across Hong Kong in a year, at the very least, we can obtain a rather astonishing number.

I myself did not keep good records on a daily basis (indeed, there was no way to keep records). During the year-end period, I hastily spent a few days investigating the number of drama performances across Hong Kong. This work is arduous and unrewarding. However, I bravely took on this burden and did it.

It is quite astonishing. Unexpectedly, the total number of performances, large and small, across Hong Kong in a year is close to two hundred. But this is only what is already known; the unknown, forgotten, and many uninvestigable are still unknown in number. Most obviously, many school performances have been omitted, which is an irreparable regret!

In this statistical table, we can clearly see the following four points of opinion:

In the War of Resistance, we should mobilize all forces to support this great torrent. Although Hong Kong is a colony, for the final victory of the motherland, we should turn the most powerful cultural work into this torrent. The Hong Kong drama movement has taken on a great task in this regard. Every performance is an anti-Japanese war drama, and is closely linked to the struggle of the motherland. This is worthy of our attention.

In the past, Hong Kong's drama was supported by a small number of aesthetes. However, after the War of Resistance, this inferior trait was eliminated, and it embarked on coordinating with the struggle against the war, and used different performance methods to work, expanding the scope of the masses. Not only were there public performances in theaters, but also performances in halls, and even mobilized to the suburbs and villages such as Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung, and Ngau Chi Wan. This is also worth noting.

Of the nearly two hundred performances, popular anti-Japanese dramas accounted for 80%, which shows that popular drama has great potential, and shows that the newly emerging serious drama has penetrated into the lower masses. In the future, in addition to striving to increase large public performances, popular performances need to strengthen their strength even more.

Although the number reaches nearly two hundred times, which is quite considerable in quantity, the actual quality requirements are too urgent. We not only need to increase the number of performances, but also need to increase the quality requirements. Only when both quantity and quality advance simultaneously will it be a good impression.

However, in any case, we can feel comforted and find many drops of sweat and hard work from this huge number! We will grasp her and continue to fight forever!

This glory belongs to the Hong Kong drama movement!

### Peng Dehuai Talks About the War Situation in North China Continues on the Second Edition

(4) The Hebei Plains Guerrilla Force, × people threw fast troops and cavalry, and could attack, the strike team used old grass-cutting knives to ambush underground, sharp blades facing the sky, covered with floating soil, when the × people's fast troops arrived, the wheels were punctured, unable to move forward, and triangular nails were used to ambush underground, nail tips facing the sky, when the Japanese × cavalry arrived, the horse's hooves were injured, unable to move forward, the old people called this "old grass-cutting knives defeat new weapons, triangular nails injure × horse hooves."

(5) In June and July last year, 5,000 workers in Tangshan revolted and defeated two battalions of Japanese soldiers, seizing many guns and weapons. Today, it has developed into a powerful guerrilla force of more than 10,000 people, fighting fiercely on the border, Chaoyang, Shanhaiguan, and eastern Hebei. This uprising involved the participation and leadership of comrades from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and some also heroically sacrificed themselves. This is called "5,000 Workers in Tangshan Revolt and Defeat Two Battalions of Japanese Soldiers."

(6) In backward areas, such as the mountainous areas of Pinglu, Shanxi, the old people believe in Bodhisattvas, but they also hate the Japanese equally. They make small bodhisattvas out of millet flour and wheat flour, and eat them facing the sun, expressing their curse on Japan, meaning to eat Japanese devils. They also sing a nursery rhyme, "Seven families make noodles, three families make rice, every family gets up to cook the Japanese, you eat arms, I eat legs, leaving the head for the dogs to lick." They cook devils on the first and fifteenth of every month. Although this is their superstition, it fully expresses their national consciousness and hatred for the Japanese ×.

(7) Also, the itinerant vendors in the cities occupied by the × have joined the puppet organizations, but they still have a strong patriotic heart. The people around Jizhou, when you meet them, they will tell you, "My body is in Cao Ying, but my heart is in Han. I will not be happy until I kill the Japanese."

These facts are not small things, but great national stories, which have been compiled into popular operas and widely spread among the people. As for the people of North China spontaneously destroying roads and transportation, harassing and attacking × people, blocking news, capturing traitors, and actively helping the army, leading the way, transporting supplies, and women sending their husbands to join the army...the facts are countless.

c. Mass Work Under Various Situations

(zi) Anti-Japanese Farmers' Associations and Trade Unions: Farmers account for more than 80% of the country's population. In the long-term people's liberation war, farmers have a decisive role. Under the various evils of the Japanese ×, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the farmers is becoming more and more obvious. At the same time, under the exploitation of heavy rents and high-interest loans, the lives of farmers are the most difficult. They have no political status, and their demands to improve their lives and raise their status are also very urgent. This is something that no one can ignore. If this is forgotten, it is impossible to lead and organize farmers. The victory of the War of Resistance will depend on the farmers. Under the principle of "Anti-Japanese First," it is entirely necessary to appropriately improve the lives of farmers. It is correct to mobilize farmers based on this.

In North China, farmers have a fairly widespread organization, which has played a major role in the War of Resistance. They have provided various assistance to the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, and the status of these families has been improved. High-ranking government officials have gone to encourage and greet them. In addition to spiritual rewards, material assistance has also been provided, so that the parents of soldiers going to war do not feel any difficulties after their sons and husbands leave, but feel that it is supreme glory. At the same time, mobilizing family members to write letters to encourage soldiers to fight bravely has further improved the combat effectiveness of the troops.

Secondly, educating farmers to work hard to produce so that they know that increasing production greatly helps the war. Therefore, the harvest in North China last year, in our recovered areas, not only did not decrease compared with before the war, but increased by 20% to 25%. Grain prices are very low, six yuan for one dan of millet. This is entirely due to the increased enthusiasm of farmers for labor, and production has naturally increased.

In addition, the replenishment of troops for the Chinese army is no problem with the active participation of farmers. I have never seen the phenomenon of "drawing" or "pulling." In addition, farmers organize self-defense forces, stretcher teams, help the army fight, transport, or eliminate traitors, lock down news, etc. In North China, surrounded by the Japanese on all sides, it is really difficult for traitors to operate. Every time they pass through a place, they must have a road pass or a letter of introduction to pass. Even without a road pass, even if they see shepherds in the mountain gullies and slopes, they must stop them for questioning. We have received documents from the × people saying that they have sent traitors to the Wutai Mountain area to operate dozens of times without getting any response, and they were arrested. This shows the failure of the × people and the difficulty of traitors' activities.

Farmers have such a role and achievements, so why don't we actively mobilize and organize them? At the same time, in mobilizing and organizing farmers, we have also implemented the principles of the Anti-Japanese Nation-Building Program and the principles of improving the lives of the people. Anti-Japanese is the first priority, and the lives of farmers are improved locally. The method of implementing five rent reductions or two-five rent reductions is to have the farmers' association responsible for inviting the landlords to come and hold meetings to discuss and adopt peaceful persuasion methods to obtain the consent of both parties. Most landlords are enlightened and know that without rent reductions, it is impossible to mobilize the people. In this way, the farmers' anti-Japanese enthusiasm and production energy are further increased.

"Those who have money give money, those who have strength give strength." This is the principle of reasonable burden sharing. However, in addition, we also heard farmers say, "As long as those who have money give money, will the poor not be willing to give strength?" This heartfelt cry touched us deeply. Therefore, interest rate reductions have also been implemented in North China. The past interest rate of 3% has now been reduced to 1.5%.

This kind of life improvement, the improvement of farmers' political status, and the leverage are naturally improved. Participating in the War of Resistance and working hard to produce, the replenishment of troops is no problem, and the supply of food is no problem.

Secondly, because farmers have organization and training, once they are educated, their national consciousness is improved, and they know that they will not do anything that benefits the × people. Therefore, in Hebei and Shanxi, farmers voluntarily do not grow cotton or flaxseed oil, but grow grain, so as not to be exploited by the ×, and at the same time increase grain production.

Unfortunately, the work of workers in North China is relatively poor, because large cities and transportation routes are occupied by the ×, and the gathering places of workers have been lost. However, there are still considerable organizations for the manual workers in Tangshan and other places, and the workers can best express their determination and perseverance in the War of Resistance. For example, the workers of the Liuhegou and Jingxing coal mines automatically blew up the mines, and the 5,000 workers in Tangshan launched an armed uprising.

(chou) Youth and Student Work:

In addition to general anti-Japanese cultural organizations such as the National Salvation Association and the Anti-Japanese United Association, there are also the following organizations:

(1) Singing Teams: Popular throughout North China. The content of the songs is about resisting Japan and saving the country. Now, in all the recovered areas of North China, workers, farmers, women, and children, whether young children or youth, can sing salvation songs, replacing the past frivolous lyrics and ditties. This really helps the anti-Japanese mobilization.

(2) Drama Teams: Masquerade speeches, such as "Eight Hundred Heroes," "Hatred of National Subjugation," "The War of Resistance Will Surely Win, and Nation-Building Will Surely Succeed," and other dramas, are widely performed, exposing the various atrocities of the × people, establishing confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, and encouraging many social welfare undertakings and production mobilization, which have had great results, and have improved the cultural level of the countryside.

(3) Organize literacy movement groups, distributed in various villages and cities, serving as literacy teachers in night schools for workers, farmers, women, and children, promoting the literacy movement, reducing and gradually eliminating illiteracy. This is not only beneficial to the War of Resistance, but also cultivates the good habit of young students providing voluntary services to society, and increases their sense of responsibility for the War of Resistance. At the same time, this is indeed what young students are willing to do.

(yin) Women's Work:

(1) The Importance of Women's Work: Women account for half of China's population, with more than 200 million people. Most of them are still enslaved slaves. Although the government has announced some articles, they are still very empty things. Therefore, most women in China are not only politically backward, but also have no economic rights and no opportunity to be educated. Especially in North China, they are still bound by the bad habit of foot-binding, which is even more pitiful. Under this kind of bondage, not only are they unable to be liberated while alive, but even superstitiously speaking, they are a ghost who is bound after death (referring to bound feet).

### Li Hua Cup, China Union Team Selected, General Association Expresses Dissatisfaction. South China Breaks Its Promise Not To Transfer Players Back To Participate. Lin Zhonghao Sends Urgent Telegram To Saigon To Request Troops Yesterday

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Football Association has decided that the second act of the Li Hua Cup preliminary football match between the China Union team and the Navy team will be held at the Hong Kong Stadium on the 22nd of this month, and all the ticket revenue from this match will belong to the General Association.

At present, the South China team is the most popular team. During the team's expedition period, the football affairs on the island were diminished.

Before the team goes on a long-term expedition, it must report this matter to the General Association and obtain its approval before it can proceed.

Beforehand, the General Association was sincerely afraid that South China's expedition would not be able to return before the 22nd. For the sake of both, it earnestly stated to South China that, in any case, it must first transfer a few players back to Hong Kong to respond to the Li Hua Cup preliminary match, and must not make excuses to shirk responsibility. South China also promised, because this business has economic benefits. If the China Union team does not have a majority of South China players selected, then the appeal will not be great and the revenue will not be good. Therefore, it is no wonder that the council is quite concerned about this.

A few days ago, Mo Ai, the leader of the South China team, sent back an airmail letter stating that Chen Dehui and Mai Shaozhang were retained by the Vietnamese host on the 15th to play an exhibition match, and it was difficult to disrupt the team midway. This news has been recorded.

After the aspect learned about this matter and the selected players for the China Union team, it was very dissatisfied, criticizing South China for breaking its promise. It is said that if South China does not transfer several players back to participate in the Li Hua Cup preliminary match at that time, the General Association will not approve the request to invite the Singapore China team to come to Hong Kong to compete in the future.

Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Lin Zhonghao, the deputy director of the South China football department, urgently telegraphed Saigon to ask leader Mo for troops. How will this matter be resolved? Let's wait for the next installment. (Football Field Lord)

### Eastern Narrowly Defeats Kowloon Club

The Eastern and Kowloon Club two-mid-group football teams met at the Hong Kong Stadium at 4 pm yesterday. Although the Kowloon Club was a long-distance expedition, it seemed to be losing ground. All the generals refreshed their spirits and seemed determined to win. Fortunately, all the Eastern generals worked together with one heart and were determined to engage in the battle. As a result, the Eastern team finally won with a strategy that was superior to the opponent, with a score of one to zero. Reviewing the skills of the players on both sides, Liu Xianhan, Miao Huaguo, and Liu Shizan of the Eastern team are making progress every day. Luo Weiquan, Zeng Ziyun, and Hou Chengtang also performed well. Secondly, such as Li Deqi, Xu Jingcheng, and Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingshi, did their best to fulfill their duties. It is a pity that Song Zhongsheng was absent due to injury. The newly appointed defender Zeng Zuozhi was also a long-time veteran, and his strength was inevitably slightly reduced, resulting in several incidents. Fortunately, the three armies were ordered to turn danger into safety. On the Kowloon side, the central defense line was the strongest. Beles and Belu performed well. Defender Helijia also defended well. The five forwards were quite fierce, but the connection was poor and the shooting was inaccurate, so they could not draw the game. The battle situation is briefly recorded as follows.

As soon as the battle began, the two armies fought desperately, back and forth, which was quite spectacular. Five minutes later, Hou Chengtang advanced rapidly along the side, and then quickly kicked the cross, the landing point was the best. Yi Deqi and Qixiang were one step late, and the great opportunity was lost. Kowloon counterattacked, the generals rushed forward, like mountains and seas. Jingcheng and Qixiang defended and Hanni Boli shot twice, but they were both saved by Xianhan's sharp eyes and quick hands. Before long, the East was forced to the city, Achen shot in front of the goal, the ball was as fast as an arrow, and everyone was in danger for the East, but unexpectedly, the ball hit the goalpost and bounced out, and the goal was not lost. At the critical moment, a kick back to the center, and East also tried to counterattack at this time. Deqi hit the ball alone, urgently outside the hundred steps, released a cold arrow, shot at the door, Helijia stood out, the ball then slipped back and rolled into the net, Helijia could not save again, Kowloon lost, several counterattacks and shots all failed, before long the first half ended.

After the rest, East was quite active, Chengtang's single force, as fast as lightning, but unfortunately, the last one was high, Kowloon Zuozhi, and Nuoshi attacked without success, Bingshi broke into the key point, and Yihua Lishi came to intercept, but was also passed, the situation was the best, but Helijia saved in time, after this, both sides lost ground, the result East won with a score of one to zero, and the lineup of both sides is as follows.

### Football Charity Match, Readers and Entertainers Draw

The Sports Special Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association was formally established.

### Mui Fong Overwhelms Pui To, Championship is Already in the Bag. HKU Liang Wenhua Absent, Loses to Sze Sze.

(Special Report from this newspaper) Ordinary circles women's basketball game, after a long night of fighting, the champion seat is already in Mui Fong's bag.

Pui To's great defeat was not undeserved, because on the one hand, it was naturally because Liu Qingcai was absent, resulting in a weak defense, and at the same time, Liu Yiyin and Luo Shaoxi's performances were really abnormal, and the connection was scattered, which was also an important factor in its failure.

There were really many fans last night, and the entire basketball room was crowded with them. The cheerleaders who came to support Pui To alone numbered about a hundred, which was a truly grand occasion.

In the first game between HKU and Sze Sze, on the HKU side, due to Wenhua's absence, its strength was actually weaker than Sze Sze's, so after the confrontation, it was at a disadvantage. On the Sze Sze side, Huang Qinfang and Wei Bao's performances were quite good. As a result, Sze Sze won two points with a score of thirty to sixteen.

The second battle, the shouting and applause of the cheerleaders started in the middle. First, Mui Fong took advantage of the moment when Pui To had not yet committed an offense, and the lively Lian Kai scored the first goal, taking the lead for a while. After a long time, Pui To returned with a goal by Xu Yinghua. After this struggle, the scores of the two sides were still not far apart. The first quarter ended with Mui Fong leading eight to seven.

In the second quarter, Xu Yinghua took advantage of Chen Huiqing's foul and made a free throw, tying the score. At this time, Pui To's cheerleaders were very happy and sang a song to wish for victory in advance. But before the singing was over, Mui Fong took the advantage again, and Huang Baozhen and Ye Meilian added three points one after another. Thus, until the end of this quarter, Pui To's score was even further behind at nineteen to seven.

In the second half, Wu Huan Ying performed very well, following step by step, and firmly held Liu Yiyin, who was known for her accurate shooting, at a loss. Chen Huiqing was also not bad, and in the forward, Liu Meilian was like a flower butterfly, piercing left and right, making it difficult to catch. At the same time, Lu Huixian's performance was also very good. On the Pui To side, although Zeng Zisheng was also very hardworking, Guan Shuzhen failed to supervise Ye Meilian, and there was a sigh of looking after one and losing the other. Although the former Xu Yinghua scored the most points, it was a pity that she was too nervous, resulting in many missed opportunities. As for Luo Shaohui and Liu Yiyin, due to the fierce entanglement of Mui Fong's defenders, their performances were not good, so until the end of this quarter, Pui To was still unable to avoid being inferior to others with a score of twelve to twenty.

In the last quarter, although the Pui To generals still worked hard and frequently launched a general counterattack towards Mui Fong's position in an attempt to recover lost ground, the Mui Fong generals did not give up, returning the favor and going back and forth. At this time, Pui To also had cheerleaders cheering and cheering, but time was running out, so until the end of the game, Pui To lost with a ratio of twenty-two to thirty-five, and Mui Fong got the championship.

### Film and Drama

Entertainment... Social Outlaw

The Last Ganaser

Edward G. Robinson, plays a nefarious thug, his past work proves his talent, his immersive interpretation of the character's personality won the audience's unanimous praise,

In this film, he plays another unrepentant thug, who disregards the law in murder and robbery, and even indulges in the evil forces of the entire society, dominating the situation, being tyrannical and arrogant, but eventually sacrificing everything, including his freedom, for the sake of his virtuous wife and children, resulting in a very tragic end.

Edward's acting skills in this film are full of sparks of talent, with an extraordinary and moving power. James Stewart and Ruth Stratam co-star. In this film, we also see the most perfect table of robber actors in Hollywood. All the moving plots in this "Social Outlaw" will give the audience a large and strong new stimulus.

Queen's Peace... Blood on the Fishing Boats

Spawn of the North

A film adapted from , describing the lives of people in the northern border of the United States, the Alaskan Peninsula in the Arctic Ocean. The island is a large producer of "salmon". The fishermen who make a living by fishing must overcome all the natural difficulties for mankind with great efforts, such as icebergs floating on the sea, and the rampant piracy, to maintain their interests. In their lives full of joys and sorrows, there are many moving stories.

This film tells the story of two good friends who, because of conflicts over fishing profits, one cooperates with pirates, and the other joins the fishermen's self-defense group. Friends become enemies. At the same time, behind them are women who love them deeply, at a loss to do anything, watching them fight each other. Later, the one who cooperated with the pirates was finally injured and repented, so he crashed the pirate ship under the iceberg, perished with the pirates, sacrificed himself, and completed the love of his friends, which is the climax of the film.

The cinematography of this film is lively and ingenious, and there are also several shots of Indian sacrificial ceremonies, which, in our opinion, are full of mysterious meaning. At the same time, this film has five stars, starring George Raft, Henry Fonda, and Dorothy Lamour, and co-starring Akim Tamiroff, John Barrymore, etc. The arrangement of the plot allows everyone to have the opportunity to give full play to their artistic talents. Director Henry Hathaway, has directed films such as "The Shepherd of the Hills" and "The Lives of a Bengal Lancer", and is very powerful in handling the plot and climax of this film.

Oriental... Quirky Bachelor

Professor Beware

Harold Lloyd starred in "Movie Crazy". Because of the insult to China, it gives a very bad impact. For a while, no films will be shown in China. This time, the "Quirky Bachelor" is still the same style as before. The plot is wishful thinking, with the thrilling places on the farm, and his silly actions make people laugh. Naturally, there are also many humorous scenes and dialogues.

Great China... Tarzan's Revenge

Tarzan's R-venge

The story is mediocre, telling about an explorer who wants to capture a white person into the interior of the island. The king colludes with people and wants to take a white woman. Fortunately, Tarzan can save her. Later, the white woman falls in love with Tarzan and never goes back.

It is absolutely nothing surprising, far less than the previous "Tarzan and His Mate" starring Glenn Morris and Eleanor Holm.

Movie Star... Spring of the Young Swallow

Love And Hisses

A musical and dance film starring Simone Simon, Walter Pidgeon and Bert Lahr. It is Simone's first singing film, and the performance is not successful. The singing voice is also not moving. It is still the battle between the radio station announcer and the news reporter, but it is quite laughable.

Central... Love, Tears, and Blood (Mandarin Film)

It is adapted from the original work of Rou Shi, directed by Bu Wancang, who can be said to be familiar with the subject. The protagonist is still Jin Yan. Only the heroine and the supporting roles in the troupe have been replaced by Yuan Meiyun and Mei Xi et al.

The story, in simple terms, is about a woman who struggles in a feudal society and ultimately ends her life with self-sacrifice.

In terms of performance, it can be said to be a satisfactory work. Only the "Lovely Mother" opera is too long. Yuan Meiyun and Hai Yan's performances are not bad.

New World... Ardent Fire of Spring

Cantonese film

This film tells the inside story of a hotel, the strange social movements, revealing the abnormal development of society, which makes people feel a great deal. This film is the first film of Justice Film Company, starring Xin Ma Shi-zeng and Deng Yunshang.

Taiping... Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Opera Troupe

Daytime performance - Disasters of Desire

Night performance - Unfathomable Women's Hearts

Puqing... Cantonese Opera

Xing Zhonghua Opera Troupe

Daytime performance - Radish Saves Mother (Part 1)

### On the Beach

— Peng Chenghui

Stretching out in front is a vast expanse of white, a sea without end.

The clear sky is a boundless expanse of blue, without a single cloud. The sunlight shines so brightly on the sea, gently rippling with continuous waves, reflecting such a dazzling light, as if it were thousands of lumps of silver, so brilliant that it almost blinds the eyes.

The weather is a scene of peace, a warmth. The distant view of the sea is infinitely beautiful: white egrets fly up and down like dragonflies skimming the water. Several white sails float gracefully above, and occasionally one or two motorboats belching thick smoke pass by, the foam behind the boats boiling, forming a black path, but quickly disappearing into the wave shadows in an instant.

Behind is a continuous range of mountains, thickly covered with pine trees, with occasional clear singing of birds. Halfway up the mountain is a road sandwiched in between, leading to the green mountains, with buses often speeding past on it.

He sat alone on this beach, quietly gazing at the sea in front.

A gentle breeze blew softly through his long hair and lifted the corners of his clothes. He felt a chill.

He had been adrift in Hong Kong for a full year. In this long line of drifting, he had never received news about his homeland. He had no friends or relatives here. It seemed that the twelve months had passed entirely on this island.

He thought silently, the sun shining on his body. He felt very warm. He immediately closed his eyes and rested his head on the stone. Very quickly, his soul returned to his homeland. He heard the clear singing of birds and the rustling of falling firewood. It was the sound of autumn arriving in the pine forest behind his house. The maple leaves were red, reflecting the sunlight, bright and dazzling, still so beautiful and poetic. Many leaves had already fallen in front of the steps. The flowing water murmured, as if someone was whispering. It was the spring flowing out from the mountain rocks in front of the door. The pond was dry, filled with silt, but the lotus stems still stood tall and firm. The lake in front lay quietly, as if sleeping, with no one to disturb its sweet dreams. The weeping willows on Su Causeway seemed to be thinking intently, silently drooping their heads. South Peak and North Peak faced each other in the clear sky, as if nodding and smiling, boasting of their towering grandeur. Lingyin Temple was shrouded in incense smoke, strand after strand, mixed with the sound of bells, still so solemn and magnificent.

The beauty of the lake and mountains, in the serene morning air, in the crimson afterglow, was limitless. Ah, how bright and beautiful this lovely hometown is!

As soon as the dream vanished, he immediately woke up consciously, opened his eyes and looked around, and found that he was still lying on the beach under the sun.

He remembered very clearly: he had escaped from the front lines on the night Hangzhou fell. He originally had a kind mother and an amiable father. He also had a sincere brother and a lively sister. Because of the fear, crowding, and haste when fleeing, he was separated from them. Because of the sudden intensity of the artillery fire and the chaos of the military situation at the time, he never had the means or opportunity to search for them. Therefore, he had to drift alone with tears in his eyes.

Ah ah—bright and lovely hometown. At this time, it must still be filled with jackal-like beast soldiers, right? The lake and mountains, under their hideous faces, must be frightened and dim. Between the fields and wilderness, perhaps the white bones of our brave soldiers are still piled up, left to be blown by the wind, exposed to the sun, beaten by rain, and invaded by frost. Who can go to pay their respects? A hibiscus tree in front of the door must have bloomed with bright flowers already. The fragrance of osmanthus must also have spread everywhere. I wonder if the cold plants in the garden are still as beautiful as they used to be? Perhaps everything has been destroyed by the flames of war.

Thinking about it, he felt that everything in the past was a sweet dream. He didn't know when he would have the opportunity to relive the old dream.

### A Small Record of Macau

— Huang Kaiyin

People living in Macau, besides gambling and eating and drinking, seem to have no other enjoyment in life. In fact, in comparison with the name "Monte Carlo of the Orient," Macau can also be called "Rome of the Orient." Churches and crosses are visible everywhere. On Sundays, the mountaintops, central parks, and beaches are filled with a quiet chiming of bells, and the clear singing of the faithful is mesmerizing. The crosses on the tops of the churches emit rays of light. People walk slowly on the steps and enter the grand halls of those Western-style or Italian-style buildings. This scene, even in imagination, feels solemn, sacred, and full of old-fashioned charm. The depictions of the Middle Ages, whether in the streets or alleys, can often be surprisingly discovered.

Where I live is near a church on a hillside. At night, before going to bed, I turn off the lights and let the room become pitch black, and when I lie on the bed and think, the evening bells of the church ring out like a stroke of lightning in clear weather. Hearing that sound echoing in the midst of absolute silence, my soul is very happy, and then I fall into a sweet dream as if I had received someone's comfort.

From my place of residence to the seaside is not too far, so whether in the morning, at dusk, or at night, I love to light a cigarette and walk alone to the seaside. The bauhinia trees are covered with withered yellow leaves, and occasionally there is a tree with red flowers. However, I can't help but feel the winter cold. The sea lies lonely, and the fishing boats rest quietly in the heart of the sea, letting the slanting wind and drizzle sweep over their sails. Further away are small islands, one by one. The Dayu Mountain near Xiao Port is also faintly visible. In this mountain, I discovered tiny little black dots. ×××××××××××××××××? These days, their ships have come to visit, and the salutes are deafening. In gambling halls, dance halls, and on the streets, everywhere you see these arrogant and hideous creatures, and they are still wearing uniforms!

The winter rain is like a flowing stream and has a special kind of charm. From this, I remembered a line from a contemporary poet: "The May rain drizzles, the swift current is the most Kamogawa," what a rich vitality and life emotion!—Walking west along the embankment, I saw buildings along the way, combining the architectural styles of various eras and nations: there are streamlined German working-class family-style combinations, Chinese-style Western buildings that are neither fish nor fowl, and Westerners' houses are fond of painting orange-yellow and grassy green, but what I especially like are two small houses in the Southern European style, with delicate hexagonal lanterns in front of the door, chrysanthemums and sunflowers in the garden, and several rattan chairs placed beside the house, a small pug lying on the ground, staring wide-eyed at people, as if to say: "The masters have just finished talking, and now they have returned to the house!" If people see this even coordination, they will feel an indescribable softness and beauty. Imagine in the summer night, sprinkled with silver light, wouldn't the Southern Europeans hold a six-string guitar and sing a love song softly? It's no wonder that the two painters who came with me couldn't help but exclaim that they wanted to rent it as a studio.

Macau is worth your lingering, if you are not a pure gambler or a vulgar person. People on the streets walk side by side in the middle of the road, without having to be as apprehensive as walking on the roads of Hong Kong. Will you be reminded of walking on Shuangmendijie at night? What I have to say here must come to a stop.

### The Educational Nature of Literature and Art

— Wen Yu

Since it is said that writers are "engineers of the human soul" (Stalin), then literature and art must be a gift to the human soul! Literature and art guide people to understand reality, transform reality, and awaken a common consciousness, so that people engage in common struggles. The reason is that writers "must always be in a state of intense and revolutionary struggle with reality. Because he must think about changing reality, so he is revolutionary" (Fox), therefore his painful products—works—have a deep understanding, criticism, and solution of reality. Writers give these fleshy things to their readers from this place, which inevitably generates a sense of response to the masses and affects their actions.

"This is a necessary book. Many people unintentionally and instinctively participated in the revolutionary movement. Now, after reading 'Mother,' they feel that it is very beneficial to themselves and is a very timely book." Lenin evaluated Gorky's "Mother" in this way.

Gorky created "Mother" in the era of reaction after the failure of the 1905 revolution, telling the workers about the great faith and affirmation of victory. The educational significance of the harvest exceeded many others. His means were to unite and organize the workers. This is the high righteousness of art and defense. "Mother" became a necessary book—"a very timely book." From this, we can understand how a writer can stand in his own position and how he can develop the weapon of literature and art to cooperate with the battle.

Then, in this sacred liberation struggle, the political goal requires mobilizing the entire nation to resist the war, and literature and art cannot but be a means of educating the people and organizing the people. Perhaps it is said that literature and art only become the tail of politics? No, but we must first make literature and art keep up with the speed of the War of Resistance, and literature and art are to organize the souls of the people, with an inspiring nature, and at the same time, they must have a huge educational nature, which can correct the concepts and strengthen the beliefs of the people, and knowledge can be instilled, etc. The answer to the question is the transformation of the soul, making literature and art "necessary" and "most suitable" for the War of Resistance. Therefore, literature and art must have a huge educational nature, and our "soul engineers" must pay attention to educational literature and art.

Let's talk about a novel. In Zhang Tianyi's "Wang Scarface and Xiao Zhu" (Free China, Issue 3), Wang Scarface is an old soldier and only has "the brute force that doesn't care about heaven and earth." His battle style is "charging is omnipotent." In the battlefield, of course, he is the bravest soldier. On the contrary, Xiao Zhu is brave and resourceful. In the battlefield, Wang Scarface becomes a "brave but unwise" and impatient soldier. Because he does not understand and achieve the requirements of tactics, he is in vainly wounded and bleeding, and he cannot get back the price. Xiao Zhu is just the opposite.

Although this is not a very successful work, the author's intention is to achieve a kind of educational task, because in the current military situation of "the enemy is strong and we are weak," we naturally must have the determination to sacrifice at all costs, but impetuousness and recklessness, or "die-hardism," etc., make the sacrifice not worth it, and we must avoid it. The author uses images to express this point, so that it can be vividly understood and appreciated by people. It has to be said that it has the significance of educating soldiers. This is just a small example, and there are many things that are required, such as educating soldiers to love the people and working hand in hand with the people to establish a good new relationship between the army and the people; helping soldiers to recognize the tragic aspects and weaknesses of the enemy; and other instructions that are beneficial to combat, etc. Naturally, this can be completed by other methods, but literary and art workers cannot ignore their necessary tasks.

In the rear, literature and art should more widely and effectively promote its educational role. Literary and art workers should concentrate their attention on seeing through the depths of the souls of people of all classes and groups, accurately identify their weaknesses, and then, in the true posture of a "soul engineer," apply the skills of "acupuncture." On the surface, each person has his or her own unique questions about the War of Resistance, and naturally, it is impossible to answer them one by one, but what we rely on is the work of writing "typical characters," which is also the same as supporting the answers to the core of many questions. Art must be analyzed, summarized, and synthesized. For example, at present, × people are trying to implement appeasement tactics to deceive and seduce our people, and some people have weakened their hatred for × people. This is a major problem at present. How should we smash the conspiracy of × people? How should we treat the wavering of some of the people? Cultural workers cannot ignore this, and literary and art workers should further develop the educational nature of literature and art and take on this task.

The educational nature of literature and art develops with the development of the War of Resistance, and changes with the changes in all aspects of reality. It is multifaceted, constantly new, and therefore lasting and mobile.

However, a practical problem that lies before us is the popularization of literature and art. Although the theoretical provision of popularization, utilization of formal forms, etc., is quite rich, the practice is too backward. This not only makes it impossible to promote the functionality of literature and art highly and widely, but also makes the problem of popularization itself suffer. Theory guides practice, and practice can act against theory. This kind of reverse is important. Without practice, there is no way to empirically prove and improve theory. Therefore, literary and art workers cannot for a moment take their sights away from this problem.

### At Wu Family Lane

— Ren Yong

Three years ago, I left Wu Family Lane. But I didn't bitterly miss her, because Jiangwan wasn't necessarily bad either. I could find true taste in the current environment, so why bother pointlessly indulging in the past?

However, now I intensely miss the past. In a series of memories, the beautiful Wu Family Lane emerges and floats up first. I deeply recall her, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes late at night.

Wu Family Lane has a unique beauty. It's a living beauty. There are five hundred acres of land there, and countless groups of young men and women. Among us, there are men like iron bulls, and maidens like Mulan. Our younger siblings are still babes, reeking of milk. The older ones wear old student uniforms and simple blue qipaos, while the younger ones are all valiant young soldiers, exposing their thick legs and displaying yellowish-red faces. What is this? Isn't this a living beauty?

The early morning is the most lovely time. In the breeze of the morning light, a bugle sounds, and groups of young people surge out of the dormitories on the west side, habitually forming rows. The physical education teacher shouts from the high platform in front of the flag. With a bugle blast, the beautiful national flag solemnly climbs the ten-zhang high pole. A thousand people stand on the field, but there isn't a sound. Each person is like an iron pillar, giving the highest salute to the national flag. Orderly, solemn, isn't that a living beauty?

The national flag flutters at the top of the pole, and the magnificent morning song roars from the loudspeaker: "...Caress the wounds of the Songhu battlefield, quell the unjust treaties, let the surge of patriotic blood well up a thousand zhang, when will the national power be displayed, the sovereignty asserted, the talented heroes bravely step forward, the youth of Shanghai boldly advance!..." Ah, what a completely vibrant morning.

During the day, we are all busy with books. The gatehouse and Xianmian Hall are where we forge our brains. After four o'clock, these two Western-style buildings become quiet. Groups of people, having removed their student uniforms, rush toward the sports field and gymnasium, the places where we forge our muscles and bones. Literature and martial arts, which one can be spared?

The setting sun quickly slips toward the west. The national flag, its face flushed, climbs down the ten-zhang pole. The heroic bugle calls every young person to stand still, still like iron pillars, protecting our national flag, slowly descending.

At night, the nine hundred acres of land are completely silent. The windows of the dormitories emit light, and our companions are again fighting desperately with knowledge. Literature and martial arts, which one can be spared?

However, I have been separated from this kind of life for three years. That kind of living beauty constantly returns to my eyes. I glance at it, and silently recall it.

Recalling, fantasizing, recalling, fantasizing, I can't help but be shocked. Now, at the top of the ten-zhang pole, I wonder what flag is flying? In the towering dormitories, I wonder what our bookworms and iron-men have become?

But every early morning, the bugle seems to still roar in my ears, and the national flag seems to still flutter between my eyebrows. I can't help but sing the "Morning Meeting Song" from my time at Wu Family Lane. On the drying platform, I stand like an iron pillar, exercising vigorously on my own, as if this one drying platform is equal to the broad field of five hundred acres. Recalling is useless, we need to work, we need to work eternally!
