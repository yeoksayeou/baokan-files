### Stalin's Warning to Democratic Nations

— Fei Ru

According to yesterday's Reuters dispatch in this newspaper, Stalin's speech at the Soviet Communist Party Congress had approximately four main points: (1) the actions of aggressive nations are becoming increasingly active; (2) democratic nations have consistently indulged and appeased the actions of aggressive nations; (3) the policy of indulgence by democratic nations will lead to immense dangers and difficulties; (4) the Soviet Union cannot agree with the politics of the democratic nations. All these points are well-founded, and the enthusiasm for cooperation with democratic nations expressed between the lines is truly worth pondering by all nations in the world, especially Britain, the United States, and France.

The aggressive nations of today, Germany, Italy, and Japan, were only on a fading, faltering path a decade ago, but today they have surprisingly formed the Axis, not only able to stand up to democratic nations but also able to run rampant within the sphere of influence of democratic nations. The main reason for this lies in the policy of indulgence and appeasement by democratic nations such as Britain, the United States, and France. The selfishness of each democratic nation is an even greater reason for the rise of aggressive nations. Starting with Europe, Germany and Italy dared to repeatedly encroach on France, partly because of the complacency and indecisiveness of the French government after Daladier came to power. At the same time, the flattery and wishful thinking of the British government under Chamberlain towards Germany and Italy was also a major factor. In the meantime, Britain and France each had different fantasies, but the result only gave the aggressors a chance to profit. For example, after the conclusion of the Munich Agreement, Britain and France were confident that sacrificing Czechoslovakia could ensure their own peace, and adopting a non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War could avoid German and Italian encroachment. However, the reality was contrary to their ideals. Although the Spanish Civil War has reached its end, and Britain and France have recognized the Franco government, the German and Italian troops stationed in Spain have no intention of withdrawing. Germany and Italy have indicated that they want not only the complete military victory of Franco, but also a complete political victory, which is equivalent to the territory of Spain being effectively jointly ruled by fascist Germany and Italy. Furthermore, how long has it been since the surrounding territories of Czechoslovakia were carved up? Now, the political turmoil in Czechoslovakia has arisen again, and the situation in Slovakia is becoming serious. Newspapers in Berlin are reporting on how Germans living in Czechoslovakia are being mistreated. The Sudeten newspaper even claimed that "several German students were injured in Prague, German homes were destroyed, the German flag was torn, and Czech rioters gathered to demonstrate, shouting 'Down with the Nazi flag!' and 'Welcome Beneš back home!'" This is exactly like the situation in the German public opinion during the unfolding of the Czechoslovakian crisis last September. The aggressors' conspiracies and attacks do not stop because of the indulgence of democratic nations.

Conversely, the strength and cooperation of democratic nations can prevent aggressors from taking further risky actions. President Roosevelt's strong criticism and adoption of tough policies toward aggressors have not only greatly reminded Germany and Japan to reflect on their attacks on Latin America, but have also prevented German and Italian encroachment on France because of the statement "the first line of American defense is in France" and the sale of arms to France. Looking at the East, , if there had been no active reinforcement with the Scottish artillery and other measures, Hong Kong would probably have already become a problem. British and American loans to China have indeed triggered Japan's encroachment through currency warfare against Britain, the United States, and France (see yesterday's editorial in this newspaper), but if economic sanctions by Britain, the United States, and France against Japan can be actively implemented, it can not only curb Japan's aggression but also weaken Germany and Italy's arrogance. Before Japan's "local procurement" plundering has been largely effective, economic sanctions by Britain, the United States, and France are indeed decisive.

The most important step for democratic nations to sanction aggressors is cooperation and courage. The recent attitude of the United States has been the most courageous and the most active. Britain is also gradually following the United States and becoming more active. The most lagging France is also planning to sell a large quantity of arms to China. These are all excellent trends. However, these actions are still limited to indirect methods. As for direct sanctions against Japan, such as the prohibition of Japanese imports and the embargo on resources to Japan, as requested by British members of parliament and ordinary merchants, have not yet been implemented. Greater courage will be needed in the future. Britain cannot simply follow the United States, and France cannot simply follow Chamberlain's lead. Currently, Britain, the United States, and France still maintain a wait-and-see attitude towards the sanctions against aggressive nations. The British-American commercial agreement needs to be further developed, and efforts should be jointly made to ensure that the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty are guaranteed. Furthermore, cooperation between democratic nations and the Soviet Union is very important in curbing aggressive blocs. The arrogance of Germany and Italy is precisely taking advantage of the suspicion of democratic nations towards the Soviet Union. However, the result of the separation between democratic nations and the Soviet Union is that Britain, the United States, and France suffer the most, not the Soviet Union. The facts of the past few years have already proven this. If Britain, the United States, and France truly abandon the "collective security system" in the future, the harm they suffer will be even greater. Stalin's expression of cooperation and courage on behalf of the Soviet Union to the democratic nations of Britain, the United States, and France is worth deep consideration by all democratic nations.

### On the Soviet Union's Future Foreign Policy

The crisis of a great war in which fascist aggressors attack Britain, the United States, and France and divide the world has already dramatically developed. All nations in the world have once again fallen into the threat of an international war. The Soviet Union, praised as the "main pillar of world peace," has convened the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at this time to discuss its entire national policy. It is no accident that this has attracted the attention of friendly nations and . Since the congress has only been in session for four days so far, we cannot predict its outcome. However, in the part of the speech by Soviet leader Stalin on the international situation and foreign policy, there are also very important points related to the future of world peace, which we cannot help but pay special attention to. We dare to briefly state our views to the readers.

Stalin delivered a speech at the congress on the evening of the 10th of this month, first making a very detailed analysis of the international situation. Among them, what is especially noteworthy is the exposure of the fascist aggressors' conspiracy to provoke a great war. Stalin said: "If the authorities of a country wish to provoke a war regardless of any treaties or public opinion, they will suffer a humiliating result. Bourgeois politicians are very clear about this, and so are the fascist chiefs. Therefore, before the fascist chiefs provoke a war, they decided to first create public opinion. The fascist chiefs used the "Anti-Comintern Pact" to try to mislead public opinion. But the clumsiness of this kind of action is already well known to us. No matter what kind of "axis" or "triangular Anti-Comintern Pact," it is not enough to conceal Japan's seizure of most of China's territory, Italy's theft of Abyssinia, Germany's annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland, and Germany and Italy's partition of Spain. In short, war is still war, and everyone can see through the so-called aggressive bloc." (See the Moscow dispatch of the Associated Press on the 11th) What Stalin said is simple and clear. What do those who stubbornly adhere to the "anti-communist" argument, distort and defend Japan's aggressive behavior, and conceal the crisis of national and ethnic subjugation have to say about this?

Another point is the satire and advice to the democratic and peace-loving powers. Stalin first described the errors of the democratic and peace-loving powers' policy of compromise, saying: "Today's war is purely launched by the aggressive countries against Britain, the United States, and France, but the latter retreated and retreated, made concessions and concessions, so that the aggressive countries could openly redistribute the world's spheres of influence, causing non-aggressive countries to suffer sacrifices. Democratic countries not only turned a blind eye but also openly acquiesced. This kind of thing is really hard to believe, but this is indeed the case. For example, the policy of non-intervention is tantamount to acquiescing in aggressive behavior, and pacifism and disarmament plans are all dead and buried. Some say that the Munich Agreement is another way of building a policy of concession. These seemingly plausible and persuasive words are already unbelievable, and even the signatories of the Munich Agreement feel the same way." (Reuters Moscow dispatch on the 11th) Stalin then pointed out the basis of the policy of compromise and non-compliance, saying: "Britain and France failed to resist aggression and planned to instigate war elsewhere, hoping to reap the benefits. They did this not for fear of revolution in their own countries after World War II, but to let Germany and Japan fall into the quagmire of hardship (one of the hardships is conflict with Soviet Russia). In their opinion, after the belligerents had exhausted their strength, the democratic countries could conclude a peace treaty according to the conditions they proposed. For example, European and American authorities planned to incite Germany to invade Ukraine, but they were soon disappointed. Because Germany did not advance eastward, but instead advanced westward to demand colonies." (Associated Press Moscow dispatch on the 11th) Stalin did not explicitly state this here, but he exposed the ugly behavior of German aggressors temporarily abandoning eastward advancement in favor of westward encroachment in light of the Soviet Union's uncompromising policy. Are the various countries of Britain, the United States, and France aware of this and have they learned their lesson?

Secondly, regarding the Soviet Union's foreign policy, Stalin also made extremely important reports, listing four main points: First, "Continue the policy of peace and increase trade with all countries." Second, "Pay attention to not letting those who are accustomed to provoking others to war attempt to drive the Soviet Union into the vortex of international war, so as to be their tool for profit." Third, "Make every effort to consolidate the strength of the army and navy." Fourth, "Strengthen international friendship with all peaceful countries." From this, we can see the future of Soviet diplomacy. The Soviet Union will continue its policy of "not threatening others." This policy will render the fascist aggressors' "Anti-Comintern Pact" without basis, all conspiracies carried out in the name of "anti-communism" will lose their basis, and the relationship between democratic and peace-loving countries such as Britain, France, and the United States and the Soviet Union will have the possibility of further improvement. This is one. At the same time, the Soviet Union will also earnestly implement a policy of "not being threatened by others." The backing for this policy is what Stalin said at the congress: "The Soviet Union should strengthen the combat effectiveness of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force in the future in case of emergency" (Reuters Moscow dispatch on the 11th). The direct impact of this policy will first be to enhance the Soviet Union's prestige in all countries of the world and expand its political influence. This is two. And the so-called "strengthening international friendship with all peaceful countries" is further proof that the Soviet Union will continue to strive to consolidate and expand the peace front, which will make a more significant contribution to promoting the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle to safeguard world peace. This is three.

Finally, what people should most express praise and respect for is what TASS Moscow dispatch on the 11th said, Stalin especially solemnly and clearly stated two points in his report on Soviet foreign policy: One said: "We insist on providing assistance to those who have fallen victim to aggressors and to nations that are fighting for national independence." The other said: "We are not intimidated by aggressors, we are prepared to avenge ourselves, and we will fight to the end with those who attempt to invade the Soviet border and incite its integrity." At a time when a small number of pro-Japanese traitors to the Chinese nation and those who advocate defeatism willingly serve the Japanese aggressors and slander our friendly nations, especially the Soviet Union, after this, they will lose the opportunity to conspire and spread rumors. As for us, we are filled with infinite excitement for the smoother future of the anti-Japanese war!

What is even more noteworthy is that this diplomatic stance and policy of the Soviet Union is by no means Stalin's empty report, but has its facts as a guarantee, such as the Soviet Union's gradually growing economic, political, and cultural strength, such as the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, such as the friendship between the various ethnic groups belonging to the Soviet Union, such as the loyal, brave, and skilled Red Army, Navy, and Air Force, such as the spiritual support of workers in all countries who are most concerned with peace, and such as the gradual recognition of democratic countries, all of which are conditions for the smooth progress of Soviet foreign policy.

### The General Mobilization of the National Spirit: Full Text of the Implementation Outline - A Major Condition for Victory in the War of Resistance, The Newest Weapon for National Salvation and Nation Building

As a result of implementing wartime economic policies based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, the nation should ensure a balanced and rational development of public and private industries after the war. The vast majority of the people, with wartime lives, wartime actions, and wartime spirit, should strive for production and creation to achieve progress and prosperity. Following this path, the establishment of a new nation based on the Three Principles of the People will coincide with the glorious victory in the War of Resistance, and the foundation for China's eternal peace and happiness will be firmly established. A bright future is clearly in sight. This is precisely what our people should aim for, to be excited and work together towards it. The way to achieve this starts with our people steadfastly adhering to a unified national faith.

Spiritual Transformation

The unified morality and belief that the people must establish have already been elucidated. Therefore, we will further explore what kind of sound spirit is suitable for the interests of the nation, ethnicity, and military today, and sufficient to achieve the goals of resisting the war and building the nation. What kind of unhealthy spirit violates this meaning? We will then selectively cultivate or eliminate it, creating a common and consistent good environment, thoroughly transforming the spirit of our people. Broadly speaking, there are the following points:

(A) The lifestyle of living in a drunken dream must be corrected. Life is the foundation of the spirit. Without a rational life, there is no sound spirit. Therefore, the lifestyle of living in a drunken dream, indulging in sensual pleasures and material gains, must be thoroughly corrected, and the tenets of a new life must be implemented. Otherwise, not only will the individual's spirit be exhausted, harming themselves and the country, but it will also lead to a prevailing trend, causing the entire society to present a picture of national ruin, inviting the contempt of the world and the intrusion of enemies, which is not only harmful to the nation but also affects military affairs.

(B) A spirit of vigor and vitality must be cultivated. Second only to the lifestyle of living in a drunken dream as a minor thief of the national spirit is the atmosphere of depression and decadence. The existence of this atmosphere is caused by both psychological and physiological factors. Psychologically, it is due to the lack of national self-confidence and individual self-reliance. Some believe that the nation has no hope of revival, while others see the revival of the nation as unrelated to themselves. If these two mindsets are not corrected, the people's vigor and vitality cannot be cultivated. Physiologically, exercise, hygiene, orderliness, cleanliness, and even the habit of waking up early must be promoted and implemented. Only then can the people's spirit be enriched and their vigor revitalized, so they can undertake extraordinary revolutionary undertakings.

(C) The habit of living for the moment must be eradicated. There is a spiritual phenomenon in the War of Resistance that must be paid attention to. That is, the people in the front lack the determination to swear revenge to the death, and the personnel in the rear have selfish plans to avoid difficulties and seek ease. The former phenomenon reduces the number of national warriors and weakens the will to fight. The motive is that the concept of national supremacy is not firmly established, and the habit of living for the moment still exists. To correct the former phenomenon, the doctrine of great revenge must be clarified. The so-called "avenging the country, even after a hundred generations" should ensure that the people who have fallen into lost territory never forget the concept of national supremacy and ethnic supremacy. To correct the latter phenomenon, the spirit of "sacrificing life in danger" should be promoted, and the loyalty of those who died in the line of duty should be commended. Moreover, discipline must be strictly enforced and righteousness promoted, so that everyone regards evading duty and secretly seeking safety as the greatest shame. Only then can the spirit of revolution be established.

(D) Selfish and self-serving desires must be broken. Only seeking to preserve one's own life and property, increasing one's own fame, position, and profit, without regard for the interests and survival of the entire nation, is like those who have military power wanting to preserve their strength and territory, a selfish motive. Fulfilling this selfish mentality will inevitably lead to private opinions being higher than everything, and private interests being higher than everything. Even the expansion and satisfaction of personal reputation, status, rights, and desires must come first. At its extreme, it will inevitably sacrifice national interests and undermine the War of Resistance plan. Now, at a time when the War of Resistance is fierce and survival hangs in the balance, if one is still not self-aware, how unwise and unkind is that? Under the goal of the General Mobilization of the National Spirit, this entrenched habit must be eliminated. The authority of public opinion should be promoted and used to the greatest extent to point out and stop it, striving to eliminate private opinions and contribute one's heart and soul, returning to the utmost fairness and sincerity.

(E) Confused and mixed thoughts must be corrected. Since the War of Resistance, the thoughts and opinions of the entire country have fundamentally formed a unity, but there are still many branches and leaves that are divided. If they are allowed to exist in a mixed manner, it will inevitably lead the people's minds to be dispersed and cause disadvantages to the war. Therefore, it is necessary to establish standards and correct them separately under the principles of national and ethnic supremacy, military victory first, and concentration of will and strength, so that the foundation of unity can be further consolidated. It is also necessary to actively guide and create the same country, so that our people and youth have the same ideals for the future of the country in their understanding, and strive for the same goal in their actions. This is not only to achieve victory with one heart and one mind, but also to create a permanent unity of the whole country after the war and avoid divisions and chaos. These standards should be based on the needs of the current situation and the interests of the people, which should be accepted and gladly accepted by the people of the whole country. To summarize, they are: (1) The Three Principles of the People, which violate the basic principles of national revolution; (2) Words that do not encourage transcendence of ethnicity and harm the absoluteness of the country; (3) Do not undermine the unity of military and political orders and administrative systems; (4) Do not use the situation of the War of Resistance to achieve any intentions other than the interests of the country and ethnicity. All thoughts and opinions should take this as a guide. If they violate this meaning, they should be rejected as a whole. If they are in accordance with this meaning, they should be encouraged in many ways, striving to develop and flourish from this foundation and become a trend.

The above five points are only the main ones. To achieve the thorough transformation of the national spirit, we must further promote and broaden it. First, we must seek the enrichment of the national spirit, then the concentration of the national spirit, and even more so the revolutionary transformation of the national spirit. The so-called enrichment means making it vigorous, vibrant, strong, and firm, with the power to overcome the environment and resist difficulties. The so-called concentration means seeking its close unity, with one heart and one mind, turning the multitude into a fortress, to the point of absolute sharing of weal and woe and never being separated. The so-called revolutionary transformation means dedicating oneself to the revolutionary cause based on the supreme concept of loving the nation and the country. Internally, it means being loyal to the government and the doctrine, and externally, it means resisting the country. It must be that wealth and status cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot change, and power and force cannot subdue. Furthermore, this spirit should be used to influence compatriots, and even more so to use spirit to defeat the enemy country. The transformation of our national spirit, if it truly reaches these three standards, then the goal of the General Mobilization of our National Spirit can be said to be complete.

Mobilization Leadership

The target of the General Mobilization of the National Spirit is the entire population, but the following categories of personnel are primarily responsible for advocating and implementing it:

(1) Party members and civil servants: Our party inherits the legacy of the Prime Minister and implements the national revolution. During the period when the revolution has not yet been completed, our party bears the responsibility for the government's administration. Now that many provinces and regions have fallen into the hands of the enemy, and millions of people have been devastated, how should our party members blame and encourage themselves, and earnestly examine whether their public and private actions are sufficient to serve as a model for the general public? At the beginning of the implementation of the General Mobilization of the National Spirit, it must first be carried out by the party members. Each party member must possess moral practice and be worthy of the heavenly duty in this extraordinary period. Compared with the general public, they must be more diligent and frugal, and more brave and sacrificial. This is in terms of party members. As for civil servants, especially administrative officials at all levels and local autonomous personnel, they bear the important responsibility of implementing administrative orders, coordinating the military and the people, and enriching military preparations. Their spirit and actions must be sufficient to gain the trust of the people and serve as a model for the people. Therefore, the implementation of the General Mobilization of the National Spirit must first be carried out by civil servants in addition to party members, in order to advocate it among the general public.

(2) All soldiers: All our soldiers should uniformly recognize the duty of soldiers, not only in fighting against the enemy army, but also knowing that the army represents the prestige of the country and the soldiers should represent the national spirit. Moreover, in today's China, where all popular organizations have not yet been completed, the national army is the center of national strength. Therefore, soldiers must become the center of national belief in morality. Today, the heavy responsibility of saving the country and the nation rests entirely on the shoulders of our soldiers. Therefore, all our generals and soldiers must first implement the General Mobilization of the Military Spirit. All our soldiers should absolutely possess the morality of saving the country and the belief in building the country, possess the sound spirit necessary for resisting the war and reviving the country, be loyal and filial, and never forget it. They must also show benevolence to their compatriots, be trustworthy to their superiors, comrades, and subordinates, and finally, they must value humanity and discipline, in order to promote our nation's inherent lofty ideals of peace. If all the soldiers of the country unanimously practice the General Mobilization of the Spirit and promote the glory of China's inherent morality, then the power of this kind of thing will be immeasurable when expressed in military affairs, and the compatriots of the whole country will undoubtedly take action and respond unanimously.

(3) Leaders from all walks of life across the country: When we implement the General Mobilization of the Spirit, we hope even more that the leaders of the cultural, industrial, religious, and various occupational groups across the country, as well as the backbones of society and the respected elders in various places, will sympathize with the purpose of the General Mobilization of the National Spirit, and advocate it in person. Since the War of Resistance, the wise men of the country have done their best to be the backing of the national military, and their contributions have been very great. The various cultural undertakings and industries in the war zones have been destroyed, and the sacrifices they have suffered have been enormous. In the future, the difficulties and hardships of the country will deepen even more. To date, the spiritual strength shown by all sectors of society is not sufficient to meet the current needs of the country. We sincerely hope that they will take another step and take the lead in implementing the General Mobilization of the Spirit, with one heart and one mind, and contribute all their strength to the country and the nation. If leaders and backbones from all walks of life can practice it in person and advocate it, then the people in various localities and occupational departments will have more reason to follow suit and a trend will arise. As for the people in the cultural and speech circles and writers, it is even more hoped that they will examine the responsibility for the safety of the country and the rise and fall of the nation. The fortunes and misfortunes of a hundred generations and the rise and fall of a thousand years all depend on whether the leaders of all walks of life can accept the "virtue" of the General Mobilization of the Spirit at this time and fight together for it.

(4) The youth of the whole country are the lifeblood of the country. We have deep expectations for the youth who have received and are currently receiving education across the country, regardless of whether they have dropped out of school or are unemployed. The fate of the country and the nation in the future depends entirely on the youth, and today it also depends on the youth's dedication and efforts. Japan wants to conquer China, and what it hates most is the youth of China. Therefore, in the enemy-occupied areas, countless youths have lost their lives and suffered misfortunes. Since the rise of the army, there have been many youths in the front and rear who have endured hunger and cold and worked diligently. This is what the country should especially cherish and supervise. Today, when the General Mobilization of the National Spirit is implemented, we sincerely hope that the youth of the whole country will uniformly participate, and become enthusiastic advocates among the general public. We especially hope that our youth across the country will unanimously practice the inherent national salvation morality of China, and unanimously believe in the Three Principles of the People, without division, without doubt, without decadence, and without self-abandonment. Unanimously believe in the supreme principles of national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, military first, and victory first, and work together to engage in the struggle to resist the war and revive the country.

Mobilization Implementation

The implementation of spiritual mobilization largely depends on the self-awareness of each citizen's conscience, and mutual encouragement and enlightenment are the means to help them become aware. As for discipline and correction, it should only be used to assist what enlightenment and persuasion cannot achieve. Therefore, the main work focuses on the combination of advocacy and official propaganda and education. As for the actual implementation, it is necessary to first measure the effect of each work, whether it can be as expected, and then respond accordingly and make every effort to seek simple, rapid, and reliable methods. Avoid official formalities and cumbersome procedures, and use existing organizations and natural methods to guide the situation, so as not to disturb the people, waste time, and hinder the cause. Now, the implementation aspects are divided into the main body of decoration, the steps of implementation, the methods of implementation, and the matters of implementation, which are described separately.

Implementing Entities

The work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit should be carried out by the Party, the government, and the people, working together to achieve thoroughness. (1) On the Party side, on the one hand, urge the affiliated party members to uniformly implement the General Mobilization of the Spirit and conduct assessment and training. On the other hand, lead the party departments and party members at all levels, and also contact cultural institutions, using various propaganda methods to publicize the essentials of the General Mobilization of the Spirit to the entire population. Negatively, correct the errors in the people's thoughts and speeches. Positively, provide the theory for promoting the General Mobilization of the Spirit. (2) On the government side, uniformly reform the bad habits of society's decadence and slackness, and ban the lifestyle of drunken dreams. On the one hand, supervise the civil servants and local autonomous personnel under their jurisdiction to implement the General Mobilization of the Spirit and popularize it among the entire population. At the same time, guide schools at all levels to implement the education of the General Mobilization of the Spirit. (3) On the military side, on the one hand, the political departments at all levels stipulate that the General Mobilization of the Spirit is the main subject of spiritual education for soldiers, and also undertake the promotion of the General Mobilization of the Spirit among the people. On the other hand, the commanders of the units at all levels, level by level, realize the actual work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit, as well as all the soldiers. (4) On the social side, various cultural groups, popular groups, occupational groups, and various magazines and museums should unanimously use the essentials of the General Mobilization of the Spirit to assist the party, government, and military in the work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit, so that it can be widely and thoroughly implemented effectively. (5) On the national side, on the one hand, create an environment for promoting the key items of the General Mobilization of the Spirit (such as practicing frugality, hard work, and hygiene and waking up early). On the other hand, the ways to encourage each other from father to son and brother to brother, and to promote all members of the family to work hard for the great purpose of resisting the war and reviving the country. And to generally develop the concept of national interests being higher than family interests. (6) Responsible backbone, the people who are responsible for promoting the General Mobilization of the Spirit should be the leaders at all levels in the government and troops, the heads of families in the family, the principals and teachers in the school, the chairmen in the group, the editors in the magazines, and the county magistrates, township heads, and baojia chiefs in the county, district, and village. These are all the brains of the group and the backbone of the cause. On the one hand, it is necessary to require them to lead by example and transform the trend. At the same time, it is also necessary to regard the General Mobilization of the Spirit as a necessary duty and implement it in all their undertakings.

Implementation Plan

In addition to setting up a guidance and promotion agency for the General Mobilization of the Spirit to implement the planning and assessment of the work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit, as well as the interpretation of the outline and the supplementation of the methods, the party, government, military, and civilian agencies and organizations should implement it in accordance with the following steps:

(1) Formulate specific plans: The supervisors and persons in charge of the party, government, military, and civilian agencies and organizations should formulate systematic and orderly plans in accordance with the instructions of the General Mobilization of the Spirit, according to the nature of the matters listed, which belong to their own duties or scope of work, and implement them earnestly.

(2) Realize the members of the subordinate: The senior agencies or organizations of the party, government, military, and civilians should first supervise the personnel directly under their jurisdiction to implement it uniformly. On the other hand, they should mobilize all lower-level agencies, take the opportunity of small group meetings, etc., formulate appropriate methods according to the actual environment, and implement them earnestly. It is necessary to urge each level and use competition and inspection methods to learn from each other, and to truly realize it in every member of the subordinate, in order to popularize it among the general public.

(3) Use inherent groups: In addition to the people's organizations and cultural institutions directly led or administered by the party and government agencies, it is also appropriate to make full use of other inherent groups in the society, such as religious groups, hometown groups, and trade groups, to assist in promoting the work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit.

(4) Pay attention to liaison and progress: The promotion of the General Mobilization of the Spirit in various places should be based on the principle that the party, government, military, and civilian agencies and organizations should do their best to promote it in accordance with the established plan. If the nature of the matters involves general or multiple aspects, they should be linked together and cooperate in carrying out the work.

Implementation Work

The work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit can be divided into the following four types according to its nature:

(1) Publicity and initiation: It includes the promptness of the essentials of the General Mobilization of the Spirit, the establishment of the national concept, the promotion of national morality, the establishment of the confidence of victory, the correction of wrong speeches, the transformation of rebellious psychology, and the elaboration and explanation of the theory and practice of the General Mobilization of the Spirit. This work should be carried out by the party departments, propaganda departments, political departments of the troops, newspapers, schools, cultural institutions, groups, etc.

(2) Training and improvement: Publicity and initiation are only the first step of the General Mobilization of the Spirit, followed by training and improvement. For example, the errors in the people's thoughts have been enlightened by means of publicity, and then training methods such as gatherings must be used to sharpen each other's revolutionary personality, establish the awareness of resisting the war, discuss the world situation, study the rise and fall of the country, the rise and fall of the nation, and the historical facts of the enemy's foreign troubles, so as to advance the enrichment and unity of the spirit together. For example, the people's will has been declined, and the shortcomings have been pointed out by publicity, and then military training must be promoted to promote hygiene and promote new life, so as to improve the work of the people's body and mind. This work should be implemented by the party departments, social departments, political departments of the troops, educational institutions, schools, etc.

(3) Supervision and persuasion: Although the promotion of the General Mobilization of the Spirit originates from top to bottom, the real and genuine effect must rely on the mutual supervision and encouragement of the people. In the family, family members and brothers should remind and encourage each other. In the customs and groups, all members should sharpen and learn from each other. In the society, regardless of their status, they should supervise and encourage each other in the relationship between comrades and compatriots. Even to those with higher status, if there are thoughts, speeches, and actions that violate the spirit, they should sincerely persuade them to reform from the standpoint of the country and the nation.

(4) Research and promotion: All work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit is not only to respond to the story, nor is it to be satisfied by simply following the usual common sense. It must have the spirit of research and initiation. Today is an extraordinary period, so there must be extraordinary work to adapt to it, and if you want to have extraordinary work, you must have extraordinary research and design. Therefore, in order to seek the long-term progress of the various work of the General Mobilization of the Spirit, it depends on the concerted efforts of all sectors of the party, government, military, and civilians to research and promote it.

Implementation Matters

The matters of the General Mobilization of the Spirit are based on the above-mentioned sections on spiritual improvement, and the following matters are shown as a brief example for analogizing and generalizing. Detailed sub-items need to be supplemented. They are described separately as follows: 1. Regarding the correction of life: (1) Rectify the daily life of the people, and take away all improper entertainment. (2) Ban extravagance and all unnecessary expenses.

Conclusion

As described above, the content and implementation outline of the General Mobilization of the Spirit have been briefly presented here. Finally, there are three points that must be told to those who are responsible for implementing the General Mobilization of the Spirit, namely,

(1) The implementation of the General Mobilization of the Spirit must be thorough from the inside out and the whole innovation. Do not let trivial matters breed harm to the people's spirit. Therefore, we should check our body and mind and strive to overcome it. We must pay attention to the initial germination of wrong habits and start with the small details of life.

(2) It must be sought that its effect will last for a long time. The General Mobilization of the Spirit is by no means merely relying on the encouragement of temporary blood and emotions to produce five minutes of national salvation enthusiasm. It is necessary to deeply implant the supreme concept of the country and the nation in the minds of the people, and it is necessary to verify it in daily life and behavior, so that there is no guilt in the heart, and then it can not exceed the fine details temporarily.

(3) The establishment of the ethnic spirit must be firm, persevering, and unswerving. If it is swayed by external oppression and temptation, then this spirit is still not enough to complete extraordinary things. Therefore, all revolutionary theories of life must be thoroughly advocated, which is what should be paid attention to during implementation.

In short, the General Mobilization of the National Spirit is the main condition for victory in the war and the latest weapon for national salvation and nation building. Today, the people of China, unless they are absolutely numb to feelings, do not have the blood and sincere thoughts of grief for the dangerous situation of the country and the suffering people. Then, identify the goals, and strive forward together. Not only do they fulfill their national duties, but they also seek the highest comfort in life, and the future bright and brilliant destiny of the country and the nation for thousands of years will surely begin here. I hope that my comrades will rise up together. (End)

Direct Formal Flight Between China and Vietnam, Can Be Completed in One Day, External Air Routes Are Unobstructed 【Associated Press, Chongqing, 13th】 China National Aviation Corporation recently announced that the direct passenger and mail air route from Chongqing to Hanoi, after successful testing, is now scheduled to officially open tomorrow with Douglas aircraft. The entire journey can be completed within one day, with a short stop only in Kunming. The passenger fare is 450 silver dollars. The company also stated that the airport at Lashio is still under construction. The airport area is too small, so the air service from Chongqing to Rangoon cannot be implemented soon, and the reason also lies in this. The company's aircraft and other equipment are very sufficient, only waiting for the completion of the airport before it can start flying. In a few weeks, there will be four air routes operating between Chongqing and the outside world: (1) Chongqing-Hong Kong route, connecting the Pan American Company's trans-Pacific route; (2) Chongqing-Hanoi route, connecting the French air route; (3) Chongqing-Rangoon route, connecting the British Imperial route; (4) Chongqing-Hami route, connecting the Soviet route.
【Central News Agency, Chengdu, 13th】 The Ministry of Communications has decided that the long-distance telephone service between Chengdu and Kunming will be officially opened for business starting from the 15th.
Legal Authorities Denounce × Rumors 【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th and 12th】 Shanghai News: It is reported that the French Concession Police Station yesterday ordered residents in the concession to take down the Chinese national flag. Local authorities in the concession specifically issued a statement denying this, saying that yesterday was the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, and the Chinese national flag in the French Concession and the International Settlement were all lowered to half-mast in mourning.
Tianjin Concession Lockdown Incident, × Attitude is Overbearing, Reply Cites Self-Defense, Pressuring the Concession to Yield 【Reuters, Shanghai, 13th】 It is learned that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have recently set up various defensive structures in the area, turning the British and French concessions into concentration camps. The British and French consuls have submitted a note to the Japanese side requesting an explanation. The Japanese authorities have replied, stating, "This is a self-defense action." The British and French concession authorities have failed to cooperate sincerely with the Japanese side, causing the concession to often be a base for anti-Japanese elements. The Japanese side's establishment of defenses on the streets of Tianjin is purely for self-defense. If the British and French authorities can cooperate with the Japanese side to maintain peace, then this action can be terminated. The reason for the Japanese side's adoption of this measure is that, when necessary, it can isolate anti-Japanese elements in the concession from contacts outside the concession.
Han × Searches American Consul's Car 【Associated Press, Hankou, 13th】 The car of the American Consul-General here was recently stopped and searched by Japanese military police. Japanese officials are investigating the matter.

In the four months since taking office, his administrative spirit and work performance have shown excellent results. All measures have been able to address the crux of the matter and are determined to reform. He expressed deep satisfaction and specifically telegraphed Chairman Wu of the Guizhou Provincial Government to issue a commendation.
Japanese Political Parties Worry About the International Situation, Plan to Raise Joint Demands to Awaken Government Attention 【Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th】 It is reported that leaders of various political parties in the Japanese Parliament plan to unite and demand that the government adopt a more convenient attitude toward domestic and foreign affairs, strengthen the application of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and are now considering the current trend of various countries tending to aid China in order to find ways to deal with it.
【Reuters, Tokyo, 13th】 Japan's new budget for 1939-1940 reaches 1,041 million yuan, including a general budget of 369.4 million yuan, special war expenses for China of 460.5 million yuan, and additional budgets for the Army and Navy of 91 million yuan.
600,000 Refugees, Divided into Areas for Cultivation, Interview with Staff of the Relief Commission 【Associated Press, Chongqing, 13th】 A member of the Relief Commission, in an interview with the Associated Press, said, "Since the start of the war, one-third of our country's population, about 160 million people, have been directly affected by the war. The government has done its best to provide relief. As of this month, 600,000 people have obtained land, money, agricultural tools, seeds, etc. due to government assistance and can engage in production and maintain their lives. These 600,000 people are divided into northern Fujian, southern Jiangsu, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan and other places, adopting collective farming methods like those in the Soviet Union. The government has now established several reclamation areas to accommodate refugees from various places. The government also provides refugees with engineering skills training to enable them to participate in the construction of highways, railways, etc. in the northwest and southwest."

It is claimed that 70 Red Army soldiers crossed into the puppet territory at a certain place and built defensive works, immediately engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese army. After one hour, they were driven back by the Japanese army. The Japanese army suffered four casualties. The puppet "Manchukuo government" immediately lodged a serious protest with Moscow.
The Situation of the War in South China and International Relations, Interview with Sun Yat-sen's Son 【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper】 Since the × army landed on Hainan, great resentment has arisen internationally. Yesterday, our reporter specifically visited Chen Youren to inquire about his views. Mr. Chen kindly gave the following interview.
Mr. Chen said: "The × side, due to brewing changes in the European situation, is trying to temporarily end the so-called 'China Incident.' However, as long as the regular resistance forces in the southwest exist for one day, the × side will not be able to achieve its dream. As long as armaments can continue to be imported from Yunnan, our country can still use our strong manpower to sustain the war of resistance.
The × people's occupation of Hainan this time is, on the one hand, to prepare to cope with changes in the European situation, planning to turn Hainan into a second Taiwan, as a base for naval, land, and air forces, threatening Britain, France, and the United States. On the other hand, they intend to use Hainan as a base to attempt to invade Guangxi, and then use air power to control Yunnan, threatening the two major routes of our southwest international transport.
Taiwan is 600 miles away from Nanning, and Hainan is only 300 miles away from Nanning. We must pay attention to the × people's attempt to invade Guangxi after occupying Hainan.
The current countermeasures should be considered from the perspective of the sea and air forces. To deal with the × people at sea, we can only rely on the joint fleet of Britain and the United States. This is obviously beyond the ability of our authorities. However, in terms of air power, if we can seek the full cooperation of the Soviet Union today, so that we can confront × in the air, our authorities may be able to do this.
At a minimum, only the Soviet Union can provide large-scale air force assistance to our war of resistance within a year. If we can get this, the doomsday of the × people is coming."
Jin in Struggle, Politics, Economics, Culture, Civil Movement (Part 2) Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shanxi War Zone Correspondence
The Self-Defense Forces here are under the system of the National Salvation Association. But of course they also listen to the command of the county government. They are all automatically joined by the people. In addition to the Self-Defense Forces, there are also stretcher teams, transportation teams, etc. They are training in the playground day and night. In villages close to the front line, the Self-Defense Forces also come out to stand guard and check suspicious pedestrians. In the Self-Defense Forces of the village cities, sometimes they also stand guard with the police at the city gates.
The mass movement is widely developed here. The highest organization for mobilizing the masses here is the county's General Mobilization Association. The General Mobilization Association is organized by the County Government Sacrifice Public Association and various mass organizations. Under the General Mobilization Committee, there are organizations such as the Farmers' Salvation, Women's Salvation, Workers' Salvation, and Youth Salvation. At the ferry crossings along the Yellow River, the dockworkers' union is also organized. The highest salvation organization in the countryside is the village National Salvation Association. Under the village National Salvation Association, there is a grain seed organization, and it also governs the village's Self-Defense Force and stretcher team.
The so-called Sacrifice Public Association is the abbreviation of the Sacrifice Salvation Group Alliance and the Advocacy of Justice and Solidarity Joint Working Committee. In the past, the Sacrifice Alliance and the Advocacy of Justice were not subordinate agencies. After the start of the war of resistance, Mr. Yan used the form of a joint of these two agencies to form a working committee to promote local work. Every county has an organization of the Sacrifice Public Association, jointly organized by the Sacrifice Alliance Civil Movement Special Commissioner and the Advocacy of Justice Group Leader. Under the County Working Committee, according to the scope of work, several District Committees are formed to promote civil movement work in districts. Above the County Working Committee, Central District Working Committees are formed according to the regional areas of work. The responsible persons are all active and promising young people; but some local workers are not doing very well because of their political level and experience. However, under long-term work, they will gradually enrich themselves.
Because of the low cultural level and poor living conditions of the people here, some are not very enthusiastic about participating in the war of resistance, such as not wanting to join the Self-Defense Forces and being somewhat afraid of the army. However, most have stood up. They are working day and night in all tasks and persuading those who are unwilling to participate in the war of resistance. Here, the county government has established local cadre training classes to train village chiefs, neighborhood chiefs, and Self-Defense Force captains, and this effect is now being achieved.
The troops stationed in the Xinan area are also doing civil movement work. The more significant achievements include the working team of the Forward Headquarters of the Second War Zone, the propaganda team of the 31st Army Corps, and the wartime service group of the 38th Army.
In addition to the Self-Defense Force, there are also some armed masses here. The most prominent is the guerrilla force led by Wu ××, a soldier of the Eighth Route Army, active in the border areas of Pinglu and Xia County. In addition, there are some Red Spear Societies active in the rear of the × people. There are many kinds of Red Spear Societies, such as the Red Spear Society, the Cover Spear Society, and the Yellow Spear Society. They are all farmers in the rear of the ×, an armed organization launched to protect their homes. Some of the slogans they have put forward are not to fight against the Japanese army or the National Army. Therefore, recently the × side has sent people to work in these teams, which is a dangerous thing. We are also actively working to win them over.
Finally, let me talk about the situation of women here! The women's movement has still failed to develop well here. Indeed, the legacy of feudalism is too deep for them. In the towns, it is difficult to see a woman on the street. In the countryside, women are always deeply hidden. Therefore, the work of the Women's Salvation is not easy to develop.
The × people, for Jinan, which has grabbed its tail, naturally cannot be careless. It uses various methods to destroy it. It wants to buy over the Red Spear Society; it does civil movement work, using methods such as compensating for house prices and sending food to lure the people back to the occupied areas, and implementing military raids.
But the × people's destructive tactics are not easy to take effect. We also send people to work in the Red Spear Society and hold grand and extensive anti-× people's work propaganda. As for military actions, we are not afraid. At the end of last month, our ××× army launched a large-scale attack to cooperate with the Yingxi war, attracting the × people who were transporting security to Jixian and Daning in western Jin. Therefore, the × people's attempt to cross the river from western Jin was shattered under the pincer attack from both western and southern Jin. Later, in order to take revenge, the × people launched a large-scale attack on our inner city at the beginning of the month. Our ××× Brigade suffered some casualties, but as a result of the counterattack by the × Shi × Army, the inner city was recaptured. The × people only ended up losing soldiers and generals!
Southern Jin in Struggle is growing stronger in the fire. It stubbornly flies the blue sky and white sun flag. It is not only our base for resisting Japan, but also a shield for the Central Plains and the Northwest. It is always struggling. I use this to comfort the compatriots who care about Shanxi!

Youth Wartime Work in the Fifth War Zone By Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya
In this magnificent war of resistance, many steel-like promising young people have been forged. This war of resistance melting pot, formed by four thousand years of history and culture, has erupted with bright and brilliant sparks because tens of thousands of young people have constantly thrown themselves into the furnace. At the same time, these tens of thousands of young people have also been fortunate to throw themselves into the melting pot, and have begun to be forged into the cement and steel bones for the restoration and construction of the country and nation.
First, let's talk about the Fifth War Zone. During the Battle of Xuzhou, about 3,000 young people were trained and stood out there. During the Battle of Wuhan, more than 4,000 graduated from the Huangchuan Youth Army—later renamed the Wartime Work Training Corps. Recently, 1,800 people have been trained and assigned to work by the Political Department of the Commander-in-Chief, plus members of the wartime youth service teams established by other armies and divisions, the total number should be at least over 10,000.
These large numbers of young people, they (every one of them) have a pure patriotic heart, a high degree of political awareness, and rich military knowledge. When Xuzhou and Wuhan were withdrawn one after another, they decided to stay in northern Jiangsu and the Dabie Mountains, Tongbai Mountains into the Hongshan Mountains, and still do political work behind the enemy lines. Especially those in the border area of Anhui and Henan, when they were trained in Huangchuan, they were sent to various counties to practice, in order to identify the terrain, contact the local people, and integrate with the lives of the people. After the large army withdrew, luring the enemy deep, they still had to hide their talents and actively develop their work. Some fought as guerrillas, some were promoted to county magistrates, some organized and trained the people, some destroyed the enemy's transportation, some attacked traitors' agencies... They were all vigorously establishing great achievements, and telegrams were flying in all directions, reporting victories.
Practical experience tells general political workers that the work behind enemy lines is easy to develop, no different from the vastness of the sea and sky, allowing you to fly high and far, and do whatever you want. Therefore, the political workers in the Sangfan area are constantly requesting to the responsible agency to be assigned to work behind enemy lines.
"Those of the same mind seek each other, and those of the same voice respond to each other." The responsible persons of the guerrilla teams in various areas behind enemy lines also very much need such political workers to help and lead. However, according to Mr. Wei Yongcheng, director of the Political Department of the Commander-in-Chief here: the Fifth War Zone has tens of thousands of troops stationed there, and the department currently has 1,800 political workers. It still feels that it is not enough to be distributed. The needs of the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines cannot be met. In this way, if the ambitious young people who are still hesitating and watching in the rear can boldly fly and follow the above-mentioned youth pioneers, and go to various war zones and behind enemy lines to participate in actual work, you will never feel "heroes have no place to use their strength" and be disappointed.
Hardworking, enduring, and brave young women are especially needed in the war zone. This is also derived from experience. The power of female political workers is sometimes even greater than that of men. Some are really able to work, such as going to the countryside, worshiping the old women as godmothers, and swearing brotherhood with the middle-aged women. They will be welcomed with surprise and joy. Then the godmothers will ask them to hold meetings, and the goddaughters will ask them to send men to the army. They will also come to ask these dry relatives for advice on what new events have occurred; of course, these resourceful young women are also very qualified to be their guiding lights in extraordinary times.
Sometimes, because of night walking or other important matters, it is necessary to knock on the doors of the common people in the dark. Soldiers cannot do it, but if female comrades go to knock, they will surely answer and open the door. The political work wonders of female comrades are indeed too numerous to mention.
They (female comrades) also have the spirit of self-sacrifice of "if I don't go to hell, who will?" Ms. Shang Luoyun, a graduate of Peking University from the Guangxi Student Army, is a representative of this. When the Political Department trained 500 young men and women and assigned them to be instructors of a company, they were all willing to be sent to work in difficult places. Ms. Shang even requested to be sent to the worst company. She really has a way. She takes care of the soldiers when they are sick, giving them medicine, and mending their clothes when they are torn, or teaching them to sew themselves. In less than a few weeks, she transformed the soldiers of that company, who were almost all scoundrels, into little students in the classroom, listening and obeying her guidance.
The "Laboring Women's Service Corps" led by female writer Hu Lanqi is almost entirely composed of female workers from Shanghai. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, they have followed the ×× Army Corps, serving in another war zone until now, and have won general praise. Among them, there are several little sisters who are fifteen or sixteen years old (only fourteen or fifteen at the time of the January 28th Incident). Outwardly, they seem no different from each other, but on their merit books for "suppressing traitors," they are almost filled with the names of the little sisters. It can be seen that the various kinds of beautiful trophies standing on the front line are not necessarily taken away by young people who have received education like Ms. Shang.
In addition, there are also some Korean youths who have emerged as a surprise force, also organized into "Korean Youth Work Corps" and "Korean Volunteer Army" and other fresh troops, doing the same sacred work of anti-Japanese resistance in our youth work camps in various war zones.
The Korean Youth Work Corps is probably composed of "Korean Youth Vanguard Alliance" and "Revolutionary Youth Group." The Korean Volunteer Army is indeed organized by the "Korean National Front Alliance." And the Korean National Front Alliance is composed of the "Korean National Revolutionary Party," "Korean Revolutionaries Alliance," "Korean National Liberation Alliance," and "Korean Youth Vanguard Alliance." Therefore, the organization, the Korean Volunteer Army, has as many as ××× people, divided into ×× district teams. The entire team belongs to the Korean Volunteer Army Guidance Committee, composed of four representatives of the Korean National Alliance and four representatives of the Political Department of the Chinese Military Commission. Their main task is to overthrow ×× imperialism, restore the Korean nation... and realize permanent peace in East Asia. Temporarily, they are working to promote propaganda to the × in our war zone, and are preparing to carry out activities behind the enemy lines.
Each war zone has some of their activities and achievements, such as in the Xiangyang area, they have given many speeches to our people, although they do not speak very fluently, but their propaganda attitude, as if they were crying with grief, and the actual data of the tragic suffering of national subjugation, were very moving to our compatriots.
On the walls of Xiangyang, in the city gate caves, and on the walls of other public offices, one by one, lively slogans jumped into people's eyes, causing you some strange feelings: "Establish a united front between the Chinese and Korean nations"; "Chinese and Korean nations unite to overthrow Japanese imperialism"; "Overthrow the traitor of the Eastern Revolution, Wang Jingwei," etc. were also written by the Korean Volunteer Army. In addition, there is a kind of wall newspaper, with concise and understandable sentences and illustrations full of satire, which often attracts a group of people to watch. This is probably not due to the Chinese people's love of novelty!
The content of their wall newspapers, in addition to reporting the front-line battles and international news related to the Sino-Japanese War, in the comments column, they can also seize important current affairs issues at any time, briefly express correct views, and the general propaganda meaning is nothing more than to encourage our compatriots to support the long-term war of resistance, strive for the final victory, and hope that the awakened youth of China, Japan, and Korea will organize a vast volunteer army to jointly overthrow the ×× fascist military customs and establish a true and lasting peace in East Asia.

It is said that military figures and part of the General Staff will participate in the matter, and the plan will also be extended to the Slovak region.
【Associated Press, Czech Capital, 13th】 The Czech cabinet is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting at 5 pm today to discuss the situation in Slovakia. According to general opinion, some or all cabinet members may resign within days.
【Reuters, Czech Capital, 13th】 Tiso, the recently dismissed Slovak Prime Minister, accepted Hitler's invitation today and traveled to Berlin by car. It is said that the Czech government and the Slovak government have also agreed to Tiso's trip.
【Berlin, 12th】 Hitler met with Ribbentrop and other senior officials today to discuss the Slovak incident. According to reliable sources, Hitler decided to wait and see how the situation develops before deciding what steps to take. The Nazi Party believes that the Czech government's dismissal of Tiso and his staff is tantamount to deceiving Germany. Hitler will not tolerate this act of undermining the Munich and Vienna agreements.
【Reuters, Berlin, 12th】 German officials are still silent on the Czech issue, but express extreme attention. The attitude of the newspapers is also consistent with that of the officials, but the headlines for the Czech disputes often use phrases such as "Czech terror rediscovered" or "Czech repeats past mistakes."
【Reuters, Berlin, 12th】 News of the mistreatment of Germans in the Czech Republic is pouring in like snowflakes, reminding people of the events of last September. According to newspaper reports, some Germans were injured and the windows of German shops were also destroyed. The German News Agency said that Czech troops attacked the Link Guard in Praskou with bayonets, resulting in 11 injuries. Now the former Sudeten German Party's organ newspaper "Zeitung," published in Prague, said that many German students in Prague were beaten by the police. Czechs also forcibly removed and tore up the Nazi Party emblem hung in the residence of a German in Brühl. A German worker was beaten to the ground, and the crowd shouted slogans such as "Down with the Nazi Party" and "Benes returns to the Czech Republic, giving the Germans a taste of their own medicine," while singing the song "Germans under thunderstorms," which roughly means extreme anti-German. The newspaper ended by saying that Prague is now discussing a plan to welcome Benes back to the country this week. According to opinions from the Hungarian capital, a separate Slovak state should be established and protected by Germany.
【Associated Press, Bratislava, 12th】 According to semi-official sources, Germany is extremely concerned about the development of the situation due to the new government promoted by bayonets. The area is now heavily guarded by the Link Guard and the police. It is said that a division of Czech mechanized troops has arrived 30 kilometers away from Luttenburg.
Cabinet Formed, Link Guard Refuses to Recognize
【Haitong Agency, Pressburg, 13th】 The Slovak cabinet held a meeting on Sunday night, announced its establishment, and decided to strictly implement various defense and security measures. All shops, restaurants, theaters, and public places must close at 8 pm. At the same time, all police teams and Slovak troops on patrol must increase their strength.
【Haitong Agency, Pressburg, 13th】 The new Prime Minister Sidor gave a broadcast speech in the evening, saying that he had ordered the Czech army and Czech police to withdraw from Slovak territory within 24 hours, and that all those arrested would also be released during this period. This guarantee has made the situation better, and the radicals have slightly eased. The 250 people arrested, who were being sent to Moravia, have been returned for release. Sidor declared that the new cabinet will hold its first cabinet meeting tonight to decide on emergency measures. The Speaker of the Slovak Parliament has requested the Czech President to allow the meeting to be postponed to March 28, so that the new Prime Minister Sidor can attend at that time to report on the new government's program and the handling of the current situation. The Prime Minister concluded, "We swear to protect the interests of Slovakia. We will build an independent Slovakia. There will be no retreat in the future, only forward."
【Haitong Agency, Bratislava, 13th】 The headquarters of the Link Guard has issued a statement refusing to recognize Sidor as the supreme commander of its guard. The statement said that the Link Guard has refused to serve the Slovak government appointed by the Czech government, especially the Sidor government.
【Haitong Agency, Bratislava, 13th】 Kamazon, the representative of the German community in the Slovak region, gave a speech on Saturday night, saying, "In a nutshell, we do not want Czech forces to extend into the Slovak region. Therefore, we do not recognize any new government, because all new governments are unconstitutional. The current new government is illegal."
Disputes Arise Repeatedly, Scope of Conflicts Expanding
【Haitong Agency, Pressburg, 13th】 From Saturday night to Sunday morning, the German Volunteer Police Corps and Czech troops clashed many times. A Czech military vehicle drove in front of the German community association and fired several shots at the German police on duty there. The German police immediately returned fire, with a total of eight shots fired by both sides, but there were no deaths or injuries. On Saturday night, the Czech police made large-scale arrests, capturing about 70 people, including 23 Germans. Although the German consul protested, they were still detained until the next morning before being released. At the same time, the Pressburg City Hall was occupied by the Link Guard and the German Volunteer Police Corps at noon on Sunday. The Slovak autonomy flag and the swastika flag were flying on the flagpole there. Former Deputy Prime Minister Taiberlanski, because Sidor's cabinet has not yet been formed, continues to hold office temporarily and requested the German Volunteer Police to disarm, but was refused. He then spoke with Czech Foreign Minister Shifanek Fuerk to request instructions on how to handle the situation. Because incidents of conflict and arrest continue to occur, the atmosphere among the people is quite tense. According to observations by foreigners, the future of the situation is quite worrying. The German community association in Pressburg was surrounded by the local police at noon today and occupied all four buildings, adopting a defensive posture against the German headquarters. The headquarters guards and the Link Guard were also armed and waiting. It is said that the important buildings in other important places in the province have also been occupied by Czech troops.
【Haitong Agency, Pressburg, 13th】 A report from Slovakia on Sunday says that in the past few days, the number of Slovak leaders arrested by the Czech government has exceeded 250, including pastors, commanders of the Link Guard, members of parliament, leaders of various states, and Slovak officials. In the past 48 hours, 150 members of the Link Guard were arrested by Czech military police in Slovakia and sent to Moravia.
【Haitong Agency, Czech Capital, 12th】 Today is the anniversary of Germany's annexation of Austria. Germans here are flying the swastika flag to celebrate. Several conflicts occurred between Germans and Czech residents. The first incident occurred this morning at a German merchant's hotel. A group of Czechs smashed its windows, trying to tear down the swastika flag. At the same time, a German firefighter was beaten while trying to protect it. Later, a group of Czechs sang the national anthem and passed by. A German couple was insulted for refusing to take off their hats. Another German student was also beaten. After the above incidents occurred one after another, the German community also formed a team to parade, singing German songs to protest. Later, in a bar, German and Czech youths clashed again, and two Germans were injured. A Czech youth was arrested by the police.
European Observation: Rebuilding Central Europe, Anti-German Front
【United Press, London, 12th】 Today marks the anniversary of Germany's annexation of Austria. The diplomatic community is quite suspicious of the Czech events this week, wondering if it is another step in Hitler's eastward policy. Opinions vary on whether Hitler is involved in this disturbance, but most people believe that Hitler is indeed encouraging it. However, some believe that Hitler himself may be difficult to place a bet on the chess game, because since Poland recently renewed its friendship with France and the Soviet Union, dividing the Slovak people from the Czechs would undoubtedly destroy the buffer zone between Germany and Poland. As for the Czech Republic's adoption of this anti-German attitude after Romania, it is an attempt to rebuild the Central European front to resist German aggression. At the same time, some believe that Slovakia's move may be enough to promote a common front between Poland and Hungary. It is therefore generally believed that Poland is an important fulcrum in the European situation in the future. It is rumored that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Back will visit Britain in early April in order to seek Chamberlain's assistance in resisting Germany's demonstrations in Danzig and agreeing to establish friendly relations with France and the Soviet Union.
【Reuters, London, 12th】 According to the diplomatic correspondent of "Observer," "Although there have been many changes in the past 24 hours, it is still difficult for outsiders to understand the truth of the Slovak incident. The Czech side believes that the appointment of the new Slovak cabinet is a temporary compromise to maintain Slovakia's constitutional government. As for internal opinions in Slovakia, there are also differences. Sidor and young radicals form their own factions, the latter advocating separation from the Czech Republic. In addition, there is a small German minority, whose number is very small, but they are all extreme elements in Slovakia who loudly appeal. It is said that Germany is their powerful backer. The only hopeful solution to this incident is that no conflicts have occurred so far. According to well-informed sources, the Sidor government may be forced to request the withdrawal of Czech troops, and then move to allow the exiled leaders to return to the country. The saying that Slovakia is independent is also very popular. It is said that in the future, an independent Slovakia will be protected by Germany on the one hand, and its customs and currency system will be linked to Germany. However, as of now, Germany has not responded to Tiso's request for assistance or taken action. German officials also said they did not understand the truth of the matter, but mentioned its dangerous possibilities. Semi-official German opinion believes that the rights of the Sidor government are nothing more than a piece of paper, but because Germany has no active action, it is still a question for Germany to decide whether it is profitable to fully support Slovakia's secession movement.
Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, Stalin's Speech, Elucidating Foreign Policy, Maintaining World Peace, Promoting Neighborly Friendship with All Countries
【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th】 TASS, Moscow, 11th: The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened on the 10th in the Grand Hall of the Kremlin. Stalin delivered an important report, first stating the new economic panic situation in various capitalist countries in recent years, and listed the figures for tangible gold reserves and the total amount of industrial production in each country as examples. As for the Soviet Union, it is just the opposite. In recent years, the Soviet Union has become increasingly prosperous, its economy and culture have made more progress, and its political and military power has become stronger and increased. Then, he described the most important events that occurred after the new imperialist war was launched: In 1935, Italy attacked and occupied Abyssinia; in the summer of 1936, Germany launched military intervention in Spain, establishing rule in northern Spain and Spanish Morocco, and also establishing rule in southern Spain and the Balearic Islands; in 1937, after occupying Manchuria, Japan invaded North China and Central China, occupying Peiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and began to occupy the inland, excluding foreign competitors; in 1938, Germany seized Austria, and in the autumn of that year, it plundered the Sudetenland region of the Czech Republic; at the end of 1938, Japan occupied Guangzhou, and in the first year of 1939, it occupied Hainan Island. In this war, nearly 500 million people were involved, and the affected area extended from Tianjin and Shanghai through Abyssinia to Gibraltar.
After the First Imperialist War, the victorious countries, such as Britain, France, and the United States, first established a new system of mutual relations between countries, namely the post-war peace system, and the support for this system was the Nine-Power Treaty for the Far East and the Versailles and other treaties for Europe. The League of Nations was within this system, adjusting relations between countries based on the joint front of collective security. However, the three aggressor countries and the imperialist war have fundamentally overturned the post-war peace system. Japan has destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty, and Germany and Italy have betrayed the Treaty of Versailles. At the same time, the three countries have uniformly withdrawn from the League of Nations, completely disregarding everything. For this new imperialist war, it is an accomplished fact. At this juncture, suddenly disregarding various treaties and public opinion, turning to war is not an easy thing. Bourgeois politicians are well aware of this, and fascist leaders are also aware of this. This is why fascist leaders decided to devote themselves to creating public opinion to suit their purposes before entering the flames of war, that is, to mislead and deceive public opinion. The German-Italian military alliance opposes the interests of Britain and France in Europe? It is really not an alliance. We have no alliance. What we have is only a harmless "German-Italian Axis," just like discussing the axis with geometric formulas (laughter). The German, Italian, and Japanese military alliance opposes the interests of Britain, France, and the United States in the Far East? Absolutely not. We have no military alliance. What we have is only the Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo triangular alliance. In other words, it is a love of geometry (laughter). Going to war, opposing the interests of Britain, the United States, and France? It's really absurd. We are going to war, opposing the Comintern, not opposing these countries. If you don't believe it,

Urgent News from Guangdong: Tense Situation Escalates, West River × Reinforces Troops Attempting to Invade, × Again Occupies Ge Wei, Raids Ma Fang, and Disturbs Bai Ni Market, Deng Longguang Personally Oversees Frontline Defense, Further Strengthening Defenses [West River Express] Military situation on the West River has become tense since the recent crossing of the river by × soldiers at He Kou, who then occupied the old San Shui Ge Wei. × forces are being transported to San Shui daily, and reinforcements are continuously arriving at Mu Mian and Lan Gang, plotting to cross the river and raid Ma Fang and attack Si Hui. However, our Western defense line, since the visit of the 64th Army's Deng Longguang and Deputy Commander Chen Gongxia to the Guang Li and Hou Li areas on the 5th of this month, has developed a comprehensive plan to eliminate the invading × forces and inflict a major blow on their westward advance. The following is a report on the recent situation on the Western Front: × Crosses the River Again to Occupy Ge Wei Investigations reveal that × troops have crossed the river and occupied the Shang Gang area of the old San Shui Ge Wei, stepping up the construction of defensive fortifications and building pontoon bridges. The pontoon bridges from He Kou to Lao Ya Zhou and from Lao Ya Zhou to Ge Wei have been completely built. From the 4th to the 6th, × military supplies were continuously transported from He Kou to Ge Wei. However, the original force of over 400 × soldiers stationed there, threatened by attacks from our Qing Qi and Han Tang guerrilla units, suddenly retreated entirely around 7 AM on the 7th, fleeing back to He Kou. No trace of the × soldiers remained in the Ge Wei area. However, by noon on the 8th, over 300 × soldiers, divided into more than ten rubber speedboats and fully loaded with equipment, arrived from Zhen Nan Xin Xu and landed at Ge Wei, immediately rushing to build fortifications, intending to occupy the area for a long time. Lan Gang × Further Plots to Invade Ma Fang In recent days, the × troops on the West River front have been frequently mobilized, but these have been troop rotations and not any increases. In addition to dispatching troops to cross the river and garrison Ge Wei, the × forces at He Kou have also moved a portion of their troops to the Mu Mian and Lan Gang areas for guarding and stationing. Investigations reveal that around 7 AM on the 8th, two × military vehicles carrying 60 to 70 × soldiers arrived at the Lan Gang, Dian Xian Gang, and Song Dun Gang areas. On the 9th, the number of × soldiers in Lan Gang suddenly increased to over 400, and two mountain guns were added to the nearby hills, with the muzzles pointing towards the west bank. In recent days, the × artillery has been indiscriminately shelling our positions across the river, seemingly planning to cross the river and invade Ma Fang. Our defending troops are on high alert. Bai Ni Market Severely Harassed On the 9th, the × forces dispatched over 100 infantry soldiers, aboard more than ten steamships, and advanced along the West River via both land and water routes to invade Bai Ni Market, which belongs to San Yi Shui. Upon entering the market, they resorted to their usual tactics, engaging in widespread looting. The civilians in the market were caught off guard, and almost all the shops in the entire market were emptied. The × soldiers, having satisfied their desires, continued to harass the Dan Zao and You Guo villages. Along the way, they distributed false and misleading leaflets, mostly aimed at alienating our people and promoting their so-called "benevolent rule of the Imperial Army." At the same time, they forced the villages to conduct census surveys, organize baojia (mutual responsibility system), and elect village chiefs to be reported to the × military for inspection, falsely claiming protection but actually secretly guarding against the activities of our guerrilla units. However, our people, knowing their deceitful intentions, are unwilling to comply. After the × forces engaged in widespread harassment in various villages that day, they returned to their base in the afternoon. Further investigations reveal that when the × army invaded Gang Tou on the 27th of last month, they swept through more than 20 villages in Lu Li Tie Ju, killing dozens of villagers. In addition to being set on fire, Da Gang Market was looted of two pawnshops, resulting in losses of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Lu Xi Road × Builds Defenses and Holds Firm Furthermore, investigations reveal that the × troops on the San Shui front have been busy constructing fortifications in recent days. In the Ma Kou Gang Gen area, the × troops have placed barbed wire along the riverbanks, dug trenches and foxholes, and dispatched engineers to repair the pontoon bridge from Dong Ma Kou to Xi Ma Kou, which had been damaged by our guerrilla forces. In recent days, the × soldiers have also built defensive fortifications in the Yang Mei area along the Lu (Bao) Xi (Nan) Highway in the northeast of San Shui, attempting to hold firm, indicating their fear of an attack by our main forces from the Lu Bao direction. Shi Long × Shows Signs of Retreat, Military Equipment and Supplies Being Transported to Boats, Over 100 Civilians Kidnapped [Bo Luo Express] The × troops stubbornly entrenched in Dong Zeng have been extremely busy with troop movements, creating a false show of force, claiming they will launch a major offensive, but this is just a deceptive tactic to confuse our observations. According to intelligence from the Third Detachment Command of the Third Guerrilla Region, the × forces in Zeng Yu have not dared to act rashly. In Dong Guan, the × forces, centered on Shi Long, with units like the Zhu Lian forces, number only over 300 men. There are four shallow-water gunboats and more than 20 wooden boats berthed on the river. The Nan Bridge in Shi Long was previously demolished by the × forces, and recently the bridge piers have also been blown up. All the × soldiers are concentrated on Zhongshan East Road (formerly Dong Lu Yuan) in Shi Long City, using the Guo Zhong or Jin Pu store as their command headquarters. All military equipment, supplies, and furniture looted from shops in the city are being transported to wooden boats. Over 100 civilians and children have been kidnapped and imprisoned on the wooden boats. Their actions suggest a complete retreat. × Invades Da Wan Village, Defeated by Our Forces [Shun De Express] Le Liu in Shun De County has been repeatedly invaded by the × forces, and bandits have taken the opportunity to loot and plunder, causing suffering in the area. Da Wan Village, near Le Liu, has our guerrilla units stationed there, and the area is relatively peaceful. The × forces sent traitors to infiltrate and scout, intending to harass the area. Many traitors were captured by our units on the 11th of this month and executed after confirmation. The × military, upon hearing this, dispatched over 100 men, traveling in rubber boats, directly towards the coast of Da Wan Village, firing at the shore with machine guns. Our units defended from their positions, but were forced to retreat due to being outnumbered. The × troops forcibly landed on the shore, and our units, while fighting fiercely, telegraphed the Da Liang Guerrilla Headquarters for reinforcements. Upon receiving the news, the headquarters immediately dispatched the ×th team of the First Special Operations Detachment, driving vehicles and rushing to the frontline in Da Wan to provide support. After three hours of intense fighting, the × forces were pushed back. The × forces, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated from the village and hastily boarded their boats, fleeing in panic. It is reported that the village suffered tens of thousands of yuan in losses. Fearing Attacks by Our Guerrilla Forces, × Troops in Fo Shan Greatly Reduced, Ambush Successful, × Casualties Number Over 20, × Forces Are Weak and Anxious, Daring Not Venture Out [Nan Hai Correspondence] Fo Shan is located in the center of the Guang San Road, and the × military considers it a transportation hub for the Guangzhou and West River fronts, providing support for San Shui and Jiu Jiang. The × troops stationed there have always numbered in the thousands, with countless others passing through. Currently, the × military is urgently drawing away troops, having transferred most to Tai Niu, leaving only about 400 troops in Fo Shan. This was learned by the ×th Detachment of our First District Guerrilla Command. They are monitoring the movements from Fo Shan to the ××× villages to the north, in order to launch an ambush at the appropriate time. The × forces are also aware of their weak strength, and every night they retreat to Nan Di as a central station, increasing their vigilance. Our units are temporarily refraining from action while waiting for an opportunity. Pre-emptive Ambush, Fierce Attack on × On the 10th of this month, at 6 AM, four × military transport vehicles, carrying construction materials and engineers, drove along the Guang Nan Highway, nearing the border of Fo Shan. Our unit had detected this in advance and laid an ambush near Lao Bian Village, piling obstacles on the road. When the × vehicles approached, they could not pass. At that moment, our guerrilla forces launched a fierce attack, firing intensively. The × soldiers responded in a panic, unsure of the situation, and retreated while fighting, suffering over 20 casualties. Later, the × forces in Fo Shan, hearing the alarm, came to provide support. Our guerrilla forces, having achieved their objective, quietly retreated. The × troops did not dare to pursue, and instead carried the dead and wounded to Fo Shan. Fo Shan × Stationed in the Area for Investigation Further investigations reveal that this was not the first time the × military had been attacked by us. Recently, with their forces even weaker, they are anxious and dare not venture far. The nearby villages are experiencing less harassment. Currently, the × forces in Fo Shan belong to the Xin Ye Tian unit, stationed at the following locations: the command headquarters is located at the Guo Hua Wine Shop in Nan Di, the transportation corps is located in Fen Ning Li, and another unit is stationed at the train station. However, at night, they all retreat to Nan Di, maintaining constant vigilance and restricting lights after 7 PM, prohibiting pedestrians. The puppet administrative commissioner's office is located on Xian Xiang Street, guarded by puppet police during the day, but they become evasive and dare not come out at night. To Increase the Effectiveness of the War of Resistance, Guangdong Reorganizes Mobilization Committee, Establishes District Mobilization Joint Committees, Plans to Centralize Talent [Shao Guan Express] The Commander of the Fourth War Zone, Zhang Fakui, and the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Li Han hun, believe that the military resistance in South China has entered a new stage and that a large-scale counteroffensive on all fronts is about to begin. It is appropriate to adopt close liaison and cooperation in the three aspects of military, political and civilian affairs in the front and rear, so as to increase the power of the general mobilization for resistance. The provincial mobilization committees and the county mobilization committees have now been reorganized and their functions and powers have been raised. It is also planned to set up a mobilization joint committee in each of the nine administrative regions, with the administrative commissioner of the region as the chairman, and the senior military, political, party, and civilian leaders of each county under the jurisdiction of the region as members. The resolutions and plans of the county mobilization committees may be submitted to the district joint committee for meeting and review when necessary, and the pilot implementation will be carried out to benefit the public. The names of the provincial and county mobilization committees originally included the words "people", but after the reorganization, they will be referred to as ×× County Mobilization Committee, so as to concentrate the strength of party, government, military and civilian personnel and plan the mobilization of wartime human, financial and material resources to complete the great task of resisting the war and building the country. The plan is currently being drawn up and will be implemented soon. The Overseas Chinese Youth Rural Service Corps on the West River Front When Guangzhou fell and the × people stepped up their offensive on the West River, the Overseas Chinese Youth Rural Service Corps arrived in Gao Ming to work. At that time, it was the second stage of China's transition to a protracted war of resistance. The widespread launching of guerrilla warfare in this stage was the only way to ensure the victory of the Chinese nation. In order to win the final victory of the war of resistance, we must mobilize all human and material resources to defend the southwest in order to achieve the final protection of the Chinese nation. That is why they - the young men and women of the Australian Chinese Youth Rural Service Corps - need to go to the forefront of the war of resistance and mobilize the people to fight a desperate battle with the tyrannical ×. In Gao Ming, they used great efforts to ensure that the entire county's self-defense forces received correct political training, raising Gao Ming's armed combat power to the extent that the tyrannical × were afraid of it. In the sentinel battle at Hai Kou in Asia, they fearlessly sacrificed themselves and worked with the armed comrades - the self-defense forces, calmly entering and leaving the firing line of battle. The Gao Ming County National Salvation Association was also quickly established. It promoted and decided on the national salvation work of Gao Ming County. All active national salvation groups were united under this organization to rationally distribute work, and Gao Ming County achieved unprecedentedly active performance. Although people were extremely frightened by the × bombing raids, they continued to struggle in this harsh and dangerous environment. At the same time, they were also responsible for the rescue work in Gao Ming County during the bombing raids. Because of the lack of surgeons in the local area, many people came to seek medical treatment and change dressings every day after the bombing. Their rescue medicines were limited, so their medicines were in great need after this incident. The actual situation of the work was made known to General Tan Qixiu of the 19th Guerrilla Zone, who was wise and discerning. Under the primary principle of "mobilizing the people and participating in the war of resistance", he earnestly invited them to work in Luo Ding. Luo Ding is naturally a link on the south road of the West River. When they arrived in Luo Ding, the anti-Japanese General Cai Tingkai warmly and sincerely welcomed them and hoped that they could work together for a long time. General Cai and Tan had a very correct understanding of the need to improve the relationship between the army and the people. Under the current circumstances, the work in Luo Ding is naturally constantly expanding. However, Si Hui is indeed becoming an important area in the West River. Due to the natural hazards of the West River and the tyrannical ×'s exhausted tactics of roundabout warfare, Si Hui has also become a destination point. Although there is a certain natural advantage there, in order to build a flesh-and-blood defense on this hazardous terrain to make it more difficult for the tyrannical × to advance, they have a factual demonstration of their work there. Here, they cooperated with armed comrades in their work. On the "January 28" day, they conducted an on-site test of clearing the fields and strengthening the walls in ×× Township. At that time, × aircraft came to scout and bomb, but the people there were organized very strictly, and the work had been distributed properly in advance, so no one was injured by the × aircraft bombing. The men and women comrades of the Overseas Chinese Youth Rural Service Corps are assigned to work hard in various places. Recently, as early as the end of February, they sent some capable young people to participate in guerrilla warfare in the fallen areas and near the war zones. They will contribute even greater efforts to the cradle of victory in the national war of resistance. The development of this work not only strengthens the subjective development of the guerrilla forces, but also creates a broad-based public awareness of the tyrannical ×'s political Zheng purposes of fundamentally undermining the tyrannical ×. The current West River is in a bloody war of expansion under the tyrannical ×'s desperate struggle. In this flesh-and-blood battle on the West River Front, there is also this group of Overseas Chinese Youth Rural Service Corps who are lethal to the tyrannical ×. (End) Qiongshan Lai Rong Speaks × Hastens to Build Airfields in Hainan, Hai Cheng Has Magnificent Docks A traveler who escaped from Qiongshan and arrived in Hong Kong spoke of his experiences there. He had left Hainan 18 days after its fall, and had a detailed understanding of the situation there. According to him, after occupying Hainan, the × forces immediately stepped up their military deployment and opened two large airfields. To the west of the original Qiongshan County, our side had built a small airfield. Recently, the × forces have intensified their work and rebuilt it into a large airfield with a vast area that can accommodate hundreds of aircraft. They are also expanding the airfield in Wan Ning County, and are rushing to build an airfield in Ya County. This airfield is even more magnificent than the other two. The × airfield construction points are all on the south coast of the Pacific Ocean. Given the urgent progress of ×'s current construction, it is believed that it can be completed in the shortest possible time. In addition, a magnificent dock has been built in Hai Cheng, and construction there is also proceeding very actively, day and night. There is no doubt that the × forces intend to control the Pacific Ocean in order to deal with the British and Americans. There are currently six damaged aircraft parked at a certain airfield. According to what is known, two aircraft, after bombing Qiong Zhou on a certain day, returned to the × camp, flying back and forth, showing off their power. But heaven took their spirit, and they collided with each other, destroying the aircraft and killing the people. Two aircraft, after dropping their bombs, crashed while returning to the airfield in tandem. None of the pilots survived. Another aircraft caught fire and burned during takeoff due to an engine leak. News About Events in Shao Guan [Our Correspondent] Now, Shao Guan has become an important town in the rear of Guangdong Province. The highest military, political and party organizations have gathered here, as if to replace Guangzhou in the old days. There are many journalists working here. The Central News Agency alone has more than a dozen people. Others, such as the Central Daily News, Sao Dang Bao, and a photographer from Moscow News, are also here. However, the news they collect, especially the news from the Central News Agency, is often obtained through repeated interviews, so it takes four or five days for news from the front lines to reach readers. The problem is that the journalists are unwilling to go to the front lines, so they inevitably have to go through multiple intermediaries. When we published the Wartime Herald in ××, the news was provided by the Central News Agency's radio station. We published it before they sent it to Guilin, Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming, but we still felt that we were slow. It can be seen that it is not feasible for journalists to hide in the rear. There are many reporters' associations in Hong Kong, and I am afraid that sometimes they cannot remember many things. If they can run to the fallen areas or the battlefield, there will definitely be a lot of valuable materials. There are few Hong Kong newspaper reporters here, like morning stars, and the sales of Hong Kong newspapers do not seem to be focused here. There are local newspapers here, such as the Bei Jiang Daily and the Zhongshan Daily, which are both half-sheets. The Zheng Zhong Daily and Da Gang Bao from Hengyang arrive every two days. The Xinhua Daily and Jiu Wang Daily from Guilin can also be bought, but they can only be seen once a week, and there is not much daily news. If Hong Kong newspapers were to open a sales site here, there are buses to Shao Guan Mei Xian and Shao Guan Chao An, and there are even more cargo trucks coming and going. The entire journey to Shao Chao only costs two yuan. The Guangzhou branch of the China Youth Journalists Association has also resumed its activities here. Xia Yan once represented the General Association and reported on the recent activities of the Youth Journalists Association, and gave many instructions and encouragement on the development of the Guangdong branch. The work is now progressing quite actively. (A Chen) ...Special Shipping Report... The Italian postal ship "Ge Di Na Su" will arrive in Hong Kong at 9:00 AM today, first docking off Stonecutters Island to unload dangerous goods, and then docking at the Kowloon Wharf at 10:00 AM. After all the goods for Hong Kong have been unloaded, it will set off for Shanghai. The Tai Seng Company's Hao Jiang vessel sailed to Macau yesterday. It is currently under repair at the Kowloon Dockyard. It is expected to be repaired and return to service in one to three days. After the Tai Fung Company purchased the American transport ship Yu Na Shi (formerly Xin Die Lu Da), it specially sailed it into the Taikoo Dockyard yesterday for repairs. It will be able to set sail within days, traveling between Hong Kong, Guangzhou Port, and Haiphong. Film and Drama: In the Words of a Younger Sister, "Tyrone Power" "Tyrone Power can't hide anything from me." This petite girl said, her brown eyes gleaming. "I understand him too well." She wasn't boasting; what she said was true. And if there was truly a girl in the world who could thoroughly understand Tyrone, it would be her—because she is his younger sister. Hollywood has never known that Tyrone has a younger sister, and a very attractive one at that: dark, shoulder-length hair, young, lively, and energetic. She isn't an actress, although she possesses considerable beauty, a captivating voice, and inherited acting skills. For now, she has no desire to act at all. She has been married; her husband is a young businessman from Honolulu. Before Tyrone appeared on the screen, she lived a quiet life in Honolulu. Recently, it seems the marriage has become somewhat unsuitable. She came to Hollywood, living with her mother and brother. Ann Power—this is her name—is only seventeen months younger than Tyrone. The small age difference allowed them to grow up together, and gave Ann the opportunity to thoroughly understand Tyrone. So, when she was living in Honolulu and Tyrone gradually rose to fame on the screen, two questions inevitably arose in her mind, urgently demanding answers: "Has he changed?" "What impact has Hollywood had on him? Those influences that I don't like—none?" She recently answered those two questions, and for the first time, publicly announced: "The long absence hasn't estranged us; on the contrary, I now feel even closer to him. I have the opportunity to observe him closely and see him even more clearly." What were Tyrone's characteristics before entering Hollywood, and what impact has Hollywood had on him? Her words: "He was never arrogant. I often hear women say—of course, the speaker doesn't know I'm nearby, nor does she know I'm his sister—'Tyrone is so handsome, really, and not arrogant at all!' I smile inwardly when I hear such things. Naturally, they don't know what I'm smiling about." "Tyrone had a deep-seated inferiority complex." The reason for this complex was that he was "Little Tyrone Power," someone who constantly reminded people of his father. Tyrone often thought that he was being praised only because of his father's reputation, not because of himself. Therefore, he had only one great wish: "To act well." "Having an actor father makes it easy to start in the acting business, but he himself knows how much he has truly achieved in this area." According to her, Tyrone never trusts those who flatter him to his face. He doubts whether he can handle his current position, and works diligently, never relaxing for a moment, and never letting other thoughts distract him from his burgeoning career. This desire to act existed from a very young age. "When Mother was acting in San Gabriel, her dressing room was also our playground. At that time, he had a desire to act, often asking to be given a role, but always received the reply, 'Wait until you're older.' So he would ask, 'When will I be older?' He really wanted to grow up quickly so he could be an actor. At seven, he finally got a small role, and I still remember sitting on the nanny's lap, watching him act on stage." After entering school, Mother also taught him drama knowledge. Tyrone was relatively enthusiastic, while Ann was absorbed in music and books. She considered herself a bookworm, a dreamer, while Tyrone was active and practical. "Around the age of four or five, he began adapting the movies he had seen into plays. He had a unique rating system, marking the films he liked and explaining why he liked them, studying the small gestures in movies, reading all the movie magazines, and taking notes on the celebrity interviews he thought were brilliant. This gave him a lot of talking points after he became a celebrity." Tyrone didn't attend college, but convinced his father to study acting exclusively. Unfortunately, just as he stepped into Hollywood, playing small roles in his father's films, his father died. This was a major blow, and the first of many that followed. He lost his acting role and had to find work as an extra. This continued for a year and a half. He left Hollywood for Broadway, where he laid the foundation for his current position. Although he experienced many setbacks, he consistently continued to work hard. This character trait is called perseverance, or stubbornness if you want to be harsh. Regarding this, Ann told another interesting anecdote from their childhood: "I was probably in the third or fourth grade. One day, we were coming home from school, and it was snowing. I was sitting on a sled, and he was pulling it. I suddenly felt that he should hold my books for me more thoroughly, but he refused. So I said, 'If you don't, I'm going to throw them away.' He said, 'Dare you?' I really threw the books in the snow. He didn't pick them up, and neither did I. As a result, the books were lost." It seems that both siblings are very stubborn—no, persevering. But besides that, he is an extremely good-natured person. He has his own opinions, but at the same time, he never infringes on the will of others by insisting on his own correctness. Tyrone never blames others, nor does he dream of getting things he can't get. If he really wants to get something, he must first make an effort, and never sit and wait for success. If he still doesn't succeed, he can resolutely give up without any regrets, because he knows that it is still beyond his ability. This is probably his policy in his career, marriage, and everything else. Speaking of love, Ann Power said: "Tyrone began to pay attention to the opposite sex at the age of five. I remember one time when the nanny took us to visit friends in Bristol, Pennsylvania. When we arrived there, Tyrone immediately discovered a very beautiful little girl living next door. He temporarily forgot that I was by his side. After all, I was just a younger sister, but here there was another kind of attraction. Later, the nanny took a picture of them together. In the picture, Tyrone is smiling at her. I'm afraid Mother still keeps this picture somewhere. This was Tyrone's first attention to the opposite sex, and also the first time he was noticed by the opposite sex." "In school, Tyrone often went out dancing or to the movies with female classmates. Most of them were blondes, but none of them made Tyrone fall in love. Even now, that is still the case. He hasn't found a suitable partner yet. Many people ask about Tyrone's marriage, as if he is about to get married. If Tyrone finds a suitable woman, he will truly get married, but it definitely won't be now or in the past. As for what kind of person she will be, I don't have the slightest idea, but I know that I will definitely be very happy to have such a sister-in-law." In Ann's eyes, Tyrone is truly an amazing person. In every way, Hollywood has not had a negative influence on him. This is what reassures Ann Power. Yin Hua Xiang The private life of big-mouthed actress Martha Raye is very public, like a radio broadcast, every little thing is widely disseminated. Recently there has been news that she and her husband David Rose will agree to a divorce because they both feel that this marriage is not as fulfilling as expected. But another even more surprising piece of news is just the opposite. Neither she nor her husband denied this one, Martha is going to be a mother soon. It is said that Martha herself told one of her girlfriends this in a nightclub. Okay, whichever one you like, believe whichever one you want.

Sports News International Football Semi-Finals: England Squad Announced Yesterday, No Naval Players Selected, Weaker Squad. Two First Division League Matches Tomorrow Afternoon, Four Chinese Teams Face Off. Chinese Team Has Won Six Championships Thus Far. [Our Special Correspondent] Of the six championships in this year's football season, the Chinese team has already won the Superintendent's Cup, the League Championship, and the Special Shield. Currently, the South China Southern team has an absolute advantage and considers the championship in their grasp. The Lai Hua team has secured a place in the Chinese team finals. However, the South China team has not yet competed against the Navy and Army teams for the Xu He Cup, and the future is still uncertain. As for the international competition, if the Chinese team can defeat the England team in the semi-finals this Sunday, they will win the right to compete in the finals. Therefore, judging from the situation, the Chinese team has excellent players and strong strength, and it is possible to win all six championships. The future looks bright. I hope our athletes will work together to create this unprecedented new record. In this year's international competition, the Chinese team defeated the Scotland team in the Christmas period last year, and the Portugal team also defeated the Ireland team. However, the Portugal team won the right to compete in the finals with one victory, while the Chinese team must compete in the semi-finals against the England team this Sunday. If the Chinese team wins, they will win the right to compete in the finals and then compete against the Portugal team for the championship. Therefore, the importance of the semi-finals this Sunday in relation to the championship can be seen. Fortunately, the England team is not strong, so there is no need to worry. The English naval players have not been selected because they are on a large-scale exercise in Singapore. Even the city representative, Han Ni Wei Lu, is only on the reserve list. It is really impossible to predict whether he will participate in the war. Therefore, it is better to abandon him and recruit Fei Shi Wo Da of Mi Du Xi. However, Fei is also a top-notch material. The England squad was announced yesterday. The advantages of the whole team lie in the goalkeeper and midfielder lines. The two wings are also quite good. Otherwise, there is nothing to take. The weakness of its inner guard and the mediocrity of the three recorders dare to attack and defend will definitely not be as desired, and they are not an enemy of China. Also, according to the secretary of the General Assembly to reporters, during the semi-finals of last week's League Cup, it was also found that someone was selling fake tickets outside the stadium to profit from it. In order to prevent this, the international semi-finals this Sunday, if spectators buy tickets outside the stadium, will be refused entry once discovered and must buy tickets again to enter. Therefore, spectators should pay attention. The competition venue has been changed to the South China Stadium on Caroline Hill. The game starts at 4 pm. The England team is recorded as follows: He Li (Kowloon Club) Wei Jian Chen (Mi Du Xi) Bo Jia (Police Club Mi Du Xi) Ju Li Di (Captain) Ge Bian (Artillery Team) Fei Shi Song Da (Mi Du Xi) Da Fei Lu (Electricity Team) Yi Zhong Du Lan Zhi (Hong Kong Club) Shi Da (Artillery Team) Mo Shi (Police Club) Ba Shi (Artillery Team) Reserves: Li Di Shi (Artillery Team), Han Ni Wei Lu (Navy Team), Xia Wen, Zeng Ning Shi (Mi Du Xi) South China Qing Cao Same Triumph, Reporter Team Against Li Xing Match Postponed The Open Men's Basketball Tournament, with three games originally scheduled for last night at 6:30 PM, featured the first game between the Reporter Team and Li Xing. However, the Reporter Team was granted a postponement and only played an exhibition game. Subsequently, in the A Group match, Zhong Sheng challenged South China. The game was intense, with South China's offensive power proving quite strong. Their forward line coordination was consistent. Zhong Sheng also tried their best to compete, but their defense was weak, allowing South China to mount a final strong attack and win by a score of 49 to 45. South China Defeats Zhong Sheng As referee Xiao Dian blew the whistle, both sides began the contest immediately. Guo Zhi Hong took the lead, and Shen Rui Qing broke through with a surprise attack, scoring first. South China, after losing the first battle, immediately launched an offensive. Yu Jie Min, Chen Xin Qiu, and Shi Zhen Zhi scored successively. At this time, Zhong Sheng called a timeout, and Chen Ru Zheng and Zhang Ren Sheng joined the battle, making a significant impact. South China also knew that the attack was coming strongly, so Shi Zhen Zhi, Shi Zhen, and Yu Jie Min started together, repeatedly attacking the city. Zhong Sheng's Chen Ru Zheng and Guan Yun Shu also bravely rushed forward. In the first half, the two sides tied at 26 to 26. Switching sides to fight again, South China supplemented the team with fresh troops, with Zhang Rong Cai and Li Zhen Zhong enlisting in the rear, enhancing their strength and repeatedly pressuring Zhong Sheng. Shi Zhen Zhi, Shi Zhen, Chen Bang Zhen, and Li Zhen Zhong and Yu Jie attacked from five directions. Zhong Sheng was surrounded by enemies. Fortunately, Su Bo Hui and Li Yuan Fen resisted the incoming enemy. Chen Ru Zheng, Zhang Ren Sheng, and Shen Rui Qing also worked together to fight until the score was 45 to 48. The battle situation became more serious. However, South China's offensive became more urgent. At the end of the game, Zhong Sheng was defeated by a score of 45 to 49.

After the start of the battle, Da Zhong launched a fierce attack, with Dong Qi Biao and Zheng Biao scoring successively. Qing Cao's Xu Qing Hua, Chen Shi Xiang, and Zheng Zhao Yuan, opened from left and right, also scoring. The battle was intense, and in the first half, Qing Cao took the lead with a score of 15 to 13. Switching sides to continue, Wu Yao Kun responded with a close attack, Zheng Kang Chu, Chen Dan Zhong, Chen Zuo Jian, and He Jin Gui providing support from different directions, which had some success. However, Qing Cao refused to be outdone. Zheng Hua Kun and Ye Song Pei counterattacked with all their might. When the score reached 26 to 26, the match became very tense. At the end of the game, the two sides drew even at 30 points each. In the overtime replay, Da Zhong first gained the advantage of a free throw, but Qing Cao fought even harder. After an intense battle for a long time, Qing Cao suddenly launched a surprise attack at the last moment, successfully hitting the basket and defeating Da Zhong by a score of 26 to 35.

### General Chiang's Telegram, Announcing Implementation

[Chongqing Air News] General Chiang sent a telegram to the whole country on the 12th, officially announcing the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The full text is as follows: Commanders of all war zones, Commanders-in-Chief, Pacification Commissioners of all provinces, Chairmen of Party Headquarters in all provinces and cities, Chairmen of all provincial governments, forward to all officers and soldiers, and all compatriots nationwide, please take note. Today is the 14th anniversary of the passing of the Premier. Zhongzheng respectfully and solemnly announces the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization. All the guidelines, methods, and the National Covenant have already been published, and the full text has been published in various newspapers. The Premier said, "A person has the use of the spirit, not relying solely on the material body." And also said, "A weapon is material, but the one who can use this weapon relies entirely on the spirit. In comparison between the two, the power of the spirit accounts for nine parts, while the material power only accounts for one part." The Premier dedicated his life to the revolution and personally experienced battles. All these teachings are his personal experiences, trustworthy and verifiable words. Examining the historical facts of the revolution, we initially overthrew the Manchu Qing Dynasty with our bare hands and established the Republic of China. Later, we swore to launch the Northern Expedition, cleared the obstacles of warlords, and completed national unification, all relying on the victory of the spirit to lay this foundation. Unfortunately, the revolution was not completed, and the mentor passed away early. National disasters are deepening day by day, and foreign aggression is becoming increasingly urgent. Now the War of Resistance has entered its second phase. Looking to the future, the ferocity of the invading bandits has not subsided, the worship of the mausoleums is not possible, the suffering of countless compatriots is waiting to be rescued, the lifeline of the national family is at the cusp of survival, and the success of the revolutionary nation-building cause is still distant. The reason for this is purely because our adherence to the Premier's doctrine and teachings has been weak and insincere, our spirit has not been able to be uplifted, our will has not been able to be concentrated, or even if we have been excited for a while, we have not been able to be strong and persevering, so that the invading bandits still have the delusion of attacking our spirit and winning over the hearts of our people. Insulting oneself invites insult from others, and there is no lack of internal problems. Thinking about this shame, the shame is indeed obvious. The current crisis of national destiny and the rampage of powerful invaders are due to our past spiritual and behavioral decline and dispersion, which have led to these negative results. Now that we are in the second phase of the War of Resistance, where success or failure and survival are of utmost importance, if we still do not feel ashamed and repent, and quickly catch up, jointly restore our nation's inherent morality, consistently promote the Premier's revolutionary spirit, and unite under the three common goals of national supremacy, ethnic entirety, military first, and victory first, concentrate our will and concentrate our strength, eliminate the obstacles of decadence and corruption, cultivate a vigorous and enterprising spirit, and each exert our abilities and fulfill our duties to strive hard in the great cause of the War of Resistance and nation-building, how can we save ourselves and the country, and how can we face the ancestors of our people and the descendants of future generations? Zhongzheng mourns the early passing of the Premier and the teachings that can be followed, and firmly believes that the National Spiritual Mobilization is the foundation for building the army, building the nation, overcoming the enemy, and achieving victory. Following this path, one can be equal to a hundred, and ten can be equal to a thousand. I sincerely hope that all officers, soldiers, and citizens, male and female, from all sectors of society in all provinces and cities, will be sincere and devoted, deeply examine each point revealed in the guidelines, consistently implement them, vow to abide by the National Covenant, establish a will for resistance, and use spiritual transformation to manifest in practical actions, hoping to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the Premier's passing in a concrete way, to comfort the spirits of the Premier and the martyred soldiers and civilians in heaven, and to fulfill the heavenly duty of loyalty and patriotism to the utmost as those who have survived. This is also where we can wash away the shame of the Chinese people being invaded, ravaged, plundered, burned, and destroyed by violent bandits. As the saying goes, "Where sincerity prevails, metal and stone can be penetrated." We must be consistent inside and out, and not treat this matter as something ordinary. Zhongzheng (12th) Service Secret Yu.

A Conversation with a Certain Director

[Dispatch from a Certain Place, Central News Agency, 13th] A Central News Agency reporter visited a certain director in the morning who was presiding over a certain meeting, and asked about the achievements of the meeting. The director was still saying goodbye to the representatives at the time, and his kind instructions and friendly spirit were evident in his words. He then agreed to talk. Although the director had worked hard for several days, his attitude was still very excited and happy. After the reporter paid his respects, he asked a few questions. The director first said: "The only achievement of this meeting is the unprecedentedly united and powerful spirit. Each representative spoke about the difficulties they had experienced since the start of the war. The sincerity of their naked outpouring was surprising and touching. A responsible spirit of loyalty and dedication can be seen here." The director continued, "Regarding the fight against the enemy, the meeting made a firm decision on both positive and negative strategies. On the positive side, we have been fighting in the blood for 20 months, laying the foundation for a long-term war of resistance strategically, and have already gained the initiative. Therefore, we must support this great foundation. Add steps to punish the enemy. Therefore, in the meeting, in addition to showing the precise tactics of a full-scale active war, we also decided to return to the troops with the spirit of death and fight a bloody battle with the people in front of and behind the enemy. The enemy has recently been exhausted and powerless, and is specializing in military intimidation to cover up the promotion of their traitorous politics, and is also plotting sinister economic plans. For this reason, the meeting specifically decided to eliminate the enemy's poisonous attempts. Militarily, we must bravely defeat the enemy's main force; at the same time, we must crush the enemy's political conspiracy by implementing the Provisional Civil Agreement; and then we must use economic and blockade methods to prevent enemy goods from being transported into the mainland, and even more so, we must not allow our food to be transported into the enemy-occupied area, so that their economic sources are cut off and their economic life is trapped in a dead city quagmire." On the negative side, the consolidation of political and cultural forces is aimed at coordinating the revolutionary tactics of both parties. Politically, it was decided to strengthen political organizations at all levels, consolidate political organizations, and enhance the people's resistance forces. Culturally, it was decided to increase the work of resisting the enemy's culture and promoting the national spirit in order to improve revolutionary sentiment. In terms of personnel, it was decided to select and appoint capable people in accordance with personnel laws and regulations. In terms of management, it was decided to follow management laws and regulations and be honest and fair. Finally, simple and effective steps for leading, training, and using troops were formulated.
