### A Perspective on the New European Peace Movement

The political developments in Europe, following the actions of German and Italian aggressors and the creation of the anti-aggression front by democratic nations, have surprisingly led to the brewing of a new peace movement between two opposing blocs. Since Hitler's important speech, while democratic nations have continued to forge their anti-aggression front, they have also expressed "sincere intentions for peace" to the German and Italian aggressors. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 30th, this movement, led by Britain, first proposed a non-aggression guarantee plan to Germany. This plan is also based on Roosevelt's suggestion. News from diplomatic circles in Paris even suggests that Britain may request France to jointly offer Germany a guarantee of non-aggression, with the intention of proving that Hitler's claim of democratic nations encircling Germany is inaccurate.

Today, with President Roosevelt's "peace plan" to Germany and Italy having yielded no good results, Britain's initiation of this peace movement is somewhat surprising. Mr. Chamberlain has always kept the door of friendship open to the two aggressors, Germany and Italy. His disappointment at their broken promises is only temporary. The state of mind at the time of the "Munich Agreement" is now rippling in Mr. Chamberlain's heart again. When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in an instant, Mr. Chamberlain also expressed disappointment to Hitler. Now, Hitler's style has not changed. While he is taking a momentary rest, isn't he also scheming again? Mr. Chamberlain is now expressing so-called sincere intentions for peace to Germany and Italy. Mr. Chamberlain may have his own considerable difficulties in this, but the development of events will definitely not be as sweet as Mr. Chamberlain hopes.

What kind of response did President Roosevelt's peace plan receive from Germany and Italy? Was it not that, apart from the roaring of Hitler and Mussolini and the malicious criticism from public opinion in Germany and Italy, there was not a shred of sincerity? President Roosevelt's suggestion was to guarantee that 31 countries in the world would not be invaded, clearly expressing opposition to German and Italian aggression. However, the peace proposal that Britain is now about to put forward is to jointly guarantee with France not to invade Germany in order to seek Germany's understanding. The motivations behind these two actions seem completely different. The resilience of Britain and France in Europe will therefore be weakened.

Look, can Hitler have sincere intentions for peace? Although diplomatic circles in Paris speculate that "if Britain and France establish a non-aggression pact with Germany, it would be difficult for Hitler to refuse," the future of Europe is not so optimistic! Even if Hitler needs a moment's rest after this wolfish gulp, he may superficially appease Britain and France, but its effect will at best be a second Munich Agreement. Britain and France, who are always seeking peace at a new price, are once again preparing to walk into the trap of Hitler and Mussolini. In his speech, Hitler did his best to attack British diplomatic policy, while also [missing text]. In addition to reiterating his old claim to recover lost territories, he also announced the abolition of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. He severely rejected President Roosevelt's peace proposal with a destructive tone. Italy has also been instructed by Hitler to follow Germany in abandoning the military clauses of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Even with the need for a temporary rest, Hitler has not forgotten the continued annexation of small Eastern European countries. Since the German government officially sent a memorandum to Poland, declaring the abandonment of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, hasn't Danzig become an object in front of the Nazi crusader's gun muzzles? As a European diplomat told a Reuters reporter: "The current question is no longer whether war is possible, but when war will occur. The problem in Europe really hinges on how Hitler resolves the Danzig issue... Most politicians are comparing Hitler's methods against Poland to his methods of destroying Czechoslovakia..." If so, it can be presumed that Hitler's next step against Poland will be to make even broader and more powerful demands.

With such a predator glaring at it, Poland naturally tends towards effective guarantees and assistance from the Soviet Union. The European situation is still intensifying. If Chamberlain uses this peace movement as a diplomatic battle against Germany and Italy, it is certainly not impossible, but if he takes it as the goal, it is too idealistic. Even as a means of diplomatic warfare, we still doubt that it will ultimately have any effect. Continuing to intensify the creation of an anti-aggression front is a more effective and powerful method.

Middle School Education Improvement Plan

The following is the Middle School Education Improvement Plan passed by the National Education Conference:

Considering that middle school education was originally intended as preparation for students to pursue higher education, it is actually the most important stage in the entire education system. The main points of this plan are: (1) establishing six-year middle schools to raise the level of middle school education; (2) revising the teaching curriculum to adapt to modern needs; (3) emphasizing production labor training to cultivate the habit of using both hands and brain; (4) rigorously implementing vocational guidance, examining the personality of young people, and indicating pathways for further education and employment. The methods are as follows:

(1) The middle school system and its objectives should be changed appropriately. 1. In addition to the existing 3-3 system, middle schools should also establish six-year integrated schools, without separating junior and senior high schools. 2. (1) The Ministry of Education will designate several middle schools in certain provinces and cities to implement pilot programs for the six-year integrated middle schools. (3) A portion of the curriculum for the third year of junior high school should be designed separately to facilitate the studies of students who will graduate or seek employment. English may be offered as an elective in the third academic year. 3. An additional year may be added to the three years of junior high school, in addition to offering rudimentary vocational subjects. 4. Junior and senior high schools should prepare students for higher education while also cultivating intermediate and junior-level talents for general social undertakings.

(2) Divide middle school districts to determine the establishment of middle schools (see proposals under Education Administration category)

1. Each province should consider local transportation, population, economy, culture, and the distribution of existing schools to divide the entire province into several middle school districts. 2. The number of middle schools in each middle school district in the province should be appropriately allocated. Each district should have at least one middle school. 3. Junior high schools should be established on a county-by-county basis in principle, but in impoverished areas, a location may be designated for several counties to establish them jointly. 4. The annual enrollment quota and the number of grades to be added in each middle school within each district should be determined by the provincial Department of Education based on the number of elementary school graduates in the district who pursue further education.

(3) Revision and Determination of Middle School Curriculum Standards

1. English in junior high school may be changed to an elective subject. 2. Students in junior high school who do not study English may study more Chinese language and literature, history, geography, manual labor (with a focus on domestic skills for girls), or elementary vocational subjects. 3. A manual labor subject should be added in the first year of senior high school, and elementary vocational elective subjects may still be offered in the second and third years. 4. Determine the curriculum for six-year integrated middle schools. The important principles are as follows: (1) The entire curriculum for each subject does not need to be a double circle but should be a consistent linear arrangement. (2) Manual labor subjects should still be listed in the first to fourth grades. (3) The history and geography subjects should be combined, with Chinese history and Chinese geography accounting for two-thirds and foreign history and foreign geography accounting for one-third. (4) The weight of foreign languages should be gradually increased from the fourth year onwards. 5. After the curriculum standards for junior and senior high schools are revised and the curriculum standards for six-year integrated middle schools are determined, drafts of subject syllabus should be created immediately to serve as the basis for editing textbooks and teaching.

(4) Emphasis on Production Labor Training

1. Students in junior and senior high schools and middle schools must study agriculture or industry, while girls must study domestic skills and gardening. In urban and commercially developed areas, both male and female students may study commerce. 2. Standards for manual labor facilities should be established, and all public and private middle schools in each province and city should set them up accordingly. 3. The curriculum and practical standards for agriculture, industry, commerce, and domestic skills must be specified in detail, and each school should implement them accordingly. 4. Students in junior and senior high schools and middle schools, regardless of the type of production practice they engage in, must meet the predetermined skill and quantity standards within each semester. 5. Regarding the training of elementary school manual labor teachers, in addition to special normal school courses offered by normal schools, each province and city should designate excellent vocational schools to establish manual labor teacher training classes, enrolling graduates from advanced vocational schools and providing them with one year of training. Regarding the training of middle school manual labor teachers, normal colleges and universities and specialized schools or designated excellent advanced vocational schools should establish specialized manual labor teacher programs, enrolling graduates from advanced vocational schools for a duration of two to three years.

(5) Rigorously Implement Vocational and Higher Education Guidance

1. Each middle school must employ full-time teachers or assign teachers to concurrently take charge of student vocational and higher education guidance. 2. Teachers in charge of vocational and higher education guidance should consult with homeroom teachers at all levels and the higher education guidance committee to discuss and resolve various issues related to student higher education and vocational guidance. 3. When conducting vocational and higher education guidance, various tests or examinations should be conducted on physical strength, intelligence, interests, abilities, character, and occupation as reference materials for guidance. 4. Vocational and higher education guidance should be closely linked with student families and all sectors of society. On the student family side, the opinions of parents and siblings regarding their children's higher education and employment should be investigated. On the social side, the actual conditions of various industries should be investigated so that each student understands the content of each industry. At the same time, individuals with prestige in various industries should be invited to the school to give lectures. 5. Each year, the educational administrative organs should thoroughly investigate the content of various important industries in society, the types of work, the types of talent needed, academic qualifications, and other special conditions, analyze them, and print them into booklets to be distributed to schools for student and guidance reference. 6. Each middle school should compile a list of the circumstances and results of vocational and higher education guidance conducted for graduates each semester and submit it to the Education Department/Bureau and forward it to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. At the same time, parents of students should also be notified. 7. Provincial and municipal education departments/bureaus should set up vocational and higher education guidance agencies or assign full-time personnel to preside over the matter, and set up vocational guidance centers in important cities in conjunction with relevant agencies. 8. Provincial and municipal education departments/bureaus should also convene vocational and higher education guidance personnel from middle schools during each summer vacation to hold vocational and higher education guidance lectures or discussion meetings. 9. Add a vocational guidance course to the departments and subjects of normal schools and colleges of education.

(6) Reorganize Middle School Teachers in Each Province and City

1. The education departments/bureaus of each province and city should strictly implement the full-time teacher system in accordance with the regulations of the ministry. From now on, when inspectors from the ministry, provinces, and cities inspect middle schools each year, they should pay close attention to investigation. 2. The education departments/bureaus of each province and city should continue to conduct non-examination verifications and examinations for teachers, and those who pass the examination verification should be given a certificate with a valid period. 3. Teachers who pass the verification should be required to participate in summer training courses and join the secondary education research associations in the normal college districts each year to study secondary subject teaching issues. 4. Summer training courses for middle school teachers should be organized by normal colleges in principle. All participants must write theses on the results of their lectures or research findings as an examination. Those who fail may have their verification qualifications revoked. 5. Teachers who have not passed the verification should be organized by the education departments/bureaus to hold longer-term training classes in stages. Those who pass will be considered to have passed the examination verification, and those who fail will have their teacher qualifications revoked. 6. The Ministry of Education may send personnel to jointly organize or entrust normal colleges to organize long-term training classes for middle school teachers in each province and city. 7. Teachers who fail to attend two training classes should have their teacher qualifications revoked.

(7) Replenish Middle School Science Instruments and Library Equipment

1. Revise and supplement the standards for instruments, specimens, and other equipment for each subject in middle schools, and promulgate them for implementation. 2. Formulate a list of reading materials for middle school students and a list of reference books that middle schools should prepare, and promulgate them for adoption. 3. The Ministry of Education should raise funds to entrust the Academia Sinica or other manufacturers to manufacture middle school science instruments and specimens and sell them to middle schools at low prices, with the goal of bringing the teaching equipment of middle schools across the country up to a certain standard within a few years. 4. The Ministry of Education should select reading materials for middle school students and a list of reference books published by various bookstores and order middle schools to purchase and use them in stages, with the goal of bringing the library equipment of middle schools across the country up to a certain standard within a few years.

(8) Actively Promote Special Measures and Training During the War of Resistance (This plan serves as a common plan for secondary education)

1. The administrative and educational administrative organs of each province and city in the war zone should pay attention to investigating out-of-school youth and try to continue to maintain their studies. 2. The educational administrative organs of each province in the rear area should pay attention to investigating out-of-school and unemployed youth who have retreated from the war zone and try to provide them with short-term training so that they can be sent to various places to serve. 3. The Ministry of Education should formulate short-term training methods for unemployed youth in central China and implement them earnestly by the central government or each province. 4. The education departments of each province in the rear area should order all secondary schools to appropriately reduce class time in accordance with the Outline of Special Education for Secondary Schools and earnestly implement spiritual training, rear area service training, and various special knowledge and skills training related to the needs of the War of Resistance. 5. Urge the education departments of each province in the rear area to order all secondary schools to pay special attention to the training of production labor in the future.

Normal Education Improvement Plan

The following is the Normal Education Improvement Plan passed by the Third National Education Conference:

The main points of this plan are (1) adjusting the establishment and dividing normal school districts, (2) reorganizing the curriculum and emphasizing practical training to cultivate training spirit, (3) allocating graduate services to adjust supply and demand needs, (4) implementing on-site counseling systems to assist in improving local education, etc. The methods are as follows.

(1) Regarding Adjustment and Establishment

1. Each province should divide into several normal school districts according to local transportation, population, economy, culture, and the situation of various types of normal schools (see another case). 2. Each district should set up a normal school or rural normal school and several simplified normal schools or simplified normal departments. In areas where education is not yet developed, the establishment of normal schools or rural normal schools may be temporarily delayed, and simplified normal schools or simplified normal departments should be enriched first. 3. Each district should establish a women's normal school. If it cannot be established independently, a women's department should be established in the normal school or simplified normal school. 4. Each province should designate one or two normal school districts to open special normal school courses, or set up specializations within the normal school, to train elementary school physical education, manual labor, art, and music specialty teachers. To the extent possible, physical education schools should be opened on the one hand, and private physical education normal schools should be closed down on the other hand. 6. The original short-term normal schools or teacher training schools that do not comply with regulations in various places should be merged and reorganized within a certain period of time to be converted into simplified normal schools or simplified normal departments. 7. The number of grades to be established in each type of normal school and normal department in each district and the number of new students to be recruited each year should be practically planned and managed in accordance with needs.

(2) Regarding Curriculum Reorganization

1. The teaching subjects and weekly teaching hours of each type of normal school should be appropriately reduced, and the total weekly teaching hours should not exceed 32 hours. 2. A course on mass education should be added to the subjects of normal schools, and the principles and methods of vocational guidance should be added to the corresponding education subject. The content of teaching materials for various established curriculum standards should be revised in accordance with the revised hours. 3. The curriculum standards for various types of normal schools and normal departments that have not been established should be compiled immediately. 4. Compile the syllabus for each subject based on the newly developed curriculum standards.

(3) Stipulate that each student in the manual labor course must achieve the predetermined skill and quantity standards in each semester

2. All types of normal schools must pay attention to manual labor, learning agriculture and handicrafts in separate years. Girls must pay special attention to domestic skills and may appropriately reduce the training in agriculture and handicrafts. 2. Rural normal schools and simplified rural normal schools should pay special attention to gardening. 3. Stipulate the manual labor standards for each type of normal school and normal department, and order all schools to set them up uniformly. 4. Stipulate the operating standards for each manual labor course, and each student must achieve a certain amount of income per semester. 5. All types of normal schools should pay special attention to the two subjects of physical education and music in the future.

(4) Replenish Equipment

1. The Ministry will formulate and issue standards for the machines, specimens, and other equipment of each subject in each type of normal school. 2. The manufacturing and distribution of scientific instruments and specimens will be the same as that of middle schools. 3. The Ministry will formulate and issue a list of reference books and normal school student reading materials for each subject that each type of normal school and normal department should have, and order each school to purchase and prepare them in stages.

(5) Determine the Implementation Method of Normal School Student Internship

1. Each normal school and rural normal school should have an affiliated elementary school. In addition to researching the improvement of elementary school education, it should also serve as a place for normal school students to practice. 2. For normal schools or normal departments without affiliated elementary schools, the department should designate an appropriate elementary school in the normal school district as a practice site for students of the school. 3. Normal school students must pay attention to practice. In addition to practicing in elementary schools, they may be assigned to try out elementary schools in various places. However, those who fail the grade will not be allowed to graduate.

(6) Improve Normal School Student Service

1. The department should plan and allocate each class of graduates in advance to each county in the district. When they graduate, the department will separately inform each county to properly allocate services. 2. The department should investigate and register unemployed normal school students in various places and try to assign them to each county, and designate their positions according to the above methods. 3. The service period for graduates of each type of normal school and normal department should be appropriately reduced. 4. Stipulate specific restrictions on normal school students who request to postpone their service.

(7) Formulate and Implement Counseling Methods

1. The normal school district should also serve as a counseling district for local elementary school education. The normal school should be responsible for inspecting, counseling, and assisting provincial and county inspectors for elementary schools in the district. The detailed methods will be determined separately. 2. The normal school counseling agency will be responsible for the research and improvement methods of elementary school education in the district. The detailed methods will be determined separately.

Elementary Education Improvement Plan

The following is the Elementary Education Improvement Plan passed by the Third National Education Conference.

Promoting compulsory education and improving elementary school education are fundamental plans for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. This plan advocates lengthening the years of short-term elementary schools and improving their teaching methods to improve their degree, while also completing the grassroots institutions for promoting compulsory education in various places to expand in quantity. On the one hand, we will determine the elementary school counseling and research system and formulate various facility standards to improve in quality. The methods are as follows.

(1) Regarding the Compulsory Education Section

1. Lengthen the years of short-term elementary schools and "try to improve their degree." (1) The one-year short-term elementary schools established by various places to promote compulsory education should gradually lengthen their years of study according to local needs and their ability, and change them to two-year short-term elementary schools or primary elementary schools. (2) Two-year short-term elementary schools should focus on using effective teaching methods to improve their degree and try to make their curriculum connect with the curriculum of elementary schools at all levels.

2. Complete the grassroots institutions for setting up elementary schools in various places—Each province, city, and county (city) should complete the establishment of grassroots institutions for setting up elementary school districts in the 28th year according to the revised method of dividing elementary school districts in cities and counties promulgated by the Ministry, but if provinces, cities, and counties have special circumstances, they may separately formulate methods applicable to this place and submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation. (1) Each county (city) should delineate elementary school districts within a short period of time, with one bao to several bao or one street and one village, with a population of about 1,000 people, as the most grassroots institution for establishing a two-year short-term elementary school. (2) At the same time, each county (city) should delineate joint elementary school districts with one lianbao to several lianbao or one xiang (town) to several xiang, ten elementary school districts, to twenty elementary school districts, and set up a four-year primary elementary school in each district as the central elementary school for short-term elementary schools in each elementary school district. (3) At the same time, each county (city) should delineate ten joint elementary school districts (i.e., autonomous regions) as one county school district, and set up a six-year elementary school in each county school district as the central elementary school for four-year elementary schools in joint elementary school districts. (4) If each province has a basis and creates grassroots institutions suitable for setting up elementary schools in this province according to the actual situation of this province, the Ministry of Education may approve flexible handling, but it must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval before implementation. (5) Except for provinces in the war zone that may temporarily postpone the division and establishment of grassroots institutions such as elementary school districts, all provinces in the rear area must complete them in the 28th year.

3. Improve the organization of compulsory education committees at all levels. (1) Compulsory education committees at all levels should strengthen their organization so that they can effectively undertake the work of supervision, editing, research, experimentation, investigation, and official publicity related to technical aspects. (2) Compulsory education committees at all levels should fully improve the institutions that supervise, manage, and protect funds so that they can effectively exercise their powers to focus on compulsory education funds.

4. Train teachers and compulsory education administrative personnel. (1) In the future, the training of compulsory education teachers in each province and city should be based on the training of normal schools, simplified normal schools, and simplified normal departments. (2) When each province and city lacks compulsory education teachers, they may recruit graduates from junior high schools and above and those with equivalent academic qualifications, train them, and use them as substitute teachers. (3) Each province, county, and city should stipulate further education methods for short-term elementary school teachers and supervise their implementation. (4) The treatment of short-term elementary school teachers should be properly determined according to local living conditions so that they can serve with peace of mind. (5) Short-term elementary school substitute teachers with excellent performance may be changed to formal teachers with the approval of the competent education administrative organ. (6) Each province should convene lectures or discussion meetings for compulsory education administrative personnel in each county and city from time to time.

5. Raise compulsory education funds. (1) The central government's compulsory education subsidy should still be expanded year by year according to the original plan, fully distributed on schedule, and not be used for other purposes. (2) The amount of compulsory education funds allocated by each province and city should be increased year by year, at least according to the central government's subsidy amount, and included in the budget, fully distributed on schedule, and not be used for other purposes. (3) Each province, city, and county (city) may consider and handle the following methods of raising funds according to the local situation: A. After the implementation of the financial revenue and expenditure system method, each province, city, and county (city) should allocate a percentage of the tax revenue to be obtained by the province, city, and county (city) according to the needs of compulsory education. B. Each county (city) should allocate the increased income from organizing educational property and other public funds and public property in an effective way to compulsory education funds. C. Each county (city) should designate sufficient tax revenue for compulsory education funds. D. Short-term elementary school funds may be shared by local people according to their wealth. (4) Elementary school buildings should make as much use as possible of existing local public property and be built with donations from local people. (5) Elementary school equipment may be donated by local people.

(2) Regarding Kindergarten and Elementary School Education Section

1. Stipulate the setting principles. 2. Improve the administrative organs in charge of elementary education at all levels and determine the work of research and counseling. 3. Formulate various standards for kindergarten and elementary school teaching, training, hygiene, and equipment. (1) Revise the curriculum standards for kindergartens and elementary schools and compile the syllabus for teaching materials. (2) Develop elementary school vocabulary, vocabulary, and grammar standards, as well as various teaching materials for the card literacy teaching method. (3) Review and select various reading materials suitable for children and issue them to elementary schools at all levels for adoption. (4) Compile standard tests and various subject achievement examination methods. (5) Revise the elementary school civic training standards and elementary school hygiene facilities and equipment standards. (6) Formulate standards for kindergarten and elementary school construction and other equipment. (7) Fix the social facility methods for auxiliary children's education officials. (8) Compile and review elementary school wartime teaching materials and supplementary reading materials.

### Japan's Deceptive Pretext for Aggression Against China (2)

— Lofu

(Continued from yesterday)

Regarding the demands of Wang Jingwei and his ilk to abolish the 'special organization' of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army most resolutely support the leader and the government, uphold the national policy of resisting Japan, bravely fight on the front lines of the war, and implement the Three Principles of the People. Why should they be abolished? The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are bravely killing the enemy on the front lines, creating countless glorious achievements, striking fear into the hearts of the Japanese invaders, and bringing glory to the nation. Their prestige is widespread and their name resonates throughout the world. Why should they be abolished? The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army's resolute and mobile warfare against Japan, the excellence of their political work, and the coordination of their relations with the people can all be regarded as models for the National Army. Why should they be abolished? Moreover, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are already part of the National Revolutionary Army and have been formally commissioned by the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, resolutely carrying out the major strategic tasks assigned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Why should they be abolished? I believe that no one except Japanese imperialism and traitors can or will agree to abolish the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army.

Perhaps some people think that what Wang Jingwei and his ilk mean by abolishing the 'special organization' of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army does not refer to abolishing the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army themselves, but rather to abolishing the leading role of the Communist Party within them and the military and political system and working methods they have established. If that is the case, then we say that this is precisely the trick of Wang Jingwei and his ilk. Because Wang Jingwei and others know that if the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army lack the leading role of the Communist Party and the military and political system and working methods they have established, then the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army will inevitably disintegrate, and this is precisely what Japan and the traitors urgently demand today. Everyone knows that the reason why the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army have become what they are today is precisely because they have the leading role of the Communist Party and the military and political system and working methods they have established. Therefore, the leadership of the Communist Party within the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army and the military and political system and working methods they have established must not be abolished. Perhaps this is a bit 'special'. However, what is wrong with this special nature that guarantees the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army become a strong force in the war of resistance? They have contributed their special experience and opinions in creating a strong revolutionary army to the other National Revolutionary Armies throughout the country. This experience and these opinions are now gradually being adopted and generalized. It is believed that in the near future, under the condition of the common progress of the national army, many of the special features of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army in military and political systems and working methods will naturally gradually become common things.

As for some people saying that the Communist Party has no right to lead the army it created, we do not know what principle this is based on. If it is based on the principle of 'unity', then the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army today not only do not hinder unity, but also resolutely support unity and have in fact implemented unity. If it is based on the principle that there should be no political parties in the army as proposed by some people, then since there can be the Kuomintang in the army, why can't there be the Communist Party? Moreover, in fact, the activities of revolutionary parties in the revolutionary army will not weaken the strength of the army but will strengthen it. If it is feared that the Communist Party, having an army, will launch an armed uprising to overthrow the current regime in the future, then in fact it is the Communist Party that firmly advocates long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and strives to the end for a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Today, the Kuomintang cannot suspect that the Communist Party will launch an armed uprising to overthrow the current regime, just as the Communist Party cannot suspect that the Kuomintang will launch another coup to suppress the Communist Party. If they are 'party armies', then they cannot become national armies. However, in fact, the Kuomintang's party army is a national army, and the Communist Party's party army is also a national army. If each party and faction has an army, then the training, supply, education, and command of the army cannot be unified. However, in fact, under the common goal of each party and faction striving to realize the Three Principles of the People today, this unification is not a problem. In short, the argument that the Communist Party has no right to lead the army it created through hardship and war is unfounded.

Some people are dissatisfied with the Eighth Route Army raising some of its own grain locally to solve the problem of supplies, and are trying to use various methods to make the Eighth Route Army have no food to eat. This method of starving the Eighth Route Army so that it cannot fight and cannot survive is of course beneficial to the Japanese invaders. However, in order to resist Japan for the nation and to complete the strategic tasks assigned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the government, it is necessary for the Eighth Route Army to raise some of its grain locally. Otherwise, the Military Affairs Commission must provide sufficient funds to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army so that they can receive the same treatment as other national armies. At that time, the method of raising grain locally can of course be stopped immediately. The lives of the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are generally very difficult. They have never wasted a single penny of the country's money for their own lives. Their method of raising some grain locally is also based on the national policy of "those with money contribute money." They have never had any conflicts with the people because of raising grain. On the contrary, the people are willing to support them and contribute their money and grain. This method of automatically raising supplies is a last resort for the Eighth Route Army today, but in the future, in the course of a protracted war of resistance, when the country's finances and economy are in extreme difficulty, I am afraid that it can also be imitated by other national armies.

Some people also blame the Eighth Route Army, saying that the Eighth Route Army has interfered with and undermined the unification of the local administrative system. This accusation is also groundless. For more than a year, the Eighth Route Army has been bravely resisting Japan behind enemy lines, recovering many lost territories for the Republic of China, protecting large areas of land from being ravaged by the Japanese invaders, and establishing many anti-Japanese base areas. The unification of the local administrative system in the areas where the Eighth Route Army is active is precisely the result of the Eighth Route Army's arduous work and the reliance of the Eighth Route Army on being able to sustain a long-term and victorious war of resistance. Without the reliance on a unified local regime that has begun to implement the Three Principles of the People, it is impossible to sustain a long-term and victorious war of resistance behind enemy lines. Moreover, this unified local regime that has begun to implement the Three Principles of the People behind enemy lines not only does not undermine the unification of the national administrative system by the central government, but also creates the most powerful conditions for the central government to unify the local regimes behind enemy lines. Moreover, facts have also proven that all the unified local regimes restored, established, and transformed by the Eighth Route Army are organic parts and strong lower-level foundations of the central government. Whoever undermines the unification of this local regime not only actually undermines the true trend towards unification of the national administrative system, but also actually helps the Japanese invaders, creating favorable conditions for the Japanese invaders to undermine China's true unification, and at the same time makes the Japanese invaders' attempt to unify the puppet regime behind enemy lines possible. Therefore, the problem today is not to send friction experts to the areas where the Eighth Route Army is active to prevent and disrupt the Eighth Route Army's work of unifying the local administrative system, but rather to help the Eighth Route Army so that it can more quickly unify the local administrative system, so that it can more fully exert its strength in persisting in a long-term and victorious war of resistance behind enemy lines, and so that it can create more strong positions for a bright new China based on the Three Principles of the People in the future.

Therefore, regarding the demands of Wang Jingwei and his ilk to abolish the leading role of the Communist Party in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army and their military and political systems and working methods, we must resolutely reject them from the perspective of the interests of the country and the nation and from the standpoint of supporting the leader, the government, and the Three Principles of the People. On the contrary, we hope that the Military Affairs Commission of the Central Government will give the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army the same fair treatment and care as other national armies, so that they can better exert their strength to attack the Japanese invaders and contribute everything they have to the establishment of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

From this, it can be seen that none of the specific measures for "joint anti-communism" proposed by Wang Jingwei and his ilk are not intended to destroy China. The people and parties of the whole country should unanimously oppose such propositions of Wang Jingwei and his ilk, expose the true essence contained in these propositions, so that no one and no party should be deceived and harmed by them. The Republic of China and the Chinese people can no longer fall for the Japanese invaders' poisonous scheme of using "joint anti-communism" to destroy China. Persist in consolidating the anti-Japanese national united front! Persist in the long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party! Persist in the national policy of "victory in the war of resistance is certain, and national construction is bound to succeed"! This is the only way for the Republic of China to survive!

### Implementing Spiritual Mobilization Nationwide Chiang Kai-shek Announces to the Nation

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] The National Spiritual Mobilization has begun uniformly throughout the country on the 1st. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a broadcast speech to the nation at 8 PM that afternoon. The original text is as follows: Fellow compatriots, today is the anniversary of the uniform commencement of the National Spiritual Mobilization, strict implementation of the National Covenant, and the start of the National Monthly Meeting in all parts of our country. Today, the representatives of all sectors are holding this commencement ceremony here, which is not an ordinary ritual, but indeed the most painful and meaningful day of national revival for our Chinese nation. And today is Labor Day, and I want to explain my personal expectations to my compatriots across the country. At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to solemnly call for the joint efforts of our compatriots who have fallen under the ravages of the Japanese army. Now our entire nation is at a critical juncture of survival and victory or defeat, and the war of resistance has entered a serious and tense stage. Twenty-two months of war have clearly pointed out the prospect of certain victory in the war of resistance. However, the stubborn and brutal Japanese invaders are still trying their best to exert their bestiality and are trying to intensify their conquest of us, so we must not have the slightest slackness or negligence, but must intensify our efforts to struggle. Because our final victory must come from our firm war of resistance and our belief in certain victory. From today onwards, we must thoroughly examine our spiritual shortcomings; from today onwards, we must thoroughly get rid of the old and bring forth the new in spirit, change our faces and wash our hearts, and make a epoch-making effort, so that the past shortcomings, like yesterday's death, and the spirit of today, like today's birth, can make a difficult and solemn war with a brand new spirit. Today's ceremony is a vow of national spiritual mobilization. We want to swear to our ancestors Yan and Huang and our Premier Sun Yat-sen: from today onwards, we must thoroughly fulfill the National Covenant and wash away the various shortcomings of fearing difficulties, preferring ease, being perfunctory, and stealing peace in the past, and fulfill our responsibilities to the country and the martyrs. We want to swear to the martyrs and compatriots who have died for the country since the war of resistance: from today onwards, we will definitely redouble our efforts to avenge them and wash away the national humiliation. We will definitely redouble our efforts to continue the blood path of the martyrs. Today is the first day of May. In this month, there are many memorial days for the national humiliation of the Japanese invaders' aggression against us. We are truly shocked and pained. Every descendant of the Yellow Emperor of our Chinese nation must make a resolution today to turn the national humiliation of May into a month of washing away the humiliation. Speaking of this, we would first like to express our infinite concern to our compatriots in the occupied areas, especially our compatriots in North China, especially our compatriots in the Northeast, and all our compatriots in the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Beining, Zhengtai, Jiaoji, Pinghan, Yuehan, Guangzhou-Kowloon, Jinpu, and Longhai railway lines and other occupied areas, especially our elders. I know that although you cannot often meet and talk, my mind is always connected with your will. I have never stopped thinking about your suffering in this occupied and miserable life; I have never stopped thinking about your emotions of waiting for the good news of our army and looking forward to the restoration of our rivers and mountains. I and all the officers, soldiers and compatriots are moved and happy every time I hear that you have killed a Japanese invader or burned a Japanese goods in your efforts to endure suffering, persevere, struggle to the death, and strive to maintain the personality of our Chinese nation under the iron hooves and violence of the Japanese invaders, even more than when I receive news of victory on the front lines, because you can kill a Japanese invader in the rear of the Japanese invaders—that is, in our occupied areas. The effect is greater than killing a hundred Japanese invaders on the front lines. Therefore, our compatriots in the occupied areas, as long as they can resist the Japanese invaders spiritually and fight the Japanese invaders without cooperating with the Japanese invaders. It is equivalent to the meritorious service of our officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines. Our officers and soldiers on the front lines not only miss your hardship in the occupied areas very much, but also deeply appreciate your spirit of perseverance and struggle. What our government officials and soldiers never forget is to be worthy of you, so we must persevere and never slacken, and we must come to your aid and liberate you. So we must persist in the war of resistance; we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. Today, we are holding the National Spiritual Mobilization, and I would first like to express my condolences to your elders, sisters-in-law, brothers, and sisters. I know that you will definitely be able to accept this movement and implement this movement no matter how dangerous, difficult, or bitter the situation is. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. War can only temporarily isolate our contact in form, but it cannot isolate the exchange of our patriotic conscience and our blood ties. At this time, if there are still people among our people who are living in a drunken stupor, who are stealing a life, who are selfish and self-interested, who have divided will, and who do not know how to strive for self-improvement, then they are not compatriots of our Chinese nation. Nor are they descendants of our Yellow Emperor. (To be continued)

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 1st] Government agencies are busy holding the first National Monthly Meeting, and the atmosphere is extremely tense and enthusiastic.

The significance of the National Monthly Meeting lies in enabling people throughout the country to carry out the National Oath and earnestly do as they promise, so as to achieve the purpose of National Spiritual Mobilization.

### Enemy Planes Attack Ningbo Over a Hundred Casualties

[Jinhua, Central News Agency, 1st] At 9:52 AM today, six enemy bombers invaded Ningbo, dropping seventeen bombs in the urban area, causing more than one hundred casualties and destroying more than two hundred houses.

[Yicheng, Central News Agency, 1st] An enemy plane flew over Yicheng at 10 AM this morning for reconnaissance for about ten minutes and then flew north.

### The Enemy Issues Counterfeit Money in the Occupied Areas of Central China The Puppet Bank Was Established in Shanghai Yesterday Chen Jintao Assumed the Position of President

[Shanghai, Reuters, 1st] The "Huaxin Commercial Bank," sponsored by the Japanese side, was established at the New Asia Hotel in Hongkou today. The puppet side claimed that the bank was registered with the puppet "Reformed Government" and would issue banknotes. The puppet Minister of Finance, Chen Jintao, also serves as the president of the bank. It is said that the banknotes issued by the bank will circulate in various places under the puppet "Reformed Government," except for customs. The bank has a capital of 50 million yuan, half of which is paid by the puppet "Reformed Government" and the other half is borne by the Sino-Japanese Bank.

British Business Circles Express Great Concern

[London, Reuters, 1st] Business circles here are discussing the establishment of a new bank by the "Reformed Government" under Japanese sponsorship. It is generally believed that this is the beginning of opening up the Yangtze River. It is intended to export Chinese products from the Yangtze River basin in exchange for foreign exchange for Japan. Some people believe that the Japanese side will demand that British industry recognize the banknotes of the new bank as a condition for opening up the Yangtze River, but it is generally believed that the United Kingdom and the United States will hardly agree. What is feared is that the issuance of this new banknote will make China's commercial situation more chaotic. However, all parties pointed out that it is much more difficult for the Japanese side to promote counterfeit currency in Shanghai than in Tianjin. The plan in Tianjin had already failed, so it is difficult to achieve anything in Shanghai.

Again Dreaming of Seizing Railways

[Shanghai, Reuters, 1st] Two enterprises for transportation and finance were established here yesterday, one is the "Central China Railway Company" and the other is the "Huaxin Commercial Bank," both jointly operated by Japanese and puppet organizations, with a capital of 50 million yuan each. The "Central China Railway Company" will represent the puppet Reformed Government of Nanjing and manage 800 kilometers of railways in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, including the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, Nanjing-Wuhu, and Songhu lines. According to semi-official Japanese news, the company will also manage intercity bus services. The shareholders of the "Huaxin Commercial Bank" are the Nanjing Puppet Reformed Government and six Japanese banks, which will issue banknotes as currency in the area ruled by the Puppet Reformed Government.

Counterfeit Currency in North China Fell Again Yesterday

[Tianjin, Reuters, 1st] The value of the counterfeit currency of the North China Reserve Bank continued to fall today. One hundred yuan of national currency is worth 133 yuan of counterfeit currency.

### Infighting in the Japanese Seiyukai The Reorganization and Conservative Factions Compete for the President

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] A Shanghai dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st reports that the long-brewing infighting in the Seiyukai caused by the election of the president has become increasingly fierce and has reached a decisive point. The current Seiyukai has been divided into two factions, one is the reorganization faction, with a total of 83 people, headed by Nakajima, and the other is the conservative faction, also with 83 people, headed by Ichiro Hatoyama. The reorganization elements have now elected Nakajima as the president. It is reported that Nakajima has adopted a moderate attitude towards the conservative faction and still hopes that the two sides can work together harmoniously, and advocates that Rentaro Mizuno be the candidate for president of the Seiyukai. If he declines, then Fusanosuke Kuhara will be the candidate in order to restore unity within the Seiyukai. Political observers believe that there is a good possibility that the reorganization and conservative factions will reconcile. In addition, House of Representatives members Shigemasa Sunada and 太上 Ue have resigned to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Matsuju Shoyama, for their involvement in the breakup of the Seiyukai.

### Commander-in-Chief Yan Speaks on the Conditions for Winning the War of Resistance and Nation-Building: Admonishment to the Jin-Sui Military Officer Training Corps

[Report from the Min Ge She (Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang) correspondent in Western Shanxi] Victory in the War of Resistance and the success of nation-building are conditional. To speak of inevitable victory and success without conditions is empty talk, devoid of content, and without assurance. To know the conditions for inevitable victory in the War of Resistance and success in nation-building, we must first understand what kind of nation we are? We are a backward nation because the legacy of two thousand years of internal unity but external weakness has led to a culture of irresponsibility among the people. As a result, the Restoration (of 1898) failed, the Revolution (of 1911) only achieved superficial effects, and even now, we lack everything. We can be said to be an unmodernized, weak country. Fortunately, our country is vast, rich in resources, and populous. Today, in resisting Japan, if we do not change our ways, we will be at a disadvantage when the weak confronts the strong. Therefore, today we must avoid our weaknesses and exploit our strengths to overcome the strong with the weak. Once we understand this, we can discuss the conditions for winning the War of Resistance and nation-building.

What are the conditions for winning the War of Resistance?

1.  We must transform the political strategy of a war between nations into the political strategy of a people's revolutionary war. The political strategy of a war between nations uses military force to strive for the victory of the highest judgment; the political strategy of a national revolutionary war uses the all-out, nationwide War of Resistance to seek the survival of the nation and the liberation of the people.

2.  We must transform the war tactics of a war between nations into the war tactics of a people's revolution:

(1) The strategy of a war between nations is to crush the opponent's military force and subdue it, using strength against weakness. The strategy of a people's revolutionary war is not to defeat the enemy's military force, but to break the enemy's purpose in using military force, using weakness against strength.

(2) In terms of tactics, in the past, according to strategic orders, troops attacked positions. Today, we must abandon our strategic disadvantages and use our tactical advantages. Officers must take responsibility on their own initiative, not miss opportunities, not suffer losses, and kill the enemy to death.

(3) In battle, in the past, the goal was to break the enemy's national strength. Today, we must strive for victory in battle, with the goal of eliminating the enemy and defeating the Japanese General Staff's intention to invade China.

(4) The nature of the army must also be changed. The old army relied on the regime for replenishment and emphasized quality. Today's army relies on its own development and uses a new replenishment method to mobilize enthusiastic patriots, emphasizing both quality and quantity. Management and education must also be transformed into humane management and persuasive education. In the old army, emphasis was placed on military discipline. Today's army is dispersed due to guerrilla warfare. In addition to the power of military discipline, it is necessary to have political leadership. Today's army must keep an eye on the enemy while opening its own eyes, and it needs the assistance of the people. Therefore, it must cooperate closely with the people.

5.  The nature of officers in the past was passive; today, they must be able to take responsibility on their own initiative. In terms of responsibility, in the past, they were responsible for defending territory; today, they must be responsible for failing to seize opportunities and allowing the enemy to escape. In short, only by transforming the old ways into new ones can we be assured of victory in the War of Resistance on the military front.

6.  On the people's side: we must implement the organization of the masses so that everyone has a national concept, a national consciousness, and a political force that is responsible and does not tolerate irresponsibility. Everyone must participate in the War of Resistance, complete the intelligence network, and eliminate traitors. Only then can we be assured of victory in the War of Resistance on the people's side.

7.  On the administrative side: we must implement a strong people's politics that benefits and loves the people, persuasive administration, and win the hearts of the people. Only by obtaining the people's assistance in everything can we be assured of victory in the War of Resistance on the administrative side.

8.  Construct guerrilla base areas. In a war between nations, defending a territory has a rear area, and everything is supplied by the rear area. Today, due to strategic disadvantages, we abandon the defense of positions. Without a rear area, we have no choice but to establish solid guerrilla base areas as the source of our mobile warfare and the fortress of our protracted war. In the guerrilla base areas, we use the combined force of military, political, and civilian elements, implement a scorched-earth policy, destroy communications, eliminate traitors, and circulate intelligence. Coupled with the terrain, climate, and season, we conduct hundreds of exercises in actual combat, so that when the enemy attacks us, they will pay a huge price and suffer losses beyond that price, shattering their invasion attempts. Only then can we be assured of victory in the War of Resistance.

The above are the conditions for winning the War of Resistance.

What are the conditions for the success of nation-building?

Today's China is certainly much more advanced than it was thirty years ago, but it is still far behind the modern great powers. Since we are unwilling to fall behind, we must catch up. How can we catch up? To catch up quickly, we must have great strength. How can we increase our strength?

1.  We must concentrate human resources and develop material resources. How do we concentrate human resources? We must strengthen the unity of the people and lead them onto one path. How do we lead them onto one path? In terms of the system, we must first eliminate internal contradictions, that is, we must first eliminate economic class struggle. To do this, we must implement distribution according to labor. Implementing distribution according to labor can eliminate social inequality. With class struggle gone, human resources will not be scattered and can be concentrated. How do we develop material resources? The lack of civilization today is due to the insufficient development of material resources. The first problem in developing material resources is capital, and the second problem is limited production. Implementing property certificates can solve these two problems. Open up channels for production and concentrate material resources. Therefore, to catch up, we must implement a system of property certificates and distribution according to labor. Only then can we be assured of success in nation-building in terms of the system.

2.  Do whatever you are responsible for. Everything is accomplished through a sense of responsibility. If you do whatever you are responsible for, everything will flourish, and we will have wealth, strength, and civilization. If you do not do what you are responsible for, everything will be abandoned. We will lack wealth, strength, and civilization. Chinese Confucianism emphasizes responsibility. Two thousand years ago, the greatest emphasis was placed on a sense of responsibility. Since the Qin Dynasty unified the country and implemented a policy of internal unity but external weakness, over two thousand years, the sense of responsibility has been almost completely extinguished. Right and wrong are reversed, and irresponsibility has not only become a habit, but also a doctrine, influencing us to become the poor and weak nation we are today. Therefore, we fall short compared to the great powers of the world. If we want to modernize, we must develop everyone's sense of duty and responsibility. But to preserve this, we must have an organized sense of responsibility. The seed of an organized sense of responsibility is rooted in a political force that is responsible and does not tolerate irresponsibility. Therefore, we must firmly establish our ambition to be responsible and not tolerate irresponsibility, and organize talents who are responsible and do not tolerate irresponsibility, and demonstrate an organized sense of responsibility. Everyone is responsible, does whatever they are responsible for, and accomplishes whatever they do. Everything flourishes, and we have everything we need. Only then can we be assured of success in nation-building in terms of work.

3.  Implement mutual criticism, error review, and strict small-group life. The times are constantly progressing, and people must also progress every day. Leftist criticism is beneficial to people, and reviewing errors is beneficial to things. Living in small groups can correct our mistakes and increase our strength, and it is also a process of continuous training and strengthening to shoulder the work of nation-building. Only then can we be assured of success in nation-building in terms of enthusiastic progress.

I often say that distribution according to labor is an airplane, property certificates are gasoline, an organized sense of responsibility is the driver, and mutual criticism and error review is engine oil. Only when all four are present can we create airplane-style progress and catch up to create a new and prosperous nation. These are the conditions for the success of nation-building.

With the conditions for winning the War of Resistance and the success of nation-building, we can win the War of Resistance and succeed in nation-building. If we follow the path I have outlined for ten years, from the War of Resistance to the revival of the nation, what will the nations of the world do? They will have to consider our country's attitude before making decisions. If you recognize this, you can use it as a standard for your work, to criticize whether other people's work is correct, and to criticize whether other countries are progressing. I hope you pay attention to this, study this, grasp this, strive for this, in order to complete the work of winning the War of Resistance and succeeding in nation-building.

### Britain Determined to Compete for Far East Shipping Industry

[Hong Kong News] The competition among the world's major powers in the Far East shipping industry has intensified in recent years, especially among Britain, the United States, Japan, and Italy. The shipping companies under their jurisdiction are all building new ships to seek exclusive hegemony. According to news, the British Blue Funnel Line recently added two new ships, each with a displacement of 10,000 tons, which are under construction. After completion, they will participate in the Far East routes. It is also found that Britain, the United States, and other countries have made the greatest determination to compete for the Far East shipping industry, and have provided substantial subsidies to their respective shipping companies to enable them to build fast and great new ships to participate in the Far East routes. The British government recently announced that in the overall plan to subsidize the British shipping industry, it is prepared to allocate 10 million pounds in cash for subsidizing shipping companies to build new ships, but only those built in British territories can receive this subsidy. This shows the great determination of the British government to compete for Far East shipping rights. In addition to the Blue Funnel Line, the Glen Line also plans to build a batch of new ships. These ships are all 10,000-ton giant ships, and two have been completed and launched, with the rest under construction. According to the company's shipping plan, some new ships will also be allocated to operate on the Far East routes in the future.

### Nanchang Annihilation Imminent: Besieged on Three Sides, Approaching the Suburbs

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, May 1st] Our Jiangxi troops are continuing their attack on Nanchang with the force of Mount Tai pressing down. As of May 1st, all routes have approached the suburbs. There are approximately 2,000 enemy troops in the city, who are currently resisting stubbornly. Their resolution is only a matter of time. On the Wuning front, the enemy is still in stalemate with us at Yan Harbor, and the battle situation is relatively quiet. The enemy has continued to reinforce in the past two days and has repeatedly counterattacked northeast of Gao'an, but all have been repelled. Lianhua Mountain and Xiangfu Temple are still in our hands. After a certain commander of ours passed through Hunan, the morale of the front line was greatly boosted, and the formation was renewed. It will be extremely difficult for the enemy to attempt to invade Changsha.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, May 1st] The enemy in Zhongxiang, Hubei, has repeatedly attempted to forcibly cross the Xiang River since April 29th, but all have been repelled. We occupied Chenjiaji and advanced eastward, capturing many prisoners.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, May 1st] The enemy in Xinyang, Henan, has suffered heavy losses. Fearing our attack, they have all moved outside the city. Xinyang has become an empty city. We are still confronting them in the vicinity.

[Special Dispatch from Guilin, May 1st] The battle situation in southern Guangdong has slowed down in recent days. The enemy on Hainan Island landed at Xinying Port a few days ago and re-entered Dan County, attempting to attack our troops from both sides. After repeated attacks by us, they suffered heavy casualties.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, May 1st] As of the evening of May 1st, all battlefields are stable and there are no major battles. We are still in a dominant position. Nanchang is under siege. In southern Guangdong, we have news of capturing Heshan. In eastern Henan, the enemy invaded Luyi. We are in the suburbs, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy. Yesterday, we ambushed between Huaiyang and Tuocheng, killing more than 200 enemy troops.

Nanchang City Capture Strategy

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Guilin, 4:00 PM, April 30th] A certain senior commander came here from the front line today. A reporter inquired about the recent situation of the Nanchang battle. He smiled and said, "From a purely tactical point of view, our army's attack on Nanchang this time has achieved a very full range of mobile operations. The generals' command of the troops is flexible, and the soldiers' coordinated actions are consistent, which is especially impressive. Therefore, this battle can be said to be a new model of unified action in the counter-offensive stage. The victory of the Nanchang outer perimeter battle began with the capture of Gao'an on the 23rd, and then successively captured Dacheng and Gaoyou City. We besieged Fengxin in the north and approached Wanshou Palace in the west. The enemy on the western front has fallen into an effective encirclement. The left and right wings of the southern route also launched simultaneously, capturing Xihan New Village on the left and approaching Xiebu City on the right, jointly attacking Liantang and Xiangtang. Yesterday morning, a certain regiment of ours coordinated with our troops in the Shengmi Street area, launching an annihilation battle on the inner perimeter. Although the enemy divided its forces to return for reinforcement, it was already like spilled water that cannot be recovered. It is recalled that the enemy suffered heavy sacrifices when they captured Nanchang. Now, while their foothold is unstable, they are being violently besieged by us. It is expected that the collapse of the remaining enemy is imminent."

[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, May 1st] According to news from the front line, the Chinese army is currently encircling Nanchang on three sides and will launch a general offensive in the near future. The two airfields captured by the Chinese army are now being defended by the Chinese army. According to battle news from Hubei Province, after the Chinese army captured Tongshan, it advanced northwest, capturing Xianning and Tingsi Bridge, cutting off the rear of the Japanese army in Yuezhou.

Our New Air Force Mobilizes

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, May 1st] According to Chinese reports, a squadron of Chinese aircraft bombed Yueyang yesterday, directly hitting the Japanese arsenal there, and returned safely. The Japanese army did not send aircraft to intercept.

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, May 1st] On April 29th last year, Japanese aircraft took advantage of the Japanese Emperor's birthday and launched a large-scale air raid on Wuhan, resulting in the Chinese side shooting down 20 aircraft, creating a great page in the history of air combat. In the year since then, the Chinese Air Force has been actively strengthening its replenishment and has accumulated a strong force, waiting for the opportunity to strike a major blow to the Japanese Air Force. Major cities in the southwest and northwest provinces, such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou, have been equipped with elite air forces to wait for Japanese aircraft to fall into their nets. Among them, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Lanzhou have the strongest strength. In recent days, the Chinese army has repeatedly appeared on the north and south battlefields, assisting the army in operations, using mobile tactics to disrupt and contain the activities of the Japanese Air Force, which further proves that the Chinese New Air Force has been gradually established. According to news obtained by this agency, the Chinese New Air Force will be dispatched one after another in the near future and will have exciting actions to spread both domestically and abroad. Recently, we have received reports on the Chinese Air Force's recent operations. It is reported that Chinese aircraft bombed and destroyed the strong positions built by the Japanese army along the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses and, having no basis for combat, collapsed, suffering heavy casualties. The Yuncheng Japanese airfield was suddenly attacked by Chinese aircraft, destroying several Japanese aircraft. Five Japanese aircraft took off to fight and one was shot down by Chinese aircraft. The Chinese aircraft safely returned to their original bases. In addition, nine Chinese aircraft suddenly attacked Japanese positions on the west bank of Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi. The Japanese army was caught by surprise and suffered great losses. Three Japanese transport ships on the Yangtze River were sunk by bombers, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. In the air battle near Xi'an on the 29th, two Japanese aircraft were shot down, and one Chinese aircraft was damaged and forced to land, but the aircraft and pilot were safe. Thanks to the protection of the Chinese aircraft, Xi'an was not subjected to air raids.

### Chamberlain Announces Continued British-Soviet Negotiations: Soviet-Turkish Agreement to Establish Black Sea Group, Cooperating with Britain and France to Resist Aggression

[Reuters, London, May 1st] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today in response to questions, "The British government's negotiations with the Soviet Union are currently underway, but I regret that I cannot make any further statements on this matter at this time." He also replied to Attlee, "The government has recently received proposals from the Soviet Union and is continuing negotiations with the Soviet Union, but the details of the negotiations are difficult to elaborate, because this matter requires consideration of other relevant governments besides the British government."

[Central News Agency, Ankara, May 1st] Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, and Turkish authorities have discussed the establishment of a Black Sea nations group to cooperate with Britain and France. This cooperation plan stipulates that, in the event of war, the Dardanelles Strait (between the Asia Minor Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula) should allow warships of nations resisting aggression to pass through.

[Haitong News Agency, Ankara, May 1st] The Turkish President met with Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, yesterday to discuss the negotiations among East and West European countries on mutual guarantees. The Turkish Foreign Minister was also present.

[London, May 1st] Foreign dispatches report that negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey regarding the anti-aggression front will be officially completed this week. According to well-informed sources, British-Turkish negotiations have also been completed. These negotiations have faced difficulties because Turkey insisted that the entire agreement and guarantee system must include the Soviet Union. However, with Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin's visit to Ankara and the ongoing British-Soviet negotiations, this issue has been satisfactorily resolved. According to Haitong News Agency, Britain will offer Turkey guarantees against Italian attacks, and Turkey will also agree to assist Britain in the event of an Italian attack on Palestine or Egypt, and allow the British fleet to pass through the Dardanelles Strait in the event of war. However, this news has not been officially confirmed.

[Associated Press, London, April 30th] Britain, France, Romania, and other European countries may accept Hitler's proposal to conclude non-aggression pacts with him. Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently. Maisky proposed that Britain and France should provide guarantees to countries bordering the southwestern border of the Soviet Union, maintaining their independence and resisting aggression. This includes Latvia, Estonia, and Finland. At the same time, the Soviet Union would agree to a military agreement with Britain and France. If Germany invades Britain, France, or their neighbors, and Britain and France believe it is in their interests, the Soviet Union would provide military assistance. The Soviet Union also guarantees assistance to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

### British Cabinet Holds Special Meeting Yesterday: Discussing Military Training Bill, Defense Committee Also Meets

[Reuters, London, May 1st] The British Cabinet held a special meeting this morning, attended by all cabinet members. Prior to this meeting, the Imperial Defence Committee held a meeting. Opposition leaders Attlee and Greenwood also met with Chamberlain for a 25-minute discussion. It is understood that this cabinet meeting discussed the Military Training Bill and will present a report to members of the House of Commons tonight. The Defense Committee also held a meeting.

[Reuters, London, May 1st] The British Military Council held a meeting yesterday to discuss the recent conscription measures in detail, lasting seven hours, the longest meeting in the council's history.

[Central News Agency, London, May 1st] Official news: Since the meeting between Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and British Foreign Secretary Halifax last Saturday, both sides have remained silent. According to reliable sources, the Soviet Ambassador has reiterated that if Britain is prepared to sign a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union can also agree to Britain and France's request to assist Poland and Romania in resisting aggression. The British Foreign Secretary agreed to reply to the Soviet Ambassador within a few days. The British Cabinet, in view of Hitler's declaration to abolish the German-Polish Agreement and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, decided to hold an emergency meeting this morning to discuss the international situation and will also draft a reply to the German side. It is reported that Britain has ordered the fortification of Alderney Island in the northern English Channel, becoming a second Gibraltar, so that it can control the fleet in the North Sea in the event of war.

[Reuters, London, April 30th] The British Cabinet will discuss Britain's future policy towards Palestine and the original text of the Military Training Bill on Monday. It is understood that it will also be decided whether the conscription law will apply to Northern Ireland and Irish people residing in Britain.

### Japanese Invasion of China Results in Economic Hardship: Public Bonds Difficult to Sell, Prices Soar, Raw Materials Under Control, People Suffer

[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence] In the last fiscal year (ending March 30th), the Japanese Ministry of Finance organized a campaign to encourage the public to save 8 billion yen (equivalent to 470,000,000 pounds) to meet the huge war expenses against China and expand production capital. According to Japanese claims, this goal has been nearly achieved. The current amount of national savings has reached 7.2 billion yen (423,500,000 pounds). However, the sale of government bonds has not fully met expectations, and the amount of banknotes issued has increased by 500,000,000 yen (30,000,000 pounds), causing prices to rise across the board. This year, the government authorities are again asking the Japanese people to save 10 billion yen (600,000,000 pounds), of which 6 billion (360,000,000 pounds) will be used to absorb government bonds and 4 billion (240,000,000 pounds) will be used to develop industry. "The Nichi Nichi Shimbun" believes that the total amount is still low, as the amount of bonds issued this year has reached 7.5 billion yen (441,200,000 pounds), and it is necessary for the government to strengthen the promotion of national savings to prevent excessive currency inflation. "The Kokumin Shimbun" said that the Ministry of Finance is now forcibly implementing a savings system in Japanese arms manufacturing factories, deducting a fixed amount from the wages of its employees and workers that are higher than those before the outbreak of the war against China, forcing them to save.

[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence] The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department announced that since the implementation of the National Raw Material Control Law a month ago, 54,351 citizens have been detained and warned for violating the law, and the trend is continuing. The Japanese people are suffering greatly due to the high degree of control over raw materials.

### American Public Opposes Military Supplies Being Shipped to Japan

### German Nationals in the United States Return Home in Droves: More Than 4,000 People

### German Newspapers Comment on Hungarian-German Negotiations

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, May 1st] Yesterday, the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister laid a wreath in silent tribute at the Monument to the Unknown Soldier and signed the city hall's golden book before attending General Göring's banquet. The guests included the Roman Governor's wife, General Mier, Lieutenant General Udet, Major General Butendandt, Neumann, and Koranna. In the evening, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet for the two Hungarian political figures at the Esplanade Hotel. Newspapers here have commented and criticized the Hungarian politicians' visit, saying that in recent weeks, representatives from Romania, Yugoslavia, and Hungary have been sent to Berlin to negotiate with Germany. This shows that although Eastern and Southern European countries are carrying out anti-German movements, they have to be close to Germany due to geographical and economic environment. The Nazi Party's official newspaper, "Völkischer Beobachter," said that after being greatly disappointed with Western European democratic countries in the past twenty years, Hungary has been able to repent and implement realistic policies. "Berliner Tageblatt" said that Hungary's frank attitude is enough to show that Central European countries are not in as dangerous a situation as democratic countries imagine. "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" said that it is admirable that Germany and Hungary can help each other economically, while the "Frankfurter Zeitung" said that the Berlin talks are enough to enhance relations between Southern and Hungarian countries.

### Yesterday's Labor Day: Soviet Union Holds Military Parade, Communist International Issues Declaration Calling for Expanded Sanctions Against Aggression

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 1st] On May 1st, a grand annual military parade was held on Moscow's Red Square. Stalin, along with all military, political, and party leaders, attended the inspection. Deputy Military Commissar Budyonny served as the commander. Military Commissar Voroshilov delivered a speech stating that the Second Imperialist War had already begun, that the Red Army was the armed force of the international labor society, and that it fought for world peace. The Red Army clearly understood how to fight, and was extremely fond of fighting. The Red Army had never failed, and would always achieve victory, establishing peace for all friendly nations. It was observed that the troops participating in the parade included various military branches and women's troops. On the same day, large parades were also held in Minsk and Kyiv, all fully armed. Military and labor groups marched in formation through designated squares, carrying large banners bearing various slogans, praising Stalin's achievements.

[Reuters, Hwansko, 30th] The Communist International today issued a May Day declaration calling for the workers of Britain, France, and the United States, along with all anti-aggression warriors, to unite and impose economic, military, and political sanctions on warmongers, to aid China, and to liberate Czechoslovakia, Albania, Spain, and Abyssinia. The declaration did not advocate world revolution, nor did it attack democratic countries, marking a new characteristic.

French Cities Hold Celebrations

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] Major French cities all held Labor Day celebrations last night. The French Chamber of Commerce, recognizing the gravity of the current situation, did not hold the usual demonstration parades. Crowds in Paris gathered in the Bois de Vincennes for a celebratory meeting, attended by 15,000 people, significantly fewer than in previous years. The slogan of the meeting was "Respect social justice, consolidate freedom, protect peace." A union secretary spoke, first addressing the seriousness of the current situation, then stating that while French workers deeply desired peace, if any enemy, domestic or foreign, attempted to infringe upon the people's freedom, French workers would rise up to resist.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Many French workers' Labor Day parades were held early today, and tomorrow, with a few exceptions, they will still work as usual. This is a first in several years. The "Paris Evening News" commented: "This is the labor community's indirect response to Hitler."

### Axis Powers Plan New Moves: Italian Premier Meets German General, Sends Spanish Delegation to Italy

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 1st] General Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, after laying wreaths yesterday morning at the Altar of the Fatherland, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and the Monument to Fascist Revolution Martyrs, was received in audience by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and visited Prime Minister Benito Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 1st] Mussolini met yesterday with General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, for an hour-long conversation. It is reported that Brauchitsch urged Mussolini to stockpile war materials, as the Italo-Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War had depleted Italy's munitions. A Spanish military delegation is also currently in Italy, leading outside observers to believe that the Axis powers are planning new moves.

[Reuters, Rome, 30th] Mussolini today received General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, and Italian Undersecretary of War Pariani, for half an hour. The meeting was reportedly extremely cordial, and they revisited issues recently discussed by Pariani and the German Chief of Staff. General Brauchitsch and Pariani will fly to Libya tomorrow.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 1st] Yesterday afternoon, Italian Undersecretary of War Pariani, representing the Italian King, presented the Grand Cross of the most honorable Italian Order to the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. His accompanying officials were also awarded.

### Poland Will Not Yield to Germany: Polish Ambassador to Germany Ordered to Return Home, France Pays Close Attention to Beck's Reply

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] The Polish Ambassador to Germany left here tonight for Warsaw. He reportedly received new instructions from the Polish government after hearing Hitler's speech. German newspapers are now harshly attacking Poland, calling the Polish government "liars," while their tone towards Britain is quite mild, a stark contrast to the harsh criticisms of weeks past. Some foreign observers believe that Germany is doing this to sow discord between Britain and Poland.

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 30th] Poland, having decided to protect Danzig, has deployed troops to the front lines near Danzig and the Polish Corridor, so most of the troops will not participate in the national memorial day military parade the day after tomorrow. The authorities claim that soldiers on the border have "other duties" and have been ordered not to withdraw to participate in the air defense fundraising event. For propaganda purposes, yesterday the Air Force conducted large exercises in twelve major cities, which the public watched with great interest. Many streets were plastered with slogans such as "This is our answer to Hitler."

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 1st] According to yesterday's "Polish Courier," Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck will deliver a speech to the Polish Parliament on the 5th of this month, and then submit his country's response to the German memorandum to the German Ambassador to Poland. It has not yet been decided whether the Foreign Minister will address all members of Parliament or only the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. The German Ambassador to Poland has been away in Germany for a long time and is rumored to be returning to his post this Monday, although this has not been confirmed. On Sunday, Polish newspapers urged the public to actively purchase aviation bonds, saying that the Polish Air Force is a weakness in national defense and must be strengthened. Some newspapers stated that the solution to the Danzig problem should be based on Polish interests, as Danzig is closely related to Poland, and if Danzig becomes a German military base, Poland's security will be greatly threatened.

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] Diplomatic circles here are now focusing on Beck's response to Hitler. It is generally believed that the Polish Foreign Minister will insist on Poland's rights in Danzig and will not allow Germany to build extraterritorial roads in the Polish Corridor. Information coming from Poland in recent weeks proves that Poland is determined not to yield to Hitler's pressure. However, it is generally believed that Poland will allow Germany to build a road in the Polish Corridor, but it will be entirely managed by Poland.

### U.S. Senator Proposes Independence of Philippine Islands Be Delayed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] According to highly reliable sources, U.S. Senator Tydings, deeply fearing that the United States will be forced into the vortex once war breaks out, plans to propose a new bill to Congress stipulating that the political independence of the Philippines should be realized in 1942, and that the U.S. economic privileges to the Philippines should be extended to 1952.

[Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 1st] Local officials deny the French newspaper reports that La Perthus on the Franco-Spanish border has been blockaded by Spanish troops, and say that last night the Franco-Spanish border area was peaceful and normal, with no disturbances reported.

### French Warships Visit Portugal

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 1st] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here yesterday afternoon from Paris. The Italian Undersecretary of State Ciano, the Romanian Ambassador to Italy, the German Ambassador to Italy, and the Polish, Turkish, Yugoslavian, and Greek Ambassadors all greeted him at the station. After arriving, Gafencu went to the Italian National Monument to Victor Emmanuel II, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and the Monument to Fascist Revolution Martyrs to lay wreaths. He then held talks with Ciano. Although the Romanian Foreign Minister's visit is official, he will hold political talks with the Italian Foreign Minister during his three-day stay. Yesterday, all the newspapers unanimously welcomed the Romanian Foreign Minister and asked the public to pay attention to the fact that during his European tour, he first went to Berlin, then to Brussels, Paris, and London, and Rome is the final stop of his trip and the second cooperative country of the Axis powers. Therefore, the newspapers pointed out that Gafencu's arrangement of his itinerary is beneficial for him to fully understand the functions of the Axis and the closeness of German-Italian relations, which is beneficial to Romania. It has been announced that Gafencu has clarified all existing issues between Germany and Romania, and with the approval of King Carol of Romania, has refused the requests of Britain and France to join the group surrounding Germany. It is reported that Romanian Finance Minister Constantinescu, who is also the Governor of the National Bank of Romania, will also come to Rome for a three-day stay soon. The reason for his visit is to study the successful enterprises of Fascism.

Since Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Poland has been sending and receiving envoys to various countries, and this move is another example of Poland's new diplomatic activities.

### Hitler Delivers Two Speeches for Labor Day

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Hitler delivered two speeches today for May Day Labor Day, one at the Olympic Stadium, addressing 132,000 male and female members of the Hitler Youth, saying, "I hope you will become strong and upright Germans. You all know that everything must be obtained through struggle and defended when necessary." Hitler also addressed a large crowd of demonstrating workers, saying, "Our current revolution is completely different from previous revolutions. We are now participating in the greatest revolution, without a doubt."

[Associated Press, Berlin, 30th] Sunday, which is a national memorial day in Nazi Germany, Hitler will deliver two speeches, both of which will only address domestic issues. It is generally believed that Hitler will temporarily refrain from taking new adventurous actions abroad after delivering his parliamentary speech, and will take a wait-and-see attitude, watching Britain and Poland's negotiations on a new treaty to replace the abrogated one.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 1st] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech today to the Hitler Youth, declaring, "The country you represent will surely succeed in Europe. You should strive for a new Germany and for a new Europe. You are responsible for new ideas. Compared with you, the youth of democratic countries are already old and dirty."

### Roosevelt Delivers Speech, Reiterates Call for Peace; World's Fair Opening Ceremony Spectacular, New York City Celebrates Vigorously

--Roosevelt--

[Associated Press, New York, 30th] The New York World's Fair officially opened today. President Roosevelt, in his speech, did not mention Hitler's speech, only reiterating his call for peace, saying that our goal is to achieve the happiness of mankind, international friendship and cooperation, and world peace. The American people are working together to seek happiness for the majority and transform human life for a better world. The conference opened at 10 a.m., but the number of visitors was not enthusiastic. The total for the day was only 140,000, far from the projected number. In the evening, there was a grand electric fireworks display, personally hosted by Professor Einstein. Various colored lights and countless cannon sounds were spectacular, but the weather was not right, and a sudden rainstorm greatly reduced the enthusiasm of the tourists. According to the police, due to the rain, there were fewer vehicles and no accidents occurred.

[Central News Agency, New York, 30th] The World's Fair opened here today, and New York City celebrated wildly.

President Roosevelt personally hosted the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, saying that future trade barriers between countries can be eliminated, and that the United States' goal is to seek international friendship, especially to seek peace. The name of this exposition, "The World of Tomorrow," is also a great expression of the United States' optimistic attitude towards the country.

The number of people who visited yesterday reached one million, and the total number of visitors before the end of the exposition may reach 60 million.

Short Commentary

### New Trends and Countermeasures of Germany and Italy

Hitler's "cover-up" speech on the 28th was an extremely nuanced and anti-democratic, peaceful country performance. Some people exaggerated in advance that it would be a bombshell, but as a result of the speech's publication, this bombshell was at least damp, because when this speech was transmitted to the United States, President Roosevelt still slept soundly. When it was transmitted to Britain, Prime Minister Chamberlain had already gone to his country villa for a weekend holiday. When it was transmitted to Poland, Poland formally stated that it would "not be moved by intimidation"!

We do not want to overestimate the strength of the anti-aggression front actively supported by Britain and responded to by the United States. At least at present, the Soviet Union is not truly united. But on the other hand, the bullying and adventurous tactics of the German and Italian aggressors are approaching the point of "exhausting their skills"!

Now the German and Italian aggressors are indeed a little panicked. General Brauchitsch, the Chief of Staff of the German Army, accompanied by several officers of the General Staff, arrived in Rome on the evening of the 29th for important talks with Italian military leaders. On the Italian side, Mussolini also reported on the new military budget on the 29th, roughly stating that 500 billion lire would be spent within ten years, and he declared that "the Italian government's determination to expand its army is a response to Chamberlain's announcement of implementing conscription."

When intimidation fails, it is followed by conspiracy and adventure. This is the habitual technique of fascist aggressors. Intimidation, conspiracy, and adventure are inherently used in a mutually supportive manner. The old is coming to an end, and the new is starting. To know what will happen next, we must see the sincerity and methods of the United States and the United Kingdom to come up with an anti-aggression plan. Of course, in order to safeguard world peace and human justice, we must not stand idly by and watch the success or failure of the anti-aggression front work being carried out by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France! We must launch national diplomacy, launch international public opinion, and mobilize the progressive parties and people from all walks of life in democratic and peaceful countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in the spirit of "the world belongs to all the people in the world" to promote the progress of the anti-aggression front.

Speaking of our Far East, we can only strive to promote the development of the anti-aggression movement in Europe, and only by striving to increase the difficulties of the German and Italian aggressors can we make the Far East aggressor Japan fall into more serious isolation and difficulties, can we make the anti-aggression forces in the Far East rise, and can we advance the final victory of the Chinese war of resistance.

### National Production Conference to be Held on the 5th; Fishermen's Association Cables Proposals for Relief, to Be Included in Strengthening Fisheries Production, Organizing Relief, Cherishing Fisheries Technical Experts, and Popularizing Fishermen's Education

× warships ravaged the coastal areas of China, and Hong Kong fishermen suffered a major blow, daring not to go out to sea for work, their situation being extremely difficult. Our central authorities are deeply concerned about this. In addition to ordering the China Relief Commission to allocate funds for relief, they have also formulated relief methods and successively dispatched Mr. Chen Chunpu and Mr. Xu Tianchen to Hong Kong to express sympathy. These matters have been reported in previous newspapers. It has now been learned that the National Production Conference is scheduled to be held in Chongqing on the 5th of this month. The Hong Kong Fishermen's Progressive Association yesterday specially cabled President Kong Xiangxi, Minister Weng Wenhao, Minister Chen Guofu, and the convener of the Production Conference, Mu Ouchu, proposing a plan to relieve the fishermen. Excerpts from the cable are as follows:

Strengthening Fisheries Production and Providing Relief

(The above is omitted.) (1) Request to be included in strengthening fisheries production organizations and handling fishermen's relief matters. Since the war of resistance began, fishermen have been burned and bombarded by × boats, with ×××× causing 10,092 deaths. 628 fishing boats have been destroyed, and property losses amount to more than 8 million yuan. There are countless orphans and widows left behind. The total number of fishermen here is about 70,000. Large fishing boats (surveyed on February 16, 17, and 18 of this year) were × burned and plundered, with only 1,234 remaining in the various fishing areas of Hong Kong. If they do not go out to sea, their livelihoods will be cut off. If they do, they will be poisoned by × warships. Compared with the same month of the 27th year, the number of fishing boats is only half of what it was. Without considerable protection and relief, they will inevitably be destroyed by × people or exploited by × people. This will definitely affect the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national reconstruction. If considerable relief can be implemented in a timely manner, it can not only avoid destruction by ×, but also serve as a coastal force for the war of resistance and lay the foundation for the revival of fisheries. Moreover, there are many who can assist in coastal defense. Therefore, concerning the relief of fishermen, we earnestly request that you propose to include it in fisheries production so that there is no one-sidedness, demonstrating fairness.

Including Fisheries in the National Reconstruction Plan

(2) Please include fisheries in the national reconstruction plan and central government expenses so that national fisheries affairs can be initiated. The governments of all countries have a "Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, or Fisheries Bureau" to manage national fisheries affairs and train fishermen to assist in national defense. Even in our country, from the late Qing Dynasty to the end of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, there was a Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Division. However, after the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Division was abolished, and all fisheries administration expenses were deleted. All fisheries investigation and guidance work, fisheries syndicate loans, and emergency fishermen's relief plans were also completely suspended. During the European War, governments of all countries not only paid attention to fisheries administration as before during the war period, but also made further reforms. At that time, they were seeking the governance of the country's coast. Moreover, × people used 10 million Japanese yen for the implementation of fisheries in China. This shows that fishermen and fisheries should be given considerable consideration in the future of the country. Now, the Ministry of Economic Affairs does not include central fisheries administration expenses in the budget, seemingly believing that coastal areas will inevitably be occupied by × people. Therefore, fishermen and fisheries in various places are temporarily abandoned. It is observed that all countries pay attention to managing and training fishermen and developing fisheries production during wartime. Our country is now in a war to win the people. How can we abandon them? It is advisable to consider the management and relief of fishermen and the research and encouragement of fisheries, as well as other facilities. In addition, the freshwater fisheries area is vast, and various fisheries expenses should be included in the national policy plan.

Cherishing Talent and Implementing Education

(3) Please cherish fisheries technical experts and implement fisheries education for fishermen. The cultivation of senior fisheries technical personnel requires six to eight years of fishing ground experience in addition to completing school terms before becoming a qualified "fishing boat captain" or "fishing master." Continuing with five to ten years of service experience is required to become a fisheries leader. Therefore, the formation of a truly strong force in fisheries requires an average of at least 20 years of experience (including school time). Even the captain of an old-fashioned Chinese fishing boat must have more than 15 years of experience. Therefore, the difficulty in developing fisheries lies in the cultivation of talent. Since the establishment of aquatic schools in the country, not many suitable and experienced talents have been created, and × people often tempt fisheries specialists with weak awareness with money, wanting to explore the shape and depth of our country's harbors and islands, as well as the size of reefs. Outsiders are not familiar with these things and must attract and employ general fisheries industry outcasts to find out. As for changes in fishing grounds and fishing seasons, they can be obtained by those outcasts. As a result, the importance of coastal defense and the richness of fish production are lost. This is important for national defense during the war of resistance. After the end of the war, it will be related to the needs of the industry. If our government can appropriately establish aquatic practice fields, fisheries research institutes, wartime fisheries service groups, and all organizations of wartime aquatic schools and fishing villages, and give them appropriate positions so that they can maintain their livelihoods, the government will increase its expenses to a limited extent, and the intangible benefits will be infinite. Since these people are all Chinese, they should not be abandoned under any circumstances. Moreover, fisheries education must be promoted in a timely manner because only one or two out of every hundred fishermen can read. Their knowledge is shallow, and few of them have a sense of the country and the nation. Therefore, our association has been actively engaged in fisheries education in recent years for this reason. Furthermore, only through hard work in propaganda can fishermen understand the essence of the nation's struggle for survival and resistance. However, fishermen's minds are simple and easily shaken. Therefore, popularizing fisheries education is also a necessary preparation for the central government. Please give attention to the above points. The cable is urgent, and we await your instructions.

The officer on duty immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. Later, according to the owner, a young man named He Can, about 23 years old, had fled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong after Guangzhou fell and was temporarily staying at the store for several days. Yesterday evening, the 30th, the young man did not return to the store, and his luggage was also taken away. Because the young man left without saying goodbye, suspicion arose, and he immediately checked his belongings and discovered that he had lost 160 Hong Kong dollars, 1,500 provincial dollars, and gold jewelry and cash, worth about 1,410 Hong Kong dollars. It is now suspected that the young man did it. The police have telegraphed all district police stations to arrest the young man.

### Pirates Rob a Cargo Boat in Chiwan Waters; A Helmsman Shot and Injured by Thieves

At 8 am on the 30th yesterday, a cargo boat of a certain number, fully loaded with fruit, came to Hong Kong. When it was sailing to the waters of Chiwan, it suddenly encountered five bandits, all holding long and short guns, driving a boat and chasing after them, shouting for them to stop. The boat owner, Chen Fuzai, hurriedly ordered his boat companions to fly the oars and raise the sails in an attempt to avoid being robbed by the thieves. The thieves, seeing that they did not obey the order to stop, immediately fired at Chen's boat, and bullets rained down. The boatman, Chen Kuantian (40 years old), could not avoid being shot in the left hip, and blood flowed profusely. Seeing the ferocity of the thieves, Chen and others, fearing that casualties would occur, stopped moving forward. The boat then drove forward and docked near the beehive. They drove the boat companions into the cabin and then searched and robbed them, stealing 24 Hong Kong dollars and two baskets of sweet oranges, worth 54 yuan, before leaving with a howl. Afterwards, Chen sailed the boat back to Hong Kong and reported the case to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station, and sent the injured Chen Kuantian to the Kowloon Hospital for treatment.

### Mr. Xia Yan's Lecture: Comparison of Spiritual Mobilization between China and Japan

— Peng

Lecture at the First National Monthly Meeting of the Chung Wah Middle School Yesterday

In order to welcome the sacred May, at 8:30 am yesterday (1st), all the staff and students of the Hong Kong Private Chung Wah Middle School held a national monthly meeting.

The entire open-air playground was filled with innocent and lively students. The white and neat Zhongshan suits showed purity and solemnity.

After the ceremony, Mr. Xia Yan, the newly arrived editor-in-chief of the National Salvation Daily and a famous writer in the country, stood calmly on the stone steps amid warm applause and explained in detail the "Comparison of Spiritual Mobilization between China and Japan."

"... It has been two years since the war of resistance. In these two years, since our country implemented spiritual mobilization, it has generated great power for the war of resistance..."

"... The same is true of mobilization. The comparison with × people is different. Our country is mobilizing for national survival and world peace, while × people are mobilizing for aggression. The nature is absolutely different..."

"... Aggressors have long had the spiritual mobilization of aggression for a hundred years. Coupled with more than 50 years of preparation... They have fought against our country and Russia, and they often boast that they have never lost a battle. They believe that strength can make us submit..."

"... Their education policy is for foreign aggression, but this time their behavior is perverse and their purpose is confused, and their morale has declined..."

"... Since January 28, they have been met with just and strong resistance, fully demonstrating their failure. Therefore, anti-war sentiment is surging, soldiers are alienated, and the people hate spiritual mobilization. This is often expressed in Hong Kong magazines... "

"... They were exactly the opposite of England during the Russo-Japanese War. Now they are not of one mind in the war, their military discipline is lax, and they are not serious at all. They are dissatisfied with the measures of the warlords and are full of negative anti-war thoughts..."

"After our leaders promulgated the spiritual mobilization program, everyone knew that the purpose of the war of resistance was for national survival, for world peace, and for the liberation of the Chinese nation. The responsibility is great. The military and civilians are united, the more we fight, the stronger we become, and the more we fight, the braver we become. The common people do not lose their strong confidence because of the × people's air raids, massacres, and thinning. Everyone understands that we are fighting for survival, and there are no complaints——!"

"... Now we are carrying a sacred mission. The more we fight, the more we build, and the more progress we make. Culture, politics, and economics... have all made great progress..."

"In order to realize the great plan of winning the war of resistance and completing the construction of the country, the covenant of national mobilization must be strictly followed, sow the seeds of the spirit, create a strong force, strive for the final victory, and maintain world peace..."

Finally, following the majestic singing, the enthusiastic emotions of the audience showed the bright future of the war of resistance.

### Our Army Continues to Counterattack in Northeast River; Zengcheng × Army Falls into Heavy Siege Again; 10,000 More × Troops Suddenly Increase in Taipingchang, Northern Guangdong; A Major Battle Between Our × Armies Will Continue to Unfold on the Southern Battlefield

[Dongjiang Express News] The military of our Northeast River counterattack army has been tight and loose over the past week, and then tight again. Our armies continue to advance steadily. The × in Zengcheng is in panic, and has been trying to consolidate the inner encirclement and visit our surprise attacks for days. × is also continuously reinforcing them, and the × in Taipingchang is also reinforcing Shiling. The following are the details:

Continuing to Counterattack Zengcheng

Military affairs on the Eastern Front have indeed shown a trend of rapid decline after being intensified by our × again. We have made extremely strict preparations for the counterattack on Zengcheng. The armies in Boluo have been dispatched to the front lines one after another. Our elite troops are densely deployed in the Luofu Mountain area, advancing steadily towards the × positions in Zengcheng, dividing their troops and advancing. The main army on the front has advanced along the Bo-Zeng Highway, and the other famous roads have also been launched in the middle of the road.

The Zengcheng × Army Attempts to Defend to the Death

It has been found that there are currently more than a thousand × soldiers stationed in Zengcheng City, as well as more than ten motorboats outside Dongdou and more than ten civilian boats full of grain. Recently, our military operations have brought the entire × in Zengcheng under control. The front part is very close to the × position. × is also trying its best to consolidate and defend Zengcheng, so it has intensified the consolidation of the inner encirclement line in Zengcheng over the past week, building more forts and digging trenches, attempting to defend to the death.

Our × Outposts Have Made Contact

After our armies advanced separately, the armies have approached the × positions. There are also our troops in the Jigongkeng area. In the past week, our army has advanced extremely rapidly. General Wu Qiwai, the highest military commander responsible for directing the counterattack on the Eastern Front, personally arrived at the front line yesterday to direct and plan the counterattack. Therefore, we have made such rapid progress this week. Our × is in confrontation, so our × outposts have been in contact for days, but no major battles have occurred. The skirmishes of the past few days have been intermittent. In the future, a major battle will be fought in Zengcheng. During the week, our × troops have made active arrangements. × has been calling for reinforcements from all sides within the week. Currently, more than a thousand × new troops have arrived in Fuhe and Zhucun, northwest of Zengcheng. Together with the × troops stationed there before, there are about 3,000 people. There is also about one regiment near Zengcheng.

The Northern River × Army Reinforces Shiling

The war in the Northern River seems to have been silent again this week. In fact, × is quickly replenishing its forces, and our army is also quickly deploying for the Northern River War. The war will break out again within the week. On the evening of the 29th, more than a thousand × infantrymen moved from Taipingchang to Shengang. The original 400 × troops stationed in Shengang were transferred to Shiling to reinforce it. There are now about a thousand × troops in Shiling. A certain unit of our 12th Regiment Army has surrounded the × in Shiling, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate them together. On the morning of the 27th, a × electric boat sailed from Guangzhou to Nankou, downstream of Jiangcun, and fired more than ten shells at the various overseas Chinese homes west of Jiangcun, for an unknown purpose. × also forced our people to build many fortresses in Dasonggang, southwest of Jiangcun, in an attempt to defend to the death.

10,000 More × Troops Suddenly Increase in Taipingchang

Several thousand × troops suddenly increased in Taipingchang, Shengang, Tiegang, Zhongluotan, and other areas this week, for a total of about 10,000 people. They forced the gentry and civilians to build barracks and ammunition depots in Taipingchang, Shiling, and other places, and set a limit for each village near Yangcun in the cotton production area to send three children to Taipingchang within ten days to enter school and implement Han Chinese education. They also drew two able-bodied men to be formed into the South China Plainclothes Advance Team. On the 16th, × troops sent more than a hundred traitors to Huaxian County to pretend to be our plainclothes team and rob young children in Huaxian County City.

### × Occupies Jiaji City; Our Army Moves to New Position; Our × Armies Are Still in Stalemate

[South Road Express News] After × occupied Qiongshan, it recently harassed Qiongdong and Jiaji City. It has been constantly attacking the city on the 12th and 13th of last month, and has been repelled by us. The news has been recorded in previous reports. On the 14th and 15th, × launched a major attack again, advancing by land and air. The battle situation was most fierce on the 15th. After we obtained a considerable price, we moved to a new limit and are still in a stalemate in the nearby villages.

### Guerrillas Active in Guangzhou City; Bloody Battle on Xiaoshi Street Kills More Than Ten × Military Police; More Than One Hundred × Soldiers and Puppet Police Have Been Killed in the Past Six Months

Recently, several gold shops in Xiaoshi Street, Guangzhou have reopened for business. On March 25, our plainclothes team saw this and entered the shops to persuade them not to reopen in order to enrich Guangzhou by ×. Unexpectedly, the merchants secretly notified the × military police by telephone. In an instant, more than 30 × military police rushed to surround our plainclothes team. The plainclothes team resisted according to the danger. A fierce battle broke out between the two sides. In an instant, more than ten × soldiers were killed and wounded. Our plainclothes team retreated safely. One of our brave men also sacrificed. Afterwards, the × army vented its anger on the gold shop owners and arrested all of them. This is what is meant by being a villain. Since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou last autumn, it has organized self-defense groups to cooperate with the Japanese military police. There are a total of 26 branches and more than 300 sub-groups in the self-defense group. The expenses are collected from each household at a rate of one cent to three cents. However, in the past half year, more than one hundred × military police and puppet police have been intercepted and killed by our brave men. From this, it can be seen that our guerrillas are active in Guangzhou City.

### Our Strict Preparations in Chaoshan, Large Numbers of × Warships Gather Outside Aomen, Harassing Passing Ships, An American Oil Tanker is Sunk, Our Losses in Shantou After Bombing Are Still Minor

【Shantou Quick News】 Intelligence from military authorities here indicates that most × warships in the Chaoshan sea area are concentrated outside Aomen, such as the sea areas of Haifeng, Lufeng, and Huilai, while fewer are outside Shantou. Yesterday, one × plane took off from a × warship outside Aomen and conducted reconnaissance over Haifeng and Lufeng, but did not drop any bombs. Our defense forces and local militia are closely monitoring the coastal area. × has made no unusual movements for the time being. Another report states that × warships are harassing passing ships constantly, becoming increasingly brazen. At noon on the 30th, an oil tanker flying the American flag, while passing outside Aomen, was inexplicably bombarded by × warships. Soon after, the oil tanker was hit and sank. Whether the crew members escaped is still unknown.

【Shantou Quick News】 From 7:00 AM to noon on the 27th, Chenghai and Chaoyang in this city were bombed three times by × planes, destroying more than a dozen civilian houses and warehouses. Fortunately, our authorities were prepared and evacuated the population and goods in sequence, so the losses were still minor. The situation after the calamity is recorded as follows:

Disaster Area Survey: The losses from this air raid include houses numbered 1 to 5 beside Beihai Road destroyed, the Lao Jiuzheng Theater also destroyed, and the Liangmao Oil Mill at number 24 beside Beitidi Road was also damaged by the blast, but the losses were minor. The Fengji Garlic Warehouse at number 64 beside Beihai Road, and the empty warehouse at number 72 were also damaged. Also, a bomb landed in an open space in the warehouse of the Danish trading company Jebsen & Co. beside Beihai Road, destroying half of the public shelter. Fortunately, the refugees inside the shelter were not killed or injured. The indoor shelter of Liangmao Oil Mill was also shaken, but did not collapse. Among the twelve bombs dropped this time, one was an incendiary bomb, but fortunately, it did not spread the fire.

A Bloody Account:

Injured Civilians: Lin Na, female, was hit in the right arm by shrapnel near Guanghua Bridge. Ms. Li, female, was washing clothes in the courtyard of Hongyuan Shop on Yong'an Street and was hit in the forehead by shrapnel. Xin Fanzi, male, was injured in the foot by shrapnel in front of Mingfa on Wuqiao Road. Zhang Han, male, was injured in the left arm and leg near Guanghua Bridge. Ms. Zheng Lin was injured near Hua Bridge. Ms. Lin, from Chenghai, was injured in the right abdomen and thigh, as well as the calf, and the condition is very serious. There was also one person with minor injuries who returned home after receiving treatment from the ambulance team. Furthermore, the members of the Red Swastika Society and the ambulance team bravely rescued the injured yesterday, which is highly commendable.

Chaoshan Preparedness:

Our garrison authorities had prepared for the various actions of ×. Residents and goods in various places have been evacuated in sequence. The remaining citizens are organized. Therefore, the threat of × warships and planes, in addition to destroying a small part of the buildings, has not had much effect on us. Commander Hua Zhenzhong has also ordered his troops to be on alert along the coast.

### Supporting the Motherland's Resistance, Macau Service Group Will Go to the Dongjiang River, Yesterday They Passed Through Hong Kong, the Chung Sing Society Hosted Various Sectors

The third team of the Return to the Country Service Group, organized by the Macau Four Circles Disaster Relief Association, departed from Macau the other day to serve in the Dongjiang area. Passing through Hong Kong, a report on the preparatory process was held at the Chung Sing Charitable Society yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., hosting representatives from all walks of life. More than 30 people attended. During the event, Li Zhiqiang, Chairman of the Association, delivered a speech, stating that since the outbreak of the war, the Association has been established and initially carried out dance relief work. After the war extended to South China, battlefield service groups were organized. The first team went to Shaping to serve, and the second team went to Hecheng. Although these two teams did not have good results in the past, they still tried their best to fulfill their national duties. The Association has now received the assistance of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Macau, enabling the organization of the third service group, which will depart during the day to serve in the Dongjiang area. Finally, Li expressed his gratitude to all circles for their assistance. Chen Jianlian then reported on the preparatory process, followed by speeches from representatives of various groups. The team consists of 15 people. The list of team members is as follows: Team leader: Li Zuqiang, Qu Yongning.

### Only Women and Children Evacuated from Shantou, Business Still as Usual, Defense Arrangements Consolidated, × Not Easy to Invade, Hong Kong-Shantou Ships Run as Usual, Goods Crowded

(Hong Kong News) Our army recently launched a counter-offensive against Guangzhou, winning victories one after another. In order to contain our military strength, × has attempted to harass Shantou. The Shantou authorities, in order to prevent and deal with this, recently ordered the evacuation of citizens and the relocation of factories within a time limit, implementing a scorched-earth policy. In order to understand the recent situation in Shantou, the reporter specially visited Mr. Lin Zifeng, chairman of the Chaoshan Chamber of Commerce, who had returned to Hong Kong after inspecting Shantou, and asked him questions. According to his answers to the reporter's questions: "After the Zhoutou Nan War shifted, Shantou is the only transportation hub for Chinese merchants. ×'s attempt to harass did not start today. Therefore, the Shantou authorities have been arranging the defense work of Shantou for a long time, so that × will not invade easily. According to the observation of general military strategists, × cannot attack Shantou without using 10,000 troops. The solidity of its defense can be known from this. × is in a time of national poverty and military exhaustion, but the authorities are still worried that once a war occurs, the first to be killed will be the residents of Shantou. For the sake of both the front and the rear, it was announced a few days ago that citizens would be evacuated within a time limit. However, as seen by my brother in Shantou, the evacuation situation is that citizens are very calm. Those who are evacuated are all women and children, while 80 to 90% of the general laborers and businessmen still remain in Shantou. Business is unchanged, and the Hong Kong-Shantou ships are running as usual. However, due to the excessive accumulation of export goods in Shantou from all parties, it has been quite crowded in recent days." He also said that regarding the Hong Kong authorities recognizing Shantou as an epidemic port and prohibiting third-class passengers from coming to Hong Kong, this measure not only affects Shantou merchants, but also has a considerable impact on shipping companies. The Chaojia Chamber of Commerce will jointly submit a petition to the Hong Kong authorities, requesting that the ban be lifted.

### The Porcelain Industry of Fengxi in Chao'an

— Juren

(Special Correspondent in Chao'an) Chinese porcelain is a major export and has a high position internationally. The first reason is the excellence of the soil, and the second is the long history. Later, because it failed to adapt to the times and improve, the market was seized by latecomers. Especially after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, exports were difficult, so it became even more depressed.

Speaking of Chinese porcelain, everyone knows that Jingdezhen is the most famous. The excellence of the porcelain and the skill of the work are unmatched by any manufacturer and are very popular with foreigners. The foreign market is quite active. However, due to the impact of the war, Jingdezhen unfortunately fell into the hands of ×, and all the porcelain industry equipment was completely destroyed. The Chinese porcelain industry was thus severely hit. Not only did the output decline, but also the production was affected. In addition to Jingdezhen in Jiangxi, Fengxi in Chaozhou is the next most important porcelain-producing area. The porcelain industry in Fengxi has not only been unaffected by the war of resistance, but has become more prosperous due to the demand after the fall of Jingdezhen. Most of the domestic supply and part of the foreign market depend on Fengxi. Therefore, the porcelain industry in Fengxi today is worthy of our attention.

During the reporter's trip to Shaozhou, he made a special trip to Fengxi for sightseeing when passing through Chaozhou. There are dozens of porcelain factories in Fengxi, large and small. Most of them treat it as a family industry. All members of the family can work. There are also large-scale factories that employ hundreds of workers. Fengxi regards this handicraft as its lifeline. According to rough statistics, about 20,000 people rely on this business for food, and the number of people who indirectly profit is the same. It can be seen that the impact of the Fengxi porcelain industry is great. The clay for making porcelain raw materials can be taken freely in Fengxi, and the value of other materials is also very cheap, so the cost of porcelain is not high, and the profit is very good. It can be said that this is the most reliable handicraft.

Under the guidance of Captain Wu of the Social Training Team, the reporter visited a large-scale porcelain factory: The work is divided into several different departments, and the work procedure is to first grind the clay into powder, soak it in water five times, and pile it up on the wall to dry. When the soil is firm, start making the blanks. The machines for making blanks are very simple: a rotating graphic disc, a bamboo skin, and a small knife. Anything can be made. I think: if they were given a motor, the efficiency of the work would definitely be increased a lot, but they never want to resort to mechanical power. Their engine is an old leg. After the blank is made, it is dried and then colored. A layer of varnish is added to the uncolored ones. The coloring is admirable. They can write uniform floral and textual patterns like printing. After all the work is done, it is taken to the kiln to be fired into various kinds of porcelain. The kiln for firing porcelain is not small in scale and looks almost like a fortress from a distance.

The porcelain in Fengxi has obviously made great progress. The most exquisite works are the figures, toys, and porcelain plaques, which can be traced back to the works of Jingdezhen. Many large Hong Kong and other places' salt restaurants' special porcelain are made here. The number of porcelain exports every year is quite astonishing. Recently, it is said that it has been increasing.

### Walt Disney's Second Feature-Length Cartoon Film, Decided to Adapt the Famous Fairy Tale Blue Bird, To Be Adapted After Acquiring Copyright

Walt Disney is planning to produce a second feature-length cartoon film, which will be longer than "Snow White." Like "Snow White," this film will also be based on a world-famous fairy tale called "Blue Bird" (L'Oiseau Bleu).

However, the author of the fairy tale (Belgian) Matex Lfn is still alive. Walt Disney must purchase the copyright of the book "Blue Bird" from him. They have discussed it several times. The author asked for 30,000 US dollars, while Walt was only willing to pay 25,000 US dollars. Until now, everyone's opinions are still deadlocked.

If Walt Disney does acquire the rights to the book, he will also have to adapt the story into a movie script and add many humorous elements before he can start production.

### Husband, Wife, Friend (II)

But Tao Si changed the subject and said with a smile: "You are a rough man. You don't understand etiquette at all. You are just an athlete from an engineering school."

Rio corrected: "Is an athletic champion!"

Rio kicked off a shoe and said, "I have been an American athlete twice."

Tao Lis said: "There is nothing strange about this."

Rio Na said: "I do feel proud."

"You don't like opera, but you go to sleep. You don't like any art."

"I like baseball."

Tao Lis chuckled, and changed into a green casual wear. Rio La stretched out his arms and hugged her over and asked, "Will you marry me?"

She opened her eyes wide and said, "Marry you again?" He nodded. "But if you get married and then get married, don't you know what people will gossip about? Dear, this will really become a scandal!"

Rio lowered his head, "I love you so deeply - what do you say if I change the names of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and live in a hotel with you?"

She smiled. "You are still so enthusiastic, it's been five years!"

"Lover, there is no such thing as five years or not," Rio Na replied: "Every time I see you, it always seems like the first time." He kissed her.

Tao Lis let him hug her. "Dear, how sweet!" After a pause, he said, "What are you thinking?"

Rio Na replied: "Learned from books. But this kiss was not learned." As he hugged her like this, his face gradually became serious. "Lover, I have something to tell you. But I have always wanted not to tell you." Tao Lis sat up in surprise at the time. He continued, "It's easy to say this, but the fact is -"

"Say it!" Tao Lis was terrified.

"—You are a snob."

Tao Lis was silent for a while, and suddenly shouted "What are you talking about?" She beat him wildly, and stopped only when he caught her.

He said, "If you don't have a social status, I will definitely knock you to the ground." But after a while, he put on casual clothes, leaned on her bedpost, and said, "Would you like another opera to send you to sleep?"

Tao Lis pleaded, "Please don't, it's late!"

Yong Ola took a full breath of her chest, showed her teeth and sang. Tao Lis pulled up the quilt to cover her head. Yong Ola's voice was very loud. She sang Lala Lala and went into the bathroom.

### South China Football Team Prepares for Southern Expedition, Scheduled to Play Against Foreign Sailors Tomorrow, Zhang Jinhai to Play for South China and Play Tomorrow, South China to Play Against the Meville Ship Again This Friday

[This newspaper's special report] Although the football season has ended, the footballers of the South China banner are still practicing diligently day and night in preparation for the Southern Expedition.

At 7 p.m. last night, the members of the football department of the association held a meeting in the billiards room of the association on the eighth floor of the China Building to discuss the Southern Expedition. It was decided to elect Mo Qing as the team leader, and Mo will be responsible for all the preparations for the Southern Expedition.

The date of departure has not yet been determined, approximately in the late of this month. As for the Southern Expedition athletes, there will be about 20 people, a very strong force, with the Nanyang area as the destination.

For the sake of practical practice, it is agreed that the British warship "Jian" will have a friendly match at Caroline Hill at 5:15 p.m. tomorrow. The warship has agreed to send a team to the venue to compete at that time.

The warship is full of talent, and its team is enough to compete with any strong team. More than half of the players in the navy team that decided the runner-up of the甲组 League last week are veterans of the warship.

South China will respond with a mixed team, and its strength is quite strong. Zhang Jinhai and Zhong Yongshen, who came to Hong Kong from Chongqing, are willing to play for South China and have registered with the General Association.

Tomorrow, Jinhai will be transferred to the right inside forward, but Yongshen will only play on the 5th against the Meville ship. The South China lineup for tomorrow has been drawn up as follows:

Zhu Zhaogeng, Li Guowei, Ruan Shu, Xie Jinhong, Liu Qingcai, Guo Yingqi, Luo Douwen, Bei Hua, Dehui, Zhang Jinhai, Deng Guangsen

Reserves: Yang Shuiyi, Tan Zhenhui, Liang Baiwei, Zhong Yongshen, Li Enliang, Chen Zhongxian, Lu Dakeng, Yang Genbao.

On Friday of this week, we will play against Maowei at Jiashan at 5:15 p.m. Maowei also has many famous generals, which are not ordinary. At this time of recession in the ball, it is a great thing to have these two friendly matches to embellish the field. Tell the fans not to miss the feast.

Tickets will be charged for these two games, with covered stands at four jiao, and open-air stands at two jiao. (Ball Court Grand Duke)

### Basketball Game Surprise, Pui Ying Beats South China, Chung Sing Fights Hard to Beat Kwong Ta, Group B Li Hang Wins Wah Kiu

In the public men's basketball game, in the first game last night, Chung Sing played against Kwong Ta. It was generally expected that Chung Sing would win, but at the beginning of the battle, Kwong Ta took the lead with a score of 10 to 3. The absence of Kwok Chik Hung affected Chung Sing's offensive a lot. Although Cheung Yan Sing is not as good as Kwok, Cheung's performance was quite outstanding, responding to each other with the two wings, often receiving unexpected gains. Shum Sui Hing worked very hard, galloping around, and his accurate shooting was a credit to Chung Sing. Chan Yu Ching was originally the soul of the team, but he was too arbitrary last night and lost many opportunities under the basket, causing him to be closely pursued by the opponent. However, his interceptions and receiving of the ball are steady and skillful, and he has reached the point of perfection. Dodging enemy guards is especially skillful. Li Yuanfen and Su Bohui, who defended their own basket, can also be said to be responsible. Most of the balls shot by Kwong Ta came from long shots, so it was not because of the lack of resistance from the two. Among Kwong Ta's forwards, Lao Tung and Yuk Tong were the most outstanding. One was strong and one was attacking in secret, gaining a lot of credit. In addition, the shooting was accurate, so they were able to keep up with each other. Leung Kong Keung pinned down Chan Yu Ching, and Wu Chao Yi, as a defender, often directly attacked the enemy's basket. The two made a lot of wonderful achievements for Kwong Ta, but unfortunately their skills were inferior and they were eventually defeated by Chung Sing.

In the course of the game, Kwong Ta took the lead with 10 to 3, and then tied the score at 18 to 18. Then Chung Sing counterattacked and won with 26 to 19, and the first half ended. Then they took the lead with 28 to 20. After changing baskets, Chung Sing took the lead with 34 to 28 and 45 to 36, all the way. However, Kwong Ta was only behind by three points each time. Until the end of the game, Chung Sing won with 55 to 48.

In the second game, South China played against Pui Ying. In this session, South China was known as high, and commentators generally said that Pui Ying, who had lost more and won less, was really no match. Unexpectedly, there was another surprise in this game, and Pui Ying actually won. There are two reasons for their victory: one is the appropriate tactics, and the other is the desperate efforts of each team member. Qiu Guangxie's transfer to defender was the basis for victory. Because South China's Huang Zuode is agile, and his shooting under the basket is foolproof. Although he is surrounded in the core, he can always use his last struggle and is ultimately calculated. In yesterday's battle, Guangxie guarded his basket, and few of the enemy's passes and rebound balls were not intercepted by him. Therefore, Huang Zuode almost had no place to use his hero. Yi Rirong also followed step by step, pinning down his opponent. The forwards Lin Wanli and Pan Jinhong had unexpected effects with their long and short shots. Although the team's connection was not wonderful, the offense and defense were fast. They made every effort to intercept the enemy's transmission, and did not let go of the slightest. Therefore, South China's three forwards were pinned down and had no way to get close to the basket. Every time they had a chance to shoot, they could not get what they wanted. Later, they changed to the long-range shooting method, but it did not help the matter. The two guards were not as outstanding as before, so they were defeated by Pui Ying, whose performance was average.

In the course of the game, Pui Ying took the lead with 9 to 4 and 17 to 9, all the way in the limelight. Until the end of the first half, they still won 23 to 20. After changing baskets, Pui Ying's forward shot repeatedly hit the target, and then won 31 to 13. In the middle, South China once counterattacked and the situation was slightly better, but in a flash, they fell behind again with 18 to 41. After that, although they tried hard to recover the decline, at this time it was like a soul swimming in the bottom of the pot, and there was no way to turn over. Until the end of the game, Pui Ying won with 46 to 30.

In the last game, Li Hang played against Wah Kiu. The strength of the two teams was one strong and one weak, and there was nothing to see. However, Li Hang players Liu Bangyan, Lin Youpei, Chen Yu, and Lu Dezhang all performed abnormally, giving Wah Kiu an opportunity to attack. In the first half, they were only behind by 14 to 18. In the second half, Li Hang's connection gradually became better, and Huang Jiuwu's long-range shots hit the basket several times. At this time, Wah Kiu was also exhausted. As a result, Dong Hang won with 36 to 22.

### Grass Court Tennis Doubles: Xu Family Wins Finals Spot; 3-0 Elimination of Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi

Yesterday, in the All-Hong Kong Open Grass Court Tennis tournament, a doubles semi-final took place between Xu Weipei and Xu Runpei versus Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi. Ultimately, the Xu duo triumphed with a score of 3-0, securing their place in the finals.

In the first set, the Lin-Huang pair performed sluggishly, losing four games consecutively. They then managed to win three games in a row, advancing to 3-5. At this point, the Xu brothers dared not be negligent, employing bold and decisive strikes.

In the second set, the Lin-Huang pair launched a fierce offensive from the start, using attack as defense. Lin's serve was accurate and powerful, and Huang capitalized on this by volleying at the net, gaining an advantage and firmly holding a 5-3 lead. Unexpectedly, their good fortune didn't last, as the Xu brothers steadily caught up, creating a 5-5 tie. They then won another set with a score of 8-6.

In the third set, the Lin-Huang pair continued to use attack as defense, taking the first game. However, a slight misstep led to scores of 2-2 and 3-3. After these two ties, they were unable to produce any further strong plays and lost with a score of 4-6.

Overall, the Xu brothers were undeniably superior in skill. Their cooperation was also exceptional. However, the Xu brothers frequently had "double fault" serves, which skilled tennis players generally consider a faux pas. If they can pay attention to this and act cautiously, they will benefit greatly in the competition.

Yesterday, Lin's serving technique was remarkable, with dangerous landing points that frequently earned him points. His net interceptions were also crisp and powerful. The biggest weakness was his lack of defensive ability. If a ball was hit with a slight angle, he couldn't handle it. He also often misjudged the landing point of the ball. His volleys often slipped, which proved this point.

Huang Jinxi gave his best performance and showed improvement compared to his usual play. He had particularly excellent performances in the second set. The scores are recorded below:

Xu Weipei Xu Runpei beat Lin Tiande Huang Jinxi 6-3 8-6 6-4

### Philippine-Hong Kong Interport Football Match: Hong Kong Team Loses 1-3; Li Huitang Suffers Leg Cramp Shortly After Kickoff

[Manila Dispatch] The Philippine-Hong Kong interport football match was held at the Rizal Memorial Stadium here on the evening of the 30th. A large crowd attended. Shortly after the kickoff, Hong Kong team center forward Li Huitang suffered a leg cramp and left the field. He soon returned, but his movements were less agile, and his leadership was not as effective. However, the first half saw both sides maintain a strong stalemate, ending in a 0-0 tie. In the second half, the Hong Kong team faced rapid attacks from the Philippine players and conceded two goals in a row. After several attempts, Da Gaoshan Nu managed to score one goal back. However, just as the situation was heating up, the Hong Kong team's forward line became weak, and the Philippine team scored another goal, ending the match with a score of 1-3. Furthermore, South China Athletic Association received a telegram yesterday stating that Li Huitang played in the evening's match and temporarily left the field due to a leg cramp. After a short rest, he recovered his original state. He is expected to play as usual in the match against the league champion YGO team on Thursday. The rumors of injury are not factual. Liang Rongzhao had a slight injury while in Hong Kong. His injury had not yet recovered that evening, so he did not play. The rumors of injury are also inaccurate.

### The Duality of Realism

— Jie Ru

The approach of realism in literary theory is associated with the development of scientific worldviews and ways of thinking. Realism in literature not only rises and falls, developing through all stages of art history, but also organically provides a critical summary of human artistic practice. It scientifically extracts its positive components from the artistic activities of various eras and writers to nourish itself. At the same time, it absorbs the achievements of the development of human scientific worldviews and ways of thinking, using them as a foundation for its own standing. Therefore, realism in literature is actually an organic fusion of artistic methods and scientific methods, and it is the highest peak reached so far by human artistic creation methods and a great development in the flight of art, leading to an unprecedented flourishing of realism in literature.

Scientific methods and artistic methods enter into realism as two essential mechanisms and two basic components. Therefore, realism unifies and synthesizes the special methods of art with the logical methods of science. The Soviet Union's new artistic theorist, Mirsky, believes that "realism includes the following two basic tendencies: first, it brings the specific social and temporal external characteristics that give the impression of reality; second, due to a deeper generalization of images compared to the superficial, it expresses the essential meaning of society and its development, thereby completing the most in-depth perspective on the historical content of reality." These two significant tendencies undoubtedly concretely embody the internal opposition of realism and the contradiction between artistic cognition and scientific cognition. At the same time, it embodies "the essential consistency of realism, which has the specific nature of the impression of reality" and "external characteristics," while also bearing "the most in-depth perspective of the historical content of reality." This is precisely the foundation of the duality of realism.

The duality of realism comes from the duality of the artistic construction process. The contradiction between scientific methods and artistic methods in the artistic construction process forms its own duality. However, this contradiction is rooted in the contradiction between rational cognition and emotional cognition in the process of human understanding. From the understanding of the duality of realism, we must first recognize their contradictions and their unity, and recognize that although there are contradictions between them, there is not necessarily a conflict. Rational cognition and perceptual cognition, scientific methods and artistic methods, are not necessarily antagonistic or incompatible. They often complement each other and communicate with each other, thereby completing their own complete forms. Therefore, realism, in its internal structure, bears the characteristic of its duality. However, this duality cannot be regarded as a defect in the structure of realism. On the contrary, it is sufficient to show the infinite richness of the constitutive content of realism. Only realism that integrates rational cognition and perceptual cognition, and incorporates artistic methods and scientific methods as two organic components into itself, can possess its duality.

However, due to the duality of realism, the realistic meaning of the writer's techniques and the overall realism are often separated. This is especially common among backward writers who cannot keep up with the times. They grasp a kind of seemingly correct realism, writing about life as if it were unchanging, unable to see the true rebirth of the future. Although they want to write about revolution and construction, they cannot see the building being constructed itself, but only see some of the dust of construction. This is "realism with clipped wings, only writing trivial matters, seeing trees but not the forest, looking at individual facts but not reaching the whole" (Mirsky). Therefore, their realism is partial and purely technical. In their internal structure of creative methods, the scientific method and the artistic method have irreconcilable contradictions, just as Rozenthal said: "Artists who strive to reproduce the true appearance of the world, reality penetrates the writer's works with extraordinary power, and the writer's cognitive stance is weakened by the intrusion of this reality, often becoming contradictory." This contradiction arises because the writer's understanding of objective reality is not deep enough.

Although the lack of understanding of reality and the defects of worldview are sufficient to make realism degenerate into "technical realism," realism often acts as a huge force, prompting writers to overcome the shortcomings in their understanding of the world. Engels once said: "Balzac, with his realism, shattered the shackles of his own feudal political views." This sentence is enough to see the organic and dynamic role of realism. As long as a writer approaches reality due to his realism, he will at some point stand on a correct worldview. This dynamically influences the worldview and inevitably leads to a correct worldview, which is "the victory of realism," that is, the victory brought about by the duality of realistic meaning.

### The Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

Soon, he found a comrade to buy her some picture postcards and candy. He comforted her and said:

"What else do you want to buy? Tell me."

"I don't want to buy anything. Don't I know you don't have any money?"

In these words, there was a latent, immense sympathy. This sympathy was the first she had given them—the Volunteer Army—since arriving.

At this moment, unexpectedly, the sound of someone selling newspapers on the road below rang into the room:

"Look, the bandits' big kidnapping! Look, the news about Miss Zhu being kidnapped at gunpoint!"

——The general idea and the facts are similar. In addition, in the newspaper, there was a reward notice for 100,000 yuan and a page of her photos. The photos were printed very clearly. Even strangers who saw her for the first time would immediately recognize that the photo was her face.

She said:

"Buy me a newspaper!"

He hesitated, worried that the news in the newspaper would stimulate her recently calmed mood.

"You can use my money to buy it!"

She misunderstood, took out a bundle of banknotes from her pocket, and gave them to him. He refused and said:

"We still have some change."

"No, keep my money by your side for me to use. It can also buy you some good food!"

He accepted it, because rejected sympathy easily causes resentment. Then, she urged him again:

"Buy me the newspaper!"

He was still hesitant, as if thinking about some unforgettable thing. She was so anxious that she playfully pushed his body, turning him into a softened clay figure. In this instant, she unconsciously showed an action guaranteed by friendship, temporarily forgetting the relationship between her and the other party—kidnapper and kidnap victim. She said to him mockingly in a friendly way:

"Go quickly! This is the first time I've asked you. Look, you're putting on airs!" (May Fourth)

### Food, Men, Women, and Dwelling

— Chi Qiang

This past week, I was busy sending airmail letters. The letters used a telegraphic style of writing, never quite filling a single sheet; and the attached items outside the letter were impossible to shorten. Long nights invite many dreams. Consequently, each postal layer became considerably expensive. Because I myself have never flown, entrusting my spiritual belongings to have the opportunity to "ride the long wind and cleave the waves for three thousand miles" gave me a novel sensation in ordinary life. However, with a sky full of stars and supremely elegant writing, even if the plane were to crash, it would at least achieve the truly deserved "falling flowers on the water's surface all become poetry"!

Because of this, I was reminded of some questions about life. Here it comes again! Life, when life is hard to come by, especially during a time of all-out resistance, friends—those heretical naysayers—want to discourage you. Moreover, dispersing the population is also a way to "undertake one's duty according to rank." Individual bullets and collective bullets don't concern themselves with human life. So what's the use of flattering—? After the martial and literary, let's get to it!

So I thought that the gun still needs to be aimed, and the act of aiming is nothing more than to "clearly identify the enemy." If you don't aim accurately, the enemy will "laugh in your face" at the muzzle of your gun. This is naturally not something I, who has never rushed to the front lines, can explain clearly. Let's just say—this "let's just say" has a good reason. Without branching off into different topics, the main point is that "resistance is above all else." Dealing with just this one aspect head-on is already enough. However, living in this place, which is neither the front nor the rear, half like a "gilded city" and half like an "ivory tower," the "bright eyes and white teeth," sometimes punctuated by bursts of righteous indignation and tender patriotic—elegant resistance of the ladies, can really be frustrating!

People are so busy that you could almost say they have no free time. Some things are finished, and then others come. And when those are finished, they come again and again, until black hair turns white, and the unwavering are swayed and perhaps fall. Moreover, there are some things that are neither officially assigned nor stipulated by contract; they are not official duties. Eating, men and women, dwelling, etc., are "butting in," forcing a person, besides talking about love (of country) and resisting (the enemy), to personally engage in eating, men and women, and dwelling. In this respect, the gentlemen and ladies on the isolated island and all sorts of partners are most delighted. Some people call it "red-blooded joy"—"not giving up until reaching the Yellow River, and wanting to cross it even after getting there." This is truly an overwhelming sea of desire, beyond salvation!

Eating, men and women, and dwelling, therein lies humanity's greatest desires—the ancients said, "Food and sex are human nature." For modern people, it means eating, loving, and sleeping; you can't do without any of them.

Mr. Yu Dafu believed that "behind vermilion gates, meat and wine rot, while on the wild fields lie frozen corpses. That is why there must be class struggle: on one side, three thousand beauties in the imperial harem, the monarch never tires of looking at them; on the other side, the husband and wife in Shihao Village are separated, the husband defending the frontier, the wife in Wu, that is why there must be revolution." Then he explained:

"However, the desires for food and sex, being fundamental desires, are very easy to satisfy. No matter how great an epicure you are, as long as you have a jug of wine, a single goose, three bowls of white rice, and a large flatbread, you can always be satisfied. After eating your fill, even if you invite more guests, you won't be able to eat any more. As for sex, no matter how energetic you are, at most you can handle ten women. After ten women, even if it's Xi Shi or Yang Guifei, you won't be able to arouse any sexual desire."

This seems to solve some of life's desires, so there's really no need to say more.

However, after "eating their fill," do you expect them to love their country? After "no longer being able to arouse sexual desire," do you expect them to resist or step onto the path of national salvation? No, no. Let's not get into high-minded talk about what is low. Ever since Liang Qichao designed that "manufacturing heroes machine," ever since Bian Que said, "Essence generates and the body is strengthened," ever since "circumstances dictate," ever since using "the rear" as an excuse, ever since temporarily not being a traitor, ever since "our own people have something to say and want to go to someone to talk," which sounds perfectly logical and happens to align with the supreme principle that the people's livelihood is above all else, only then do they lower their flags and cease their drums, and everyone gathers around food, men and women, and dwelling, enjoying life.

Large advertisements, large crowds of shivering pedestrians, three-dimensional architecture, and ingenious designs all strive to provide supporting evidence for this article.

I don't understand the psychology of various groups in society, so what I say is unpleasant to hear. But who can do without white rice, men and women, and sleep?

Precisely because they cannot be separated from them, in the past, they stirred up political waves to trade in public bonds. Now that the country is in crisis, there is also disaster money to be made. As for embezzling disaster relief funds, spreading rumors, and scheming for foreign exchange, filling their own pockets, then the great desires pass through all sixty-four hexagrams. Every hexagram leads to success.

Mr. Cao once distinguished between a traitor and a puppet. The group of people seen before one's eyes probably won't all become traitors, but becoming puppets is quite possible, with many potential factors involved.

When that time comes, then after eating, men and women, and dwelling, there will be yet another new reason born out of ten thousand "environmental pressures." Then we, a group of friends rushing around with pointless busyness on paper, will finally feel it's all in vain.

### Driving in the Snow

— Zhi Yin

The sun tightly hides in the depths of the mountains, revealing a trace of gray-white light. The sky presents a terrifying deathly gray color, as if wanting to collapse onto the massive ground. All around is somber, like the eyes of a giant beast extending its claws to seize food.

The north wind blows from the gaps in the mountains, from between the branches of the trees, from all sides, on the ground, from all directions, sweeping over the mountains, sweeping over the trees, sweeping over the ground and the river surface, opening its wings, sweeping away the darkness and stillness of dawn.

At this time, there is only one kind of light shining on the earth, a jade-like purity, a crystal-like brilliance. A light as soft as wild duck down. Oh! Look! Gazing out, a winding circle of mountains is covered with a layer of silvery-white stuff. The mountain gravel has become beads of various shapes. The withered branches are like suddenly blooming pear blossoms, and a kind of lush, pure white pear blossom never seen before. The petals seem to be woven from silver threads. That road has also turned into one paved with gemstones, or like a brand new rug of milky-white velvet... Oh, this is snow, that is the light of snow. Surrounded by the glittering silvery-white, the small stream is especially green and lovely. That clear jade-green water is like a moon among the stars, standing tall, holy, and pure.

Faintly, the sound of a horn rings out, the notes vibrating with clarity and sorrow, a moving melody echoing in the space.

In the distance, a long string of olive-green formations appears, slowly moving forward. The formations appear on the mountain peaks, in the gaps between the mountains, on the mountains opposite... endlessly, appearing in the mountains.

In the distance, the sound of horses neighing is heard, drawn out long, carrying a piercing grief that stirs the heart.

Other than that, there are no other sounds, only the slight "swish—swish!" sound of straw sandals stepping in the snow.

The congealed air only loosened up a corner, the surroundings were still heavy, the earth still half-asleep, its dreamy eyes not yet fully open.

On the mountains and roads, countless uneven footprints appeared in a disorderly fashion. As they slowly came closer, the footprints became more and more numerous, etching scars on this vast expanse of white.

The sun gradually revealed a little red light from the depths of the mountains. The red sunlight shone on the white snow, dressing the trees, mountains, and ground in pale pink clothes, as if in a magical, colorful world.

Opening one's chest and taking a deep breath of the morning air, fresh and fragrant, directly touching the internal organs, the whole body bathing in the subtle light of the sun, the cold seemed to lessen a bit, feeling a kind of joy and comfort that light was about to arrive. Tens of thousands of people raised their heads, tens of thousands of hearts resonated with the same emotion. Dawn, dawn is about to arrive, China's victorious dawn is about to arrive.

Tens of thousands of people, all came from the distant south. Today, they were ordered to move from the southeast battlefield, passing through many miles of long journeys, crossing mountain ranges, crossing long bridges, highways, and railways, and be transferred to the north of the Yangtze River. Tens of thousands of people held the same firm heart, the same aspiration. Today, they were about to begin a difficult and distant march, without the slightest bit of timidity, without the slightest bit of fear, because their eyes had already seen the light of the nation's victory.

Snow, for these strong men from the south, was a novel thing. They had never seen something so bright, so pure white and shining, so soft. This was simply a dreamscape, a myth. Most of them had never left home, only a few had followed the army north twelve years ago, and had seen snow...

"Swish, swish, swish..." Tens of thousands of people were marching in the snow, the sun shining warm light, the sky no longer deathly gray. The somberness of the surroundings had also been dispelled. The light of the snow and the light of the sun intertwined, forming an omen of bright victory.

"Swish, swish, swish..." The formation was moving forward.

The bugle was sounding again, majestic, solemn.
