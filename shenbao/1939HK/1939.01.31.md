### The Temptation and ×× of the Oriental Aggressors - On Japan's Reply to the Tripartite Note from the United States, Britain, and France

In light of the Japanese aggressors' ××× actions in the Far East, violating the Nine-Power Treaty, undermining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and the security of the powers' interests in the Far East, the United States, Britain, and France successively presented strongly worded notes to the Japanese government in October and December of last year, and January of this year. All three notes explicitly stated: (1) Japan's actions in the Far East today clearly undermine the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and the principle of the Open Door Policy; (2) they resolutely refuse to recognize any new situation in the Far East created by force; (3) they will continue to abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, and all issues must be resolved fairly through international conferences. These solemn and forceful notes from the United States, Britain, and France were undoubtedly a rude awakening for the Japanese aggressors, especially at a time when the Japanese aggressors' offensive in China was entering a new stage of difficulty. It can indeed be seen as a major blow and a fresh example of Japan's isolation and lack of justice in the international community.

How did the Japanese aggressors respond to these forceful notes from the United States, Britain, and France? They had two paths to take. The first path was to accept the protests of the United States, Britain, and France, halt their military aggression in China, hold an international conference, and jointly discuss a thorough solution to the Far East problem. The second path was to resolutely reject the protests of the United States, Britain, and France, and continue to advance the so-called steps to create a new order in the Far East. However, the first path was clearly a fundamental negation of the fascist aggression route, forming a complete surrender of Japan to the European and American powers, which was not only unacceptable to the Japanese fascist military clique but also unbearable for the leaders of Japanese financial and capital tycoons to witness. As for the second path, it was advocated by the Japanese military clique and was also the intention of the leaders of financial and capital tycoons. However, this would not only further increase the difficulties of the Japanese aggressors in the international community, but they were also practically on the verge of being unable to support the military aggression in China. How could they create more powerful enemies and hasten their own demise? Because these two paths were impassable, they came up with a policy that combined enticement and intimidation.

According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 30th, Japan will notify the United States and Britain during the day, stating that Japan is willing to negotiate directly with them on the modification of the principles of the "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity" in China. This is a kind of enticement. The purpose of this enticement policy is to cover up the damage inflicted on the European and American powers by Japan's aggression against China and expansion of its sphere of influence in the Far East, and to entice the European and American powers to be blinded by the nominal "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity" principles, placing all the Far Eastern interests of various countries under the rule of the Japanese aggressors, serving the Japanese aggressors for life, intensifying the exploitation of China and even the weak and small nations in various parts of the Far East, and obtaining commissions or wages from Japan. Moreover, they specifically stated that they would negotiate directly with each country separately and were unwilling to participate in an international conference. This further reveals their cunning plan to defeat the peaceful and democratic countries one by one and undermine the joint sanctions of the peaceful and democratic countries.

A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the same day also stated that although Japan expressed its willingness to negotiate directly with the United States and Britain, before the negotiations, the United States and Britain must first recognize certain conditions, including (1) complete freedom of world commerce, (2) freedom of residence and travel for Eastern races, (3) abolition of tariff barriers and import restrictions, and free purchase of raw materials related to national survival. This is intimidation after enticement, that is, it is stated that Japan will never abandon its position and actions of promoting the "Japan-Manchukuo-China Group" and establishing a "New Order in East Asia." In particular, the Reuters dispatch from Tokyo stated that the point that will be emphasized in Japan's reply is the so-called "complete freedom of world commerce," including (1) abolition of existing economic blocs and (2) abolition of tariff barriers. Also, the so-called "fair distribution of resources" includes (1) free purchase of raw materials for national survival and (2) free access to resources needed for national defense. These two points not only require the United States and Britain to openly recognize that Japan's plunder in China and military development in the Far East in the future are legitimate, but also to assume the obligation of supplying Japan with the raw materials and funds needed for aggression!

Judging from the content of this reply to the United States and Britain, which has been disclosed in advance by the Japanese side, it is evident that the Japanese aggressors have adopted a dual strategy of enticement and intimidation in response to the strong notes of the European and American powers. However, their lack of sincerity in peacefully resolving the Far East dispute can be said to be completely exposed. Especially at a time when the two Western aggressors, Italy and Germany, have just won a new victory in Spain, creating a sinister and volatile serious situation in Europe, especially at a time when the rulers of Britain and France, although severely damaged, are still unwilling to completely abandon their policy of appeasement towards the aggressors, and especially at a time when the anti-fascist and anti-aggression united front of righteous people and working masses from all over the world has not yet fully formed and expanded, it is not at all surprising that the Oriental aggressor, Japan ××, is taking the opportunity to entice and threaten the United States, Britain, and France, attempting to confiscate all their weapons of resistance and further act as an assistant to the Japanese aggressors.

What we should pay attention to today is, first, although Japan's policy of enticement and intimidation can conversely prove the seriousness of the internal and external difficulties of the Japanese aggressors and that they will inevitably increase these difficulties as a result, we cannot ignore the fact that the Japanese fascist aggressors are closely colluding with the German and Italian fascist aggressors. This fact is the basis for Japan's continued ×× insidious and conspiratorial dual policy of enticement. We must expose this conspiracy of Japan ×× at any time and advise the friendly countries of peace and democracy. Secondly, if the friendly countries of peace and democracy, Britain and France, do not thoroughly abandon their policy of appeasement towards the fascist aggressors, then the insidious intimidation of the aggressive countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy will become even more unbridled, and any serious protests and forceful notes will become useless talismans. Therefore, we must urge the friendly countries of Britain, France, and the United States to use closely cooperative practical forces to counterattack the fascist aggressors and crush any enticement, intimidation, and conspiracy after such serious protests and forceful notes encounter failure. Finally, we must understand that this kind of counterattack can only be realized under the joint promotion of the righteous and peaceful people and the oppressed masses of all countries in the world. Therefore, we must mobilize all forces to organize this great force.

### A Visit to the Aviation School

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Kunming

"Do not forget to seek out the bridge!" When you enter the simple and solemn auditorium of the aviation school, which is now located in ××, you will see many alarming slogans hanging inside. But the most striking thing among them is these four characters above.

The "bridge" is in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the birthplace of the Chinese Air Force, and also the original site of the current ×× Aviation School.

Calling on students not to forget to seek out the bridge is calling on students not to forget to "recover lost territory." This is a slogan in the auditorium of the ×× Aviation School that is most likely to stimulate people.

Although the ×× Aviation School has moved to the rear in ××, in addition to training air force talents, every one of them is determined to go to the front. We have seen the fierce and brave combat of the air force at the front, creating extraordinary records fearlessly. If we consider the alarming slogans in the auditorium of their birthplace alma mater, we know that this is not without a reason.

When I went to visit Director Xu Yulin of the Political Training Department of the Aviation School, his reception was very friendly. He is from Zhejiang, and in his Mandarin conversation, he often revealed his original accent. When we talked about the future of the national war of resistance, he expressed his confidence in the combat capabilities of the Chinese Air Force, and his attitude was very firm. Later, I asked him about the mission of the Political Training Department in the whole school. In addition to explaining to the students about their political understanding, ... He and I had just walked to the entrance of the auditorium, and he smiled and looked at a cement couplet outside the auditorium: "Swear to be loyal subjects of the country, must be the leader's death soldiers." Indeed, although he did not say anything at this time, the most important mission of the Political Training Department in the aviation school, and its spirit, can be explained by this cement couplet instead of what Director Xu wanted to say.

Later, I went to visit the principal's office. Two wooden plaques with white characters on a black background were hanging at the entrance, which were "Principal's Office" and "Director of Education's Office."

The current Director of Education of the ×× Aviation School, Mr. Zhou Zhirou, who is well-known to everyone, represents Chairman Chiang in carrying out the school's administration. Because Director Zhou represents everything of Principal Chiang when carrying out the school's administration, people often call him Principal Zhou.

After entering the principal's reception room, the clean and tidy interior arrangement, surrounded by clear and bright sunlight, reflects into the hearts of every visitor like the spirit of the teachers and students full of vigor throughout the school. Although I had not yet seen the appearance of this master of the whole school, a typical image had already emerged in my mind through imagination. When the Director of Education came out and shook hands with me, his tall stature and bright eyes showed that he was a person with a very strong personality and willpower, who had been tempered for a long time. The handshake also revealed sincerity and composure, arousing a kind of indescribable and difficult-to-describe goodwill. The first impression that this Director Zhou gave people exceeded the typical image that I had imagined when I first entered the reception room.

I knew that I could not publicize any school affairs related to military operations during this period of national war of resistance, so I did not ask about them. However, I wanted to visit and write about the students' living conditions throughout the school to report to the readers, because this is also a fact that readers across the country are eager to know.

Director Zhou agreed to my request and allowed me to observe and visit the student dining hall and dormitory. Before parting with Director Zhou, I took a sitting portrait with him as a souvenir.

The ×× Aviation School, formerly known as the Central Aviation School, is the main school of all aviation schools in the country. The students trained here are prepared to be air force officers. Therefore, the level of students in the ×× Aviation School requires a high school graduation qualification to apply for the exam, and the standard of the level is higher than elsewhere. Students there only need to be listed in the graduation ceremony to become air force officers. The admission examination for students is extremely strict in terms of intelligence, occupation, and physique, so the level of students is also very uniform. Many famous flying generals since the War of Resistance have been officers who taught here and have just graduated.

When I visited an air force instructor, I asked him what his opinion of the students was? He smiled and said to me, "All the teachers and students in our school are classmates who came before and after. Many of my students in the past have now become my friends, and many of my teachers in the past are now working and joking together, and everyone has become friends. Here, the so-called 'teacher-student relationship' is seen as a very light question. We are just classmates who came before and after. If we want to be more strict, everyone is a 'Chinese Air Force comrade.' We have 'stages before and after,' and there is absolutely no question of any 'upper and lower stages' in the so-called teacher-student problem here."

This is very true. We can see that many officers are quite different in age, but the feelings they express are very intimate and loving. This proves that the words of the air force instructor are neither fabricated nor exaggerated.

As for the relationship between many instructors and students, as long as you look at their mutual actions, you can prove it very well. When instructors meet students, their attitude and expression show a very caring look, while students treat instructors with a very respectful attitude, which can be represented by an idiom: "extremely respectful in etiquette."

The students' physique is extremely tall and strong. The school's physical examination of students when they join the army is of course very important, but the physical fitness training and exercise of students after entering the school is also of great importance. Therefore, students spend a lot of time on physical fitness and exercise in their daily lives. When we go to visit the activities of the students of the ×× Aviation School, we should pay attention to their sports field. The various ball games of the Aviation School are very famous in ××, so when they compete with various universities, the Aviation School always has the advantage. This is of course because the students who apply for the Aviation School are originally very strong because they paid attention to sports before entering the school, but after entering the school, they pay great attention to physical fitness training, so excellent results in various ball games have become a natural result. Finally, in addition to the strict selection procedures before entering the school and the hard work and exercise after entering the school, there is another essential relationship with the strong physique of the students of the Aviation School, and that is the issue of health and nutrition in the school.

Regarding the nutrition problem of students at the ×× Aviation School, there is a very interesting and thought-provoking thing that happened recently, and I would like to attach it here.

When the ×× Aviation School was in Kuanqiao before, the school authorities paid great attention to the students' nutritional food, and provided porridge and milk every morning. Now that it has arrived in ××, because the milk production in the whole city is very small, it is not enough for the distribution of all students, so students only have porridge every morning and the milk has been reduced. Everyone can eat as much as they want in terms of porridge, but they lack milk. When I was visiting a student at an aviation school, because I talked about the diet problem in life, I mentioned the lack of milk. I asked him what his feelings were at the time? He replied very excitedly: "In this national war of resistance, many compatriots in the lost land do not even have porridge to eat. What is so important about us reducing a portion of milk every morning? Even in normal times, how can our clothes and food not come from the hands of compatriots across the country? Our service to the country and even sacrifice is our military duty. We often feel great unease when we see the suffering of the compatriots in the lost land, and we can't wait to fly forward and fight ×× desperately. Now, although we lack a portion of milk every morning, every time we have a meal, we will think of the suffering compatriots in the lost land, at the front, and in the rear when we see every grain of snow-white rice. We want to work hard to learn the combat and driving skills that the air force has, and to avenge and vent our anger for our compatriots across the country. As for some increases or decreases in food, we feel that it is not a very important issue. We know very well that the elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters across the country are looking forward to us very much, and we will never live up to their high expectations. Please tell them frankly in the war of resistance that we will definitely avenge and clear their shame for them. Our bodies were originally the country's. It is publicly owned by compatriots across the country, please rest assured"!

When this student of the Aviation School talked about "Please rest assured," tears were already leaking out of his slightly red eyes. I shook the hand of farewell tightly under great emotion.

Before I was about to withdraw from the ×× Aviation School, I suddenly saw two slogans, and now I will write them out as the conclusion of this visit:

"Our bodies, planes, and bombs should perish together with the enemy's naval positions!" (Li Baoquan)

### Four Major Events in Hengyang

— Wang Ping

Hitting the "Stray Dog" Wang Jingwei

The first shot of the 28th year was the Kuomintang's opening Xu traitor to betray the party and the country, and Wang Jingwei, who sued × for peace. This was a loud noise that excited all Chinese people, even international people, and gave a '?' in the brain pattern of many people. The Hengyang salvation workers quickly wanted to use this as an expanded political publicity, so they ran around shouting, promoting the early realization of this movement. As a result, the anti-Wang climax in various places impacted the party and government authorities in Hengyang, and decided to convene an anti-Wang conference (later, because they felt that Wang did not need to be 'discussed,' they changed it to 'dismissing' Wang). Before the meeting, the wartime service group Hengyang service office of the Military Commission and the anti-× drama troupe No. 8 of the Political Department of the Military Commission and the wartime service group of the Hankou Women's Christian Association launched an anti-Wang symposium. At this meeting, representatives of government agencies, and various cultural, work, service groups and individuals attended and launched a heated discussion, especially the speech of the representative of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway workers, which won the applause of everyone.

"...Our anti-Wang is to attack Wang's traitorous remarks, and to eliminate Wang's echo bugs in every corner. The War of Resistance is like a locomotive. The locomotive accepts new fuel on one side, and eliminates the residue on the other. Wang is the coal that has been excavated, which is not only not worth regretting, but also very beneficial..." He used his life to make an appropriate proportion, which was very popular among the audience.

After discussing for a full five hours, a common conclusion was reached:

(1) Wang is a thorough speculator. In his revolutionary history and life history, he is full of the stains of shaking, being despicable, and betraying the revolution. Even his most readable assassination of Prince Regent is also opportunistic. (Originally, the assassination of Prince Regent was a decision of the Tongmenghui. The method of assassination was to bury bombs, and several people including Wang took turns guarding the fuse. When Prince Regent passed by, they would light the fire to blow it up. As a result, when it was Wang's turn to guard, Prince Regent was passing by, and Wang was extremely panicked, and the matter was not completed. He was caught by the Qing soldiers. Later, Han told the entire plan and conspiratorial comrades, and used this to curry favor with the Qing court, and was escorted by the Qing court to study in Japan, while other comrades all died. This is the biggest stain in the history of the revolution.)

(2) Wang is a typical person who values ​​personal interests more than national interests. In order to achieve his own selfish desires, he does not hesitate to take the most despicable means.

(3) During the War of Resistance, Wang also echoed with the voice, but the anti-war force overwhelmed the "peace" force, but he still looked for opportunities to destroy the War of Resistance anytime and anywhere. For example, his past talks were very skillfully propagandizing reaction.

(4) Wang's rebellion is a matter of time and a predetermined plan.

(5) Therefore, we must carry out universal and in-depth publicity to prevent Wang from becoming the second Franco in Spain.

(6) The government's and leader's decisive handling this time is the most supported by the people, and it shows the government's wisdom and determination to fight to the end.

(7) Send a telegram, publish a special edition, picture magazine, write anti-Wang scripts, songs, and immediately organize a propaganda department to go to the countryside.

The chairman of this symposium was Mr. Liu Chenlie, one of the chairmen of the Hengyang All Walks of Life Anti-Wang Conference. We asked him to report this record to the general assembly and launch a wider discussion.

The Tide of Charity Sales is Spreading

Since the fire of charity sales was lit in Hong Kong, every corner of China has had sparks of charity sales; Hunan's first charity association was the Dagang Daily in Hengyang, followed by the No. 8 Anti-× Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Commission, in addition to taking out a part of the troupe's living expenses to pre-purchase the first newspaper of Dagang, it also decided to perform one day, and donate all the income to the War of Resistance; then the resident Chong troupes also responded and organized a Response to Charity Movement Performance Committee, stipulating a continuous performance for seven days. The members of this committee, in addition to the eighth troupe, include the first itinerant drama education troupe of the Ministry of Education, the 49th troupe, the 77th troupe, Xiang opera, and new opera - the scripts performed include the five-act play "Roar of the Ancient City" of the first drama education troupe, the "Northeast Corner" and "Cold Clothes Song" of the 49th troupe, the "Dynamite" of the 77th troupe, and others, and the four-act play "Phoenix City" of the Anti-Drama Troupe No. 8 - this script depicts the situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army Miao Kexiu, Deng Tiemei, Zhao Tong (the son of Zhao Laotai, the mother of the guerrillas)... fighting heroically in the difficult rear of the × people. It is the latest masterpiece and has only been performed once in Chongqing in China. This time is the second performance - the performance date is from the 18th of this month.

Various troupes are working hard to prepare. The charity sale day of Dagang Daily (15th) has arrived, so everyone enthusiastically participated in the charity newspaper sales team. In total, Dagang Daily earned more than 4,200 yuan, ranking third among the charity sale income of newspapers across the country, and also sold a 500 yuan newspaper, breaking the national record.

In addition to the drama industry, several taverns are also holding eight days of 20% charity sales. In short, the charity sale is like a big stone thrown into the calm water, expanding its wave circle.

### Full Text of the Declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee issued a declaration today. The original text reads: Since the Provisional National Congress in April of last year, our Party, based on the resolutions of the Congress and the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction, has encouraged and steeled the compatriots of the whole country to continue their efforts in the sacred war of resistance, while simultaneously carrying out the work of national reconstruction amidst the war of resistance. Over the past eighteen months, the military and the people have been of one mind and one heart, their will growing stronger. Although the war zones have shifted, the foundation of the nation has become more solid. Since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the situation of the war of resistance has shifted from the initial stage to the later stage. The main purpose of the initial stage of the war of resistance was to deplete the enemy's strength, expose the enemy's conspiracies, and complete the strategy and deployment for the later stage of the war of resistance. The task of the later stage of the war of resistance is to build upon the achievements of the struggle in the initial stage, to bring into play all the forces of resistance in the front and rear areas and in the occupied areas, in order to achieve final victory and the success of national reconstruction. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is appropriately held today, at the beginning of the later stage of the war of resistance. Recalling the war achievements of the past eighteen months, and the glorious sacrifices and contributions of our soldiers and people throughout the country, we deeply feel that the struggle from now on is a key to determining the survival and prosperity of our nation. Therefore, after careful consideration of internal and external facts, we have established a strategy for the later stage of the war of resistance and are striving to implement it. We hereby declare its main points to all comrades of our Party and all compatriots of the country with all sincerity.

The Invasion Has Lasted Only a Year and a Half, But the Enemy Is Already in Dire Straits

In the past eighteen months of the war of resistance, the deeper the enemy’s invasion, the more depleted their military strength, and the more severe their financial, economic, and social crises. From the Battle of Southern Shandong to the battles along the Yangtze River, the enemy troops have suffered more than 500,000 casualties, and the war expenses have increased to more than 9 billion. Political tides have risen and fallen within the enemy's country, and infighting has deepened. In recent months, they have even issued their so-called "New Order in East Asia" declaration, hoping to use this absurd theory to cover up their atrocities. However, all countries in the world have already seen through their concealment.

The purpose of our sacred war of resistance is to seek national independence and the survival of our people. Although we have lost vast territory and suffered many casualties, the soldiers and people of the whole country share a common hatred of the enemy, and their morale is rising. Everyone is determined to die in order to build an eternal cause for the country. Our country has always been a peace-loving nation. The reason why we are enduring a long and arduous war, without shying away from any sacrifice, is actually the result of the Japanese militarists' continuous use of military force to invade and their implementation of a policy of gradual encroachment and annexation, reaching a final critical juncture. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has brazenly disregarded everything, broken the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and implemented the occupation of our Northeast four provinces. On July 7th of the year before last, they went even further, launching an attack on the Lugou Bridge and occupying Beijing and Tianjin. The lifeline and the destiny of the people of our country have reached a point of survival or extinction. The entire nation, from top to bottom, can no longer tolerate it. Therefore, even though we know that our military equipment is inferior to the enemy's, we have no choice but to engage in a difficult and tragic war of resistance in order to maintain the survival of our nation and people. "We will never abandon peace as long as there is a glimmer of hope; we will resolutely sacrifice when the sacrifice has reached the final critical juncture." This is the determination repeatedly stated by the President of our Party, and it is also the national policy unanimously adhered to by our people.

The Japanese militarists' ambition to annex the mainland is, externally, the public enemy of the world, and internally, hated by the people. Looking at the years since the September 18th Incident, within a few years, three of their prime ministers have been assassinated, two finance ministers have been assassinated, four naval and army generals have been assassinated, more than a hundred university professors have been arrested and imprisoned, and countless people have been executed for opposing the war. The unity they maintain today is merely a manifestation of the militarists' oppressive power. As the ancient saying goes, "When two armies meet, the one with grief will prevail." The grief and indignation of our people throughout the country in resisting aggression and the righteousness of defending peace are sufficient to serve as the main force in defeating the enemy. As the later stage of the war of resistance begins, it is even more important for our compatriots throughout the country to jointly and consistently adhere to the main points of the old struggle.

The Ultimate Goal of the War of Resistance Is to Seek the Happiness of Mankind

The Declaration of the Provisional National Congress stated: "What we seek is a peace that conforms to justice, not a peace of surrender: surrender only serves to encourage aggression." The Provisional National Congress further explicitly pointed out that in order to establish the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration, and to realize a country of equality and freedom, we will not stop until we achieve our goal. The Three Principles of the People, created by the Premier to lead the national revival of China and establish the Republic of China, are to strive for national independence, for the survival of the nation, for the permanent peace of East Asia, and for the dignified justice of the world. The meaning of today's war of resistance is also the same. Japanese civilization initially sought it from Korea, and then from our country. Everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation to the principles of benevolence, righteousness, morality, and ethics, there is nothing that we do not share. Our country has been known for its wealth and strength in East Asia for thousands of years. Japan's strength is only a few decades old, and Korea has already been destroyed by them. Now, they are even trying to annex our China. Looking at the militarists' mad words, they directly want to control the entire globe and subdue Europe and the United States. Their withdrawal from the League of Nations and tearing up the Nine-Power Treaty are merely the beginning of their unleashing of violence upon the world. The reason why our country is resolutely resisting today is not only to resist the enemy invading our country and to restore the integrity of our sovereignty, territory, and administration, but also to punish the instigators who destroy the dignity of treaties and endanger world peace. We sincerely hope that friendly nations around the world who uphold peace will bring into play the spirit of concerted unity, protect the treaties that share common interests, implement effective methods, and eliminate the spread of war. Only in this way can we seek the peace of the world and promote the happiness of mankind. This is the common understanding and unwavering determination of our 450 million people.

All Countries Unite to Help Us Eliminate the Tragedy of War

Looking at the evolution of the international situation over the past year, it is quite similar to the eve of the European War in the past. The crisis is deeper and broader, far from what the European War could compare to. Taking the situation since the start of the Japanese invasion of China as an example, they use air force to bomb our undefended cities, villages, and cultural buildings. The scenes of their brutality and ferocity are not found in the European War. All countries, governments, and peoples in the world who love peace and respect justice have the same urgent feeling. In the past few years, those who tried to call for the efficacy of international law and to prevent the spread of war with lip service and written words have now changed their direction and are simultaneously seeking to use force as a guarantee for self-defense and common defense. As of today, it is clear that Japan's invasion of China is a threat to the foundation of the Pacific Ocean; and the Pacific Ocean is the world's largest market. Last autumn, the Japanese army invaded Wuhan, attacked Guangzhou, and blockaded the two major rivers, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. The League of Nations happened to be meeting at this time. Friendly nations such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, acting righteously and exerting their efforts, unanimously supported China and passed the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant, applicable to Japan's aggression. Recently, the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution of January 19th further invited countries related to the Far East situation to consult with each other in order to take effective measures to provide assistance to our country. At the same time, US President Roosevelt strongly upheld the Nine-Power Treaty and issued a firm warning to Japan, and Britain and France followed suit to jointly maintain the treaty. The purpose of this is not only to stop Japan's aggression, but also to eliminate all the tragedies that destroy world peace. Our country, at a time of difficulty and danger, is deeply grateful for this noble friendship that supports the endangered and upholds the precarious. We are also confident that our Chinese nation, by exerting its sincerity in upholding public reason and justice, will contribute to the future of human civilization and world peace, and will surely live up to the high expectations of our friendly nations. We are even more convinced that our Republic of China has the determination to eliminate world wars and promote the peaceful life of mankind in the world. (Unclear telecode)

We Will Continue to Sincerely Uphold the Principles of the Nine-Power Treaty

At a time when the countries of the Great War were suffering from the lack of effective aftermath, our Premier published his great plan for developing Chinese industries. He believed that (unclear telecode) Japan's intensified aggression against China would inevitably lead the world to a point where it could not extricate itself. He repeatedly explained, although he spoke of (unclear telecode) now the US President specifically invokes the Nine-Power Treaty to call on the world to maintain the treaty in order to restore peace in East Asia. And (unclear telecode) the two major principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are: one is to respect the sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity of China, and the other is to open the door and equal opportunity (unclear telecode), developing Chinese industries, even more, to firmly believe that our people not only support the principle of opening the door, but also are willing to cooperate with the world's countries in a mutually beneficial and peaceful cooperation on the principle of fairness and mutual assistance.

We Sincerely Hope That the Soldiers and Civilians of the Whole Country Will Strive for the Final Victory Together

The most urgent words in the conclusion of the Premier's plan for developing Chinese industries are: "Japan always gets the best reward from every war, no wonder the Japanese militarists regard war as the most profitable business." Now that China has awakened, Japan wants to implement a policy of aggression, and the Chinese people will also come out to reject it. Even if China is unfortunate for Japan (the following telecode is unclear for about a hundred words) The belief that national reconstruction will be successful is already so firm that it cannot be changed. Today, when this sacred sacrifice has displayed unparalleled brilliance, we especially hope that the soldiers and civilians of the whole country will further invigorate the spirit of their old gates and advance bravely in order to win the victory of the war of resistance, to establish the foundation for the construction of the Republic of China, and to cooperate sincerely with the friendly nations of the world on the principle of mutual assistance and peace, and to complete the great cause of building the Republic of China. Only in this way can we not fail the heroic sacrifices of millions of our compatriots, and allow our people throughout the country and their descendants, as well as the infinite human beings of the world, to jointly enjoy the peace and happiness created and guaranteed by our soldiers and civilians with their lives. The Japanese militarists, their perverse thoughts, cunning attempts, and cruel actions, which they are applying to our country today, will also lead to an even more tragic result for themselves. The rebellious incidents that have occurred continuously in their country since September 18th (unclear telecode) the evil consequences created, I am afraid, are even more than (unclear telecode) killing our compatriots with weapons and violence.

Understanding the above, we can know that resolutely resisting the war is the consistent mission of the national revolution, and it is also our only sincerity in saving the country and saving the world. Violent × (unclear telecode) our soldiers and civilians throughout the country, from the beginning of the war to (unclear telecode), strengthen unity, actively fight the old battles and work hard on construction. And improving the national spirit and rectifying revolutionary discipline are the guarantee for the success of the above three things. The main points are listed on the left:

First, Strengthen Unity and Implement the Three Principles of the People

(1) The so-called strengthening of unity. The conference believes that unity must be based on sincerity, and the revolutionary spirit must be pure. The Provisional National Congress solemnly declared, hoping that the people of the country who are ambitious will concentrate in our Party and fight the old battles together. This session of the conference sincerely hopes again. The country is in such great danger that it must increase its strength in resisting the war and building the country as much as possible in order to achieve the effect of uniting the people and turning them into a city. Compatriots throughout the country, regardless of their past political views and factions, are sincerely welcome to join our Party and engage in the sacred cause of national revolution, resistance to the war, and national reconstruction, as long as they are willing to implement the Three Principles of the People. However, the purpose of the national revolution is to seek national independence and the survival of the nation, so it is necessary to maintain the sincere and pure spirit of the Chinese nation, and then the foundation of the country can be consolidated. This conference solemnly declares that we absolutely do not want to see the fact of dual party membership in the Party leading the revolution; and we cannot bear to see the consistent goal of implementing the Three Principles of the People in China and completing the revolutionary reconstruction of the country be frustrated due to a lack of faith and a lack of will. When the countries of the world began their revolutions and national reconstruction, they all succeeded in brushing away difficulties and reaching success because the entire country was united and the people were of one mind. There is absolutely no second way to do it, whether in China or abroad, ancient or modern. From now on, our compatriots must sincerely unite, exhaust their wisdom and be loyal, believe in and practice the Three Principles of the People, do their best for the later stage of the war of resistance, and establish an unshakable foundation for the great cause of national reconstruction.

Second, Actively Fight and Strive to Resist the War to the End

(2) The so-called active struggle. Our compatriots should know that "those who travel a hundred miles are halfway at ninety, and the last journey is often the most difficult." When we review all the work in the past, we have not yet done our best. What we have worked hard on is not completely certain, not completely coordinated, and we have not been able to be consistent in word and deed and make consistent contributions to meet the needs of the war. Today's later stage of the war of resistance is actually the final victory or defeat between our country and the Japanese militarists. The thoughts and actions of all soldiers and civilians in the front and rear, especially in the occupied areas, or in the military areas near the war zones, if they cannot be strictly reflected on, strictly reported on, and strictly corrected, and if they cannot completely contribute their abilities, freedom, and lives to the country and increase the strength of the counterattack, then the achievements of the countless martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the old battles will fail, and our nation will inevitably be destroyed. Therefore, from now on, our comrades and compatriots must swear allegiance together, under the leadership of the supreme commander, with no reservations and no hesitation, and march forward bravely to win the success of national independence and national survival in this war of life and death.

Third, Accelerate Construction and Improve People's Lives

(3) Regarding accelerating construction. We must know that the main force in building a country lies in building an army. Without a national army as strong as gold and stone, the people's livelihood cannot be guaranteed, the people's rights cannot be maintained, and the nation cannot survive. And psychological construction, political construction, and economic construction are the foundations for building an army. The so-called psychological construction must be based on the Premier's theory that knowledge is easy and action is difficult, carry forward the Premier's spirit of military education, popularize national military training, increase educational efficiency, and promote wartime service, so that all compatriots in the country are revolutionary soldiers of the Three Principles of the People, and seek the final victory with the spirit of success or benevolence. The so-called political construction requires strict rewards and punishments, comprehensively explains the truth, concentrates strength, increases efficiency, strengthens the organization of the people, unifies the actions of the people, alleviates the suffering of the people, and improves the lives of the people. At the critical juncture of the beginning of the later stage of the war of resistance, when life and death depend on it, it is especially necessary to form a unified command structure of the central party, government, and military so that the work of the party and government throughout the country can be closely integrated with the military affairs in order to achieve the effect of joint action. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council is specially established to unify the command of the party, government, and military. Economic construction is not only related to the victory or defeat of the war of resistance, but also to the success or failure of national reconstruction. It must be based on the needs of the people's lives during the war, distinguish between priorities, consider the slow thoughts and implement the controlled economy, and adjust the production and consumption of materials. All heavy industries and mining industries necessary for the war of resistance, light industries necessary for the daily life of the people, and urgent railways, air lines, and highways, etc., should strive to do what they can and work hard to promote them. More solid currency system, smooth financial gold, promote the development of public and private industries, and other improvements in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, all depend on the development of the hidden treasures. In increasing the production capacity of the provinces, it is especially necessary to match the power of all capital technologies of the government and the people, and earnestly accelerate the implementation. This kind of economic construction is not only to enrich the strength of the war of resistance, but also to lay the foundation for implementing the welfare of the people. As for the governments and peoples of friendly nations around the world, either assisting with material and financial resources, or supporting with spiritual and moral support, or providing relief to soldiers and civilians injured, sick, hungry, and cold, or helping us to restore schools destroyed by the enemy. All these noble acts will be eternally remembered. We firmly believe that the result of our country's war of resistance will be to restore our national sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, and will be able to revive the authority of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. How can the principle of open door and equal opportunity be implemented alone, the great plan that our Premier suggested to the world twenty years ago, to combine international peace and mutual assistance, and to jointly develop Chinese industries, can also be realized. With the wealth of our raw materials, the breadth of our market, and the urgent need for reconstruction after the war, for the absorption of foreign capital and technical cooperation, and for the existing capabilities of the industrial countries, we will never worry about its excess. And if our people throughout the country put in more effort today, they will surely gain ten or a hundred times the benefits after the war. Because all true economic benefits are absolutely private to the world and mankind.

Implement Revolutionary Discipline and Improve National Spirit

The above three things are the goals that our country should actively strive for, and the fundamental meaning lies in improving the national spirit and rectifying revolutionary discipline in order to realize the Three Principles of the People of revolutionary reconstruction. In the past, the Premier spoke about the electric spirit education, and explained with deep feeling: "Humans have the use of spirit, not just the physical body." "If you want to take on an extraordinary career, you must rely on the extraordinary, spirit." Especially lifting up wisdom, benevolence, and courage as the morals that those who are revolutionary and save the country must have: only wisdom that conforms to morality is the wisdom needed for revolution; only the ability to avoid things when they happen, to go forward without fear, and to have a spirit of resolute death that does not take or fear, is the courage needed for revolution; only "sacrificing life to save the world, picking up life to save the country, not asking for benefits, and fulfilling responsibility" is the benevolence on which the revolutionary cause depends to achieve. Without seeking life to harm benevolence, there is killing oneself to achieve benevolence, beginning with great wisdom, ending with great courage, and only then can we build the country, complete the revolution, and protect the life of our nation forever. At this critical moment of life and death, our compatriots throughout the country only have the determination to achieve benevolence and take righteousness, to implement the great road of the Three Principles of the People, to swear to die, to be old and brave and loyal, and to establish the foundation of the country for billions of years with the lives of our decades of inevitable death, then there is no fear that the war of resistance will not be victorious, and there is no fear that the country will not be built. Among the comrades in our Party, and all those who hold national military and political positions, everyone should be mindful of the seriousness of their duties and revolutionary discipline, set an example, and be the vanguard of the people. It is necessary to establish strict discipline, establish the justice of believing in rewards and punishments, and then we can gather the public's will into one mind, combine the public's strength into one body, and not endanger the country because of the loss of one corner, and not harm the public because of the mistake of one person. It must be known that the war of resistance against the enemy is a struggle for life and death in an instant, and the great cause of national reconstruction is a permanent and indestructible work; if it is not disciplined with strict and clear discipline, how can it achieve the practical effect of success? Therefore, the strict execution of revolutionary discipline is the thorough invigoration of the spirit of the war of resistance, which is the greatest guarantee for the victory and success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and must be implemented with all efforts.

Only One Basket Remains to Be Completed, and Victory Will Ultimately Belong to Us

Our Party is based on the historical mission of revolutionary reconstruction. At the time of national and national crisis, we lead the people to resolutely shoulder the responsibility. The heavier the responsibility, the more difficult the mission. All our comrades must sincerely abide by the resolutions, be of one mind and one heart, accept the President's instructions to improve party virtues and consolidate the party's foundations, invigorate their spirits, concentrate their wills, strengthen their faith, enrich their abilities, and go deep into the masses, the war zones, the devastated areas, and the lower-level villages. They must endure hardships and persevere, set an example, be the first to face difficulties, and fear being late for righteousness. With this spirit, they will do their best to fulfill their duties, and with this spirit, they will impress both China and foreign countries. As for our compatriots throughout the country, there may be a first or second to hear about righteousness, but there should be no difference in rushing to righteousness. The reason why this war of resistance can be sustained and unyielding is that it is the great continuation of the tireless struggle and the sacrifice of everything by our people throughout the country to engage in the great cause of saving the country and building the country. Now that the war of resistance has entered the later stage, only one basket remains to be completed. Those who gain the Dao will receive more help. The sympathy of the world has been gathered in our country. The great task of completing the revival will definitely belong to us. We see the date of victory in the war of resistance, at the meeting of the completion of the reconstruction of the country. We hope that all comrades in our Party and all compatriots in the country will work together with this intention and do their best to fulfill it!

### I Am Working Hard to Build a New Air Force

[Shanghai, 30th, Foreign Telegram] Our country's third phase of the new air force is now using personnel from the United States and the Soviet Union to vigorously develop and compete with Japan for air superiority. After nineteen months of resistance, the influence of Italy in the Chinese Air Force has been completely eliminated. After the fall of Nanjing, most of China's air battles relied on Soviet pilots and aircraft. At the same time, China's aviation schools have also moved to Kunming. In recent weeks, new trainers from the United States have arrived. Chinese young pilots are receiving extremely strict training and will surely pose a significant threat to Japan in the future.

### National Army to be Reorganized and Trained in Stages; First Group of Troops Arrive at Designated Locations; War Resistance Strength Will Increase After Four Months

[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 30th Dispatch] In order to strengthen our war resistance capabilities, the national army will be reorganized and trained in stages. Currently, the first group of troops to be reorganized have been moved separately and have reached their designated locations. They are divided into five zones: the first zone is the army of Tao Zhiyue, which will be supervised and trained by a certain army corps commander nearby; the second zone is the armies of Xiao Zhichu, Sun Zhen, Chen Dingdong, and Song Xilian, which are divided into two locations and supervised and trained by a certain commander-in-chief nearby; the third zone is the armies of Yao Chun and Guo Chan, and the division of Fu Zhongfang, which are also divided into two locations and supervised and trained by a certain committee member nearby; the fourth zone is the army of Chen Anle, which will be supervised and trained by a certain commander-in-chief nearby; the fifth zone is the armies of Li Yannian, Gan Lichu, Zhang Yunsong, a certain division of Wang Zhonglian's army, the Xu Tingyao division of the New XX Army, and the Lin Ying division of the Honorary X Division, which are divided into two locations and directly supervised and trained by the Ministry of Military Training.

The second phase will be completed in X months, and will be reviewed by the supervisors from the Ministry of Military Training. As for the officers, they will be trained by subject to improve their skills. Without hindering the scope of troop education, short-term training classes for various arms will be convened in stages to reorganize and train officers.

### X Plots to Sabotage Our Country's Finances; Counterfeits Tens of Millions of Our Legal Tender; Mixes Them into the Inland to Absorb Private Savings; Ministry of Finance Has Telegraphed to Banking Industry to Pay Attention to Investigation and Prohibition

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since our country's war of resistance began nineteen months ago, we have adhered to an unyielding spirit and strived to fight. Therefore, the X people have gradually become embarrassed. Whether in terms of popular morale, military resources, or the economy, they clearly have major weaknesses. Especially due to the lack of funds, the prolonged war is the greatest crisis. On the other hand, our country, due to its firm will to resist the war, has gained international sympathy and faith. The second credit loans from Britain and the United States are about to be successful, and our country's war resistance resources will become more solid. The X people, in order to weaken our war resistance strength, are also trying to sabotage our country's economy and finances. For example, they are wantonly issuing banknotes in the occupied areas and war zones to absorb our country's legal tender, which is their most vicious means. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, even counterfeiting our country's legal tender plates and privately printing large amounts of counterfeit money, distributing it to the interior and various places in an attempt to undermine our country's economic credibility and absorb private savings. Their intentions are extremely cunning. Recently, after the Ministry of Finance received a report, it was sincerely afraid that merchants in various places would be unaware and mistakenly use it, which would have a significant impact. Therefore, it has specially issued a notice to merchants in various places to be aware of this counterfeit money and strictly investigate and prohibit it. The banking industry also received a notice yesterday, which stated: "(Above omitted) According to reliable reports, the Japanese are privately printing tens of millions of our country's legal tender in XX, using Japanese spies, Japanese residents, and traitors to use them in various places, which has a huge impact on finance. It is urgent to issue a unified notice to pay attention to investigation and prohibition in order to prevent this. In addition to having secretly transferred this to the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks to inform their branches to pay attention, and secretly ordering each bank to find examples of counterfeit currency, distinguish the differences between genuine and counterfeit currency, and report them by telegram, we are also corresponding to request that you investigate and instruct your subordinates to pay attention to investigation and prohibition."

X Plots to Monopolize Resources in Southern China

[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] The news that Japanese sugar, mining, electric power, and shipping experts are going to Southern China for inspection has attracted close attention from economic and business circles here. The inspection team, led by Viscount Inoue, Director-General of the South Asia Development Agency of Japan, departed from Taiwan and is expected to arrive in Guangzhou on the 25th. The Japan Times stated, "The team will conduct a detailed investigation in Southern China and report to the government so that the Japanese government can formulate a basic plan for developing the economy of Southern China." It is also learned that the Japanese military stationed in Southern China and some people involved in the sugar industry have strongly advocated obtaining "Manchurian" sugar industry cooperation between China and Japan in order to create a self-sufficient situation. Therefore, the Secretary-General of the Japan Federation and thirteen technicians have been ordered to participate in this inspection in order to achieve the goal of monopolizing the sugar market in China.

### German-Soviet Relations Improve; Italy Also Following Germany's Lead; Anti-Comintern Pact Will Become Waste Paper

[Associated Press, Berlin, 30th] According to German private sources, the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have greatly improved recently. Therefore, the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan will become a piece of waste paper, and Japan will soon be abandoned by Germany and Italy. This trend is naturally important to the international situation. Berlin has sent a commercial investigation team to Moscow soon to discuss German-Soviet trade matters and improve the diplomatic relations between the two countries. The fascism of Germany and the socialism of the Soviet Union are not as incompatible as fire and water, because Hitlerism is also based on socialism. Furthermore, even if the two countries have different political ideals, the differences are very small. The conflicts between the two countries in recent years have been caused by national policies. The Soviet Union now wants to act freely in the Far East in order to deal with Japan, and Germany is also eager to act freely in Europe. Because of the existence of these basic conditions, the two countries have the possibility of approaching each other. Moreover, Hitler's faction feels that Germany's assistance to Japan against China has hundreds of disadvantages and no benefits. Germany's attitude is such that Italy is also following Germany's lead to improve its relations with the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 30th] During the budget debate held in the parliament here, Foreign Minister Arita stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact is aimed at resisting the "evil forces of communism." Japan's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is due to "the excessive activity of communism in China" and has no other intentions. Although Japan's attempt to coerce Chiang Kai-shek to join the Anti-Comintern Pact has been abandoned, Arita still refused to announce the new policy to be adopted in the future. Arita also stated that it is difficult to estimate the special expenditure for the war in China, but pointed out that the special budget caused by Japan before and after the war lasted for ten years. The debate ended at noon.

Japan's Diplomatic Predicament; Envoys to Europe Hold Conference in France; Attempt Military Alliance with Germany and Italy

[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] Japanese ambassadors to various European countries recently held a meeting in Paris. The purpose was not announced, but according to the ambassadors, this kind of meeting is held regularly in the capitals of European countries so that the participants can exchange information on the political situation. Recently, Ambassador Shirotori, who was stationed in Italy, arrived at his post from his home country, so a meeting was held to allow Shirotori to understand the European situation and listen to his report on Japan's recent situation. According to reports, the first meeting was held last Friday, but Shirotori was unable to attend due to illness. The second meeting was held on Saturday night. The results were not officially announced, but according to "Paris Evening News," "According to absolutely reliable sources, the theme of the meeting was the possibility of Japan, Italy, and Germany concluding a military alliance to make the Anti-Comintern Pact more complete. This proposal was advocated by Ambassador Oshima to Germany. Not long ago, Oshima met with Shirotori. The two felt that the military cooperation of the Anti-Comintern countries should be far closer than it is now, so they decided to invite their European colleagues to gather in Paris. The so-called military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is not new. Military personnel have long advocated this, but now their power to manipulate foreign policy is even stronger, so they are making persistent efforts to achieve it. Oshima is one of the advocates of this view, and Shirotori also shares his views." "Paris Evening News" also stated that Shigemitsu Aoi, Tanegane, and Kurusu are conservative diplomats who advocate adopting a cautious policy to avoid concluding a sensational military alliance. Therefore, the ambassadors now all support Oshima's policy, and they have also worked hard to overcome the arguments of the conservatives. According to Oshima's observation, if Japan cooperates with European dictatorial countries, there is hope for an early end to the Sino-Japanese War. If the conflict between democratic countries and dictatorial countries becomes acute, Germany and Italy will also welcome cooperation with Japan, because at that time Japan can force Britain and France to station a part of their troops in the Far East. At the same time, if the dictatorial countries take strong action in Europe, they can also force the democratic countries to have no time to take care of the situation in China. According to the Japanese military, China cannot sustain the war of resistance for a long time without the assistance of democratic countries. If the democratic countries have difficulty taking care of China, Japan's war against China can be won sooner.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The talks between Japanese envoys to various European countries ended tonight. It is reported that the issues discussed were related to promoting the Anti-Comintern Pact. The participants included Ambassador Shigemitsu to the UK, Ambassador Shirotori to Italy, Ambassador Kurusu to Belgium, the minister to Spain (rebel government) and Switzerland, and the representative of Ambassador Oshima to Germany. Oshima was unable to attend due to illness. According to generally reliable sources in France, the talks were different from the usual meetings of Japanese envoys and were initiated by the ambassadors to Germany and Italy when they recently met in Italy to avoid the cold. There were differences of opinion among the ambassadors on the matter of promoting the Anti-Comintern Pact. Oshima's representative and Shirotori both advocated strengthening the ties between Germany and Italy, but the majority advocated "nurturing" the anti-communist ideas of European countries such as Britain. According to observations here, the final attitude of this matter will depend on the changes in the European situation.

### Britain Strives to Expand Air Force; Aircraft Production Will Equal Germany; France Pays Close Attention to British Cabinet Reorganization; Believes It Will Accelerate the Promotion of Military Expansion Plan

[Reuters, London, 30th] According to the aviation reporter of the "Daily Telegraph," after Britain's production of military aircraft increased by 400 per month, it is almost the same as Germany's production rate. The reporter said, "Due to the official silence on the military expansion plan, outsiders have underestimated the progress of Britain's national defense. In fact, the Ministry of Aviation has rapidly completed the expansion of the air force. The number of regular air force pilots has now reached 5,800, and another 1,800 are in training. If the number of civil aviation personnel is included, it may soon reach 10,000." [Reuters, Paris, 29th] The reorganization of the British cabinet has attracted close attention here, especially the transfer of Sir Shadforth Field to the post of Minister of Defense. "The purpose of this move is obviously to prepare to accelerate the promotion of the military expansion plan," said the Transcendent News. A suspect committed suicide after being arrested.

### Former Siamese Royal Family; Revolution Fails; A Suspect Commits Suicide After Being Arrested

The army announced that several officers have retired and had their pensions revoked. The whole country, including the capital, is as quiet as ever.

### All India Congress; Left Wing Wins; Bose Elected Chairman; Gandhi Warns Farmers

[Reuters, Bombay, 29th] Left-wing leader Bose was elected chairman of the All India Congress today. This move was unexpected and caused Gandhi's failure, because Gandhi had fully supported right-wing leader Sattamaya, who was generally considered to be sure to be elected. The result of this move is likely to cause a divergence of opinion between the Congress and the All India Federation. However, the British government is now working hard to mediate between the right wing.

[Reuters, Bombay, 29th] Neru said at the All India Congress Committee in Lucknow today that India may face a crisis in a few weeks. Gandhi said to the farmers at the Fana Memorial Movement to return confiscated land in 1930 that the farmers should be prepared to lose their land again soon.

### Catalonia Lines; Spanish Rebels Continue to Attack; De Facto Recognition of Rebel Government Said; Roosevelt Does Not Intend to Take This Action

[Haitong News Agency, Barcelona, 30th] Yesterday, the Spanish rebels continued to attack at various points on the Catalonia front line. The Ugar troops have now advanced to the town of Baja. The government troops only offered slight resistance. However, the area is mountainous and there are only a few very uneven roads. On the central front, the rebels have occupied the town of Moirar, the intersection of the Manresa and Vich roads. As for the troops led by General Vega, they continued to attack along the coast yesterday, but there are no reports of the locations reached by the vanguard. The rebel headquarters estimates that since the start of the Catalonia war, the government troops have suffered losses of about 100,000 men, including 67,400 captured. Yesterday, rebel aircraft attacked the town of Alger in the province of Arder, dropping many bombs. It is reported that about twelve important buildings were completely destroyed.

[Haitong News Agency, Salamanca, 30th] The Spanish rebels have continued to advance and occupy an area of about nine kilometers in the past 24 hours. The government troops counterattacked in the central part of the Catalonia line, but were repulsed.

[Haitong News Agency, Perpignan, 30th] A tunnel one kilometer long in the town of Corb on the Spanish border connects to the town of Cerbère on the French border. A major tragedy occurred in the tunnel yesterday. Suddenly, rumors spread that the Spanish rebels had arrived in the town of Corb. At that time, government troops and the general public rushed to the tunnel to take shelter, scrambling to be first. As a result, in the pitch-black tunnel, children and women were trampled to death.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] According to observers in diplomatic circles, although domestic and some Latin American forces have recently intensified their demands for the US government to de facto recognize the Franco government, President Roosevelt is not yet prepared to take this action. When Congress considers Roosevelt's defense plan in the coming weeks, the development of the Spanish situation will be of great importance. Democratic Congressman John McCormick sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, requesting that the government immediately recognize the Franco government because "two million of the twenty-four million Spaniards are already seeking Franco's rule." A government spokesman said that the leaders of Congress have stated that they do not want to discuss this matter. Some believe that although Franco has occupied Barcelona, he has not yet completely subdued the government troops, and others believe that this issue is too delicate to be debated publicly. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that this matter is entirely within the scope of the President's prerogative and is not something that Congress can interfere with. "The President has the right to recognize any government and it has nothing to do with Congress, so I cannot criticize it." Senators Borah and Tom Connally also expressed the same views. According to informed sources, the Catholic faction has been secretly urging the government to recognize the Franco government, but has not yet made a formal declaration.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th] The French press is debating the issue of France sending a diplomatic representative to Burgos. Former Prime Minister Blum published an article yesterday criticizing the inappropriateness of establishing diplomatic relations with the Spanish rebels. The left-wing newspaper said that the current situation makes it necessary to begin diplomatic relations with the Spanish National Government as soon as possible. The Martin newspaper said that the late President Wilson once said that the most heartbreaking thing about pacifists is their stupidity because they are deceived by warmongers.

### Roosevelt's Birthday; Philippine Islands Celebrate Enthusiastically; Quezon and Others Participate

[Associated Press, Manila, 30th] The major cities of the Philippine Islands are celebrating President Roosevelt's 57th birthday tonight, holding six major dances. President Quezon, US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt, and hundreds of other American and Filipino celebrities will participate. The proceeds will be used entirely to subsidize the expenses for the treatment of infantile paralysis.

### German-Czech Economic Talks; Scheduled to Be Held This Week; Discuss Czech Industry with Sudetenland; German-Soviet Trade Talks Continue

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] The Czech Minister of Commerce will come here in the middle of next week to hold important economic talks. It is understood that the main purpose of the discussion is to discuss how to end the industrial competition between the Czech Republic and the Sudetenland. At the same time, the German-Soviet trade talks are still ongoing. However, it is generally claimed that the talks only relate to implementation procedures and that the original agreement between the two countries will not be changed.

### All India Muslim League; Telegram to Chamberlain; Requests Permission for Muslim Representatives to Participate in Palestine Conference

[Reuters, Bombay, 29th] Jinnah, chairman of the All India Muslim League, today telegraphed Prime Minister Chamberlain, requesting permission for Muslim representatives to participate in the Palestine Conference, stating that the British government should grant the demands of the Arabs, otherwise, if the conference fails, Muslims around the world will suffer. In addition, another telegram was sent to Colonial Secretary MacDonald with the same wording.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th] Today, someone ambushed and shot at a public bus in the suburbs, killing one Arab woman and injuring one passenger.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] According to well-informed sources, the Japanese government will respond to the proposal of Britain and the United States to convene an international conference to revise the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the Japanese government only agrees to direct negotiations with them and not in the form of an international conference, and requires Britain and the United States to accept several conditions first, including free international trade, abolishing customs barriers, abolishing import quotas, and allowing Japan to obtain raw materials from all over the world. In addition, it also requires allowing Eastern nations to live and travel freely all over the world. If the powers can accommodate the above conditions, they can be relieved of all their worries about East Asia. It is also heard that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing to respond to the notes of Britain and the United States, including the following: (1) Britain and the United States hope to use the method of an international conference to resolve all outstanding issues concerning the open door in China with Japan. In fact, the diplomatic method of an international conference has several shortcomings. Britain and the United States obviously want to use these shortcomings to implement their own goals. (2) In order to maintain the traditional friendly relations with Britain and the United States, the Japanese government is now prepared to hold direct negotiations with the two countries. The prerequisites for the negotiations are listed on the left: (A) Complete liberation of Eastern nations, abolition of all treaties that bind China, and allowing Eastern nations to live and travel freely all over the world. (B) Absolute freedom of world trade, abolition of all economic barriers, abolition of customs barriers and import quotas. (C) Fair distribution of the world's raw materials so that Eastern nations can survive and defend themselves. (3) If Britain and the United States accept the above conditions, their worries in the East and the obstacles to cooperation between China, Japan, and "Manchuria" will no longer exist.

### Sixth Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule; Germany Celebrates Grandly; Hitler Delivers Important Speech; Announces Support for Italy's Demands

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] Today, the capital of Germany is magnificently decorated to celebrate the sixth anniversary of Hitler's leadership of Germany. On the National Day, all buildings in Berlin, except for Jewish churches, are flying the Nazi swastika flag. Laborers, employees, and students, as long as they are party members, are all wearing uniforms. From Wilhelm Street to the Kroll Opera House, the roads that Hitler will pass through that evening to the Reichstag are illuminated by searchlights along the way. In addition, all streets in the city are equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast Hitler's speech in the Reichstag.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 30th] According to sources here, Nazi leaders such as Ribbentrop and Goebbels are now urging Hitler to severely criticize the comments of Roosevelt and other Americans. However, conservatives such as Goering are opposed to this move. Goering believes that Germany's past actions have already led to a deterioration in US-German relations, which will affect the development of Germany's ambitions. Diplomatic figures believe that Hitler's speech will be an important pillar of the European political situation in 1939. The speech is personally revised by Hitler, and only a few confidants know the content.

[Associated Press, New York, 29th] Judging from the news from major European countries by our agency, Europe seems to be about to experience another "diplomatic storm." Whether the democratic group and the dictatorial group will be on the verge of breaking or can be decided by this "diplomatic storm." On the British side, Prime Minister Chamberlain reorganized his cabinet so that his military expansion plan could be accelerated. His speech in Birmingham on Saturday was nothing more than urging the dictatorial countries to contribute to peace, while still resolutely stating that if the dictatorial countries want to control the world by force, the democratic countries are prepared to resist. On the German side, Hitler is now preparing for the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. Hitler is scheduled to speak in the Reichstag on Monday, when he may put forward demands regarding colonies and announce Germany's support for Italy's construction of a Mediterranean empire. On the French side, the Daladier government is working hard to cope with the 200,000 refugees who fled from Spain. On the Italian side, Mussolini is said to have temporarily suspended the announcement of his demands on France and is waiting for Hitler's speech to be published, while congratulating Franco on his victory in the war. On the Spanish side, no less than 500,000 refugees are struggling to escape into France, which is one end of the largest migration movement in history.

Short Commentary

### Declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang (KMT), which was of great concern to both China and foreign countries during the new stage of the war against Japan, has now successfully concluded and issued a declaration. According to a Reuters report, the declaration particularly emphasized that the KMT welcomes cooperation with any other political party under the common belief in the Three Principles of the People. Recalling the earnest proposal made by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China last year to strengthen cooperation between the KMT and the CPC, and to invite the KMT to unite all anti-Japanese parties to establish a national alliance, comparing it with the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session of the KMT this time, it makes people deeply feel that the national unity needs to be further consolidated, and that the conspiracies of the traitors to sow discord still need to be thoroughly broken before it can be guaranteed that the Chinese nation will win the war against Japan and succeed in nation-building. We are willing to shout out with the whole nation, "Support the Fifth Plenary Session, unite the whole country, and persist in the war of resistance!" We are even more willing to work together with the whole nation, "Support the KMT and the National Government, be selfless, unite all parties, lead the whole country, eliminate defeatism, eliminate traitors and pro-Japanese elements, implement the entire program of the war of resistance and nation-building, drive out the Japanese ××, and build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People!"

### Responding to the International Anti-Aggression Conference

Yesterday (the 30th) evening, Hitler delivered a speech, preparing to help Italy's development in Europe. Italy is intensifying all military steps to press France, and the Eastern aggressor Japan is also crazily promoting a major adventure in the Far East as the European situation becomes serious. Fascist aggressors are more frantically and openly setting off the flames of war under the Anglo-French appeasement policy!

The London International Anti-Aggression Conference is convening a general meeting at this time, which is of utmost importance. People from all over our country have now launched a movement to respond to the Anti-Aggression Conference. Fourty thousand engineers in London are also preparing to hold a strike demonstration today (the 31st), marching to Downing Street to request the government to transport military supplies to aid the Spanish Republican government and boycott Japanese goods to aid China. All or part of London's factories will be shut down for this. This news makes us rejoice!

We hope to start with the International Anti-Aggression Conference, launch a broad anti-aggression movement among people of all countries around the world. Our media and cultural circles should immediately expand publicity, and encourage the people of all friendly countries to quickly launch a united front movement, using collective power and effective actions to combat the appeasement policy and drive away the fascist aggressors ××!

### Salute to the People of India and Britain!

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 30th reported that the Indian Association held a demonstration here to protect India's independence, with the participation of most of the Indian overseas Chinese in London and thousands of British leftists. A resolution was passed on the spot demanding a boycott of Japanese goods and refusal to supply Japan with all materials and economic resources, especially kerosene and credit. It also called for economic and medical assistance to Spain. At the same time, it called on progressive forces in Britain to seek closer ties for the people of British India and other colonies. This action by progressive elements in India and Britain deserves our highest salute for national liberation.

British people have personally felt the threat posed to Britain in the Far East and Europe by Japanese, German, and Italian aggression. The Indian continent is also now included in Japan's military invasion plan. The people of Britain, India, and China are now trapped in the same fate. Only by uniting to resist the fascist aggressors can there be a way out and freedom. Under the leadership of the progressive national leader Mr. Nehru, India has recently implemented a national united front against fascist aggression and will make the greatest efforts for the people of the world and the people of China and India. The recent election of Mr. Bose, the leader of the left wing of the Indian national movement, as the chairman of the All-India National Congress, shows the common will of the people of India. We offer our remote salute and congratulate India on its glorious future.

### Indian Comrades Association Resolves to Reject Japanese Goods, Stop Supplying Gasoline and Loans to Japan, and Seek Closer Ties between British and Indian Peoples. [Reuters London, 29th]

The Indian Comrades Association convened a demonstration meeting, held in Trafalgar Square here. Its purpose was to assist in the independence of India. Participants included most of the Indian overseas Chinese and thousands of British leftists. The conference resolved to reject Japanese goods, especially to stop supplying gasoline and loans to Japan. The conference also hoped to provide economic and medical assistance to Spain and advocated that "progressive forces in Britain should strive to foster close ties between the peoples of British India and various colonies." General Overview of the Singapore Military Base, Originally Written by John Gunther, Translated by Hong Sheng.

The Singapore military base, known as the new Gibraltar, was only recently completed. It was prompted by Japan's "Twenty-One Demands" as early as 1915. Japan's submission of the Twenty-One Demands to China clearly indicated that Japan would be a moving × in the Far East for Britain.

In 1919, Admiral John Jellicoe suggested creating a British Pacific Fleet with Singapore as its base. He argued that in the Far East, in addition to cruisers, there should also be a battle fleet. He argued that Britain should establish a "Western Hemisphere" naval policy.

In 1921, the Imperial Conference met in London and considered Jellicoe's proposal, deciding to build the Singapore military base. By 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, establishing the naval ratios between the powers, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was abolished.

At this time, public opinion in Britain said that this new military base was superfluous and would only provoke Japan and arouse its suspicion. People upholding justice even believed that this new base was a moral violation of the Washington Naval Treaty because the Washington Naval Treaty stipulated a ban on the construction of fortresses or naval bases east of 110 degrees longitude, and Singapore was only six degrees away from this restricted zone.

Some people even thought that Britain intended to make trouble, but this statement was later officially denied. Construction of the base began in 1924 and was not fully completed until fifteen years later—February 14, 1938.

Singapore is an island, 27 miles long and 14 miles wide, with a causeway across the Johor Strait connecting it to the mainland. It is located at the tip of Malaya, and ships to China and Japan must turn here, precisely controlling the passage between East and West. When the work was in progress, rumors spread that someone was engaged in espionage, so security was very strict. Residents in the restricted area were ordered to relocate, and all construction workers had their fingerprints taken.

The naval base is located on the north shore of Seletar Island, about twelve miles from downtown Singapore. The air force base is not far east of the naval port. Singapore has a total of three designs: one drafted by the British Army, one drafted by the Navy, and one drafted by the Air Force. The so-called Singapore base includes all three. In theory, this base is under the jurisdiction of the Army, with General Dobbie as commander-in-chief, whose title is above all naval and air force officers stationed in Singapore.

During construction, mountains had to be moved and rivers filled, costing a total of six million cubic feet of earth. As for filling low-lying swamps, it cost eight million cubic feet of earth. To the right of the island, countless white wax-colored oil drums line up endlessly, containing one million tons of gasoline. Each drum is cast in the shape of a saucer. It is said that in the event of an explosion, this form of drum can prevent the spread of flames. Underground are armories, so rich in storage that they can turn the entire base into powder and more.

The naval base covers an area of 21 square miles. Its main grade items are two huge and extraordinary docks, a floating dock, and a repair dock. In the event of naval action, if ships are damaged, even the largest warships can be repaired in the dock. If there were no Singapore base, damaged ships would have to be assembled all the way to Bombay. By the time they were assembled and returned, the war might have already ended.

This floating dock is about 900 feet long and about 200 feet wide. It is the third largest floating dock in the world. It can carry any huge warship and still float. It can accommodate 60,000 people standing inside. This dock was built in Britain. Disassembled into several parts and towed from Woolwich to Singapore, a distance of 10,000 miles. Eight Dutch tugs were used for towing, making it one of the great sights of the modern navy.

The repair dock is slightly larger than the floating dock, about 1,000 feet long. It took six years to complete and cost 5 million gold dollars, using 4.5 million cubic feet of mixed concrete. Any ship in the world can be placed at will. The most recent test proved that it can hold 68 million gallons of water.

That floating dock can be moved elsewhere when necessary, such as the Hong Kong repair dock which cannot be moved. Near the two large docks, there are machine factories, power plants, storage warehouses, and one of the largest cranes east of the Suez Canal. Everything is doubled, except for the crane, so when × planes come to attack – assuming they break through the air defense line – they must do two sets of head work.

The only shortcoming of Singapore is that there are many reefs in the vicinity, making it inconvenient for submarine activity. However, × people's submarines, once near Singapore, will of course encounter the same difficulties.

Singapore's air force base is also very powerful, with three different military aircraft Youngs and a civil airport. The civil airport was opened in June 1937, costing 5.25 million US dollars, and built on a newly opened national land on the edge of the bay, so land and seaplanes can be used for both purposes. Another advantage of this airport is that it is very close to the prosperous area of Singapore, and it takes only seven minutes to reach by car.

One of the main military airports also has equipment for both land and air force use. The excellent sea surface for seaplanes is more than 20 miles long. The air force stationed at the base does not have four or ten teams, and reinforcements can be flown in from India if necessary.

From a technical point of view, Singapore is indeed a strong fortress. It has a peacetime garrison of 7,000, and more importantly, those mysterious artillery stacks and many forts are scattered at the easternmost point of Singapore Island, Zhang Ju, and on many small islands in the strait. These small islands are home to many artillery teams and engineers. It is said that the defenses not only include fifteen-inch guns with a range of twenty-five miles, but also the most powerful eighteen-inch guns in the world. (To be continued)

A Fire in Cantonese Road, Yau Ma Tei, Yesterday Morning:

More than a Hundred Shanties for the Poor Reduced to Ashes. Fortunately, the Fire Brigade Responded Quickly, and No One Was Killed or Injured. Hundreds of Homeless Poor People Sent to Refugee Camps for Temporary Shelter.

At three o'clock yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the shanties for the poor behind the Kwun Chung Cinema on Cantonese Road, Yau Ma Tei. The fire was extremely fierce, and because these shanties for the poor are built of bamboo and wood, once they catch fire, they can spread like wildfire. In an instant, they spread to the shanties on the left and right, and the sky was red. Hundreds of poor people cried out, and the scene was too terrible to bear. Later, the Fire Department listened to the report and immediately dispatched three fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. The information obtained is recorded below:

Fire Broke Out in the Deep Night, and the People Fled in Panic

It is found that there was originally an open space behind the Kwun Chung Cinema on Cantonese Road, Yau Ma Tei. Because there are many residents in Hong Kong, the demand for houses exceeds the supply, and the rent is expensive. Those who have no fixed assets and earn their living from day to day have no ability to live in rental houses. The authorities specially issued two pieces of land in Tai Kok Tsui and Cantonese Road for them to build their own shanties as a shelter. Previously, in order to rectify the city appearance and avoid the danger of fire, the authorities ordered the demolition of the shanties for the poor in the two places. Later, after the residents pleaded bitterly for a delay in the demolition, the authorities granted them a temporary stay out of sympathy. Because their buildings are simple and the materials they rely on for construction are all flammable, once a fire breaks out, it is inevitable. Because it was in the deep night, most of the residents were sound asleep when they suddenly heard the fire alarm. Everyone was flustered, and they supported the young and ran away in panic. As for the cause of the fire, it is not known who left the fire.

150 Shanties Were Burned Down

After the fire broke out, the sound of police sirens shook the area. The nearby residents woke up in shock when they heard the sound in their dreams. As for the hundreds of poor people who came out of the burning shanties, although they had escaped from the fire scene, they were helpless in the face of the fire and stamped their feet, thumped their chests, and cried in pain. The scene was extremely tragic. Not long after, the Fire Department heard the report and immediately dispatched three fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. However, at that time, it was during the time when water supply was restricted, and the water source could not be reached immediately. Therefore, water drum trucks were used to put out the fire temporarily to relieve the immediate crisis. After the water source arrived, the firefighters immediately worked hard to put out the fire. It was not until four o'clock that the fire was extinguished. A total of 150 shanties for the poor were burned down. It is found that there are hundreds of shanties for the poor in the area, divided into three groups. The one that was burned down was the middle one, with about 150 shanties.

Victimized Poor People Sent to Ma Tau Chung

It is found that 150 shanties were unfortunately burned down in this disaster, with losses of more than a thousand yuan. As for the hundreds of poor people who escaped from the fire scene, they were shivering on the roadside at that time, and their situation was extremely pitiful. In order to prevent these hundreds of poor people from being displaced, the authorities transported them by car to the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp for shelter. Some of them made a living as hawkers and were unwilling to follow the crowd into the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp, so they looked for other residences. Fortunately, although the fire was fierce, no one was killed or injured.

The Case of the Shooting of a British Detective on the Third Floor of Wing On Bank Begins Trial

Wong Shu-lun Is Accused of Intending to Wound and Possession of Firearms. British Detective Motalot Recounts the Incident on That Day.

The man Wong Shu-lun (also known as Lee Sau-hei) was previously accused of (1) shooting the British detective Motalot on the third floor of the Wing On Bank in Des Voeux Road Central in the early morning of December 4 last year, (2) intending to harm Motalot, and (3) possessing unlicensed pistols and bullets in a certain room of the Luk Kwok Hotel. The case had been heard several times before. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, the Central Magistrate formally arraigned the case. The case was prosecuted by Superintendent Owen, and the defendant pleaded not guilty, and Mr. Hsiao Chung, solicitor, defended him. First, the prosecuting superintendent stated to the court that the defendant had said when he was charged that he did not intend to harm Motalot and that Motalot was not his enemy. Then, Dr. Scott of Mary Hospital testified about the defendant's injury on that day. Then, the plaintiff, British police detective Motalot, testified about the incident on that day, saying that on December 4 last year, I was ordered by the Central Police Station to follow the defendant and went to Gloucester Road to look for him. When I arrived, I saw the defendant inside. The defendant told me at the time that he was waiting for a friend there. I waited for an hour, and seeing that his friend had not arrived, I took him back. After he made a phone call at the police station, he asked me to go out with him to find his friend. So I followed him to the second floor of Wong Nai Chung Road. It was about 8 p.m. He failed to find his friend, so he took me to the Wing On Bank. He opened the door and entered from the main entrance and went straight to the third floor. There was no one in the building at that time. The defendant took me to the Hua Dance Hall again. After the defendant whispered to a dancing girl in the hall, he made a phone call and told me again that his friend was waiting for him at the Wing On Bank, ordering me to go again. I went to the Wing On Bank with him again and went up to the third floor. There was still no one inside, so I asked him why. He replied that his friend must have misunderstood, and asked me to allow him to wait for an hour. I refused and only allowed him five minutes. The defendant sent me out, hoping to meet his friend on the street. So we went downstairs together. I went first, about two yards away from the defendant. When I reached the third step of the stairs, I suddenly heard the sound of me being shouted at to raise my hands. I looked back and saw the defendant holding a right-angled pistol in his hand. I still thought the defendant was joking with me at the time, so I replied, "Don't be so crazy." The defendant immediately replied, "I'm not joking with you, raise your hands quickly." I ignored him and took two more steps, and then I heard an explosion. I also felt a sharp pain in my neck. I endured the pain and pushed the defendant away. I heard another explosion at the time, and I was so painful that I could not support myself and fell down. I vaguely saw the defendant running downstairs madly. I shouted, but I couldn't make a sound. I took out a police whistle to call the police, but the sound was not loud, and no one came upstairs. Later, I managed to walk to the basement and saw that the horizontal iron gate was locked. Later, the watchman of the bank opened the gate for me to go out, and then two Indian officers helped me onto an ambulance and sent me to the hospital for treatment. Then, Wing On Bank watchman Yuen Tsui testified. At about 5 pm, the judge adjourned the case until 2:30 pm today.

Two Fishing Boats Robbed by × Again

One Searched and Robbed and Then Disappeared. One Lost About $200 Worth of Goods.

The number of reports of × warships robbing our fishing boats is increasing daily. On the 22nd of this month, another boat was robbed in ××× and has not returned to port yet. Only a cargo boat that happened to pass by witnessed the situation. According to the boat, it left Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong, on the 24th of this month and sailed to near ×××× the next afternoon. It saw a fishing boat being searched and robbed by a × small iron tugboat. The boat was afraid of being harmed, so it increased its speed and escaped. Fortunately, it was not discovered by the × warship. It only returned to port yesterday. As for the robbed fishing boat, it has not returned to port yet. It is thought that it has been robbed by the × warship together with the boat. According to a fisherman who went to the Fishermen's Association yesterday, his boat was working normally in ××× on the 25th of this month when suddenly a × warship came towards him. When the × warship approached, it sent five × soldiers with long guns to jump onto his boat. They first asked if his boat was hiding military firearms, and then searched and robbed everything. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××× and gave him two ridiculous leaflets. He only returned to this port yesterday and went to the place to report the case. The loss in this incident was about $200.

### The Practice of Popularizing Drama

— Qi Zhuo

Joint Public Performance by the Youth Drama Association - Hoping They Grow Through Practice and Learning

Special Article by This Newspaper

Young friends with passion and energy are lovable and respectable. Although in their growth process, they sometimes inevitably exhibit "infantile" tendencies. However, as long as you step into the youth ranks and see the active and progressive attitude of the young cadres, you will surely sigh, "After all, the younger generation is to be feared!" - especially when the vast and alert youth group enthusiastically and sincerely participates in the national liberation struggle.

For the youth of Hong Kong, ×××××××, the drama movement seems to be the place where their spirit and work are entrusted. Stimulated by the sounds of the Anti-Japanese War, the small "××××" in Hong Kong suddenly saw the rise of over twenty youth drama groups, large and small. This matter has given us a sudden realization, and under the urgent demands of improving work efficiency on the front lines of the war, various youth drama groups in Hong Kong have actually joined hands to organize a unified general organization - the Hong Kong and Kowloon Youth Drama Association. This is another piece of gratifying news!

In order to commemorate ××× and promote the popularization of drama, the association started public performances for three consecutive nights at the South China Middle School auditorium, inviting the public. The reporter went to visit the previous night, filled with excitement. Scenery, reception, maintaining order, preparing for the performance... Young men and women were busily working hard, and their lively performance evoked the memories of those who had lost their youth.

Several hundred spectators packed the narrow auditorium almost to capacity. The noisy sounds only quieted down at the opening.

After saluting the national flag and silently mourning the ××× soldiers, the chairman announced the reasons for the meeting, speaking about the principles of drama coordinating with the Anti-Japanese War and the unity of young people. Finally, he expressed that in order to implement collectivist self-education, he hoped that the guests would provide more criticism in their post-performance review meeting. This spirit of courageously seeking progress is naturally worthy of our deep sympathy.

The entertainment began with the choral performance by the Chung Hwa Book Company choir. Among them, the "××× Commemoration Song" and "One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement Song" were both meaningful and very pleasant new songs.

The first act was "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls" by the Red and White Drama Society. Each performer was very serious and devoted. The only shortcoming was that the voices of the male and female plainclothes team members were not loud enough. The script was a modification of "The Last Resort," but it was not as tense and poignant as the original script.

The second act was "××××" by the Ding Chou Drama Society. ××××××××××××, this was a rather successful place in the performers' skills, and the ending scene of ××××××× was also very tense.

Behind the scenes, they were busy with setting up the scenery, and in front of the stage, the Chung Hwa Book Company choir was divided into four small teams to take turns singing. The spirit of hard work and seriousness was good, but the number of people was too small, and the sound was far less majestic than the group singing.

When singing the memorial song to commemorate the Anti-Japanese War martyrs, the entire audience stood solemnly in silence. - Building a triumphal arch with white bones, and irrigating the flowers of freedom with fresh blood, what great soldiers of the Anti-Japanese War!

Then, the third act began, which was "Blind Mute's Hatred" by the Whirlwind Drama Society. In terms of the script itself and the acting skills, they were originally very good. However, after they modified the script, it became quite different from the original plot, and it was not as good as the original work!

The last act was "Reunion" by the Lu Feng Drama Society. Ding Ling's script is quite profound, and the new style of side views and curves overcomes the formulaic nature of national defense scripts. The actors' expressions were moving enough, and the performance skills were also quite mature. Although they were speaking in Mandarin, the entire audience remained silent, which was truly touching.

Generally speaking, the performances of the four acts were all quite above the standard. The simple scenery and the way it swayed around were common shortcomings, which may also be due to the lack of material conditions. It is said that each drama group contributed one or two dollars to make up the minimum expenses, and achieving such results is already commendable.

This evening, the performance ended happily at midnight. There were continued performances last night and tonight, and it is planned to promote the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement in the theater.

After this performance, they will surely humbly accept valuable lessons in practice and learning, and grow even more robustly!

### The Women's Comfort Association Welcomes Overseas Chinese Representatives from Hainan

— Luo Xia

He Xiangning's Generous Speech - Full of Encouragement

Special Feature

It was a rare grand gathering! Yesterday afternoon, the Women's Comfort Association held a reception at the St. Francis Hotel to welcome the group of enthusiastic Hainanese overseas Chinese representatives who had returned from overseas after traveling thousands of miles. Mr. He Xiangning, Miss Lingyi, the daughter of President Kong, and the Hainanese representatives... delivered passionate speeches one after another. The faces of over a hundred people at the meeting were filled with enthusiasm and excitement!

Just as the clock struck four, the Hainanese overseas Chinese delegation arrived in a continuous stream. Mr. He Xiangning and Mrs. Chen Mingshu were already waiting in the hall, standing up to greet them with smiles. Old and young, they sat scattered in the living room, chatting idly. Suddenly, a representative walked out from the crowd and asked Mr. He Xiangning to write in a commemorative album. Then you wrote, and he wrote, and they simply launched a general mobilization, surrounding her tightly. She wrote in one book after another, extremely invigorated. When she took her seat, she was still holding the writing brush, which made everyone laugh!

Two long tables, covered with white cloth, were decorated with colorful flower strips. Mrs. Zhang Le-yi, the wife of Mr. Song Ziwen, and Miss Lingyi, the daughter of President Kong, sat on the left and right of the main table, respectively, with Mr. He Xiangning assisting in the center. In the middle was a bouquet of blood-red chrysanthemums, symbolizing the loyal blood shed by every good son and daughter of the Chinese nation for their motherland!

In that joyful atmosphere, He Xiangning stood up with a smile and said: "Respected comrades of the Hainanese overseas Chinese who are enthusiastically saving the country and their hometown, who knows that before the Republic of China was founded, overseas Chinese compatriots contributed money and efforts to overthrow the Qing Dynasty... Overseas Chinese compatriots were truly founding heroes. I would like to first represent the people of the country and express my utmost gratitude to the enthusiastic overseas Chinese compatriots!" She paused and continued: "Today, foreign [aggressors] are trampling on the beautiful rivers and mountains of the Chinese nation, and they are suffering from devastation. The survival of the nation is at stake. I hope that overseas Chinese compatriots will further develop their old spirit, rise up enthusiastically, contribute money and efforts to help the Anti-Japanese War, help rescue soldiers, help relieve refugees, and help revive the nation!" She became more excited with each sentence, and more sincere with each sentence. She concluded her speech amidst warm applause. She sat down, panting, and everyone was looking at her kind face covered by the black woolen hat!

Then, Miss Lingyi, the daughter of President Kong, delivered a welcome speech. At first, she spoke very gently, but later she became more and more excited, so excited that her face turned red. She solemnly stated that the purpose of our Anti-Japanese War is not only to defeat the [Japanese] troops that are invading us, not only to restore our lost territories, but also to establish a brilliant, independent, and free new Republic of China in this struggle. Therefore, we must not only [fight the enemy on the front lines], but also build economic production in the rear to lay the foundation for the country. I hope that overseas Chinese compatriots will work hard to contribute their efforts to the country. The points she made were well-organized, and each sentence clearly and fluently entered the ears of the people in the audience, causing the blood in their hearts to flow in waves.

Then, Mrs. Gan Jiehou reported on the general situation of the Comfort Association's work in Hong Kong in a fluent and pleasant tone. Following this, Miss He Ailing gave a statement on the purpose and recent situation of the Child Care Association, and invited everyone to visit the hospital to observe the training of this group of future masters of the country.

Zhuang Song, a representative of the overseas Chinese community, stood up to give a speech. He first said: "We are overseas, but our hearts are always concerned about the motherland." These two short sentences carved out the overseas Chinese compatriots' enthusiasm for their motherland. He continued excitedly: "When we go back this time, we will further widely publicize to overseas Chinese compatriots and work tirelessly until we achieve final victory." Loud applause interrupted his words... Finally, He Xiangning stood up and added: "With such enthusiasm from everyone, I believe that the Anti-Japanese War will definitely be victorious and the country will definitely be built." She smiled lightly, and then said: "Tell the overseas Chinese compatriots not to lose heart. We are very confident of victory." When she said this, she actually jumped up, breathing very heavily. Everyone listened and straightened their backs, applauding enthusiastically. After catching her breath, she continued, "We, the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and China, must unite into a single front. I believe that we will definitely be able to defeat the fascists and achieve victory." She stretched out her hands, clenching her fists even tighter!

Finally, the representative of the Hainanese overseas Chinese reported on the work situation in Singapore. He said, "Seeing the tight situation of the salvation work here, I am very happy. However, [Japanese] goods have been cleared in Singapore, but the work here in Hong Kong does not seem to be enough!"

### Hong Kong Jews Hold Prayer Meeting Yesterday, Mr. A Criticizes Germany for Expanding Propaganda Against Jews, Jews Must Awaken to Seek Safety

Yesterday, Sunday morning, the Jews of Hong Kong held a gathering at the synagogue to pray for the Jewish refugees stranded on the German-Polish border. Many Jews attended, and foreigners also participated. Mr. Abbot Li explained the meaning of the gathering, saying that the gathering was a response to the Jews in various British territories. We might as well temporarily put aside words such as protest, mediation, and criticism, because Germany believes that its measures are very appropriate, and forcibly drove tens of thousands of Jews to Poland, but Poland refused to accept them, resulting in them being stranded on the German-Polish border. Just imagine, in the severe winter weather, they are sleeping in the wilderness, and many of them are women and children. What is their miserable situation like? We must today tell the world about this cruel act, so that they know that there are such cruel people in the world. [Even that may] not be enough. The duty that we should fulfill today is to save these compatriots from this deep and fiery situation. We are launching a fundraising campaign today, and we hope that everyone can bear the daily needs of one refugee. Then, collecting bits of fur will make a robe, and with so many Jews in the world, the number will be considerable. Hitler said in his writings, "We must not only drive away the Jews, but also eliminate them. If we want to preserve world civilization, then this movement should be promoted outside Nazi territory. If the Jews are not eliminated, then the worries about world civilization will not be removed." For the sake of thorough discussion, he spared no effort to expand propaganda, fabricate facts, and slander Jews. The annual propaganda expenditure reached 20 million pounds, and the number of exported propaganda materials was countless. Even commercial correspondence and goods were printed with anti-Jewish text. If we can reflect on it again and again, and know more about the Jews, and study their history and achievements, then there are many things that Jews can be proud of. And recently, the British government and people have expressed sympathy for the events in Germany and have made every effort to help. Now, British people have begun to organize anti-anti-Jewish movements, and I hope that all countries will follow suit. If we want to be safe and harmless, we must wake up from our sleep.

### A Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Intellectual Youth — Guo Moruo's Speech at Fudan University —

[Qinghang News] Mr. Guo Moruo, Director of the Third Department of the Political Department, gave a speech at Fudan University at the invitation of the university. The topic was "A Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Intellectual Youth." Mr. Guo rarely gives public speeches, especially on topics related to youth, so it was naturally a rare opportunity.

When President Wu Nanxuan accompanied Mr. Guo into the large classroom, which was packed with Fudan students inside and out, a burst of warm applause greeted Mr. Guo onto the stage. After President Wu's brief and concise introduction, Mr. Guo began his topic with the words "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle."

"Because [Japan]'s education policy has always emphasized education hygiene and thorough preparation, in that natural environment, generally speaking, the Japanese have received congenital soundness and acquired cultivation, and their physique is stronger than ours..." Mr. Guo first gave an overview of the physique of Chinese and [Japanese] youth, giving us a warning. He also explained that Japanese universities, regardless of size, have physical education courses in addition to various recreational activities (such as horseback riding and archery), and students are forced to choose to learn them. In addition, there is "cold practice" in winter - cold water bathing, and sea bathing in summer. Japanese youth have grown taller through these exercises than we call them "dwarfs."

At the same time, Mr. Guo also used the facts of our country's failures in the Far East and World Games as concrete proof. However, the Japanese are rewarding sports and moving forward courageously, while we are perfunctory in everything and do not seek to work hard, so we are falling behind. But in terms of intelligence, we are not only surpassing the Japanese, but also occupying the first place in the world. According to the research results of the German scholar Kanner, the brains of Chinese people are larger than those of general Caucasians and blacks. In terms of brain capacity above 1,500 CC, Chinese people account for 32%, Europeans and Americans 27%, and no one among blacks and South Sea natives. Conversely, the brains with a capacity of less than 1,200 CC are the least in our country and the most in blacks. From this point of view, although the Japanese are yellow people, their blood is more complex, far inferior to us. Compared to the achievements of our international students, most of them also surpass them. It's just that we are complacent about being smart and don't work hard, while the Japanese can spend a long time studying a subject. Because they have this spirit, they are stronger than us and first accepted Western civilization. However, the development of the Japanese is parabolic. Anything that reaches its peak will decline. What is the progress of the Japanese now? Since the "September 18th Incident" launched the war of aggression against us, Japan has conscripted troops as much as possible, and has suppressed and degraded the bodies and spirits of her youth, making the youth reach the end of their road and unable to develop normally. The prevalence of the majority of venereal diseases is clear evidence. Even "sexual mania" is everywhere, and men dressed as women appear on the streets. After the "September 18th Incident," although the [Japanese] government prohibited young students from entering coffee shops and dance halls, strictly prohibited leftist reading materials, and required students to read the Bible and Buddhism, the results were not as desired. Instead, students competed to read "Women's Magazine" and "Star Pictorial." The breadth of their sales, even the central public opinion of the Four Great Kings, Transformation, Japan Review, and Literary Spring and Autumn, could not be compared. It can be seen that this passive method cannot stop the Japanese's years of suffering and decline. The decline of Japanese culture is naturally "attributed" to her invasion of China. Now, comparing China and Japan, there is no doubt that Japanese civilization has reached its peak and is about to decline. At the same time, we are fighting for the defense of our land, for the happiness of mankind, and for world peace, which has promoted our development and gradually abandoned our past shortcomings. And the youth are paying attention to physical exercise, knowing that without a healthy body, they cannot shoulder the current important tasks. Leader Man Gao also pointed out the correct path, the so-called "student life should take soldier life as the unit" as the foundation for serving the country on the frontier in the future. The increasing health of our country's youth is the starting point for national rejuvenation.

As for the spiritual aspect, in view of the past failures in carelessness, the current situation tells us to be ambitious and need specialized knowledge. Under the slogan of enriching rear production, how can we enrich it without scientific research? Military weapons must also be used flexibly in conjunction with scientific methods, so in the first phase of the Anti-Japanese War, the highest leader said that "special skills are more important than broad learning," which is the reason.

Today, we are being promoted by the needs of the times and objective needs, which has promoted subjective efforts. That is to say, Japanese youth were originally stronger than us, but as a result of the aggressors, their spirit and body have declined and failed. Chinese youth are progressing more and more due to the relationship of the Anti-Japanese War. This is already a clear fact.

Finally, Mr. Guo clearly told everyone to constantly work hard, under the guidance of the highest leader, with the determination to revive the nation, and contribute their true talents and learning to the country. Then the Anti-Japanese War will be victorious, the country will be built, and our country's culture will shine in the world. (Ben Yuan)

### Mrs. Li Zongren Talks About Women's Mobilization

— Zhi Yuan

[Chongqing News] In a large living room with simple and old furniture, I met Mrs. Guo Dejie, wife of Li Zongren. After being introduced by my old friend Ms. Zunyi, the three of us each chose a suitable seat. The reporter asked about the situation of women in Guangxi during the Anti-Japanese War. She said slowly and modestly, speaking in Guangxi Mandarin, "Guangxi is poor, and the lives of ordinary people were very difficult before the war. During the war, they were naturally even more pitiful, especially women. Few of them can enjoy the so-called comfortable life of ladies, but they do not complain, and they are taking the same steps as the men, actively participating in the Anti-Japanese War."

"The anti-Japanese work of women in Guangxi is relatively common. The female students of various schools and the female civil servants of various agencies are naturally obliged to participate in the most direct work, such as being female soldiers and nurses on the front lines. The female student army of Guangxi has graduated two classes so far, with more than 1,000 people in total. They are now scattered in the front lines. Their achievements are very good. In some places, they have made our army and the common people unite as one and have received a lot of help. Also, on the front lines, several times our army was forced to retreat under the fierce artillery fire of the [Japanese], but the female student soldiers insisted on coexisting with the position. The male soldiers were inspired by them, and in one fell swoop, they not only did not retreat, but also won the battle."

She spoke in one breath, becoming more and more excited. The face that was originally very solemn gradually showed a smile.

"It is usually more difficult to mobilize housewives, but in the village street organizations in Guangxi, housewives are absorbed into them like men. So when the government issues orders, as long as the village street organizations are reached, the women will rise up without special mobilization. In the past, their work was to make cotton clothes and raise donations. They really did a great job in the work of raising donations. The number is more than 40,000. This is nothing in a wealthy province, but in Guangxi, it can be considered an amazing number!"

She stopped here and smiled. The reporter hurriedly asked the second question, which was "How can we mobilize all the women to participate in the Anti-Japanese War?"

She nodded and replied without hesitation, "I think everything is inseparable from politics, so if we can add a few points of political power to the mobilization of women, the efficiency will be much greater. However, I am not saying that women are in a passive position, but that women should have political power and promote themselves. Now that the provincial, municipal, and county councils are about to be established, it is said that women are not wanted in them. In fact, this is a mechanism for mobilizing a large number of women. Women have the opportunity to contribute whatever opinions and methods they have. At the same time, the female councilors of the county council can be the center of mobilizing women in a county, village, or street. We can both express our own demands and obtain improvements in our lives, and we can also work under the various principles determined by the opinions of the people. I believe that doing so may be much faster."

"Yes, some people say that British women originally did not have the right to vote, but after the European War, because the results of women's work were very good, the government automatically gave them the right to vote. Chinese women may as well imitate it, but I don't think so, because China's Anti-Japanese War is different from the European War. We should dig up all the national strength to win the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The significance of women's participation in politics in China is not only women's right to vote, but also a way for women to contribute their own strength in the Anti-Japanese War..."

Mrs. Li continued, "It's like a person who only uses his right hand and abandons his left hand. Can this make a big difference? Women account for half of the country's population, and if the Anti-Japanese War continues for a long time, everything in the rear will have to be borne by women. If women can participate in local political power and directly promote women's work, wouldn't the efficiency be greater?"

She thought for a while: "Naturally, if women want to improve their political status, it is useless to wait for others to give it to them, or to just shout slogans and post slogans. We must work hard, unite, cooperate with each other, and help each other to have hope!"

Transportation and Travel

### Travel Notes in Hunan and Guangxi

— Shuai Yucang

1.  Miscellaneous Notes on Xiangtan

The Xiang River originates from Haiyang Mountain in Guangxi, merging with the Li River and flowing northeast to Yu'an County, then joining the Xiao River and entering Lingling, and further joining the Zheng River and entering Hengyang. This is what is known as the "Three Xiang." The Three Xiang flow north to Changsha and enter Dongting Lake. Every summer and autumn, the water is abundant, and going upstream, one can directly reach the source. Further downstream, water transportation is convenient. This is the largest river in Hunan Province.

Xiangtan is located on the banks of the Three Xiang, and is a major city in Hunan Province. Commerce is prosperous and transportation is convenient. The junction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Hankou Railways is located in Zhuzhou Town, which belongs to the county. Before the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, there was the Pingxiang-Zhuzhou Railway from Pingxiang in the east to Zhuzhou. Pingxiang produces abundant coal, which is exported via the Pingzhu Railway and then floated to Dongting Lake, and then into the Yangtze River. Regarding the county's history, the county gazetteer states, "Established in the Liang Dynasty of the Southern Dynasties, followed by the Sui Dynasty. The old city was located northwest of Linghu You County. It was moved to its current location in the Tang Dynasty. In the Qing Dynasty, it belonged to Changsha Prefecture, Hunan. Now it belongs to Xiangjiang Dao. The land is located at the bend of the Xiang River, and the water conditions are conducive to mooring boats." This shows that Xiangtan is a key point for navigation on the Xiang River.

The streets of Xiangtan are divided by "Zong" (sections). Although there are names like Sanmin Road and Zhongshan Street, in fact, when taking the streetcar, it is easier to understand by saying "Upper X Zong" than "X Street," because the working class still commonly uses this term. One "Zong" is about one li in length. The most prosperous agricultural area is the street market, from Jiu Zong to Upper Ba Zong, a ten-li-long street with numerous shops, tall Western-style buildings, department stores, teahouses, and hostels. Betel nut shops are especially numerous, because the people of Hunan love betel nut. Even young ladies strolling the streets chew it incessantly. Betel nut is said to strengthen the stomach and teeth and promote urination, but its taste is very astringent, not as good as chewing wax.

The more famous hostels are Jiugexiang in Shiyi Zong, Lianghu Hostel in Shisan Zong, and Wanguo Hostel in Shiwu Zong. Room prices range from one to three yuan. They also operate confectionery, food, and wine businesses. The highest level is the rooftop terrace, where seats are set up for selling tea. Every time the bright sun rises, the bright light is interwoven with the deep yellow and weak electric light. The electric light seems to be complaining about the desolation, dimness, and misery of their business, because Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Yejiawan have been repeatedly bombed. Here, air raid alarms are frequent even during the day. The leisure class is like frightened birds, and the enjoyment of pleasure is greatly reduced. Therefore, the scenery on the terrace is just female attendants in plain clothes and dark skirts, showing off their flowery skills, interspersed among the recovering injured soldiers. Ordinary people are only a minority. However, even though business is bleak, the number of people hoping to find a glimmer of light in this bleakness to nourish their lives is increasing day by day. On these terraces, there are often young girls carrying handbags selling cosmetics such as floral water and talcum powder. They are graceful in manner and gentle in speech, unlike ordinary merchants. In their self-introductions to customers, they reveal that they are refugees from Wuhu, Anhui. Due to the difficult journey of exile, they have to do some business. But every time they ask the crowd for transactions, their handbags are often full when they arrive and full when they leave, only to receive a helpless sigh from some old acquaintances.

Regarding the transportation lines in Xiangtan, there are also several worth noting, described as follows:
(1) Xiangtan-Changsha Highway—Public buses run back and forth from Xiangtan to Changsha starting at 6:00 AM every morning, taking 85 minutes each time, with six trips per day. The fare is one yuan. To board, one must first cross the river to Xiangtan East Station to wait for the bus.

(2) Changsha-Hengyang Highway—There is one bus per day from Xiangtan to Hengyang. To board, one must first cross the river to Xia She Si Station to wait for the bus.

(3) Changsha-Xiangtan and Xiangtan-Hengyang Water Routes—Small steamers run back and forth between Changsha and Xiangtan at least once a day. The fare is 40 cents per person, with an additional 40 cents for a berth, taking about four hours to arrive. Currently, the route between Xiangtan and Hengyang only goes to Zhuzhou, with only one steamer running back and forth each day. The fare is also 40 cents. Xiangtan-Yichang Water Route—A small steamer runs from Xiangtan to Yichang, Hubei, about once a week. The fare is 9.40 yuan, with an additional 4.70 yuan for a berth. Children around ten years old are free. It takes four days to arrive.

2. Pilgrimage to Hengyang

The means of transportation between Xiangtan and Hengyang originally included steamers, trains, and buses. However, during this time of war, with the evacuation of people from Wuhan and Changsha, and the bombing of stations in Zhuzhou and other places, travelers with a lot of luggage found it inconvenient. Therefore, we had to use the slowest folk boats for this trip to Hengyang. The docks of Xiangtan are designated as follows: Jiu Zong is the Yongzhou dock, Shisan Zong is the Changsha dock, Shisi Zong is the Zhuzhou dock, Shiwu Zong is the Hengzhou dock, and Shiliu Zong is the Qiyang dock. We hired a folk boat, planning for a week's time. We first entrusted Mr. Wang, who lived near the Hengzhou dock, to find the boat for us. We agreed on two medium-sized boats at a price of 22 yuan in legal tender per boat. The owner of the boat was the broker who hired the boat. After hiring, we paid an additional reward of three yuan. We boarded the boat on a faintly moonlit night, and woke up to a dawn that was cool but not cold. A slight north wind stirred the surface of the river into ten thousand golden snakes. More than ten boats raised their sails and set sail. The cabins of Xiang boats are particularly low. Although it was already deep autumn, the cabins were stuffy and hot between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, almost reaching the boiling point. The travel speed was only 20 to 30 li per day.

(To be continued)

### Special Shipping News

The "Jilian Ang" of the Jilian Shipping Company (the local agent is Jardine Matheson) is expected to arrive in Hong Kong from Europe at noon today. This ship is one of the eight new ships recently ordered by the company. Details have been previously reported. This ship is making its maiden voyage to the East. After arriving in Hong Kong, it will dock at the Taikoo Dockyard. Once the cargo is unloaded, it will sail to Shanghai, Japan, and other ports. As for the remaining seven ships, except for the two being built at the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong, the rest are still under construction in England.

The "Jiaotong" of the Taisheng Shipping Company has been repaired and is expected to leave the dock tonight and berth at the pier. It will resume its regular voyages to Hong Kong and Macau tomorrow. Since the ship entered the dock, its original sailing schedule has been temporarily taken over by the "Haojiang." However, according to the company's消息, due to the recent addition of several ships to the Hong Kong-Macau route, the "Jiaotong" 's sailing schedule may be slightly changed to avoid conflicts after it leaves the dock this time.

The "Empress of Canada" of the Changxing Company is expected to arrive in Hong Kong from the Philippines this afternoon and reach its destination in the morning the day after tomorrow. After the cargo is unloaded, it will enter the dock for repairs.

### Improving the Production and Sales of Tea This Spring (Continued)

— Xie Yaoyuan

However, reducing the scope of operations would indirectly lead to a decrease in production, which is not a blessing for the future development of the tea industry. Only after the Trade Council implements management of the tea factories can the responsibilities among the partners of the tea factories be established. After verification of capital, the amount of capital can also be proven, thereby enhancing the creditworthiness of the tea factories. On the one hand, a syndicate can be organized to raise funds and lend them to the tea factories, so that they can have sufficient working capital. At the same time, the tea factories can provide mutual guarantees and supervision, so that the relationships between the tea factories can become closer, sharing weal and woe, and eliminating the previous sectarian views.

Adjusting personnel is an internal matter of the Trade Council, and there is no need to interfere. However, when implementing the above two points, the organization is large, and without personnel who are familiar with the industry and have both knowledge and experience to devote themselves to the matter, it would be insufficient to achieve complete success. The Trade Council's control of tea transportation and sales should focus on the development of the tea industry. It should be humble and employ outstanding people in the industry to fill important positions, or adapt to the needs of the situation. The relationship between tea merchants and the Trade Council can also be communicated through this, and the development of the tea industry will be full of vitality. The state's financial resources can be increased, and tea farmers and tea merchants will both benefit, so as to avoid competing with the people for profits. In addition to unifying the goals of the effort, tea farmers and tea merchants should also know what to strive for. Strictly defining inspection standards is essential. Tea inspection is intended to enhance the external credibility of Chinese tea. However, tea is made differently depending on the market for which it is intended. Theory must be combined with practice. For example, in the crackdown on colored tea, merchants must abide by the law, but on the other hand, in order to adapt to the needs of the consuming market, coloring is felt to be very difficult in manufacturing. After changing to the manufacture of uncolored tea, the output will naturally be reduced. Although the task of inspecting tea leaves is not managed by the Trade Council, the Trade Council should urge the inspection agencies to maintain appropriate contact with tea merchants, adopt some of the opinions of tea merchants, and improve their inspection skills. This is also something that should be noted in the development of tea.

Assisting merchants in purchasing manufacturing supplies is vital. During wartime, transportation is difficult, and there are legal restrictions on the import of certain goods. Tea merchants must use certain supplies to manufacture tea leaves, such as pigments, nails, tin, box boards, etc. Purchasing these items is sometimes very difficult and tortuous. These supplies are indispensable in the process of tea manufacturing. The Trade Council should assist merchants in purchasing them, provide convenience in transportation, or designate a special agency to prevent malpractices, which would greatly benefit the merchants' business operations.

5.

If the Trade Council effectively improves the control of the tea industry, then the control will become stricter, the organization will become more flexible, and with the efforts of all levels, the development of the tea industry can be expected. However, when the author talks to merchants, they are often overly worried and not without opposition to the control of the tea industry. This is because they do not understand the effectiveness of control and overemphasize their own interests, rather than planning for the development of the entire tea industry. Even last year, before the Trade Council controlled the distribution and sales, tea merchants seemed to have made considerable profits. However, if we analyze the reasons for their profits, it was due to the speculative nature of foreign exchange. If we convert it into foreign currency, the selling price has not increased at all. This kind of speculative profit is an exception and cannot be regarded as normal. The decline of China's tea industry has been going on for a long time, and tea exhibitors and tea merchants have suffered deeply. Now, when there is a turning point, and strength is slightly abundant, we should immediately wake up and sincerely cooperate with the Trade Council to improve control and strive for revival. The author has placed unlimited hopes on this (End).

### Shanghai Sino-Western Charity Basketball Game: Mixed Team Wins Over McLane in First Game, Controversy Over Tip-Off Leads to Overtime, Final Score 28-20

[Shanghai Correspondent] The Sino-Western charity basketball game sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Society, Mixed vs. McLane, opened last night at 8 PM in the Youth Basketball Hall. In an extremely tense situation, Mixed finally broke through the dull situation in the last eight minutes, winning 21-19. Later, due to McLane's protest, the game was extended by five minutes, and the situation changed rapidly. Mixed was unstoppable, finally winning 28-20. The first half ended in a 10-10 tie. The audience was generous, and the basketball hall was declared full, with an estimated 600+ guests. Mixed gathered the elites of the Paramount, Hualian, and Guoguang, while McLane was a combination of the Red and Gold teams. The evenly matched teams were like a replay of the Sino-American charity game in the Shen Bao Cup, but McLane lacked the ace player, so its strength was inferior to the American team. Mixed's victory was the expected result.

Worthy of Celebration

The game last night was dull and deadlocked, and it was not until the last eight minutes that it was broken. Although the Mixed team repeatedly changed formations, it was always difficult to achieve the ideal level of cooperation. The performance was particularly flustered, and the shots were inaccurate. The situation was almost entirely under McLane's control. The scores were repeatedly tied, and the difference was often between one and two points. Mixed was frustrated, while McLane's offense was fierce and relentless. Fortunately, McLane was not used to the large venue of Youth, and dozens of shooting opportunities were missed. Having practiced in the smaller venue of West Youth, the shots were all thrown too close, and the force was slightly lacking, otherwise Mixed would have been defeated long ago. The sudden reversal at the end was also unexpected, which was gratifying. In the second game, Mixed will definitely be able to take it to the next level. The best individual performance should be awarded to Sun Huizhi.

Temporary Agreement

After Mr. Xi Yushu gave a report in Chinese and English, thanking all parties, Yuan Ludeng, representing Yu Qiaqing, threw the opening ball. Old Master Yu had a minor illness and planned to be there for the awards ceremony. The 60-year-old birthday star threw the first ball, which was caught by Zhou Dayun, who quickly passed it to Chen Xuechong, who turned and sent it into the basket. Then, during the break, McLane protested, saying that the Mixed team's opening ball was passed by Yuan. Therefore, both sides agreed that if the final score was within two points, the game would be extended by five minutes to determine the winner. Coincidentally, the result was 21-19, with Mixed leading by two points, so the game was extended by five minutes. Mixed took advantage of the situation to score seven consecutive points, finally winning 28-20.

Deadlock

Under the command of Mr. Shen Kunan, Mixed's first lineup consisted of Zhou Dayun, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Sun Huizhi, and Cai Yanxiong. McLane was a pure McLane Red team. After Chen Xuechong scored the first point, Cai Yanxiong's long-range shot from half court was greatly appreciated. Zhou Dayun took the opportunity to score, and Cai made another free throw. In this way, Mixed suddenly had a 7-0 lead. McLane calmed down and scored four points in a row with free throws and field goals. Xianglong quickly replaced Li Zhenzhong, but could not get past McLane's momentum. Sachin took the place of Mannell and took the lead 8-7. Mixed's situation was very unfavorable, the cooperation was out of sync, and the team was entirely under McLane's artillery fire. Dayun made a free throw to tie the score 8-8, and Moore scored again to make it 10-8. At this time, McLane fielded the entire team. Both sides had very few opportunities to score, and the first half ended in a 10-10 tie.

Spring Clouds Unfolding

In the second half, Kong Guangyi replaced Zhou Dayun, while McLane still fielded the entire team, and the game became a seesaw battle again. McLane missed many opportunities. Mixed quickly replaced Li Zhenzhong with Kong Guangyi, and the situation suddenly improved. One throw by Xianglong gave them a one-point lead at 14-13. McLane's Red team fielded the entire team again. Dayun also replaced Xianglong. The game suddenly unfolded like spring clouds, with Cai, Li, and Xuechong quickly making contributions, creating an extremely advantageous lead of 20-15 and 21-17. Unexpectedly, one throw by Sachin made it 21-19, leading to a five-minute extension. In these last five minutes, Mixed did not give McLane a chance to recover. Dama made a free throw first, and Yanxiong made a half-court shot. Both players then added two points each. McLane only had Burnt make two free throws out of one. The final score was 28-20.

Han Ying English Royal Volleyball Team

### Recruiting Troops and Buying Horses

Since responding to the reporter's volleyball charity match, the alumni volleyball team of Han Ying English Royal School has been reorganizing its troops, preparing horses, and sharpening its weapons. Recognizing that its strength is not yet sufficient and with war approaching, the team is not only intensifying training but also recruiting troops and buying horses, calling upon former comrades-in-arms. Remote transport athlete Lu Kangyuan, Wu Zhuoliu, National Games representatives Li Zhen, Li Jinqi, and Yuan Bingqiu have all come forward to serve. Ouyang Shaotang has also joined the team. Recently, Chen Shichang has also expressed interest in joining the battle. The team's current strength is quite formidable. Once the date for the finals is set, they will first arrange matches with various friendly teams.

### The Most Suitable Sports for Women

— Wang Xuecheng

As for freehand exercises, gymnastic apparatus, swimming, walking, cycling, tennis, shooting, basketball, hockey, dancing, canoeing, polo, archery, horse riding, driving, skiing, skating, and badminton, etc., are all very beneficial to women in moderation.

In general, any sport is unsuitable for women if it is overdone. Therefore, one should try to avoid excessive fatigue during exercise. The harm of overexertion is even greater than the lack of exercise. The most effective exercise for women is one that requires "qi," or endurance, while the "strength" aspect should be moderate.

Freehand exercises, gymnastic apparatus, and swimming can be said to be the most ideal exercises for women. Walking is also an excellent outdoor exercise, which has great benefits for improving health. Regarding track and field events, except for pole vaulting and hammer throw, if appropriate equipment is used and it is not overdone, it is also suitable for women. The purpose is to train the body and make it develop evenly, paying attention to the posture of the exercise and not focusing on winning or losing.

Pole vaulting is not suitable for women because the body must withstand a significant impact when landing, which has a great impact on the internal organs. For the same reason, whether high jump, long jump, or even running are suitable for women is questionable if the focus is only on winning or losing and the posture of the exercise is ignored.

Although sports such as tennis and swimming are most suitable for women, if their physical structure and mental characteristics are not suitable for these sports, they should not be forced to engage in them. They must choose their sports based on their individual physical structures and mental characteristics, and then receive appropriate and careful guidance, progressing gradually and steadily. In this way, they will have a firm perseverance in their sports, be able to actively engage in them, and have a deep understanding of the importance of their health, their bodies, and their mental abilities.

If women want to reap the greatest benefits from exercise, they must carefully study the relationship between themselves and the sports they choose.

Apart from freehand exercises and gymnastic apparatus, the commonly known most suitable sports for women are not suitable for every woman. Freehand exercises and gymnastic apparatus are not only suitable for every woman, but also more effective than any other sport. However, to achieve the greatest effect, one must engage in freehand exercises and gymnastic apparatus on the one hand, and choose a sport that suits each individual's mind and body from among the various sports suitable for women. (The End)

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment……Beau Hunks

Beau Hunks

This is a Laurel and Hardy film from several years ago. It is now being re-released with a new copy. Among all of Laurel and Hardy's works, this one is slightly less successful. The film is not very long, and the content is not very rich. In the film, the fat Hardy is frustrated and heartbroken, so he enlists in the army and is sent to Africa. During a desert march, the two get lost but end up saving a besieged city from the natives. Laurel and Hardy maintain their consistent style, and the jokes they create are enough to make the audience laugh.

Peaceful Queen……Paris Honeymoon

Paris Honeymoon

The story is very simple, and all the scenes rely on the support of the actors. The performance is still light and pleasant. The cast is quite complete, but the allocation of actors is not very suitable. Some of the actors failed to fully display their talents.

The story tells of a millionaire from the American West who takes his fiancée to Paris because his fiancée still has to complete the divorce procedures with her ex-husband there. He first stays in a rose village, where he meets the local Rose Queen, a little girl who always gives him trouble and whom he calls "little headache." They fall in love unintentionally, while his fiancée in Paris rekindles her old dreams with her ex-husband. He then marries the Rose Queen.

There are several beautiful songs in the film, sung by Bing Crosby. Shirley Ross and Edward Everett Horton don't have much to do in the film. Akim Tamiroff, a star famous for playing villains, plays a comedian here, and the performance is quite good. Franciska Gaal's performance is lively and excellent.

Oriental……Swiss Miss

Swiss Miss

The story is very simple, telling about two rat trap salesmen (Laurel and Hardy) who suddenly have the whimsical idea to do business in Switzerland. However, not only do they not do any business, but they also end up being punished to work as waiters in a hotel. The two self-proclaimed clever idiots make a lot of jokes.

There are two European singers in this film, especially the female one, who has a very good voice. Laurel and Hardy's performance is no different from their previous works.

Great China……Everybody Sing

Everybody Sing

Starring Judy Garland. Although her singing voice is not as moving as Deanna Durbin's, she is also an outstanding talent among the newcomers. The content of the book is about a family of theater maniacs. The performance is all focused on comedy and song and dance. It is also a typical Hollywood musical. In addition to singing, Judy Garland's expressions are also good. Allan Jones is not as outstanding as in "A Day at the Races."

New World……The Real and Fake Empress Wu Zetian

Cantonese film

A commodity that wants to use eroticism as an appeal takes a stage actress with a lifelong lustful nature as the central figure of the film, and uses her role as Empress Wu Zetian on stage and her licentious private life as the description material. The content is bizarre and absurd, but it may cater to low-level tastes. Despite the so-called erotic scenes, it does not dare to be thorough, only disappointing "salty encounters" audiences, and making ordinary audiences feel nauseated.

Central……Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum

Cantonese film

Audiences who have seen the previous episode will remember that at the end, Zhou Zhicheng still stole a pair of Golden Chrysanthemums. The sequel starts from the pursuit and ends with the return of the Golden Chrysanthemums. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is very lax. However, there are still many places in the middle that can win the tears of some foolish audiences, such as Kuang Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting the prison. The consistent style of folk tales cannot be avoided. We can guess the plot of the film without having seen it, and this idea is indeed correct. Cao Qiwen is not suitable for playing this sequel film. The set photography is still passable in South China, but the sound recording is a failure.

Taiping……Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Opera Troupe

Day performance……Military Lock on Moths' Eyebrows Array

Night performance……Two Volumes of Yin Yang Fan

Gao Sheng……Cantonese Opera

Xing Zhonghua Opera Troupe

Day performance……Luo Tong Sweeping the North

Night performance……Poison Blood Washing the Heart of Lang

### Alice Marble's Secrets to Tennis Success (6)

—Courtship

The overhead smash is the most difficult technique for women to learn. Women who can perform the overhead smash must have a natural gift, so there are very few women who can perform the overhead smash. The reason is that women's movements are fundamentally slower than men's. This is a natural flaw. The reason why it is difficult for women to have an overhead smash is because of the word "slow," which often causes the high ball to fall too low before it is smashed.

Although the overhead smash is similar to the serve, the racket must be swung behind the body when preparing to serve. However, this is not the case when preparing for an overhead smash. When you see that you must use an overhead smash to return the ball, you should raise the racket high as preparation when your opponent hits the ball. At the same time, you should also move forward slightly with small steps, especially sideways. Only when you are about to hit the ball should you lower the racket backward and then swing it upward and forward. But when hitting the ball, avoid intentionally pressing the ball down.

According to my technique, the outline can be divided as follows. This is nothing less than my ten commandments for playing tennis:

"1" When the opponent serves and I am preparing to return the ball, I should try to stand close to the baseline, because this will help me prepare quickly.

"2" When you swing your racket back, preparing to hit, you should do so when the ball is about to leave your opponent's racket.

"3" Advance and retreat with small steps, "avoid running with large steps."

"4" During the match, your feet should never stop moving and should always be jumping. In this way, you will not have the disadvantage of being too late to start.

"5" During the practice time before the match, you should scout out the weaknesses of your opponent.

"6" You should always pay attention to the ball served by your opponent and to the ball you hit.

"7" After hitting the ball at the end of the court, you should immediately return to the baseline and the midpoint of the service line.

"8" When serving, if the first ball fails to pass the net, the second ball should be tossed a little higher. If the first ball is hit out of bounds, the second ball should be tossed a little forward.

"9" You should regard playing tennis as a great entertainment. Be happy when you win, and be happy when you lose. Both winning and losing should show equal courtesy.

"10" Should be based on continued action, "The End"

### Don't Fall for the Enemy's Trap

— Du Ai

From the newspapers, I learned that the Spanish government has invented a powerful propaganda weapon called the "propaganda cannon." Using the force of cannonballs, leaflets are scattered over the rebel territory. Not long ago, I saw in a pictorial that the Spanish government army has fighters who are specifically responsible for conducting broadcast propaganda to the rebels in open areas. These two efforts will play a significant role in disintegrating the rebel forces. This is worth learning.

Modern warfare is not only a war of guns, but also a political propaganda war. Everyone knows this. Our current war of resistance is for truth and justice, and the effectiveness of propaganda warfare needs to be improved. However, some propaganda fighters lack political common sense and vigilance, and often end up publicizing the opposite result.

Some of our Chinese newspapers still seem unable to break away from the old method of "reporting everything that is heard," only seeking to "report" or "report a lot," but not seeking to "verify its authenticity," and even not investigating the source of the "report," let alone estimating what kind of result the news will achieve after publication. Newspapers like these are most likely to fall into the enemy's trap. For example, take the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops. The Soviet Union's assistance to us is based on our objective needs. What we need from the Soviet Union in our war of resistance is modern military equipment, technical personnel, etc., not the Soviet Union's "large army." Under its complex international relations, the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to assist China is not a simple matter. It is also not beneficial for us in any way for the Soviet Union to dispatch troops to assist China alone. Because the dispatch of troops will cause an attack by Western fascist countries, the Soviet Union's assistance to us will be affected instead. The Japanese know this. Therefore, they are doing their best to promote "the Soviet Union is about to send troops to assist China." This kind of propaganda has three aspects: one is to China. To make the Chinese people happy. But in the end, the Soviet Union did not send troops. As a result, the Chinese people were disappointed with the Soviet Union, and even resented the Soviet Union, scolding it for "not being a friend." Japanese news agencies use such tricks to break the increasingly close relationship between China and the Soviet Union. The second is international. It spreads lies to the international community that "the Soviet Union is about to send troops to China" and "China is about to be converted to communism" in order to divert international attention, make the democratic countries of the world suspicious of China, thereby provoking the feelings between China and the democratic countries, and making my international position independent. The third is for Japan's domestic audience. It can use the "storm" of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to "more reasonably" extort its citizens and transfer troops to China on a larger scale to strengthen its new military offensive against us. This is the conspiracy of the Japanese news agency and its assistant, a certain country's news agency, to particularly like to fabricate rumors such as "the Soviet Union is sending troops" and "General Galen has arrived in Chongqing." Some of our newspapers, without analysis, also publish it in a big way. What is its impact? The people are disappointed, the Japanese offensive is more fierce, and the people are more pessimistic about the war of resistance. As a result, the editorial of a certain major newspaper criticizing the Soviet Union appeared, and the staff of the communications agency of × party laughed triumphantly. Although things like relics are "a thing of the past," our newspaper editors should remember these experiences and lessons.

Let me give another example? When Guangzhou fell not long ago, the Japanese news agency and a certain news agency colluding with × country suddenly released the news that "Chairman Chiang ordered Guangzhou to be recovered before November 14." In fact, the recovery of Guangzhou can only be achieved under certain conditions. We are not concerned with the issue of recovering "Guangzhou" alone. The main task at present is how to stop ×'s offensive to the northwest and how to recapture the cities surrounding Guangzhou, and launch guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear to trap × people in a corner of Guangzhou. Then, when the time is right (that is, under certain conditions), the recovery of Guangzhou is not a problem. × people know this. They know that we cannot recover Guangzhou immediately at present, so they deliberately release a rumor, saying that "Chairman Chiang ordered" and so on. When the fact that Guangzhou had not been recovered by November 14 was made clear, × people and their accomplices laughed knowingly again. This kind of rumor from × people also has two conspiracies: one, deliberately release air to achieve a certain political effect; second, to cause a certain misunderstanding among the people of Guangdong. Our newspapers, without detailed analysis, also published it in a big way, "Chairman Chiang ordered the recovery of Guangzhou in a week."

The above-mentioned experiences and lessons have not been corrected, and our newspapers (a small part) are making jokes again. For example, on the 26th of this month, some newspapers published the news from the Haitong News Agency in a big way that "the CCP has canceled the border area and returned the Eighth Route Army." In fact, the Northwest Border Region is only a local government under the central government. It is a unit under the united front. If the border area government is to be abolished, then the local governments of all provinces should also be abolished. Isn't this ridiculous. As for the Eighth Route Army, it was reorganized from the Red Army into the 18th Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army, and its subordination to the Supreme Command has not only started today. So where is the propaganda effect of Haitong News Agency? I think if we look at the proposal made by Wang Jingwei in his telegram on December 30 last year, which deliberately undermines the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, cancels the united front, and harms the future of the war of resistance, we will understand. And this is exactly the new trick of the Japanese fascists to provoke the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and undermine the united front.

### Something the Japanese Don't Understand

— Lin Huanping

From a novel in the New Year's issue of a certain Japanese magazine, I accidentally read a very interesting story. The general idea is this:

At the previous Japanese Diet, a member of parliament came to question the government, saying that Japan is the victor and China is the loser. In principle, the market price of Japanese money in international exchange should be higher than that of Chinese money. Who knew that the opposite was true: the market price of Chinese currency was much higher than that of Japanese currency: every 100 yuan could be exchanged for more than 110 Japanese yen. Isn't this a strange phenomenon? He asked the government what the reason for this was. At that time, the government officials attending the parliament, including the prime minister, the minister of finance, the army minister, and the foreign minister, could not give the questioner a satisfactory answer.

This is something the Japanese don't understand.

Later, due to the progress of the war and the intensified implementation of the policy of destroying legal currency by the Japanese warlords, the value of our country's legal currency has fallen somewhat, and about 110 yuan can only be exchanged for 100 yuan of Japanese gold (which is about the same now). However, this is about the same as the Sino-Japanese exchange rate before the war. As a result, the general Japanese people feel strange again: China has been defeated so "miserably," and the "Imperial Army" has won so "difficultly." In principle, China's legal currency should be worthless waste paper like the German mark of the defeated country at the end of World War I. Why is the price of China's legal currency still so high? This is really a mysterious thing, a miracle!

However, the Chinese people understand the mystery of this miracle; the European and American people also understand its mystery; even the Japanese warlords understand it, but they cannot solve the difficulties in it. Only the Japanese people, even the high-ranking people who serve as members of parliament, do not understand, no, the military gate does not allow them to understand the mystery of this miracle.

Here, I will tell the reader: this matter is proof that China will eventually drive out all of the * * * leaving not a single piece of armor on their bodies.

### Hollywood's China Craze

— Zhen

A year and a half into the full-scale war of resistance, China has indeed earned a good reputation internationally. Even Hollywood, the city of snobbish tendencies, is now taking notice of China. Various war film companies are using Chinese resistance stories as scripts, and they are adopting the opinions contributed by Chinese actors as much as possible. Their status is truly vastly different from what it used to be.

For example, Paramount Pictures recently produced "King of Chinatown." Although it does not contain American-style gangster classes, nor old Eastern customs such as dragging queues and foot binding, Ms. Anna May Wong, the lead actress, is still dissatisfied. She demands that Chinese people be treated as equals with Americans, without distinction. She proposed three conditions: (1) Eliminate words like "godfather" from the film. (2) Replace "nose wiping" with kissing. Ms. Wong's point is that wiping the nose to express warmth is a crude habit of the Arctic Eskimos, how can it be used to insult the Chinese? (3) Filmmakers have always believed that Chinese people are either living in a drunken stupor or are foolish. This concept should be eliminated. Well, director Blystone, seeing that Miss Wong was justified and confident, agreed to follow her requests and guaranteed that the same thing would not happen again in the future.

Columbia Pictures recently filmed "Life is Cheap," starring Betty Furness and Joan Clerc, using the Sino-Japanese War as the subject matter to expose the ugliness of the invaders. However, in order to avoid future disputes, the company's authorities cast all American actors for the roles and adopted symbolic performance methods to avoid involving the words "Japanese people." The evil General Wu plays the villain, and the Chinese General Chen plays the righteous role. It is said that this approach is already very bold.

Cecil B. DeMille, the king of directors, seeing that all parties are supporting the Chinese, recently felt the same way and decided to completely abolish the scene of a Chinese laborer dragging a queue and dressing like a slave in his new film. Instead, he filmed the image of modern Chinese workers, depicting them building a railway in hardship and solemnity, full of lively and amiable postures.

Therefore, with the advancement of the times, Hollywood directors' "understanding of China" has completely changed. They will further sympathize with and support the Chinese people, instead of distorting the truth as they did in the past.

### Spare Me Your Words

— Tian

Across from my bedroom is a dance hall. Every night, after turning off the lights and going to sleep, I look at the neon lights shining on my bed and often think of the news that neon lights are banned on Ginza Street in Tokyo. I have never been to Japan, so I have naturally never experienced the scenery of Ginza Street, but according to friends, Ginza Street is the most lively street in Tokyo, especially after dinner, strolling through it is a special flavor. However, on such a lively street, once the neon lights that enhance the city's appearance are banned, its dullness can be imagined.

But for the "Hundred Years' War," it seems that we have no choice but to conserve resources and relieve disasters. Neon lights were banned first, and matchsticks were shortened later. In addition, government offices abolished leather shoes and wore clogs, etc. The reaction to these "punishments" was indeed a bit chaotic.

A few days ago, I saw a report from a local news agency: "According to news from Taiwan, the gold and silver utensils taken from the people by the Japanese in Taiwan amounted to more than 9 million yen last year. The items taken include wine bottles, teapots, and old coins. They even take the gold-inlaid dentures from people's mouths."

This is indeed an interesting piece of news. We have a common saying to describe poverty, called "except for the button, there is no copper" (in the past, clothes were sewn with copper buttons, like the "suit buttons" that were popular in Shanghai for a while), but now even gold-inlaid dentures are affected, the degree of poverty can be imagined.

Therefore, what is worrying is: after those gold-inlaid dentures are knocked down, what other ideas will they come up with? A certain newspaper used "Spare Me Your Words" as the headline for this telegram, and I think it is appropriate to transfer these words to those "shameless" spokespersons.

Whatever, everything, just "spare me your words."

### Military Diary

— Li Huiying

Especially, our female comrades also put on military uniforms and acted together. If the old master Confucius were alive, he should lament, "The world is deteriorating" and "People's hearts are not what they used to be" and shake his head frequently.

The small town of Kongzi River has a decent terrain, with mountains and paddy fields suitable for cultivation. There are not many people. It looks like there are only forty or fifty households, and every family is living a peaceful life. The river divides the town into two halves, and a wide stone bridge spans the river. Grocery stores are all located on the west side of the bridge. On the big wall of a store, I don't know which division's political department posted a row of slogans taller than people:

"Rather be a ghost of war than a slave of a conquered nation!"

We returned to the place where we put our backpacks and rested. Our legs were so sore and weak that no matter where you put them, they would not feel comfortable. So we took out dry food to fill our empty stomachs.

A group of villagers surrounded us, and they laughed at us.

"What are you laughing at? Aren't you afraid of soldiers?"

"No, we used to be afraid, but the soldiers after the fight against Japan are all very civilized."

"Do you also know about fighting the Japanese?"

"How could we not know? Since the fight against Japan, the prices of oil, salt, fine wine have all gone up."

"Come," another comrade pulled this one away, "Let me talk to you about fighting the Japanese, okay?" Time passed moment by moment.

When people woke up and asked about the meal time, they were disappointed. We couldn't buy anything to eat! Let's just say that the cook was opening the noodle bag preparing to make no-glory noodles, but who knows when that would be cooked. Some people couldn't stand the hunger in their stomachs, so they went out to the street to find food themselves.

The street was different.

All the shops were closed, looking like it was New Year's. It was really too difficult to buy something to eat. There were also fewer people coming and going on the street than when we arrived. Only a few of our comrades were carrying cans of red and white powder, writing slogans like "Military-Civilian Cooperation" on the walls with brushes.

We finally found a shop selling sesame flowers with the door half-closed, and we hurriedly squeezed in. The sesame flowers were piled up, but he wouldn't open the door to sell them.

When the shop owners saw our brave actions, they were first startled, and took a few steps back. Then, looking at their pile of goods, they stepped forward and put on a forced smile, saying slowly:

"General, this is a small business."

"What does the size of your business have to do with us? We're paying money, and you're selling goods!" Wang said.

"No,..."

"No what?"

"General, you don't know the suffering of doing small business."

"Soldiers suffer more than you."

We ate the sesame flowers, filling our stomachs. Although the taste was not very delicious, it was already a rare and valuable food.

"How much is one?" I asked.

"Hee hee, General, how can I charge for what you eat?" (To be continued)
