### China on the Front Lines of Defending World Peace

The twenty months of Japan's war of aggression against China—what has it gained? The facts have already given us a clear answer: the use of two-thirds of its army, navy, and air force combat power and the elimination of more than one-third; the exhaustion of its finances and economy; and the widespread war-weariness and anti-war sentiment among its soldiers and people. In contrast, our country has seen the solidifying of national unity, the strengthening of combat power, the development of transportation in the rear, the increase in production, and, above all, the surge in national hatred of the enemy—all the opposite of the Japanese. From this, the future of our victory and the Japanese defeat is predetermined. All the Japanese's hypocritical propaganda can no longer cover up the ironclad facts, and has long been clearly pointed out by informed people around the world, requiring no further detailed explanation. However, the question of what tragic situation the Japanese's few warlords and plutocrats are ultimately leading the entire Japanese people into is precisely what concerns us.

Why did the few Japanese warlords and plutocrats launch this war of aggression? In my article "Why We Fight," published shortly after the outbreak of the war, I clearly pointed out that all the Japanese's professed reasons were nothing more than deceptive talk; the real reason was driven by the mad mentality and erroneous thinking of the Japanese military, who dreamed of realizing the crazy delusions in the Tanaka Memorial. The Tanaka Memorial advocated conquering the world. However, conquering the world must begin with conquering China. It can be seen that Japan's invasion of China is all a hypocritical cover-up, and conquering the world is its real purpose. Conquering the world is not only intolerable to public justice, but from its own manpower, material resources, and financial resources, this mere island nation does not have the strength and qualifications—it is predetermined from the start. However, the mad mentality of the Japanese warlords drives them unconsciously. Although their mad mentality and erroneous thinking are innately destined to fail to realize their pipe dreams, they have the ability to disrupt world peace, at least disrupt East Asian peace. In the twenty months since, the ravaging of our country's provinces and regions, the killing of tens of millions of people, the occupation of urban transportation lines, and the plunder of property and resources constitute the sole tragedy in history. At the same time, the destruction of various countries' commerce in the Far East, the robbery of overseas Chinese's property, and even the loss of protection for various countries' envoys and warships in China have attracted the attention of the world, all focused on this East Asian battlefield. Although the results they have obtained prove that they are digging their own graves, their delusion has not been awakened. Their erroneous thinking has not been corrected. The fact that Japan disregarded everything last month and attacked Hainan Island is enough to prove that it is taking a further risk and making a desperate gamble.

Hainan Island is an isolated island off our Leizhou Peninsula, unrelated to the war situation on the mainland. If Japan's war of aggression against China is limited to conquering China, then the decisive battle should be fought on the mainland. Because the naval force is not needed on the mainland battlefield, since the start of the war, the loss of Japanese combat power has still leaned towards the army and air force. The elite of the navy has been preserved. Since the army and air force have encountered strong enemies on the mainland and cannot fulfill their wishes, according to its consistent policy of conquering the world, it has had to use its last navy to attack the world. Hainan Island is west of Annam, north of Guangzhou Bay, and faces the Philippines across the South China Sea. It is sufficient to control the South China Sea and the Tokyo Bay, and to threaten Annam and the Philippines; it also cuts off the sea route between Hong Kong and Singapore, which is sufficient to influence the entire western Pacific situation. From Japan's point of view, Hainan Island is the southern gateway of Japan, passing from Sakhalin Island through Japan's mainland and Taiwan. When the United States announced its defense in Guam, Japan's move to occupy Hainan Island was tantamount to giving the United States an answer in action, tantamount to telling the United States clearly that the area from west of Honolulu to east of Singapore has long been a planned territory of Japan. The day after Japan attacked Hainan Island, Chairman Chiang clearly pointed out that Japan's attack on Hainan Island is "no different from the September 18th Incident in the Pacific." In one sentence, the ambition of Japan to conquer the world can be said to be completely exposed. In the past, when the Tanaka Memorial was discovered, although the general public was shocked, they generally thought it was just a kind of mad talk. The September 18th Incident broke out and actually ignited the flames of war in the Far East. Those with shallow views still regarded it as a local event in the Far East and did not pay attention to it. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, there were still many countries in the world watching. At this stage, Japan's ferocious face can be said to be completely exposed. It tells the world in action that its invasion of China is the first part of conquering the world.

Our Chinese heroic resistance for the past twenty months is undoubtedly for the independence of the Republic of China and the free survival of the Chinese nation. However, from the perspective of the entire world, it is also taking on the role of defending the front lines of world peace. The world needs peace, and countries have already learned a general lesson from the previous European war. The organization of the League of Nations and the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact were all set up to avoid the cruelty of war. However, the ambitions of a few ambitious people are not happy unless they drive humanity to bloodshed. At present, there is certainly more than one country in the world that deliberately creates war. However, the first shot was fired by Japan in the September 18th Incident. At that time, our country did not have the strength to resist due to internal problems; however, if all countries in the world could take a long-term view and uphold justice, the situation later would certainly not have deteriorated so much. Even the Treaty of Versailles would not have been torn up, Abyssinia would not have been destroyed, and the civil war in Spain for more than two years would not have occurred. We know that ambitious people will not be satisfied. The fact that China did not fire a single shot in the September 18th Incident and gave up the four northeastern provinces cannot satisfy Japan, just as the sacrifice of Austria and Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Abyssinia by European countries cannot satisfy Germany and Italy. The problem will only get tighter and tighter. Only resistance with strength, or the union of peace-loving countries to implement effective sanctions, can have a practical effect. The long-term war between China and Japan since the Lugou Bridge Incident has already given the most reasonable answer to the Japanese ambitious people; and the insatiable demands of Germany and Italy have also aroused widespread awakening in European and American countries. Recently, the close cooperation between Britain and France, and between Britain and the United States, has already begun, which is sufficient to give Germany and Italy a considerable warning. However, what we cannot ignore is that several ambitious people in the world are carrying out a union. Although there are many contradictions between them, they can at least echo each other. Therefore, peace-loving countries in the world will eventually need to unite. Only by uniting can the attempt of ambitious people to defeat them one by one be fundamentally eliminated. In this hopeful union, undoubtedly our China will still take on the front line.

In Europe, the reason why Germany and Italy are rampant can be said that they completely exploited the war-averse mentality of Europeans. Because the lessons of the last war are still deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public. Therefore, the reason why Germany and Italy can achieve victory is half due to threats and half due to fraud. In the Far East, Japan has fortunately won the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War since the Meiji Restoration, which has led to their arrogant mentality and has long put no one in their eyes. Without giving them a serious blow, they will not wake up. The mad talk about conquering the world in the Tanaka Memorial was born because of this. Since our China is the first target for Japanese ambitious people to conquer the world, the size of our country's land, the abundance of our products, and the sufficiency of our manpower are sufficient to resist Japan and more. This can already be proved by the past twenty months of battles. However, in order to shorten the process of the war and reduce cruel sacrifices, peace-loving countries in the world need to unite as soon as possible. We can say that this kind of union, while its direct purpose is to assist China, all countries have the same obligation to maintain world peace and ensure their own security. In the past, all countries were bound by facts, and although they have given our country a lot of sympathy in morality, they have not yet been able to achieve unity in action. Recently, countries such as Britain and the United States, which have relatively close relations with the Far East, have gradually become consistent, which is enough to give our country a lot of excitement. Now, the Japanese ambitious people are taking a further step to implement the second step of their conquest of the world. Therefore, we have to clearly point out Japan's ambition and further hope that all countries in the world will work hard for their own safety and jointly extinguish this destroyer of world peace.

Mr. Jiang Baili said: "There is no one in the world who sympathizes with the Japanese as much as I do." I think this should be the common feeling of every humanitarian. In terms of various conditions, Japan not only does not have the qualifications to conquer the world, not only should not recklessly claim to be the master of East Asia, but should also live very cautiously on its island country. How fortunate to be Japanese, establishing a country between the three great peace-loving countries of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. He actually does not know how to be satisfied and launched this large-scale war of aggression. In the twenty months of war, he used two-thirds of his army, navy, and air force and consumed one-third of his army, navy, and air force's strength; if he knew it was difficult and retreated, it would not be difficult to maintain his position as a small country in East Asia. He should be deeply grateful for the most reasonable lesson we gave him. Unexpectedly, he is now going a step further and extending his evil hand to the western Pacific with his only remaining navy. When the world's peace forces are becoming increasingly united today, his future is difficult to imagine. I think that in the near future, he will go a step further and deeply regret that he should not have received the lessons we gave him in China!

### A Week of World Trends

— Pan Lang

From March 12th to 18th

Tension! Serious! Critical! Chaotic!

Lamenting! Wailing! Raging! Cheering!

A historical tragedy! A disgrace to humanity!

The past week can be regarded as the most serious and chaotic week in the international situation since the New Year. In Europe, the Czech Republic completely perished due to its compromise halfway through resisting the war, the arrogance of the German invaders became even higher, the situation in Britain and France became more dangerous, and the call from the Soviet Union and the United States for "uniting to defend democracy and peace" gained widespread response amidst the all-encompassing war clouds in Europe. In the Far East, Japanese invaders, taking advantage of the serious situation in the West, seized the opportunity to "fish in troubled waters," creating a facade of "launching a major offensive against the Soviet Union" while stepping up preparations to conquer all of China by invading the Southwest. As for our country, in this chaotic world, under the common demand of "strengthening national unity and persevering in the war of resistance," we continue to make progress in military, political, and popular movements. Although difficulties remain serious, the future is brighter.

The Complete Subjugation of Czechoslovakia

Czechoslovakia was a newly emerging republic in Europe after the Great War, formed by combining Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, formerly parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, covering an area of more than 140,300 square kilometers with a population of approximately 14,728,000. In foreign affairs, it followed France's lead and also concluded agreements with Romania and Yugoslavia, the so-called Little Entente, to consolidate its international position. However, with the Munich Agreement last September, the French Daladier government, following Chamberlain's policy of appeasement, exchanged the partition of Czechoslovakia for the German invaders' guarantee of peace in Europe. Small countries such as Romania and Yugoslavia were even more alarmed by the wavering of France's policy on which they relied, unable to take care of themselves. The Czech government also suppressed the people's enthusiasm for resisting the war, accepting international mediation and implementing a compromise halfway through. At that time, Czechoslovakia was given nominal independence, but all appeasement policies only invited destruction. The German invaders, seeing that the resistance in Spain was gradually being suppressed under the appeasement policies of Britain and France, immediately seized the opportunity to advance, with military mobilization and diplomatic conspiracies proceeding simultaneously, tearing up the Munich Agreement that had not yet dried, which "guaranteed Czech independence," resulting in the historical tragedy of Czechoslovakia perishing without a fight on the fifteenth of this month.

On the fifteenth, Hitler triumphantly entered Prague, and on the sixteenth, he issued a declaration annexing Czechoslovakia. The current state of "Czechoslovakia" is: (1) The Slovak region declared "independence," but in reality, it has become a vassal of Germany, a European version of Manchukuo, with everything subject to the control of the German invaders. (2) The Ruthenian region has also declared "independence," but it is still being contested by Hungarian and Polish forces. There are also rumors of Polish involvement. If it is annexed by Hungary, then Hungary and Poland will border each other, and the possibility of preventing direct conflict between German forces will depend on the relationship between Italy and Germany. (3) The two wealthy provinces of Bohemia and Moravia remaining in Czechoslovakia have become German provinces. Military, political, and financial affairs are all managed by commissioners appointed by Germany, and the Nuremberg Jewish Laws are being implemented immediately. The Czech Republic has now completely perished. Here, we hope that those compatriots who are happy to see the arguments of "anti-communism," "peace advocacy," "compromise halfway through," and "international mediation" will open their eyes and see the painful history of the Czech Republic's demise under the policies of "anti-communism," "peace advocacy," "compromise halfway through," and "international mediation"!

New Developments in British, French, and American Military

From the drastic changes in the Spanish war situation to the demise of the Czech Republic, on the one hand, it created a more superior reputation for the fascist aggressors, Germany and Italy, and on the other hand, it forced the democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain and France to further decline in the world. At the same time, it also advanced the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle worldwide to a stage of intense development, forcing the democratic and peaceful front to consolidate and expand. In Britain and France, political parties representing the hard-working masses and the vast population seeking freedom unanimously opposed the appeasement policy of helping the aggressors harm others and themselves, and launched practical struggles extensively from parliamentary demonstrations and marches. The British and French governments were also forced to adopt a tougher stance. On the seventeenth, a London dispatch stated that Britain and France had agreed to recall their ambassadors to Germany, expressing their protest against Germany's breach of contract. Chamberlain also had to vehemently denounce Germany for endangering peace in Birmingham on the seventeenth, stating that Britain would do its best to resist the enemy's challenge; Halifax is also planning to organize a national cabinet, calling on all parties to participate, including former Foreign Secretary Eden and Conservative Churchill. At the same time, the government also expressed sympathy for the proposal to implement conscription to strengthen Britain's attitude towards Germany. Rumors that Chamberlain will resign and promote British-Soviet relations have been flooding in. On the French side, the anti-fascist and anti-aggression people's front led by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party has gained new development. Daladier decided to go to Britain within days to discuss how to deal with the new crisis situation. French Foreign Minister Bonnet also declared that France should maintain close relations with the Soviet Union and Poland today. He has consulted with the Soviet ambassador many times, and Poland has repeatedly expressed its desire for Britain and France to cooperate with the Soviet Union. As for the United States, since the news of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia spread, the political circles have become more uneasy about the international war clouds. President Roosevelt's attitude of strengthening the peace front to resist fascist aggression has become even tougher. Undersecretary of State Welles formally declared on the seventeenth the United States' determination to severely condemn Germany's aggressive atrocities. The Senate's opposition to the government's attitude has gradually weakened. The chairman of the House Labor Committee proposed to cancel the trade agreement with Czechoslovakia and demanded that Germany bear the huge debt of 165 million yuan owed by Czechoslovakia. In addition to the 270 million yuan to expand the Panama Canal locks, Roosevelt will also propose to Congress to allocate 5 million yuan to develop the defense of the port of Guam. These facts prove that the democratic and peaceful countries have a further tendency to awaken and unite to resist fascist aggression. Our task today is to call on and unite the anti-fascist masses around the world, promote the policy of the British and French governments uniting with the United States and the Soviet Union, and prevent their attempts to limit themselves to compromising with domestic opposition.

Serious Soviet-Japanese Conflict

At this time of extreme crisis in Europe, Soviet-Japanese relations are also unprecedentedly tense. In the past, the fundamental cause of Soviet-Japanese conflicts was not communism, but a Japanese conspiracy to ease domestic anti-war sentiment, to ease the movement of powerful nations restricting Japan, to divert attention from our country's war of resistance against Japan, and to carry out its steps to intensify the conquest of our country. This time, the Soviet-Japanese fishing zone dispute was actually justified on the Soviet side. If the Japanese side had genuine sincerity for peace, it could have been resolved long ago, but precisely because Japan has the above-mentioned conspiracy, it continues to maintain a tense state. However, since the fifteenth of this month, the Soviet Union has adhered to a tough attitude of defending peace and justice, rejecting all unreasonable demands from Japan, and implementing the auction of Sakhalin Island fishing rights. If Japan does not fight, it will yield, and it can no longer continue its past conspiracies. According to continuous telegraphic reports, Japan has been creating a "war against the Soviet Union" situation. According to a Shanghai dispatch on the seventeenth, the Japanese army recently departed from Japan, Korea, and headed to "Manchuria." The Japanese sources are running to northern Manchuria, with an estimated force of about 100,000, approaching Qinglv Port near Zhanggufeng, and has announced the prohibition of merchant ships from entering and exiting. The northern Manchurian railway from Harbin to Manchuria has been automatically destroyed. According to another foreign intelligence report, it is said that in the past two weeks, the Japanese army secretly withdrew from China and headed to Manchuria, reaching about 600,000 people. Recently, the Japanese air force in various war zones in China has been very active, and its purpose is to cover the retreat of the transport team. We must maintain a reserved attitude towards this kind of news until there is factual evidence. At the same time, we should have the following basic understandings: (1) Japan's full-scale invasion of China militarily has no chance of victory, and it has no power to simultaneously conduct wars against China and the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union's political and economic advances are a guarantee that its military is sufficient to defeat any aggressor. The Far Eastern Red Army's powerful performance in the Battle of Zhanggufeng has been great, and its progress has been rapid in the months since. Soviet Far East Army Commander Stern's report at the recent All-Union Congress proves that the Far Eastern Red Army is superior to the Japanese army in every aspect. Before Japan wins its invasion of China, it has no courage and determination to truly fight against the Soviet Union. (3) The Soviet Union's recent tough attitude towards Japan and its strong strength in the Far East are the most powerful aid to our country's war of resistance against Japan. We must not easily believe the recent rumors. We should take this opportunity to intensify the fighting force of the front line and the large-scale launch of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines from a strategic perspective. (4) We must also pay attention to the fact that Japan is clamoring to fight against the Soviet Union at all costs, but in reality, it is eager for Soviet entanglement and reconciliation. Be vigilant against its new strategy against China, especially the Southwest, and be vigilant against its preparations for a military general offensive and its conspiracies for political peace and compromise.

A Week of War of Resistance Situation

In the anti-Japanese war of resistance in the past week, the overall situation has not changed significantly. First, the once-tense war in central Hubei has weakened the enemy's momentum since our army began a counterattack against the flanks of the Japanese army last week. In the unprecedented bloody battle on the Jingzhong Road alone, the Japanese army suffered more than 8,000 deaths. Although our army withdrew from Zhongxiang, it immediately increased its reinforcements, launched a large-scale counterattack, and closely surrounded Zhongxiang, and sent four divisions to bypass the north of Zhongxiang to harass the enemy's rear. The two sides continue to face off. Second, south of the Yangtze River, the enemy continued to attempt to cut off our Zhejiang-Hunan Road from Zhejiang and Anhui, and to take Nanchang and Changsha from the south, but made no progress. Fierce battles east of Poyang Lake have continued until a cessation is sought; the area from the southern Xun Road to the north of the Xiu River on the west bank has been constantly punished by our guerrillas. Third, the war situation in the north is also in a stalemate. The enemy's three-pronged attempt to seize Jingle and invade the Northwest has been defeated by us. This is due to the remarkable effect of our implementation of the scorched-earth strategy, the enemy's rear being attacked and reinforcements being insufficient, and the enemy's cadres and troops being wiped out by more than a thousand successively; now our morale is becoming more and more prosperous. As for the enemy who committed the crime from the three routes of Fenyang, Taiyuan, and Yangqu, they have also been frustrated by our counterattack from the rear. There are continuous mixed battles in other parts of Chahar, Hebei, Henan, and Henan. After our counterattack in northern Jiangsu, the situation in Huaiyin is unclear, the enemy's momentum has weakened again, and the chairman of Heilongjiang, Ma Zhanshan, has led 30,000 cavalrymen of the newly trained Eastern Province, departing from Suiyuan on an "Eastern Expedition" and preparing to return to Heilongjiang to take office: morale is like clouds, invincible, and now arriving in the western border of Rehe, except for a road of puppet troops surrendering to the wind, they have not encountered resistance! Fourth, the situation in South China has been particularly tense in the past week. This matter is related to the compromising policy of the country and Britain and France in Europe, granting the Japanese army the opportunity to further scare and plunder. According to our army's intelligence in Shaoguan on the sixteenth, the Japanese army generals in South China recently met somewhere and planned to increase three more divisions to the incident and invade the South Road, and prepared to deal with the international problems that may be caused by the invasion of Hainan Island. According to the military report from Guilin, the enemy has recently attempted to attack Yangjiang and Dianbai, and a major battle in the south is imminent. As for the war situation on each front, our garrison on Hainan Island is still fighting hard. The former Red Army, in addition to bravely resisting the enemy, has also actively mobilized the masses and trained the Li and Miao people to prepare for a protracted war of resistance, so as to cooperate with the overall war of resistance; to consume and contain the enemy. Within Guangdong Province, the enemy still only defends points and lines in the occupied areas. Recently, they have tried to eliminate our guerrillas in each area, and used Wang Jingwei's anti-communist and peace talks, and distributed the XX Daily published in Hong Kong and other pro-peace and anti-communist traitor publications. To assist its poisonous appeasement policy, in order to consolidate its ruling power and facilitate its use of pseudo-laws to conscript money and goods and conscript strong men and women. However, because our political work has gradually extended into the occupied areas, the anti-traitor movement has made progress every day. Since April, the enemy has made no progress. The reason why they have been actively acting recently is probably to try to save their political failure by military offensive. We hope that the compatriots in South China who mistakenly believe that they have a peaceful life under the sun will be vigilant about this.

Important Military Meeting

Since the anti-Japanese war turned to the first phase, the situation between our army and the enemy has begun to undergo major changes. On the enemy's side, in order to break our protracted war strategy, on the one hand, they have intensified directing national traitors and pro-Japanese elements to promote "anti-communism" and "peace talks" in speech and action, in order to alienate our unity and undermine our anger. On the one hand, in the economy, they have adopted both appeasement and plunder, intensifying the robbery in the occupied areas. In the military, they have changed their combat policy, changing from central cities to using our army as their combat target; this is because (1) the enemy has too few troops to completely defeat us; (2) the year-and-a-half of combat experience has proved that the Chinese people are difficult to subdue even under the enemy's rape, looting, and massacre, so they are trying to break our main force; (3) the year-and-a-half of combat experience has proved that it is impossible to make us surrender without occupying vast rural areas, so they are trying to find our army everywhere to fight and clear their rear, restore the poisonous plan of using the Chinese to continue to attack and conquer our country. In response to this conspiracy of the enemy, it can be seen that we must develop the guerrilla war in the enemy's rear to stop the enemy's offensive: only by stopping the enemy's offensive can we cultivate new forces to prepare for a counteroffensive and conduct a decisive battle, and only by implementing a counteroffensive and conducting a decisive battle can we restore our land and build our country. For the sake of the new environment and new needs, we will convene a high-level military meeting recently. According to a director who presided over this meeting, this meeting decided on the positive side to use the precise tactics of a comprehensive main track war and the spirit of dying to intensify the steps to lash out at the Japanese enemy on the front line and in the rear. Militarily, it was decided to bravely defeat the main force of the enemy, and at the same time, to implement the National Covenant method to smash the Japanese enemy's political tricks, and then to use economic and blockade methods to prohibit Japanese goods from being transported into the interior, and not to allow our food products to be transported into the enemy-occupied areas. On the passive side, we must consolidate various political and cultural forces, in order to cooperate with the revolutionary tactics of the face. Politically, it was decided to strengthen political institutions at all levels and consolidate revolutionary political institutions in the war zone, in order to mobilize the anti-Japanese forces of the vast masses. Culturally, it was decided to increase the work of anti-Japanese culture and promote the national spirit, in order to enhance revolutionary emotions. In terms of personnel, it was decided to first recommend the virtuous and capable. In terms of principle, it was decided to be honest and serve the public. Finally, a simple, effective method of leading troops, training troops, and using troops was formulated. After this military meeting, there will be important progress in the entire future of the war of resistance. "For detailed comments, please refer to this newspaper's special commentary on the 15th of this month, "Detailed Review of New Military Decisions on the War of Resistance." At the same time, in order to mobilize the financial and economic forces of the whole country to serve the war of resistance, a National Financial Conference was recently convened and successfully concluded, establishing a unified anti-Japanese front in the financial community and actively striving to realize the financial and economic policies during the period of the war of resistance and national construction. (Please refer to this newspaper's editorial on the 17th of this month, "Current Financial and Economic Problems.")

National Spiritual Mobilization

To highly develop national self-esteem and self-confidence, persist in resisting the war to the end, overcome pessimistic emotions, oppose compromise attempts; and support the supreme leader, support the central government, support Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, oppose divisions and splits, oppose any traitorous government: it is the urgent task of the whole nation at the current stage to stop the enemy's offensive, prepare our army's counter-offensive, and strive for the final victory of the war of resistance. Chairman Chiang specially telegraphed the whole country on the 12th of this month (the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Eastern national revolution), calling on the sons and daughters of China. "To implement spiritual mobilization and swear to implement the National Covenant is, of course, to ask the whole country to shoulder the current urgent task together." The central government's National Spiritual Mobilization Program and its implementation measures have been published in various newspapers. We have specially listed three simple and clear common goals that are easy for everyone to know and practice: (1) The state is supreme, the nation is supreme, (2) Military first, victory first, (3) Concentration of will, concentration of strength, in order to promote the consistent acceptance of the people of the country, correct the life of drunkenness and death, cultivate the energetic spirit of development, eliminate the habits of living in peace, break the attempts of selfishness and self-interest, correct the thoughts of division and miscellaneous thoughts, and not violate the highest principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, and use the heart and strength of the whole country to dedicate to the cause of resisting the war and building the country. Various circles in various places have risen up to respond, making people feel the great and bright future of the country and the nation. However, in order to truly transition all the lively forces across the whole territory, and to practically focus on serving the cause of resisting the war and building the country, we believe that the first thing is to intensify the implementation of a democratic government with centralized leadership, so that the connection between the government and the people is closer, and the greatest strength of the anti-Japanese government can be brought into play. The great achievements of the National Political Participation Council, the only representative body of public opinion in the country, in holding three congresses have broken the cold attitude of a few people in the government and the general public towards the council, and it is recognized that it is sufficient to mobilize the strength of the whole people to assist the government, strive for the victory of the war of resistance, and lay the foundation for building a new China with democratic politics based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. It is even more necessary to speed up the establishment of the provincial and municipal councils as soon as possible, so as to become the true representative bodies of public opinion in all localities, carry forward the spirit of the National Political Participation Council, and complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country. Secondly, it is also necessary to expand and unify various mass movements, the main thing is to guarantee the freedom of all anti-Japanese mass groups and mass movements, and to establish the place of mass groups in law: it is necessary to create groups of peasants, youth, women, merchants and cultural circles, etc., to serve the war of resistance and national construction, and to unite and unify them according to region or occupation, and under the leadership of the government, do their best to assist the war of resistance and national construction.

### The Decline of Japanese Liberals (III)

Originally Published in "Asia Magazine"

They have received the assistance of the royal family, and perhaps even the military can be commanded by them. Now, although Japan's army and navy must select from the active servicemen and obtain the consent of both the army and the navy in advance, the Japanese emperor does not necessarily have to approve everyone they propose. Therefore, with the legal power that liberals possess in parliament, coupled with their potential influence inside and outside the government and next to the emperor, it is not difficult to break the current situation of military and police rule.

The undercurrent of the wheel is roughly like this, but it does not necessarily have the hope of realization. Once they encounter the attack of the stubborn fascists, they retreat without a fight, some go back to their hometowns, and some close their doors and remain silent. The debate at the last parliament was no less than a matter of face. Although they made impassioned speeches in the meeting place, everyone knew that as long as the government insisted on passing the budget, they would have to pass it. The result was that it really passed.

But this kind of retreat is not that simple. We cannot expect ordinary intellectuals to fight with the military and police. If a few old and infirm people really take out rusty pistols and fire a few shots, it will naturally be enough to spread the word for a lifetime, but what is the difference between that and suicide? The weapons of liberals, in Japan and elsewhere, are not power and guns at all.

A Japanese intellectual has obviously been influenced by international thought, has constant contact with foreigners, or has traveled around the world, but he is still a Japanese after all. There is no way to change the characteristics of his nation. Rousseau, Tolstoy, and Marx can only scratch his skin, but cannot change his arrogance. When you meet a semi-official Japanese propagandist or the leader of a Japanese business delegation in New York, you can treat him as another person. Because when he returns to Japan, he bows to thousands of idols or silk-wrapped gods and Buddhas, and when he becomes an official, he immediately runs to the shrine to report. When he returns home, he reads the newly published novel by Marno. He does not feel funny about these activities, but this dualism, constantly moving between the extremes of two spiritual lives, always makes a Japanese liberal feel bitter.

Japan is now desperately trying to restore the thoughts of the pre-Meiji era, which is of course contrary to liberalism. Since the two ideas cannot be reconciled, the result is that liberalism is silenced. Now, Japanese liberals have actually become so-called peace advocates. They think, but not necessarily, that they are hopeless. They still hope to realize their ideas, but now that national unity is so important, it is impossible for them to fight the fascist enemy.

The Japanese military is now going crazy, and only the minds of the liberals are still a little clearer. At this time, they need to come out and take on everything, to take on the responsibility of casting Japan's future, but they have given up this right. When people outside us rise up, they have lost their historical mission. In the future, when the people of Japan re-ignite the hope of freedom and happiness and revolt behind bayonets, they will no longer ask the liberals to lead them. (The End)

### Bloody Battle on Both Sides of the Xiang River; Our Large Army is Reinforcing in Multiple Routes; Major Victory in Surprise Attack on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] We are making favorable progress on all fronts. According to a telegram from Xiangyang, our troops achieved a major victory in a surprise attack on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway yesterday. They stormed into Xinyang Airport and Liulin, Jigongshan, and other places, burned and destroyed four or five aircraft, destroyed many sections of railway, and killed a large number of enemy troops, including their garrison commander, Yong Guangfu. After completing our mission, our troops safely returned to their original positions. In the Hubei Central theater, the enemy is taking a defensive posture in the areas of Zhongxiang and north of Yangzi Town, while shifting their main force south, attempting to cross the river at the opposite bank of Shayang or at Yuekou. For days, they have been harassing us, but have been repelled. As of the 18th, we are still fighting across the river. Our large army is reinforcing in multiple routes, and a major turning point will occur within days.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] In the past sixty hours, the Japanese army in central Hubei has collected a large number of civilian boats and rubber rafts in an attempt to forcibly cross the Xiang River, using heavy artillery to provide cover, but all attempts have failed.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 17th Dispatch] The enemy who attempted to sneak across the river into Sigang City in central Hubei has been completely annihilated by our forces.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] A telegram from Xi'an reports that the enemy is continuing to attack our guerrillas in the occupied areas. Clashes between the Communist and Nationalist forces in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, and Shandong provinces remain intense.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] A telegram from Shaanxi reports that our troops achieved a major victory in attacking Lishi in Shanxi. All important locations southwest of the county have been recovered. More than two hundred enemies at Jiaokou and more than one hundred at Hejiata have been annihilated. Lijiawan has been cleared, and more than ten enemy pillboxes have been destroyed by our forces. The enemy suffered more than three hundred casualties, leaving behind the bodies of four officers and over one hundred soldiers on the battlefield, as well as over one hundred thousand rounds of ammunition and a large amount of other military supplies. Our attack on the county town is underway.

[Our Newspaper, Chang'an, 17th Dispatch] The enemy at Baibao, northwest of Mancheng, were attacked and fled back to Mancheng on the 12th. Baibao has been recaptured by our forces.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th Dispatch] The enemy landing at Pingfeng Mountain seems to be attempting to cut off the communication of our Lushan guerrillas and ensure the safety of navigation on Poyang Lake, with no intention of in-depth advancement. The enemy attacking Xugang Bridge and Laoyemiao has greatly decreased. A small number of enemy troops were discovered on the Tiger Mountain side on the 15th and engaged in combat with our forces.

### American Reporter Observes the War Situation; The Enemy Has Lost the Ability to Invade; Our Military Strength in Jiangnan Is Extremely Strong; Guangxi Will Become the Second Shanxi

[Shanghai Correspondence] American news reporter Belden, who recently traveled through Central and Southern China, has just returned to Shanghai. According to general estimates by Chinese army officers, the Japanese army will not be able to launch another major offensive until next year. While the United States and others have not been able to determine Japan's subsequent actions, it is believed that Tokyo's primary concern today is to exert pressure on Britain and France to force China to end its resistance. If this fails, the Japanese army may begin an invasion of northern Yunnan, in order to cut off China's communications with the outside world.

If the Japanese army invades Guangxi, the province may become "the second Shanxi." In addition to the difficult terrain of Guangxi, the Japanese army will also encounter the firm resistance of the populace. The people of Guangxi are preparing to cope with any eventuality. As a precaution, important highways in the province have been greatly damaged, using methods like diverting rivers to submerge the roads. While this measure may not prevent the Japanese invasion, it will slow down their advance. Another measure taken by the province is to relocate the residents within five miles of the highways to other places, and to fully prepare for a second relocation upon receiving notice.

In the Third and Fourth War Zones south of the Yangtze River, there are one hundred divisions of Chinese regular and guerrilla forces, totaling one million men, standing in strict formation. In that area, there has been very little Japanese military activity for many days.

The guerrillas and regular forces in southern Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces have been reorganized, with an estimated strength of 150,000 men. Soon, they may become more active, especially around the Taihu Lake area. This area is under the command of General Gu Zhutong. After the Chinese army withdrew in the winter of 1937, he consolidated his troops. Although the area under Gu's command is not currently strategically important, it may become more important as the war progresses. Similarly, Zeng Guofan retreated to this area during the Taiping Rebellion, reorganized his troops, and ten years later, he led his troops and inflicted a fatal blow to the rebel army. Given that Nanjing, the economic and military base of the Japanese army and the seat of the puppet regime, is not far from this area, the area's importance is further increased.

Belden believes that Gu Zhutong is the most capable and loyal of Chiang Kai-shek's subordinates. The 87th Division, 88th Division, and later the 36th Division, which were formed from Gu's old troops, are among the most elite units of the Central Army. After Gu and his troops retreated to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area, many officers were sent to the interior for special training for half a year. During this period, they participated in combat exercises and received strategic training, using the training ground as a battlefield laboratory. Gu's troops have established several guerrilla areas. On the south bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, there are currently about 150,000 guerrillas, and new troops are joining and gradually strengthening them. The commander of all the guerrillas in Jiangsu Province is Leng Xin, a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, who will soon serve as a division commander in the Central Army and also concurrently serves as the civil affairs official of the area managed by his troops. Leng told Belden that the reorganization of the guerrillas has been completed and that mobile warfare in the area is expected to increase significantly. He also invited Belden to inspect his area of administration, but Belden declined due to a prior appointment.

Belden criticized the guerrilla situation, saying that it is a mistake to believe that the Chinese army has now completely switched to guerrilla warfare, and it is not in line with the facts. According to his estimate, of the one million soldiers in the Third War Zone he passed through, no more than 150,000 have been reorganized into guerrillas. Most guerrillas are reorganized and operated by officers who have received special training in the rear for half a year. Therefore, Belden believes that the activities of guerrillas in the guerrilla areas will increase.

### Zhengzhou Church Hospital Was Bombed and Destroyed by the Enemy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that the Shanghai Baptist Convention has received a report stating that the Baptist Hospital in Zhengzhou was bombed twice by Japanese aircraft yesterday, killing and injuring six people. The refugee shelter set up by the Baptist Church in Zhengzhou was also bombed, killing and injuring 200 people. However, no foreigners were killed or injured.

(2) Shang Wenli is appointed as a Counselor of the Judicial Yuan. (3) Wu Zhong is appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court.

### National Production Conference; Organized by Representatives from Various Agencies and Experts; Aims to Promote Production and Regulate Products

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan will convene a National Production Conference in early next month. The conference will be composed of representatives from various agencies and domestic production experts, and will be chaired by President Kong, with Economic Minister Weng Wenhao and Education Minister Chen Lifu serving as vice-chairmen, and Mu Guanchu, Chairman of the Agricultural Improvement Committee, serving as Secretary-General. The main significance of convening this conference is that those in charge of various production agencies deeply feel that during the war of resistance and national reconstruction, it is necessary to promote agricultural, industrial, and other business production, and to find ways to regulate products. At the same time, it will review past work, so that all production industries nationwide can become more prosperous and vigorous, in order to enhance our strength in the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

### Shanghai International Settlement; Searches Bookstores; Confiscates the Book "Japanese Spies"; Foreign Merchants Are Dissatisfied with the Enemy's Arbitrary Detention of Passengers

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that at 2:00 PM on the 17th, political detectives from the Special Branch of the Shanghai International Settlement, together with more than ten plainclothes personnel from the Japanese side, searched various bookstores and magazine companies on Fourth Avenue. The book "Japanese Spies," which was sold on consignment by the Shanghai Magazine Company and other stores, was completely confiscated. One or two copies of each of the other magazines were taken away. The search lasted for two hours before it was completed.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that the enemy is using Japanese security personnel to inspect foreign merchant ships and arbitrarily detain passengers, which has aroused great dissatisfaction among foreign merchants here. British shipping companies have reported to the government, requesting protests to Japan and effective assistance to customs to stop the illegal actions of the Japanese side. American companies will also take unified steps.

Dense Gunfire Heard in Western Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that on the mornings of the 16th and 17th, residents in western Shanghai heard clear and dense gunfire. On the afternoon of the 17th, an enemy aircraft flew from south to northwest. People believe it was caused by our guerrilla units operating actively in the suburbs of Shanghai.

### Guangdong People Are Rich in Patriotic Thought; Determined Not to Be Tempted by the Enemy, Willing to Suffer Trampling; Wu Tiecheng's Remarks in Chongqing

[Chongqing Airmail] The reporter met with Wu Tiecheng, the former chairman of Guangdong Province, in Chongqing a few days ago and had a long conversation. The reporter asked whether the various methods recently used by the Japanese army to attract residents after occupying Guangzhou City, which have included using Japanese merchant ships traveling to and from Macau without charging fares to persuade Guangzhou people seeking refuge abroad to return to the province, could be effective, given that there were few residents and the city was not easy to restore. Wu Chang replied, before the war of resistance, there were indeed 1.2 million residents in Guangzhou. After the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, the government advised the people to evacuate, and many people voluntarily went elsewhere to seek refuge. In July and August of last year, the city's population was less than 500,000. When the enemy army landed in Baiyasi Lake, the provincial government even issued orders and announcements forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate every day. By the day the enemy army entered Guangzhou, all the residents with a little property had fled, leaving behind only the poorest people. In November of last year, a survey by British, American, and French missionaries sheltering refugees in Guangzhou City found that only 50,000 people remained in Guangzhou City, of whom 17,000 had already been sheltered in safe zones and only 33,000 were displaced. Subsequently, I strictly ordered the counties close to the war zone to implement a political blockade against the enemy, prohibiting people from entering Guangzhou, and cutting off the import of all daily necessities needed by the Japanese. The enemy army is trapped by us and cannot avoid using tricks and appeasement policies to deceive us, such as not buying tickets to take boats, etc. However, the people of Guangdong are rich in patriotic thought, have a strong sense of national identity, and will never be tempted by the enemy. Moreover, the enemy army's various atrocities are appalling, and the people of Guangdong will never be willing to be trampled on. I dare to assert that the enemy army will be trapped to death in the city, and will eventually collapse after a long time. [Central News Agency]

### Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet to Be Replaced

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, returned to the United States last month. His successor is Rear Admiral Hart, Chairman of the US Navy's General Board. Hart is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of May or the beginning of June.

### Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Kidnapped; Still Not Found; Reports of Escape on the Way to Tanggu Are Incorrect

[Reuters, Tianjin, 18th Dispatch] According to the latest information, Mr. Diadia, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, who was kidnapped yesterday, has not yet been found. A previous report said that Diadia was found 12 miles from Tianjin on the way to Tanggu.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 18th Dispatch] The news that Diadia, who was kidnapped yesterday, has been freed was caused by an erroneous phone call from a sentry. The sentry said that he had seen a car carrying three Chinese and one European on the way to Tanggu and wanted to inspect it, but the driver of the car refused to stop.

### National General Mobilization Law Is Gradually Implemented; Japanese Merchants and Civilians Suffer More and More; Five-Year Military Expansion Plan to Begin

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] Tokyo Foreign News: The Japanese government today announced the implementation of Article 19 of the National General Mobilization Law and stipulated that those who violate the article will be punished with imprisonment of up to twelve months or a fine of up to 1,000 yen. With the implementation of Article 19, Article 33 will also be implemented in conjunction. According to the original text of Article 19 of the Japanese General Mobilization Law, "When the government deems it necessary for national general mobilization in wartime, it may issue necessary orders regarding prices, transportation fees, storage fees, rental fees, and processing fees in accordance with the provisions of the Imperial Edict." Article 33 states, "When it is deemed necessary for national general mobilization, the government may, in accordance with the provisions of the order, collect reports from those who are in charge, and when necessary, conduct on-site inspections of the business status, books, documents, and other items."

### International Anti-Aggression League; Resolutions of the Seventh Congress; Demands That All Countries Fulfill Their League of Nations Obligations; Capacity to Cooperate and Assist China in Its War of Resistance

[Chongqing Airmail] The International Anti-Aggression Movement held its Seventh Congress in London on February 18th and 19th. Sir Cecil, Mr. Gutteridge, and former French Prime Minister Peng Gu chaired the congress and passed a number of resolutions, including aid to China and Spain. China has now received a copy of all the resolutions, which have been translated into Chinese. The details are noted below:

General Resolution

Three years ago, when the dignity of law in Abyssinia was being undermined, the Anti-Aggression Movement came into being. Today, such acts of destruction are continuing in various places: in Austria, in Czechoslovakia, in Spain, and in China. Tomorrow, there may be more threats and acts of violence.

Even the Anglo-Italian Agreement and the Munich Agreement have been violated. Only by returning to the League of Nations and the principles of international law upheld by the International Anti-Aggression Movement can we avoid falling into a state of chaos again.

Czech Part

This Congress is deeply dissatisfied with the wanton acts inflicted on Czechoslovakia and the damage to democratic creeds and peaceful behavior. It declares that the political and economic independence of Czechoslovakia must be maintained and calls on all governments to provide all necessary assistance to this end.

Spanish part

This Congress reiterates its condemnation of foreign aggression against Spain and its legitimate government. It is concerned about the bankruptcy of the non-interference policy due to the failure of certain governments to fulfill their promise of non-interference. This Congress wishes to arouse the attention of all parties.

This Congress earnestly hopes that the terror and brutality that are destroying Spain will end, and protests against all pressure to force the legitimate government of Spain to surrender unconditionally.

This Congress calls on the world to oppose any recognition of a new government, in law or in fact, that violates the provisions of international law.

This Congress calls on countries dedicated to justice and peace to do everything in their power to seek a solution based on the following three principles:

1. The political and economic independence of Spain.

2. The immediate withdrawal of foreign troops and foreign domination from Spain.

3. Ensure that no Spaniard is mistreated or harassed because of the political attitude they have taken during the civil war.

This Congress believes that France will be able to treat the military and civilians who have sought refuge within its borders well, in accordance with its consistent noble traditions.

China part

This Congress reiterates its past resolutions, with particular attention to boycotting goods from Japanese aggressors.

This Congress calls on governments to implement the resolutions of the League of Nations General Assembly and the Council, which specifically propose that member states should avoid any actions that may hinder China's war of resistance and individually implement the various provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant.

This Congress demands that all countries ban the transportation of all arms and military supplies to Japan and jointly agree to refuse all Japanese imports. This Congress urges its national branches to redouble their efforts to ensure that governments and private organizations provide effective assistance to China, such as the recent loans to China from the United Kingdom and the United States, although they still seem to be pending.

Given China's courageous resistance, if the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union can work together to effectively stop Japan's aggression, while providing China with the assistance it deserves, and refusing loans to the aggressor, as well as the necessary supplies to maintain the war, then the victory against aggression is now.

Conference on Peace Organization

In order to resolve future economic and political disputes, this Congress expresses its opposition to the methods adopted in the recent past, as these methods are only sufficient to foster the principle of intimidation and violence over the law. This unfortunate method has prompted most of the world to advocate convening a conference to be attended by all countries to jointly discuss various economic and political issues.

This Congress warmly supports the significance of this conference and believes that the purpose and methods of this conference are extremely important and should be given special study. Therefore, this Congress will convene a special meeting of personnel to discuss it. It will be convened as soon as the Secretariat and the officers of this Congress receive the necessary documents.

Indian part

This Congress recognizes the statement of the Indian Legislative Assembly that its vote to withdraw from the League of Nations does not express hostility to the international community, but is a protest against abandoning the principles of the League of Nations. This Congress insists that only by implementing the principles of the League of Nations to ensure world peace and democracy can the League of Nations expect the support of India and other valley regions.

Liaison issues

This Congress urges the Secretariat of the General Assembly and the Secretariats of the various branches to seek closer communication between the major branches of this movement. In particular, the four branches in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the war zones should pay special attention.

Lectures, travel, and education work

This Congress urges the Secretariat of the General Assembly to organize a complete lecture tour, dispatching a large team to the Americas, as well as Scandinavia, the Baltic, and Central European countries to promote the International Anti-Aggression Movement.

The Congress urges the national branches to redouble their efforts to educate the public on the principles of the International Anti-Aggression Movement and the significance of upholding the dignity of the law. [Central News Agency]

### Veteran Yunnan General Fan Shisheng Assassinated; The Assassin Surrendered Himself to the Police Station; According to His Confession, the Motive Was to Avenge His Father; Yunnan Provincial Authorities Are Paying Close Attention

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 17th Dispatch] (Delayed) General Fan Shisheng, a famous Yunnan general, has been involved in revolutionary work for many years. Recently, due to the reorganization of the army, he relinquished his military power and returned to his hometown to practice medicine. At 4:30 PM on the 17th, he was on his way to a consultation when he was assassinated and killed. The assassins, Yang Weiqian and Yang Weixiang, were arrested on the spot. It is reported that the Yangs are the sons of Yang, the former commander of the Yunnan Army, who was killed by Fan. This act was to avenge their father. He Yingqin telegraphed Long Yun to offer condolences and inquire about the interrogation of the case.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th Dispatch] Regarding the assassination case of Fan Shisheng, it is reported that the assassin has surrendered himself to the police station and issued a written statement stating his motive for avenging his father. The police station has now transferred the assassin to the court for trial. Fan's remains were moved to his private residence on the evening of the 17th and placed in a coffin. His family has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report the circumstances of Fan's assassination and requested that the murderer be punished according to the law. Fan was 53 years old, graduated from the special class of the Yunnan General Camp School, and successively served as the battalion commander of the First Artillery Battalion of the Northern Expeditionary Army, the chief of the advisory office of the Yunnan Kaiwu General Xing Shu, the commander of the 16th Regiment of the Army Infantry, the commander of the Second Army of the Yunnan Army stationed in Guangdong, the commander of the 16th Army of the National Revolutionary Army, the commander of the Xiangfan Garrison, and the commander of the 51st Division, and a member of the National Anti-Smoking Committee. His mother is over eighty years old and still alive, and his wife is currently living in Shanghai. He left behind two daughters and one son (only four years old), and his family is very poor.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th Dispatch] The authorities here are paying close attention to the Fan case. According to reports, the assassin Yang Weiqian's father, the late military officer Yang Zhen, was once a classmate and colleague of Fan. When Yang was a regimental commander, Fan was his deputy. Until 1925, when Yang was the commander of Fan's advance detachment, stationed in Nanning, Fan and Yang lived in the same room. Yang was stabbed to death by mutinous soldiers, while Fan survived. Therefore, Yang's son suspected that his father's death was orchestrated by Fan. According to his written statement, the motive for this assassination was purely to avenge his father.

### From Shashi to Xiangfan

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Geng Ya

The car set off from Shashi at dawn when the leftover snow hadn't melted and dark clouds gathered, powerfully heading towards Xiangfan, northern Hubei. We had replenished with cheap gasoline in Shashi to cover the round trip. I heard that fruit in Xiangfan was very expensive. The Sichuan oranges that sold for fifty or sixty for a yuan in Shashi could be sold for a dime apiece there. The driver bought a lot of Sichuan oranges and stuffed them in the car, hoping to make a small fortune. However, the car was overloaded and kept "chuchu" making sounds of protest, making the passengers feel sorry for it, predicting that it would break down sooner or later.

After driving more than ten jia, we arrived at Jingzhou (Jiangling). The car entered from the east gate and exited from the north gate. Looking at the high, thick, and majestic city walls, the winding, green moat, and the many lively guards, it was clear that this ancient city was fully prepared to exert its glorious historical power to resist foreign aggression. The city was full of tung trees and willows, with lotus flowers and green algae everywhere; however, the corner the car passed through was desolate grassland. During the Three Kingdoms period, Guan Yu, a famous general of the Han Dynasty, guarded Jingzhou. First, he used his combat skills to subdue Wu and Wei, and then he lost the opportunity because of arrogance, which became a regret for readers of history for thousands of years. The "Guan Yu Temple" still preserves one of his relics - a belt; "Chengtian Temple" has a large pot, more than ten feet in diameter, which is said to be military supplies used by Guan Yu in those years. The abbots of the two temples vigorously promoted the divine spirits, and the incense has always been very prosperous. After the war, many people went to worship and pray. However, the city was also tragically bombed by enemy planes, resulting in more than twenty civilian casualties. This shows that ethereal divine spirits cannot provide realistic blessings against the harm of war. Our compatriots who generally believe in divine spirits should be thoroughly aware: quickly move the sincerity of respecting ghosts and gods and respecting heaven and earth to respecting the heroic soldiers fighting on the front lines! Move the money for worshipping gods, buying incense, firecrackers, and sacrifices to buying guns and bullets to fight the enemy! This is truly a realistic way to protect oneself and one's descendants!

We arrived at Jingmen and stopped to eat. We met Staff Officer Jiang XX from the XXX division who had just returned from the front lines. According to him, the war situation in central Hubei was briefly as follows: "The enemy in central Hubei frequently invades westward, their purpose is to expand the Pinghan defense line, consolidate the defensive strongholds in Jingshan and Bo City, and prevent our guerrillas from attacking, as well as a large-scale counterattack. However, their forces are limited. When we meet them head-on, if they do not collapse, they will be in a stalemate. In places such as Yuekou and Tianmen, the enemy and I have fought fiercely since spring, gaining and losing several times. Our army is mostly new and sharp, and every battle is extremely brave. Although sacrifices are inevitable, we can definitely prevent the enemy from advancing." Mr. Jiang can be said to have given a complete overview of the recent war situation in central Hubei.

After driving another twenty li, near Nanqiao, on a small slope, the car, as expected, asked for sick leave - it broke down! The driver repaired it with freezing hands in the snow and wind; after two hours of repairs, it was still unsuccessful. The passengers, unable to endure the biting cold wind for long, began to sing in unison, giving the driver some "reverse praise"!

At that time, twenty or thirty wounded soldiers who had just been carried from the front lines, with honorable wounds, were shivering and sleeping on stretchers made of green bamboo, hemp rope, and straw by the common people. Under the dual attack of wounds and severe cold, they were so miserable that they couldn't even groan. They shed blood for the country on the front lines like this, and after being wounded, they had to suffer from cold and hardship like this. Can we compatriots in the rear, warm and well-fed, really be indifferent?

Who knew that our driver, not blinded by profit, generously donated - two baskets of Sichuan oranges upon seeing the miserable situation of the wounded soldiers, and entrusted an "old villager" to carry them heavily with the stretcher team. That night, because the repair was too late, we stayed overnight in Nanqiao, but the passengers had no complaints. The public outrage that had made them want to "beat the drums and attack" the driver had already happily left with the heavily loaded Sichuan oranges, although the car's load was not excessively lightened as a result.

While repairing the car on the small slope, we saw many convoys training in Nanqiao Town from afar; when we entered the town at dusk to find lodging, we didn't see a single soldier. Later, we understood the mystery. If we had to say it here, there would only be four words for one night's encampment: "Advance one step."

The old folks in the town had already learned a lot of valuable lessons from the current realities of the enemy's actions. Chatting with them, some said to me: "This time the war is different from the previous infighting for the country. We can only win, not lose. If the ending is a defeat, it will be terrible! Our fields and houses will be permanently occupied by the Japanese enemy. But—but our equipment is a bit lacking."

"What's so terrible about that!" another抢着 said: "Like you gentlemen (referring to reporters), today's car broke down on the small slope. Repair it, patch it, and it will eventually climb up the slope. If you let go halfway, the car will hurt your own people. The enemy's equipment is a bit more powerful, but now if we don't risk our lives to defeat him, it will be even worse later!" There is quite a bit of the idea of "If you don't destroy the snake, what will happen when it becomes a dragon?"

Some told me: How good our troops are, such as paying for the grain they eat; carrying things for them and transporting the wounded soldiers. No less than five dimes a day...—These sound like everyday things, but in reality, they are great evidence of military-civilian cooperation that will surely lead to victory!

The next morning, we set off, passed Yicheng, stopped for a moment, and continued north, arriving in Xiangyang at four o'clock in the afternoon. The leader of the ferry across the Xiang River (i.e., the Hanshui River) to Fan said: The ferry time every day is stipulated from * o'clock in the afternoon to * o'clock in the evening; at other times, the ferry stops due to air raid prevention. Single people can use small boats to come and go. He also said; Usually, those who make a living by boating are very afraid of military service. Now he himself is requesting to serve the national crisis. The "authorities" know that he is skilled in the water and do not dislike that he is an old man in his fifties. He was also issued a full body armor and overcoat, and does the same patriotic work as the young brothers. He feels it is the most prestigious thing in his life. When the ferry sailed to the other side, and turned back, we saw large slogans written on the walls of Xiangyang City by the Korean Brave Team: "Koreans and Chinese, Unite!" It really makes people feel mentally excited.

### Germany's Breach of Contract - Britain and France Will Never Recognize It - Chamberlain's Speech Was Filled with Grief and Indignation - Denouncing Hitler's Inhumanity and Injustice

[Reuters, London, 18th] The cabinet held a cabinet meeting this afternoon. Chamberlain rushed back from Birmingham to participate. The German and American ambassadors went to the Foreign Office today. Foreign Secretary Halifax paid a visit to the King at Buckingham Palace yesterday. The American Ambassador Kennedy and the opposition leader Atlee also visited the Foreign Secretary one after another.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Britain has instructed its ambassador to Germany, Henderson, to notify the German government that Britain believes Germany's actions completely violate the Munich Agreement and that the changes caused by Germany's military actions have no legal basis.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] France has instructed its ambassador to Germany to notify the German government that France does not recognize Germany's forced intervention in Czechoslovakia as legitimate. Some newspapers believe that the French ambassador to Germany will also be recalled to provide a report, just like Britain. It is generally believed that this is a very appropriate way to express disagreement with Germany's violation of promises without resorting to the extreme measure of severing diplomatic relations.

[Reuters, London, 17th] The British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Henderson, was ordered to return to the country from Berlin tonight to provide a report to the Prime Minister. Before leaving Berlin, the ambassador will visit the German Under-Secretary of State and is expected to depart on Saturday evening. At the same time, a Reuters interviewer learned from a senior responsible party that the government has ordered British banks to restrict the transfer of Czech deposits in London, and a statement on this matter may be issued in the House of Commons on Monday.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The news that the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Henderson, is returning to London has been received with great satisfaction here. It is believed that although this move by Britain is slightly late, it has finally taken the same path as President Roosevelt's actions last November.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham today, the final section of which was received with enthusiastic cheers and applause from the audience. The section read, "I am willing to sacrifice almost anything for the sake of peace, with only one exception: the freedom that we have enjoyed for hundreds of years can never be abandoned. Although I do not want my country to be bound by unclear new obligations, it would be a supreme mistake to think that my country will not exert its full strength to resist provocation. I make this statement with the firm belief that it will not only gain the sympathy and support of the men and women of my country, but also the support of the entire empire and all peace-loving and freedom-loving nations." The Prime Minister began by saying, "The events that have taken place in Europe have relegated all other matters to a position of insignificance. I believe that what you want to hear now is the British government's feelings about the nature and meaning of these events. One thing is undoubtedly certain: the people of the world have been shocked this time as never before. Even what Germany has done in the past has never caused such a deep impression on people's hearts. Although it is impossible to predict how it will affect the future, it can be said with certainty that it will have a significant impact." The Prime Minister continued, "This Wednesday, due to a lack of information, I had to maintain an overly cautious and restrained attitude. When I thought I could only make a few comments, this calm and objective expression easily caused misunderstandings from the outside world. Some people thought that because I spoke calmly at the time, I did not feel the seriousness of the problem. I hope that tonight's speech can dispel this misunderstanding." Chamberlain went on to address outside accusations that the German occupation of Czechoslovakia was a direct result of his visit to Germany last autumn, because this event has torn up the Munich Agreement without leaving any traces, which shows that Chamberlain's previous trip was a mistake. Chamberlain argued, "Some people in the outside world think that this behavior is the Prime Minister's personal policy, so the fate of Czechoslovakia should be borne by the Prime Minister. In fact, this is not a very reasonable conclusion. My primary purpose in visiting Germany was because the situation at the time was extremely critical. The trip was the only way to avoid a European war. This primary purpose has been achieved, and European peace has been restored. If there had been no such trip, millions of families would be mourning the heroic flowers of Europe today. In fact, I don't need to defend my previous trip to Germany. I ask, if there had been no such trip, what other way could have been followed? No matter what actions we, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries took at the time, we could not have saved Czechoslovakia from aggression and destruction. Even if we finally participated in a war to punish Germany, all parties would have suffered terrible damage. Even if we won, we could not restore Czechoslovakia in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. I went to Munich to carry out the so-called European appeasement policy. If this policy had been successful, no country would have attempted to rule Europe alone, but each country could have satisfied its necessary conveniences to develop its resources and share international trade, and improve the livelihoods of its citizens." Chamberlain went on to mention Hitler's guarantee in Munich that the Sudetenland was his last territorial demand in Europe. This guarantee was later reaffirmed at the Berlin Sports Palace, "In view of Hitler's repeated guarantees, I had a hope that once the Czech problem was resolved, just like the solution in Munich, the European appeasement policy could be further promoted. Even so, I still dare not relax my vigilance until all countries also establish and accept this policy. Therefore, after the Munich Agreement, our country's national defense plan was accelerated in order to make up for the weaknesses shown during the crisis. I firmly believe that after the Munich Agreement, most people in the country share the hope I hold and earnestly hope that this policy will be further promoted. However, today, seeing this hope so completely destroyed, I also express disappointment and indignation with the people of the country. How can this event be compared with the guarantees I made to you? As a signatory to the Munich Agreement, I should be ordered to participate in the various provisions of the Munich Declaration. However, things are not like that. Hitler insisted on his own way, and even before the Czech President had obtained his irresistible demands, the German army had already mobilized. A few hours later, it had already entered the Czech capital." Chamberlain then described the position of Czechoslovakia under German rule, saying, "Who can not give heartfelt and supreme sympathy to such a heroic people, once tragically wounded, whose freedom has been reduced, and whose national independence has been destroyed? Where is the promise that there will be no more territorial ambitions? Where is the promise that 'Germany does not want to annex Czechoslovakia'? When I talked to Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Hitler insisted on national self-determination as a principle, but what will he say now? It is still difficult to believe that these repeatedly stated solemn guarantees are prone to problems. What kind of credible guarantees do we still have in this same area? The events of this week completely violate the treaties that Germany itself has made, which has made us all not know what to believe. Is this the end of an old danger, or the beginning of a new one? Is this the final attack on small countries, or will it continue to happen? And is this fact a further step in the attempt to rule the world by force? These are all extremely serious questions that I do not intend to answer tonight, and I believe that this really requires extremely serious consideration, not only by Germany's neighbors, but also by countries outside Europe. The facts show that everything has begun and there is a possibility of accelerating the promotion. We can only shift our attention to the various states of the Empire and France, which cooperates closely with us. We should review our strength in a responsible manner, because this is also extremely necessary. Our review cannot be neglected, therefore, the safety of the country is loaded, with this eye, make a detailed inspection of every department of the national lifeline." Then the Prime Minister concluded with the aforementioned remarks. Finally, Chamberlain added, "We don't have to panic and be disappointed. Our country is now a great strength and a strong country, even stronger than six months ago. Sooner or later, inhumanity, injustice and faithless atrocities will eventually eat their own fruits. All these events are enough to create a future crisis for Germany itself. I dare to predict that one day Germany will deeply regret the mistakes of its government."

British and American Comments

[Reuters, London, 18th] Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham yesterday was unanimously praised by the British newspapers. Generally, it focused on three points: 1. They were all filled with emotion for the Prime Minister's condemnation of Hitler's breach of contract without the slightest compromise. 2. They unanimously hoped that the facts would follow the Prime Minister's words and cause Hitler to have some scruples in his future actions. 3. They believed that the Prime Minister's expression of being deceived by Hitler was indeed a fact, so the Prime Minister should not bear the sole blame for this incident. Regarding the last point, the right-wing "Daily Express" demanded that the Prime Minister resign immediately, while the Times said, "Chamberlain has the same grief and disappointment about the illegal occupation of Czechoslovakia and the destruction of international covenants by the tyrannical German army."

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech last night was quite gratifying here. The New York Times said, "Chamberlain's speech was published at the same time as the statement of the US State Department, which has a very deep meaning." The "Herald Tribune" said, "The Munich policy has now come to an end, and it is replaced by a policy of expanding the army and resisting provocations."

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th] The German government refused to comment on Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, only saying that the government had not yet made a meticulous study of the contents of Chamberlain's speech, so it was not yet time to express its opinions.

### The United States Issues an Official Statement - Condemning Germany's Illegal Acts - Roosevelt Said a New Neutrality Act Must Be Established - Large-Scale Taxation of German Goods Will Be Implemented

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] President Roosevelt said that based on the recent developments in Europe, we can see that the United States must formulate a new neutrality act. As for the drafting of the bill, it can be decided by the government holding several meetings. The President continued to refer reporters to his message to Congress on January 4th. According to the President's message, the current Neutrality Act sometimes helps the culprits who create wars. The United States can rely on methods that are more advanced than verbal protests to curb aggressive actions without resorting to war.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] US Undersecretary of State Welles, with President Roosevelt's permission, issued an official statement today condemning Germany's "illegal acts," mentioning Germany's abuse of "arbitration power" to occupy Czechoslovakia, saying that "Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia is a temporary deprivation of the freedom of independent and free nations. Since the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic, the American people have maintained a particularly close and friendly relationship with it." Welles concluded by declaring, "Such illegal acts and abuse of violence endanger world peace and the institutions of modern civilization." It was also declared here that the Undersecretary of State's indictment of Germany's seizure of Czechoslovakia focused on legalistic overtones rather than diplomatic euphemisms. A spokesman close to the government said, "We don't want to hear the sophistry of aggression again. People in the world are now at least well aware of our position."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman gave a speech in the Senate today, severely attacking Germany, saying that Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia further proves Hitler's ambition to rule the land by force, thinking that wherever force can reach, he will try to occupy it. The recent trends show that Germany, Italy, and Japan are working together to achieve their goals, so Latin America is inevitably threatened. Since the situation is so serious, we should immediately prepare to take political and practical actions.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Senator King gave a speech in the Senate today, saying that "the attitude of Britain and France is to condone the slaughter of Czechoslovakia." He said that he very much hoped that the United States would sever relations with all "aggressive" countries.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The US Treasury Department announced that the US government has cancelled the most-favored-nation treatment for Czech imports from today. In the future, large-scale taxation will be implemented on goods imported from Germany.

### People in Warsaw March Against Germany

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 17th] More than 1,000 people here held an anti-German demonstration again at noon today.

### Palestine Conference in a Stalemate - Jewish Delegation Decides to Disband

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Jewish Telegraphic Agency said that it had notified Colonial Secretary MacDonald that the Jewish delegation had considered the British government's proposal for Palestine. The proposal was the basis for the establishment of an agreement. The Jewish delegation has decided to disband it. Reuters learned from authoritative sources that the Arab representatives at the meeting with British government representatives this afternoon opposed the principles contained in the British suggestions, that is, the Jewish people rejected the right to establish an Arab state. They also opposed an indefinite transition period, the length of which depends on the degree of cooperation between Jews and Arabs. They declared that unless these main obstacles are removed, it is useless to discuss detailed plans. They demanded that the British government immediately abandon the principle in order to peacefully resolve the Palestine issue. It is expected that the Palestinian Arab representatives will issue a statement soon.

### Hitler Returns Home, Issues Economic Ultimatum to Romania, Tension in Memel

[Reuters, Vienna, 18th] Hitler left here at 10:30 this morning, destination unknown. The people of Vienna were ordered to turn out and cheer him off. When he returns to Berlin, the people of Berlin will also be prepared for a grand welcome, it is said.

[Reuters, Vienna, 17th] Hitler arrived in Vienna today. Officials announced that he will return to Berlin tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] According to a dispatch from the Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent, Germany has issued an "economic ultimatum" to Romania, the contents of which are: (1) Romania should gradually be developed as an agricultural country; (2) Germany should have exclusive rights to all of Romania's exports, such as oil, grain, timber, cattle, and food. However, these conditions have been rejected by the Romanian government. Currently, all Romanian political parties are setting aside their private views and are united against external forces, it is said.

[Reuters, Memel, 17th] The new German chairman of the Memel administrative council, Mr. Boettcher, told a Reuters reporter today, "We hope that the Lithuanian government will allow Memel to return to Germany. The Lithuanian government is well aware of our economic situation and has repeatedly broken its promises. We have endured for fifteen years. Even today, we still do not resort to violent acts. We do not carry weapons in order to maintain the pure and self-loving nature of the Germans. We know that the Lithuanian government cannot fulfill our hopes, especially in economic terms, so we hope they will allow us to return to Germany."

Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia, German Appointee

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Mr. Haban, the Czech minister to the United States, has refused the Czech order to hand over the Czech embassy and consulates in the United States to German representatives. He stated that President Hácha's surrender was invalid because it was unconstitutional.

Italian Newspapers Put On a Brave Face

[Central News Agency, Rome] The newspaper "Il Telegrafo," a mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Ciano, published an editorial yesterday entitled "Italy's Attitude," stating that the British and French newspapers are deceiving themselves by thinking that Hitler's success is enough to weaken the relationship between the German and Italian axes. In fact, this is completely wrong. The two countries on either side of the Alps are indispensable to each other. Although Germany has realized its plans on the continent, it will never disregard Italy. In order to confront the common front of all countries in the world, Germany must unite with Italy. Therefore, the increase in Germany's power and prestige is a cause for great joy in Italy.

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] A large Japanese contingent sent a telegram to Hitler stating, "On behalf of my government, I would like to extend my congratulations to Your Excellency on this unprecedented success."

### Portugal and Spain Sign Non-Aggression Pact

Communist deputy Billoux initiated this debate with emotional language, and strongly attacked the French government's handling of the Munich Agreement and the Czech situation. Amid cheers from the Communist and Socialist parties, he demanded the resignation of French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet, saying, "Only in this way can the country move towards stability." Right-wing deputies responded with jeers and shouted "Long live Daladier." Many Radical Socialists remained silent. Then, former cabinet member Frossard spoke, and with eloquent words, he appealed for national unity.

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] Soviet Russian Deputy Defense Minister Mandani recently gave a speech at the Communist Party Congress, stating that Soviet Russian industry is fully prepared to deal with chemical warfare. "If a dictatorship uses chemical warfare against us, we will retaliate with chemical warfare. Chemistry has become a major weapon in war, but Soviet Russia does not want to use this weapon against others, unless someone uses it against us first, then the responsibility cannot be borne by us."

Brief Commentary

### ×× Appeals from Various Circles in Shanghai

An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 18th stated that various Shanghai organizations have jointly telegraphed Chongqing, appealing to the National Government to protest to the British, French, and American authorities regarding the deprivation of the rights of Chinese residents in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. We should express our enthusiastic support for this urgent appeal from our compatriots in Shanghai and seek its early success.

However, we should also pay attention to the following points: First, in addition to the Chinese people, the invasion of China by Japan has also caused very serious damage to the interests of the British, American, and French countries in the Far East. In particular, since Britain and France have implemented a policy of compromise and concession towards the German and Italian aggressors in Europe, they have further allowed Japan to seize every inch of land in the Far East and become increasingly rampant. The recent Japanese oppression of the Shanghai concessions is one of the most obvious examples of this. Therefore, we must point out that this is the result of the British and French policy of compromise. Britain and France must urgently abandon this policy in order to protect their interests in the Far East. Otherwise, any concession or compromise towards the Japanese will only serve the aggressors and result in increasing the shackles of their own suffering!

Second, the latest facts of the Japanese oppression of the Shanghai concession authorities depriving our compatriots of their rights are: (1) On the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, compatriots in the French Concession raised the flag at half-mast, which was interfered with; (2) The concession authorities allowed the Japanese army to search and arrest our compatriots in the International Settlement and the French Concession. Here, we should point out that (1) the concession authorities' act of depriving our compatriots of their due rights has violated the concession regulations; (2) the concession authorities are suspected of committing illegal acts of disrespect towards our country; (3) the concession authorities are suspected of protecting the illegal acts of the Japanese army in the concession.

Third, we believe that the recent unfortunate incidents in the Shanghai concessions of repeatedly depriving our compatriots of their rights are by no means the intention of the concession authorities, nor are they tolerated by the friendly countries of Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, on the one hand, we demand that the friendly countries of Britain, the United States, and France quickly investigate the root cause of such incidents in the Shanghai concessions and give them a severe punishment so that our compatriots residing in Shanghai can enjoy their due rights. On the other hand, we must also prevent the development of any sentiment of hostility towards any friendly country, so as not to fall into the plot of the Japanese!

Fourth, we hope that the government will accept the appeal of various Shanghai organizations regarding the unfortunate incidents of the Shanghai concessions oppressing our compatriots, lodge a serious protest with Britain, the United States, and France, and demand a prompt and fair resolution. At the same time, we hope that public opinion at home and abroad will pay close attention to this and do its best to arouse international righteous people to sympathize with our appeal and unanimously demand that their governments seek a thorough solution.

### After the Partition of Czechoslovakia, Will Germany and Hungary Reach a Compromise? (Part 1)

— Dong Pingduo

The Inside Story of Hungary's Seizure of Ruthenia

Czechoslovakia was divided, and Germany's swallowing was not something that a single "Munich Agreement" could stop. This is something everyone understands. However, Hungary also took advantage of the fire to rob and seize Carpathian Ruthenia—also known as Little Russia—which seems to be quite unexpected. But the occurrence of the fact is by no means accidental; everything has its background and evolution.

As far back as the era of Imperial Russia, all of the Ukrainian lands were under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Imperial Russia. At that time, the Ukrainians were already brewing an independence movement, which was naturally not allowed by Imperial Russia, and they often carried out large-scale arrests and exiles to Siberia. Therefore, many Ukrainian leaders fled to the Ukrainian territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where they established the "Ukrainian Information Bureau," which specialized in anti-Russian activities.

When Imperial Russia was overthrown and the Bolsheviks came to power, the Ukrainian independence elements believed that the opportunity had come, so they formed a "United Association to Build Ukraine and Destroy Russia." They moved into Russian-held Ukraine and established a "Central Committee" in Kiev, declaring Ukraine's independence. Their actions were supported by many anti-communist forces.

But, of course, the Soviet Union was unwilling to lose this fertile Ukrainian land; therefore, it launched a military counterattack, but was defeated by the invading German-Austrian Allied Forces. The German-Austrian Allied Forces thus protected Ukrainian independence, supporting Cossack General Skoropadsky as the leader.

When the Great War ended and Germany and Austria were defeated, Skoropadsky had to step down, and he was replaced by a figure closer to the Allied Powers, namely the devil Petliura.

Petliura's opening was very impressive: he issued a declaration announcing the union of Romanian-held Ukraine and Austro-Hungarian-held Ukraine; his new Ukrainian national plan included Galicia, Bukovina, Bessarabia, and Carpathia.

The current Ukrainians still remember Petliura's reign of terror with lingering fear. His cruelty and tyranny far exceeded that of Hitler, and he was equally obsessed with cruelty; he commanded a large army and specialized in brutalizing Jewish residents.

Later, Petliura was finally brought to justice, his dream of a Greater Ukraine collapsed, and he fled into exile in Paris, where he was shot and killed by a Polish-Jewish poet in 1936. The killer was called Samuel Schwarzbard, and he said in court: "My twelve close relatives all died at his hands." As a result, all of France said: "The criminal is not the killer, but the one who was killed." As a result, this hero was freed.

This is how Petliura died, and his dream of Ukrainian independence also died long ago. At that time, few Ukrainians still thought about independence.

The Soviet Union immediately seized back the old Russian-held Ukraine, and as a result of the treaty, western Ukraine was given to Poland; Bessarabia and Bukovina were given to Romania; and Carpathian Ruthenia, originally in Hungarian hands, was ceded to Czechoslovakia. In this way, Petliura's dream of a Greater Ukraine was divided among five countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Hungary.

In fact, if Hitler had not harbored thoughts of covetousness, the Ukrainian problem could have been considered over. But after Hitler came to power, he vigorously supported the Ukrainian independence plan, because only in that way could he obtain the rich Ukraine from the Soviet Union, and then divide Poland and conquer Czechoslovakia.

Hitler naturally still used the old Nazi methods. He found that there were still a small number of Ukrainians who were longing for the independence of their homeland. It was naturally easy to organize them into a useful gang. Thus, in Danzig, a "Central Committee for Preparing for Ukrainian Independence" was established, presided over by a Ukrainian army general named Tsylnyk, who had served in the era of Imperial Russia.

This "Central Committee" immediately began work, agitating the Ukrainians in Poland. At the same time, it organized Ukrainian stormtroopers, everything was modeled after Germany: however, the brown uniforms were changed to light green, and the name was changed to "Siczy Guards."

At first, Tsylinsky carried out this work completely secretly, because at that time, Germany and Poland still maintained friendly relations with each other. But recently, everything has been revealed. After the Munich Agreement, the Siczy Guards formally took on the police duties of Carpathian Ukraine.

Thus, Tsydusky moved the "Central Committee" to Hust, the capital of Carpathian Ukraine, the pillar of the Greater Ukrainian movement. Under the support of German strength and economic assistance, and in accordance with Hitler's orders, he was responsible for leading the Greater Ukrainian movement.

At the same time, Hitler repeated his old trick and established a Ukrainian headquarters in Berlin. He appointed a former Petliura subordinate army officer named Suzuk as the leader; he organized many assassination squads and sent them to Poland and the Soviet Union, where they carried out large-scale activities, and incidents occurred one after another. They carried the blue and yellow flag, the same as the one Tsylinsky promoted in Hust, and Tsylinsky was also actively agitating for Ukrainian demands for autonomy in Poland.

Poland is now fighting hard against this assassination and agitation. But the facts of Austria and the Sudetenland in the past, and Czechoslovakia and Slovakia now, cannot but chill her heart. Wherever Hitler glances at, his lackeys will not let go.

### In Response to the Extraordinary Period! Hong Kong Government Officially Announces Residents Service Registration Ordinance, Divided into British and Foreign Sections, Chinese Excepted, To Be Passed and Implemented at the Next Legislative Council Meeting

With international winds and clouds turbulent and uncertain, a second world war could break out at any time. In order to prepare for the recruitment of people for service in extraordinary times in case of war, the Hong Kong authorities, in addition to stepping up training for the army, navy, and air force, have specially formulated the Residents Service Registration Ordinance. The full text of the ordinance was published in the Government Gazette yesterday and is divided into two parts. The Attorney General, Mr. Ainsworth, will submit it to the next meeting of the Legislative Council for approval and implementation. If anyone violates the ordinance at that time, they will be subject to criminal or monetary penalties. The draft translation of the ordinance is as follows:

British Residents Must Fill Out Forms Within Two Months

It is noted that the ordinance pays special attention to the registration of foreigners. As for British nationals, they must report in detail their qualifications and skills, as well as their desire to serve in Hong Kong or abroad during wartime. The law is divided into two parts. The former pertains to the voluntary registration of foreigners, and the latter pertains to the registration of British nationals. According to the registration method in the second part, all British nationals in Hong Kong must register, but Chinese British citizens, active-duty soldiers, women, men under the age of fifteen or over the age of fifty, and others who are exempted with the approval of the Governor are not subject to the restrictions. The registration form lists name, age, place of origin, occupation, date of arrival, and skills such as aviation, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and wireless communication, for registrants to fill out themselves. It also includes sections for dialects and commercial experience for reporting. Registrants must also specify (A) the type of service they are willing to perform in extraordinary times, or (B) the type of work they are willing to perform in Hong Kong. British nationals must fill out the form within two months after the registration law is promulgated and implemented. New arrivals must also register within two months of arriving in Hong Kong.

All Foreigners Must Be Strictly Registered

The first part pertains to the registration of foreigners. All foreigners residing in Hong Kong (Chinese are not included) must personally report orally or in writing to the police station registration office within forty-eight hours of arriving in Hong Kong. Foreigners must also report any changes to their business or residential address within one week of the change. When the police deem it necessary, they may order foreigners to clearly fill out the nature of their passports, permits, and occupations, and submit two photos of themselves for storage. Persons in charge of organizations such as hotels, clubs, and hospitals must record in detail the name, nationality, date of arrival, length of stay, and purpose of stay of any foreigners residing there. Ship owners or agents must submit a detailed report of the foreign passengers on board within forty-eight hours of the ship's arrival in Hong Kong. Foreigners who are not subject to the above restrictions are only those who have registered with the police station, or have obtained permission from the Commissioner of Police, or foreign consuls and their families, ship employees, and children under the age of sixteen. The above registration law will be approved by the Legislative Council and then promulgated and implemented.

Hong Kong's Military Expansion Costs Reach £26,000

In view of the increasingly urgent international crisis, the British authorities are stepping up military expansion in order to seek peace through military strength and are actively implementing national defense construction plans. The new naval construction projects include £26,000 for projects in Hong Kong, such as £5,000 for the reclamation project, of which £4,000 will be spent this year, and £2,900 for the expansion of the electric power station, which will be spent entirely this year. £10,000 will be spent on the £21,700 new radio station construction this year, bringing the total expenditure to £16,700, and the remaining £5,000 will be allocated to next year's budget. £4,000 of the £28,000 cost of the Stonecutters Island seawall construction will be spent this year, and the military construction costs will be £6,000. The construction costs for the army in Hong Kong are as follows: Army Headquarters (total £35,000), £9,000; increase in the number of new recruit barracks for the defense forces (total £175,000), £5,000; three British army barracks (total £1.11 million), £500,000; Joint Heavy Duty Hospital (total £110,000), £30,000; Royal Flag Barracks (total £80,000), £7,000; Bowen Road Army Hospital, £5; Kowloon New Recruit Barracks, £10,000.

Hong Kong's Annual Military Expenditure is Six Million Dollars

In order to enhance the British Empire's national defense strength, the British Empire has increased its huge national defense expenditures in recent years. Hong Kong's annual contribution to this expenditure is stipulated to be 20% of the total annual revenue, but starting this year, due to the sharp increase in military expenditure, this percentage-based method of paying the British Empire's defense expenditure has been abolished, and a new fixed amount of six million dollars per year has been set. This new method was approved by the central government last year and is being implemented. Hong Kong has formulated the 1939 National Defense Expenditure Bearing Ordinance to regulate this change. The ordinance also stipulates the abolition of seven articles or chapters of the draft ordinance related to national defense expenditures. It is stipulated that Hong Kong's annual contribution to national defense, six million dollars, is allocated monthly. However, if the military expenditure of the Hong Kong garrison exceeds this amount in any year, Hong Kong will not make any additional allocations. This is also stipulated. However, if the rise and fall of the Hong Kong dollar makes it inconvenient to implement this method, the ordinance will be amended immediately. This method is experimental and will last for five years.

Aberdeen Harbour Officially Designated as a Military Zone

Recently, the authorities, considering that Aberdeen (i.e., Ap Lei Chau in Hong Kong) is surrounded by mountains and water and has natural strategic advantages, deemed it suitable for the navy to establish defenses. Therefore, they issued an order a few days ago ordering all vessels moored in the area to move to the vicinity of Wong Chuk Hang. Since the fishing boats received this order, they have successively sailed into Wong Chuk Hang in recent days. According to investigations, more than one hundred vessels have already left the Aberdeen waters. Since the authorities issued this order, the nearby vessels have automatically dispersed. Yesterday, a reporter accompanied the person in charge of the Fishermen's Progressive Association to investigate, and saw that all the boat households were about to leave completely. Once all the vessels have been relocated, the authorities will immediately begin dredging the river to complete the naval defense zone in the shortest possible time. It is estimated that the area can accommodate several giant ships or warships. If the authorities deem it necessary to establish naval defenses on other sea areas, they will issue orders prohibiting vessels from mooring at any time. It is said that the authorities will select another suitable sea area as a place for vessels to moor. If they believe that the sea area cannot accommodate the vessels, the authorities will find a way to build houses on land for the Tanka people living in boats.

Hong Kong's Forts Hold Separate Gunnery Exercises

The Hong Kong Artillery Department announced yesterday the dates of the gunnery exercises for each fort as follows: (1) The Pak Sha Wan Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on March 20. If it cannot be held on that day, it will be rescheduled to the 21st. The exercise range is in Zone A. (2) The Stonecutters Island West Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM daily on March 20 and 21. The exercise range is in Zone G. (3) The Pak Sha Wan Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM on March 23. The exercise range is in Zone A. (4) The Lei Yue Mun Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM on March 23. The exercise range is in Zone B. (5) The Lei Yue Mun Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM on March 24. If it is not held on that day, it will be rescheduled to the 27th. The exercise range is in Zone B.

### The Hong Kong Government Has a Comprehensive Plan to Fundamentally Relieve Refugees and Actively Seek Repatriation When Possible, While Training Refugees for Work and Production

Lawyer Lo Man Kam Speaks to Reporters

Following the outbreak of war in South China, refugees from the Hong Kong border and mainland flocked to Hong Kong. Considering the obligation to assist refugees from allied nations, the Hong Kong government has been actively considering ways to resettle these refugees. According to recent statistics, the Hong Kong government is currently accommodating over ten thousand refugees, distributed among various refugee camps in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. It is estimated that the government has been actively working on accommodating and assisting these refugees for the past five months. Concerns regarding the future resettlement of refugees are currently a focus of attention from all parties. Yesterday, reporters interviewed Chinese representative Lawyer Lo Man Kam, inquiring about this issue. Representative Lo stated that the Hong Kong government has delegated full responsibility for the management of refugees to Medical Officer Situ Wing Kwok. Therefore, he is not fully aware of the current relief plans and methods. However, according to his knowledge, the Hong Kong government has already decided on its policy regarding future resettlement and will implement it according to these steps in due course.

Repatriation

This policy is most appropriate and can be generally divided into two principles: The first is to actively seek ways to repatriate refugees to their home villages within the possible range, enabling them to continue production. The second is to plan fundamental relief measures, such as organizing work relief programs, allowing refugees who are unable to return home due to environmental factors to obtain work. The Hong Kong government believes that providing assistance to allied nations' nationals in distress is an inherent obligation. However, prolonged accommodation, unconditionally providing food, clothing, shelter, and various enjoyments, would cause the evacuees to lose their desire to return home. Prolonged residence abroad would indirectly affect the population of allied nations and weaken production. This would not only be unhelpful to allied nations but also harmful. The Hong Kong government has carefully considered this issue and decided to repatriate refugees whose home villages have been declared safe within a feasible environment.

Training and Production

Secondly, there is the issue of fundamental relief. In addition to actively seeking to repatriate refugees, the government is also actively planning to properly resettle refugees who are unable to return home due to the occupation or destruction of their home villages. Because refugees who are idle for a long time can easily develop laziness, the government has decided to plan and train refugees in various productive skills so that they can earn a living through their abilities and strengths. This is a principle upheld by the Hong Kong government in providing refugee relief. Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote has attached great importance to providing relief to our compatriots seeking refuge in the past few months, constantly considering and consulting on appropriate methods. This extraordinary concern is truly touching, and it is believed that the above plan will achieve satisfactory results in the future.

Relief for the Poor

The reporter further inquired about the progress of providing relief to impoverished residents of Hong Kong. According to reports, the authorities are also very concerned about the poor residents of Hong Kong and have long decided on a relief plan. The construction of refugee camps in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon is one of the relief plan's components. The government's motivation to relieve the impoverished masses predates the outbreak of war, and the first phase of work has already begun. Recently, impoverished people sleeping on the streets in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon have been surveyed and registered and sent to various camps for accommodation, preparing to organize various industrial product factories in the future to accommodate these impoverished people and provide them with opportunities for production. Due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War, the government must temporarily delay fundamental poverty relief because it is dealing with refugee relief. Mr. Chung Ling, the inventor of the printing machine and vegetable oil mill, has recently invented another scientific machine and has succeeded. This machine uses

Optical and geometric principles to carve human images. The structure is quite complex, and the effect is significant. According to the person in charge of Chung's company, a scientific sculpting company will be established in Hong Kong soon, and this machine will soon be seen by the people of Hong Kong. Currently, Chung's has submitted this machine to the National Government and various countries for patent registration.

### "Dog" Exhibition Held This Afternoon

The Hong Kong Dog Exhibition, after more than a month of preparation, is now complete and scheduled to be exhibited today (19th) at St. John's, opposite the YWCA of European descent. The participation rules are based on the rules of the Shanghai China Kennel Club. The dogs participating must gather at 11:00 AM and judging will begin at 11:30 AM.

### Hong Kong Government Decides to Reclaim Land to Expand the Unified Wharf and Build a New Wharf to Reduce Congestion

According to yesterday morning's gazette, the Hong Kong government determined that the area of the Unified Wharf was too small and decided to reclaim land for expansion, starting from the east side of the Unified Wharf and extending to the sea facing Victoria Street and Pottinger Street. After the completion of the project, a new wharf will be built on the site to reduce congestion at the Unified Wharf. The land area is approximately 410,650 square feet, and the wharf will occupy approximately 15,645 feet. A temporary wharf will also be built at the reclaimed area, between it and Douglas Wharf.

### Young Woman in Nam Hau Village, New Territories, Severely Injured in a Midnight Attack; Husband Watching a Play When Assailant Broke In; Suspect Mr. Mok Arrested and Sent to Hospital for Identification

A wooden house without a number in Nam Hau Village, Shap Pat Heung, Ping Shan, New Territories, where the victim, Mr. Leung, lived with his wife, Tam Sim (25 years old). The night before, Leung went to see a movie at the newly built cinema in Yuen Long, while Tam Sim stayed at home. Tam closed the door to sleep because it was quiet at night. Before long, a man broke into the house. Tam got out of bed and questioned him, and then saw the man holding a kitchen knife approaching menacingly. When the man saw Tam's bed, he raised the knife and threatened her. Tam retreated to the edge of the bed, and the man swung the knife and slashed, hitting her head twice. Covered in blood, Tam cried out for help, but none of the neighbors knew. After the man committed the crime, he attempted to kill Tam, swinging the knife again. Tam blocked with her hand, and her hand was also slashed. She fell to the bed, and the man fled. After Mr. Leung returned home from the play, he saw that his wife had been injured and quickly asked what had happened. Tam勉强made a few words, saying that it was done by Mr. Mok Muk-hei, a man living nearby. Leung immediately went to the police station to report the case. Police detectives rushed to the scene to investigate and, guided by Leung, arrested the suspect, Mok Muk-hei. The police detectives first sent Tam to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. After being admitted to the hospital, Tam was unable to speak due to her serious injuries. Fearing that Tam might die, the police immediately escorted the suspect Mok Muk-hei to the hospital for Tam to identify before interrogating him.

### Yesterday's Court Judgments on Eight Criminal Cases: Chan Sek-lam Denies Attacking Lam Pak-sang; Violent Robbery of Blind Woman and Other Crimes Severely Punished; Habitual Offender Deported Nine Times Sentenced to Four Years in Prison

This month's criminal cases were heard yesterday morning at 9:30 AM by Justice MacGregor of the High Court. There were a total of 21 cases, and judgments were made on only eight. The most noteworthy case was the attack on Lam Pak-sang, in which the defendant Chan Sek-lam did not hire a lawyer to defend him but still denied the charges against him: (1) Intent to murder Lam Pak-sang by injuring him on Des Voeux Road on January 17 of this year, (2) Injuring Lam Pak-sang with the intent to cripple him. The court ordered the case to be adjourned until next week for further hearing. The details of the trial of each case are listed below.

Violent Robbery

(1) Ho Pak-yau, also known as Tau Pei-yau, was charged with robbery in Kowloon on January 14 of this year. Government lawyer Abbott prosecuted. The defendant pleaded guilty. The court sentenced the defendant to five years of hard labor imprisonment. (2) Lo Fuk-lam was charged with (1) intent to rob and (2) assaulting the victim in Kowloon in December of last year. The defendant pleaded guilty to the second charge. The court sentenced him to one year of hard labor imprisonment. (3) Cheung Lan and Wong Yi, also known as Wong Kwai-po, were charged with violently robbing Liao Hing, a blind woman, of 52 Hong Kong dollars and 1 National dollar in Kowloon City on February 14. Both defendants pleaded guilty. The court said, "According to the confession recorded in the patrol court, the second defendant had more than 30 dollars in cash on her when she was arrested, and the first defendant only had a few cents. You two actually used scissors to violently rob an old, blind woman who gambled. You should be severely punished." The court sentenced each of them to three years of hard labor imprisonment.

Possession of Firearms

The defendant pleaded guilty. The court sentenced him to two and a half years of hard labor imprisonment. (5) Liao Tin and Mak Yiu were charged with possessing an unlicensed pistol, a dagger, and five bullets in Tai Kok Tsui on February 24 of this year. Prosecutor Blandice told the court that there was conclusive evidence of the second defendant Mak's guilt. The court, upon hearing this, acquitted Mak Yiu. Lawyer Blandice also told the court that the first defendant Liao Hing had been charged with two counts in 1931. After the trial, he was convicted and sentenced to six months of hard labor imprisonment for each count. In 1938, he committed theft and was sentenced to four months of hard labor imprisonment. The court, upon hearing this, sentenced him to two years of hard labor imprisonment. (6) Cheung Hing-jai was charged with possessing an unlicensed pistol and seven bullets in Yuen Long on February 22 of this year. The defendant pleaded guilty. The court asked lawyer Blandice, "Was the defendant's pistol recently used?" Blandice replied, "According to the armorer's inspection of the pistol, there were no signs that it had been fired." The court then sentenced the defendant to twelve months of hard labor imprisonment.

Re-entry After Deportation

(7) Chu Lam was charged with violating the deportation ordinance. According to government lawyer Blandice, the defendant had committed numerous crimes. Since 1923, he had committed a total of 14 crimes, nine of which violated the deportation ordinance. The defendant pleaded guilty.

### Many Upsets in Yesterday's Horse Race; Yana Added Another Three Wins; Place Pool Paid Out Over a Thousand Dollars

Because of the heavy rain for several days last week, the turf at Happy Valley Racecourse was somewhat affected. Although it was sunny all day yesterday, the sunshine came too late. As a result, the hot horses were caught off guard in yesterday's first special horse race. Except for "King Tenth Jutton" in the third race and "Nus Earlich" in the sixth race, the rest suffered a complete rout, allowing the long shots to triumph and return victoriously. Naturally, the payouts for the single bets in each race were high. For example, the first race paid 53 dollars, and the seventh race paid 50 dollars. The others also paid more than 30 or 40 dollars. The quinella in the fifth and seventh races were major upsets, paying out 1,054 dollars per ticket. It is believed that most bettors suffered losses, but those who favored the long shots made a killing and filled their wallets. Among the jockeys, Yana once again took the lead, winning three races.

### Hong Kong U.S. Dollar Soars Due to Tense Situation in Europe

Due to the tense situation in Europe and the looming threat of war, the U.S. dollar has been steadily rising in the past few days. According to financial circles, there is a tendency for it to continue to rise unless the situation in Europe changes. There has been a lot of speculation in the buying and selling of Hong Kong-U.S. dollars in recent days. The price increases for 89 gold since April are as follows: (15th) 69.38, (16th) 69.47, (17th) 69.50, (18th) 69.18.

### Exploring the Rice Famine in Chaozhou and Shantou

— Chi Cheuk

Profiteering Merchants and Corruption Adding Fuel to the Fire

The rice famine is severe, and the people's food is worrying. The Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the Sze Yup Commercial Associations have repeatedly requested the central government to exempt imported rice from taxes in order to maintain the people's livelihood. However, Generalissimo Chiang's reply was that it should not be discussed. What exactly is going on? There are, of course, reasons for this in the Party.

To explore the "mysterious answer," the reporter visited Mr. Lin Zifeng, a member of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, yesterday to inquire about the actual situation in Chaozhou. Although this is a very complicated issue, it is not difficult to find its clues. Although there are many different opinions, there are also common points. Here, we must report the constitutional situation obtained from the exploration to readers as follows:

The grain production in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas has never been enough to feed the people of Chaozhou and Shantou. In the past, the deficit mostly came from the provinces in the Yangtze River basin, with Wuhu being the largest source. Because Wuhu rice has a sticky quality that is most suitable for cooking porridge by the Chaozhou and Shantou people. In normal times before the outbreak of war, about 1.5 million bags of rice were imported into the Chaozhou-Meizhou area, each bag weighing 180 catties. At 20 Shantou dollars per bag, the Chaozhou-Meizhou area had to purchase 30 million Shantou dollars worth of rice annually to maintain the people's food supply. In the past, due to convenient transportation, regardless of whether the local harvest was good or bad, the supply of foreign rice was never interrupted. We only saw high rice prices, but we never saw a rice famine.

However, this situation of temporary stability came to an end after the flames of war spread and transportation was blocked. The Yuehan Railway, which transported national rice from the Hubei and Hunan provinces, was interrupted. Wuhu rice was banned from export by the Japanese. As for foreign rice, each bag cost 20 Shantou dollars, and the import tax was more than 5 National dollars, so merchants found it unprofitable and stopped doing such business. Although there were still routes to Fujian and Jiangxi, they were actually very difficult. The number of troops was also limited. As a result, demand exceeded supply in Chaozhou and Sze Yup, as well as the surrounding occupied areas. Each yuan could only buy about four catties of white rice. On average, rice prices throughout the province were twice as high as at the same time last year. As a result, people above the middle class who ate dry rice switched to porridge, and people below the middle class, especially those who barely earned enough to eat their fill every day, now had to tighten their belts and eat two fewer bowls. It has already become difficult to barely fill their stomachs with coarse grains.

Stabilizing rice prices and controlling spending were originally not without relief measures. Unfortunately, the local corrupt officials, bullies, and profiteering merchants colluded with each other and used grand-sounding names as a cover to openly disregard the interests of the people and only care about making profits. When it comes to Yao in Chaozhou and stabilizing prices in Shantou, the people of Chaozhou and Shantou hate those who manipulate them from behind the scenes and use public office for private gain, but they cannot report the situation to the higher authorities!

Recently, the old rice harvested last October has been exhausted, and the new early rice of June has not yet come on the market. During this period of scarcity, the profiteering merchants and corrupt officials who added fuel to the fire and stirred up trouble behind the scenes are as rampant as ever. Therefore, the rice famine has become even more severe. When there is nothing else that can be done, there is only one way: to ask the central government to exempt imported rice from import taxes.

Why doesn't the central government follow the people's wishes and show consideration for the difficult times by approving the request? Here, we cannot but remember a painful lesson:

In 1937 and 1938, the Chaozhou and Shantou areas also requested permission to exempt imported rice from import taxes. As a result, the people did not receive the government's grace, and the benefits of the tax exemption completely fell into the private pockets of profiteering merchants and corrupt officials. Because the tax-exempt foreign rice had a limited quantity and time, the cunning merchants exhausted their assets during the tax-exempt period, buying large quantities of foreign rice and hoarding it for sale. Although there was a lot of rice stored, the supply and demand were still uncoordinated and the prices were high. Until the tax-exempt period expired, according to his meticulous calculations, he knew that there was a certain amount of rice in the market and that sooner or later it would come to the merchants. At this time, he could raise the price as he pleased. Because a large amount of rice was stored in these rice merchants who were also "trustees." Thanks to the tax exemption on foreign rice, the only beneficiaries were the profiteering merchants, hucksters, and their protectors, the corrupt officials and bullies. The people were still helpless!

Therefore, the prerequisite for tax exemption on foreign rice is that there should be no time and quantity limits so that profiteering merchants cannot cause trouble. When the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce made the request, it also made this point clear. It is precisely because of this point that the central government is not willing to agree hastily. Because although there is actually no foreign rice tax that can be collected, once foreign rice is imported, 30 million yuan of funds will flow out annually in Chaozhou and Shantou alone. This affects the balance of foreign exchange. Regarding this point, the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce also understands the central authorities' concern for the overall financial situation during the war. It is just a question of how to purchase and transport national rice from neighboring provinces? The Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce is now resubmitting a request for instructions. In fact, the inland transportation now is also controlled by those with strong power, and there are奸men using the transportation of rice to fill their pockets. Therefore, in the final analysis, it is still a matter of "people," a matter of politics.

How will the rice famine be solved? Whether it is exempting foreign rice from taxes, developing transportation, reclaiming wasteland, forcing winter cultivation, or improving production methods, everything should have "good people" standing on a position of public loyalty and selflessness, doing it earnestly, only then can there be a solution. By earnestly doing it, the unreasonable organization, the deformed reality, and the profiteering corruption will have no way to use their tricks, and the people can also exert their strength to help the government build the country. Therefore, in the final analysis, this is a matter of "people," a matter of politics not being on the right track.

### Movie Criticism ABC

— Zhou Wei

When talking about movie criticism, we quickly think about how movie criticism should be produced. It seems that a lot has been said about this in theory. However, because theory is still theory—there is still some distance from reality—the foundation of correct movie criticism may have been laid, but correct movie criticism has not been widely developed. This makes us realize that simply talking about theory is not enough. In Hong Kong, which has been ridiculed as a "cultural desert," to make it bloom with brilliant flowers of movie criticism, it seems that we should start with cultivating seeds—the so-called "enlightenment" work. Therefore, without presuming my own insignificance, I write down some ABCs based on what I can think of at the moment:

Three Basic Points:

(1) Self-Cultivation: It seems that every moviegoer is qualified to criticize movies—no matter how limited their knowledge or how distorted their views are, they have the freedom to blurt out whatever they want. However, to "put it into writing" and spread one's views to a wide audience, influencing society's visual and auditory senses, one must make a serious self-examination before doing this work.

We know that movies are complex and comprehensive art. Their object is the entire human society and the entire universe of nature. The breadth of their contact is unmatched by any other narrower art field. Therefore, to be a sound movie critic, the most important prerequisite is to have good cultivation in various fields of knowledge—this may be too demanding, but at least one should have some understanding of various fields of knowledge—especially regarding art principles, social sciences, aesthetics, etc. Otherwise, one is not qualified to write a pertinent movie review.

(2) Basic Movie Knowledge: The various advanced principles of film may be a matter for experts, but a movie critic must know the most basic common sense about film. We often see so-called movie criticisms that are "completely irrelevant." Not only do they fail to help the audience gain a deeper understanding, but they also fail to "convince" filmmakers to make further improvements. This is a terrible waste of the movie cultural movement. We cannot use the cliché that "one does not need to know how to lay an egg to eat it" as a shield. It is not necessary to demand that you lay eggs yourself, but you must know how they are produced. Otherwise, how can you find its flaws and then criticize it?

(3) Correct Understanding: A filmmaker without a correct worldview and outlook on life will inevitably fail to produce good works; a movie critic without a correct worldview and outlook on life will similarly fail to write good articles. If the critic and the maker are both confused, then the harm caused by combining two muddled accounts is immeasurable. Otherwise, if the criticism has a correct understanding, it will inevitably expose the flaws of the maker and stop its harm. If the maker is not confused either, then the advantages can be promoted and its impact expanded. Therefore, for a movie critic, the need for correct ideas is—almost more urgent than for the maker.

At the same time, whether this is correct can also be used to determine whether one has a calm mind. Usually, every movie critic is often swayed by a temporary "prejudice" and has their own independent judgment shaken, or is dazzled by some kind of "greatness" and does not know where to start. These are all problems of insufficient subjective concepts and an insufficiently calm mind. Its influence often distorts the facts, and this is something that those engaged in movie criticism should overcome with reason.

How to Criticize?

It is really inappropriate to use a general, superficial way of writing to develop our criticism of a good or bad movie. We must know what makes a movie good and what makes it bad. Each part that constitutes this movie, whether it is meritorious or flawed, has its own responsibility. Therefore, to really talk about movie criticism, one must apply an anatomy—disassemble it and analyze it part by part. Otherwise, one will never get the true value of the criticism.

For the sake of "drawing the outline to highlight the details," I will briefly list some items and look forward to brilliant supplements:

(1) Central Idea: From the perspective of "film for film's sake," talking specifically about film, this issue should not be listed at the beginning. However, now that movies have been regarded as a tool for mass education, under the general principle that "the evaluation of all art is determined by its social function," whether the central idea is sound has become a major premise for whether each movie has its value of existence, and this is an undeniable fact. This is a major advancement in modern art criticism, and it is also a point that every movie critic should grasp.

(2) Handling of the Theme: Whether it is drama or film, every work must have a theme. If the theme is not handled well, or is obscure and unclear, it will greatly diminish the achievement of the work. It is even more ridiculous to have no theme or not know what a theme is. However, in fact, we are seeing many things that do not know what they are talking about. This is the immaturity of the maker, and critics should point out this error and urge the maker to strengthen their understanding of the theme.

(3) Performance Effect: Whether a work can be welcomed by the masses depends mainly on whether its performance effect is good. Sometimes, a very distorted fact can also deceive the masses and make them "satisfied," and this is the reason. The definition of this issue is very broad. It is a sum and also a melody. If the manipulation is wrong, sometimes what should be strengthened is ignored, and what should be ignored is emphasized, thus creating an unintended negative effect. In these places, the critic should point it out with a calm and precise eye.

(4) Script: In every movie production, people only see "stars"—ignoring the screenwriter behind the scenes, and even the director. This is the bad result of the "superficial art" of capitalism, which is very undesirable. New critics should note that not only can the director determine the life of a play, but the soundness of the script also has an indivisible importance to the achievement of the entire play, so as not to commit the mistake of "abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial."

(5) Director: Undoubtedly, for a serious work, its success or failure is the responsibility of the director because they have the power to make decisions on everything. The "stars" that people see are only responsible to the director for what they should be responsible for in the production process. However, people ignore the director. The reason for this is that many directors—especially in Hong Kong—instead ask "big stars" to direct us, and in fact, they may only be slightly more important than the stagehands in the studio. This is a strange phenomenon. In addition to pointing out the merits and demerits that the director should be responsible for under normal circumstances, we should also urge people to know the importance of the director—there will never be a good production without a good director, and urge every director to take on the responsibility that they cannot shirk for their own "position."

(6) Actors: There are definitely no omnipotent actors in the world, but in China, especially Hong Kong, many are proud of being omnipotent. Therefore, what actors play themselves, in addition to representing themselves, is unimaginable in terms of artistic evaluation. Their understanding of art is mostly so superficial, and their cultivation of acting skills is naturally even more out of the question, and the so-called "personality" is also unknown. How can it not be "like climbing a tree to catch a fish" to ask them to be "competent" and "act well"? Therefore, the critic should point out their mistakes and the path they should take based on correct views, so that they have self-awareness and engage in genuine artistic efforts!

Other things such as the "scenery"—at least whether it is the kind that Chinese people—can live in; whether the "costumes" are too exaggerated—such as the most recent period dramas, which are only a display of color—or too simple; whether the "lighting" is a necessary match of strength and weakness and whether it is suitable for what is needed; whether the placement of "props" hinders the atmosphere of the entire play; whether the "scenes" are properly distributed in the entire script; and so on are closely related to the formation of a good or bad movie and cannot be ignored. However, due to the limited space here and the urgency of the deadline, I can only end it in a hurry. I hope to talk about it again if I have the opportunity in the future.

### Starting from the Children's Drama Movement

— Zhu Baishui

Inspiration for the Joint Performance of the Hong Kong Children's Troupe on Children's Day

"Save the children!"

This great and urgent cry was shouted until ten years after Mr. Lu Xun's death before he passed away. It was shouted from before the War of Resistance to the War of Resistance. However, this urgent cry has only become more and more widespread and serious!

We have to say that children growing up in China with a bad social system have many unfortunate lives. There is no good construction in terms of education and entertainment. They are asked to memorize old antiques from hundreds of years ago, or live the life of street children wandering in garbage dumps. Adults must not ignore this contradictory and tragic phenomenon!

After the War of Resistance, cruelly trampled under the iron hooves of the aggressors, tens of thousands of children who lost their lovely hometowns, fields, and kind parents, siblings embarked on a long and miserable journey of wandering and fleeing. The continuation of life is of course serious, but how to make them grow up in the War of Resistance, how to make them healthy and strong in the gunfire, the question of education is equally serious and urgent!

In this way, we think of the Children's Troupe, which is now affiliated with the Political Department. How surprising and admirable is it that these refugees who grew up in the gunfire have traveled thousands of miles with courage and perseverance?

Others, such as the Henan Children's Salvation Troupe, which fought hard behind the enemy's lines, and the Xiamen Children's Troupe, which has been struggling in various places overseas after arriving in Hong Kong not long ago, as well as the Guangzhou Children's Troupe, which embarked on a journey of escape during the fall of Guangzhou and is now working in Guangxi, all give us a special feeling of emotion.

In this emotion, a small amount of the current plan for children's education in the War of Resistance is displayed. Of course, we cannot completely use drama to solve this serious problem, but we clearly know that drama can achieve certain effects under the requirements of correct education and entertainment in combination with the work of resisting the War of Resistance and saving the country.

Cai Chusheng's "Lost Lamb" only gives us a vivid and profound exposure and a hint of the seriousness of the problem, but until now we have not been able to obtain a correct solution or provision. The rising children's drama should have a major responsibility. In today's wartime, the presentation of this issue is not superfluous.

In China, there is no famous Central Children's Theater or Moscow Children's Theater like in the progressive Soviet Union, and there is no famous talented children's playwright Ms. Sazhi. In the past, there were only poor "Poor Qiu Miao" and "Dreaming of Wonderland" and other songs and dances or divine birthday dramas. It was not until after September 18th that we treasured the emergence of Xu Xingzhi's "Last Lesson" and "Bell Sound of the Ancient Temple" and other more dramatic and complete children's scripts. At the same time, China's emerging children's drama movement had the embryonic form of budding.

All artistic progress is growing in the great War of Resistance. Children's drama is also being established under the guise of the flourishing development of drama during the War of Resistance. Various children's troupes have been established one after another, and they have gone to villages, hospitals, military camps, trenches, and other corners one after another. This proves that children's drama also has major functions and powers in wartime.

This also strongly expresses that drama endows children with correct education and good spiritual food, and inspires the purest wisdom and strength of children, so that they can grow up healthily under the enemy's invasion.

All cultural work in Hong Kong is progressing slowly, and the development of drama after the War of Resistance can be regarded as a sharp spearhead. Until recently, the progress of drama seems to be rushing forward with a striking posture. However, the children's drama movement has never been noticed and cultivated!

Very commonly in Hong Kong's school entertainment meetings, we still see performances of "Drizzle" or "Grape Fairy"-style or non-donkey-non-horse-style Western children's songs and dance dramas. It is certainly due to the environment, and it is undeniable that the correct essence of children's drama itself has not been understood, and the work of engaging in the drama movement has not been properly established.

However, in fact, the emergence of children's drama has already begun to sprout in Hong Kong.

In terms of organization and work performance, we first point out the "Ant Children's Troupe." This organization has been established for more than a year and has performed "The Last Lesson," "Helping Our Guerrilla Team," and "The Story of Blood," etc., and has automatically organized a street children's school to educate a group of out-of-school street children. This spirit of learning is very admirable.

Recently, a group of new friends who love drama work have also organized a "Pioneer Children's Troupe," which has performed "Three Patriotic Brothers" and "The Last Lesson," etc., and is also working hard. Others, such as the School Relief Society, the Ding Twenty Troupe, and the Youth Tongle Society, have children's troupe organizations and have successively performed children's dramas.

From this, we can know that the Hong Kong children's drama movement has begun to grow anew, and this growth will make it bloom with beautiful and bright flowers—

The Four-Four Children's Day is approaching. In order to strengthen the development of the children's drama movement in Hong Kong and expand the new impact of Children's Day, this large group of young pioneers convened a joint meeting and decided to jointly perform a four-act long drama ("Long Live Children," collectively created by the Ant Troupe) during the Four-Four Children's Day to build a monument to the connection of Hong Kong children's drama. Recently, they have begun to prepare enthusiastically.

The children's drama movement has begun a strong struggle in the motherland. In Hong Kong, this special environment, it is urgent to establish the foundation of the children's drama movement with the latest attitude. Therefore, we warmly pray for this joint performance on Children's Day!

Theater Movement Trends

### Huanghuagang is in Intensive Rehearsal

The Hong Kong drama groups have decided to jointly perform the great national defense mass drama "Huanghuagang" by more than 40 Hong Kong drama groups on March 29th in order to strengthen the united front of the drama community and work together, and to commemorate the great national holidays. After several meetings, all work has been arranged separately. At the same time, it was also decided to cooperate with the Joint Association of All Circles in Hong Kong to Relieve Refugees in South China, and all the income from the performance will be sent to the association to relieve refugees. In addition to publicity, it also bears the work of raising funds, which has dual significance. "Huanghuagang," this script was collectively created by 22 people from the Guangdong Drama Association, Xia Yan, Hu Chunbing, Luo Haisha, Zhou Gangming, Lou Zhaojie, Ruan Qi, Cai Biqing, etc. before the Huanghua Festival performance in Guangzhou last year. Now, due to the change of time and environment, some of the lines are not very suitable. Therefore, Mr. Hu Chunbing was publicly recommended to revise it. He has completed the revision yesterday and sent it to Gui for printing. It is expected to be printed and sent to Hong Kong in the next few days. Now, they have begun to rehearse intensively under the leadership of the five directors of the directing team based on the revised draft. After the New Year's Day, we can see this unprecedented great performance.

### Salvation Performing Arts Team Comes to Hong Kong

We have published the news that the Shanghai Salvation Performing Arts Second Team will come to Hong Kong from Gui to prepare for overseas propaganda in the previous two issues. Originally, they were scheduled to leave Gui on the 10th of last month and were expected to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of last month or the beginning of this month. However, there is still no trace of them, and friends in Hong Kong's cultural and drama circles are very concerned. I have just received an airmail letter from Jinshan, the head of the delegation, sent from Gui this month, and learned that the departure has been delayed because the travel expenses and the purchase of foreign exchange have not been resolved. Now that all the problems have been solved, it has been decided to go to Haiphong from Guilin on the 10th of this month and transfer to a boat to Hong Kong. This time, they will stay in Hong Kong for 40 days to handle the formalities for going abroad and purchase all items. During their stay in Hong Kong, they plan to give two or three performances. In addition, they also plan to exchange opinions with friends in Hong Kong's cultural and drama circles, and hold an exhibition of war trophies to exhibit the war trophies obtained by the delegation during their years of working with the army on the front line in Central China. It is estimated that the journey from Guilin to Haiphong will take a week if the transportation is convenient. The voyage from Haiphong to Hong Kong will take three or four days. It will probably not take more than a few days to arrive in Hong Kong! However, due to the inconvenience of wartime transportation, if there are no cars and ships from Guilin to Haiphong now, then the journey will be delayed for many days! Hong Kong's cultural and drama circles are now preparing to hold a welcome ceremony for the delegation's arrival.

### The Reorganized China Travel Troupe

The China Travel Troupe is still under the leadership of Mr. Tang Huaiqiu after the "separation" and the "reconstruction." It has accepted the past experience and lessons and taken on the mission of the drama movement again. Now, they have reorganized their troops, refreshed their lineup, and started intensive rehearsals of new plays to prepare for performances. At the same time, their troupe site has also been moved from the noisy and bustling fourth floor of the United Restaurant to a quiet and secluded place—11 Phoenix Terrace, Wanchai. The lineup is also quite strong compared to before, with 33 new and old troupe members, both men and women. "China Travel" pillar Tang Ruoqing returned to Hong Kong from Gui at the beginning of the month. Tang Ruoying, Peng Guohua, Zhang Ying Huanghe and others are also very capable young drama people. There are a total of 25 to 30 plays to be performed. At present, they have started rehearsing 7 plays in preparation for the first performance, including You Jing's new work "A Tear on the Clothes" and "Phoenix City," "Motherland," "Frontier Storm," "Wilderness," "The Beginning of Man," and "Our Hometown," which were introduced in the ninth issue of this magazine. They will officially perform next month, performing in Mandarin and Cantonese respectively. I hope they will work hard and not live up to the past glory! (Note: For more details about China Travel, please refer to the "China Travel in Reconstruction" in the next issue of this magazine.)

### Movies and Women

— Jie Li

On this vast stage of the world, men and women are originally an indispensable pair of roles. In human life, the adjustment of both sexes is indispensable. That is to say, women are indispensable. If there is no participation of women, it is simply not drama art. If we want to find a few movies without women in the world, it is really not an easy thing.

Women are becoming indispensable in movies. In China, where the male-centered tendency in society is still very obvious and very blatant, the proportion of women in movies is greatly enhanced, especially in Hong Kong, which is the capital of China's film industry. The social environment is so full of pink colors, and alcohol and pornography have become indispensable stimulants for ordinary young masters and comprador rich men. Women in movies have generally become the most noticeable things for those movie audiences. Therefore, the position of women in movies is very considerable. It is unimaginable for a movie to have no women. We have only seen films that exaggerate the number, beauty, or sexiness of women, and have never seen a film that cannot find a single woman in the entire film.

In Hong Kong, this special place, in a society where the male-centered tendency is very strong, the increasingly delicate and valued depiction of women in movies, and even the fact that movies have become centered on women, all this is not enough to indicate the strengthening of women's status in a male-centered society, but rather illustrates that ordinary movie audiences, in the constant tempering and dyeing of alcohol and pornography and the environment, have constantly shifted their attention to the description of women in movies. Thus, we can see many movies on the market that are centered on women, capturing a large audience.

The fact that movies are centered on women and focus on the fine depiction of women cannot be regarded as a downward trend in movies. The question is, what is the position, direction, and technique of movies in depicting women, and what kind of women do they depict? At present, the general depiction of women in movies is only following the social taste and engaging in low-level expressions. Their position is standing in the male-centered position and having another view of women. And the so-called direction and technique are really pitiful, and they are all vulgar and weak. Therefore, the women they express are all superficial and untrue. Their purpose is actually just to attract a large audience through the depiction of women.

In fact, the description of women in movies should start from a deep point of view, from the special environment of society, to discover the typical of contemporary women in the current environment.

### Speaking on Stage Techniques

— Lu Dun

5. The Art of the Actor

A. The Easiest and Most Difficult Art Simultaneously.

Tyrone Guthrie said, "If people ask what is the easiest art? I will answer, the art of the actor. If they ask what is the most difficult art? I will also answer, the art of the actor."

Precisely because the actor's art of performance is merely the act of a person playing a person, which is inherently not a difficult thing, some people doubt its value as an art. Gordon Craig said, "I never believed acting is an art. A leaping lamb and a nightingale in the forest, the former seems to dance, the latter seems to sing, can you say they are artists?" However, this argument is unsound. The performance of a play is not everyday reality. The lamb's leap and the nightingale's song are merely an instinct of life, and their leaping and singing are also expressions of everyday emotions. But the actor's performance on stage is not their own everyday life; it is something produced through artistic creation. This thing, in other words, the emotions created through artistic means, is enough to "infect" others and evoke resonance. Therefore, the value of performing arts exists.

Moreover, the reason why performing arts are a "difficult" art is that it is simultaneously pretending and creating. A novelist spends a considerable amount of time in the writing process to complete a novel. When they read it carefully again, if they find inappropriate rhetoric, they can modify it, and modify it again – until it is perfect before releasing it to the public. But the actor's performance lacks this superior condition. Their work is simultaneously creating while it is being produced. The process of creation is also the completion of creation.

Therefore, it is impossible to say whether the art of the actor is easy or difficult, but upon closer reflection, it is considerably difficult.

B. The Creation of Realism.

Generally speaking, the actor's art of performance is the creation of a sense of realism, and the most important thing is to ensure that the audience always believes without realizing it.

The creation of a sense of realism, in other words, is created through certain production methods. Then, this is already a "non-realistic sense of realism" but is merely a created thing. For the method of creating this thing, the actor first creates a "hypothesis" in their own mind, a created "imagined reality." Stanislavski said in his famous book "My Life in Art": "Only when the actor's soul and imagination display fantastic, creative 'hypotheses' can there be creativity. If there is only true reality, only actual truth that people naturally cannot help but believe, then creativity has not yet begun. When a creative hypothesis appears, that is, when the actor faithfully and with the greatest enthusiasm believes in this 'imagined reality' – even more than believing in true reality – then the actor will step from true reality into another life, that is, when they believe in the 'hypothesis' imaginatively created by themselves, only then can the actor begin to create."

Therefore, the development of imagination and illusion is the keynote of the creation of performing arts, but this kind of inspiration cannot be forcibly completed using artificial methods. Stanislavski said, "I am not trying to create inspiration artificially; that is impossible. What I require is to create a good quality (referring to the actor themselves) that can use willpower to express inspiration." "To express inspiration by willpower" is the golden rule of performing arts! We know that the actor's performance is not everyday reality; it is merely the creation of a sense of realism. However, human inspiration, or rather, the emotional effect of human beings, is a definite and inevitable physiological reaction. Feeling a certain stimulus causes a certain degree of reaction. This is the phenomenon of human reality. However, as just mentioned, the actor's performance is not everyday reality. On the stage, the actor does not feel a certain stimulus as in everyday life, but they must show an emotion that reacts to a certain degree, as if they were stimulated. It cannot be too much, nor too little; it must be just right. Otherwise, it will lose the sense of realism, and the audience will realize they are acting. To achieve this, the actor must first train themselves to become a "good quality," able to command and control themselves, expressing good feelings by willpower, and be able to freely use their own body – internal, self-control of the nervous system; external, manipulation of physical movements. The actor must be able to control their attention, to become the master of all their expressions and actions. (To be continued)

### International Football Semi-Final: China vs. England, Who Will Win the Championship? Today at 4 PM at Caroline Hill

[Special Report from This Newspaper] In last year's football competition, our Chinese team won five titles, except for the English Sunday Cup of the International Tournament, which was taken by foreigners. The grand aspiration of sweeping all the championships was ultimately not fulfilled. This year, our Chinese team has a tendency to sweep the titles again, but looking ahead, there are still many obstacles. All our athletes must work harder from now on to succeed.

Taking today's international semi-final at Caroline Hill at 4 PM as an example, if the Chinese team wins and eliminates the English team, it will only win the right to the final. The issue of winning the championship is still not up for discussion. If they unfortunately lose, all hopes will be lost, which will not help in the future. Therefore, they must overcome today's difficulties, and then further compete with the Portuguese team for the championship on April 10.

Comparing the talents of the Chinese and English teams, there is a clear difference in level. On the English team's side, the same-nationality sailors-turned-players are performing drills in Singapore and could not help. The selection problem had to be solved second best, so four players from the second team were selected, making the team's strength slightly insufficient. However, with the support of Middlesbrough's three midfielders in the middle, and the participation of famous players such as Parker, Erridge-Duran, and Morris and Healy, the momentum is still not weak and should not be underestimated.

The Chinese team has Li Huitang leading the forward line, whose prestige is enough to overwhelm people. The other players are also top choices. Hou Chengtou was injured yesterday and it is not known whether he will participate in the battle today. If he is absent, he will be replaced by the reserve Huang Jingcong. Huang is agile and will be able to fulfill the task happily. Song Lingsheng's foot injury has fully recovered. If he cannot force himself to appear, Zeng Zhongyun will be the most appropriate replacement. The starting lineups for the two teams are as follows:

[Great China Team]

Xu Jingcheng (Eastern Football Club)  Hou Chengtou (Eastern Football Club)

Li Tiansheng (South China FC)  Li Zhaorong (South China FC)

Tan Jun'gan (South China FC)  Liang Rongzhao (South China FC)  Li Huitang (South China Club Captain)

Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua Club)  Feng Jingxiang (South China FC)

Song Lingsheng (Eastern Football Club)  Deng Guangrong (South China FC)

Reserves: Li Deqi, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan (Eastern Football Club), Zhuo Shijin,

Huang Jingcong (Guanghua Club)  Yang Shuiyi (South China Club)

[England Team]

Jenkins (Middlesbrough)  Feeley (Ordnance Corps)

Parker (Police FC)

Healy (Kowloon Club)  Beatty (Middlesbrough)  Erridge-Duran (Hong Kong Club (Captain))  Charterly (Artillery Corps)

Coburn (Artillery Corps)  Fitzwater (Middlesbrough)  Morris (Police FC)  Umbers (Artillery Corps)

Reserves: Lee Si (Artillery Corps)  Hanneyville (Navy Team)  Harman, Zeng Ningshi (Middlesbrough)

The Chinese team is so strong, it should be bound to win. The five forwards have the greatest power. However, I worry that during the battle, these five will be unable to work together. If they have an opportunity and cross the opponent's midfielder, they can move forward unimpeded. The English team's two inside forwards, although Parker has rich experience, is slow in action. He is used to charging forward, but now he is transferred to the rear to confront the Chinese team's five tigers, leading to hasty disarray, with a sigh of being unable to cope with the difficulty. Although Coburn is selected from the second team because of his skills, he is now shouldering a heavy responsibility to defend against the fierce attacks of the Chinese forward. I am afraid his strength is not enough. Therefore, the Chinese team's forwards should be careful when advancing and consider how to bypass the opponent's forward line. Although it is getting closer to their final defense, it is still necessary to avoid the solid and attack the weak for better results. I think it is easier to attack from the side than from the center because this avoids the restraint of the center midfielder. If they always break through from the center, it will easily be seen through.

More than half of the English team's forwards are soldiers and are not much of a threat. However, one point is that the soldiers from the second team who are shouldering important responsibilities will do their best and be cautious, and strive to do their best. However, their self-confidence is very weak. If their performance is not good from the beginning to the end, they will be psychologically affected, and even become afraid. Therefore, we should watch how they perform today and see if their first move is appropriate.

In my opinion, the Chinese team is very confident of winning this game. However, more than half of the English team are soldiers, they will fight to the end, and this competition adopts the ten-minute and nine-minute system, the more they fight, the more advantages they have. Therefore, even though the Chinese team is more skilled, it is still not enough to hold on to. The use of strength is also an important condition. Moreover, for a strenuous sport like football, if you want to have a good performance of skills, you must have the support of strength.

There are a few more points that I advise fans to keep in mind. Today at 2 PM, two types of tickets will be opened, priced at five corners and three corners. However, viewers should not buy tickets outside the venue, and children should not be brought in. Those without tickets will not be allowed to enter. Once the tickets are sold out, the gates will be closed, and those who arrive late will not be able to enter. Therefore, I hope fans will arrive early to avoid disappointment (the football field is too small).

### South China FC Defeated Kowloon Club with a Clean Sheet

Shuiyi, Genbao, and Dehui Each Scored One Goal

Yesterday, South China FC played against Kowloon Club at Caroline Hill. The victory or defeat of the two teams was not very important. There were few spectators. Tan Jun'gan did not play, and Deng Xihong was the goalkeeper. The rest were as shown in the table. Healy of Kowloon Club's performance was very organized, so the Kowloon Club's goal was unusually deserted in the first half. Unexpectedly, in the last 15 minutes of the second half, South China scored three consecutive goals, sealing the victory. The lineups for the two teams were as follows:

(South China FC)

Deng Xi

Liu Mao, Guo Bingzhong

Liu Weipei, Lin Depu, Liang Bo

Xie Jinhong, Ou Shie, Chen Dehui, Yang Genbao, Yang Shuiyi

[Kowloon Club]

Healy

Wu Lie, Yi Hua

Zhi, Ni, Shi, Li, Li Mai

Bo Liaoyachen, Lu Zhaozhi, Shi Peier, Vivi Di, Lu Xiaonuo Shi

At the time, Bell first passed the ball to attack, but was blocked by Liu Mao. Bingzhong had not practiced for a long time and occasionally made mistakes. Fortunately, Liu Mao helped and did not cause any mistakes. South China counterattacked but failed to score. The two sides went back and forth until near the end of the game. Ou Shie received a wonderful ball and shot fiercely at the goal. Unfortunately, the ball was slightly high and missed the winning opportunity. The first half was 0-0, with no victory or defeat.

In the second half, Kowloon Club attacked fiercely, and South China's defense suddenly became chaotic. Xie Jinhong handled the ball with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was taken by Zhaozhi. The shot was too strong, and the ball hit the net. Twenty minutes later, Ou Shie passed the ball far to Xie Jinhong at the door. Yang Shuiyi waited in front of the door and headed the ball into the net, opening the scoring. Soon after, Chen Dehui led the army to advance fiercely. When he got close, he passed the ball to Yang Genbao, who shot with a big foot and scored. Xie Jinhong passed the ball into the center. Chen Dehui raised his foot and scored the first goal. The two sides attacked and defended for a long time and did not score again. South China FC won by a large margin of 3-0.

### Hong Kong Annual Track and Field Event Held Yesterday, Yang Xuhua Won First Place in the 10,000-Meter Race

The 24th Annual Sports Meet of the Hong Kong School Entrance Examination Association was held at the school's sports ground on Pokfulam Road at 1:30 PM yesterday.

The individual champion was Jie Min, the runner-up was Lin Yucheng, the dormitory champion was Molli Hall, and the third place was Yilu Hall and De Mara Hall.

### Eastern FC Defeated the Navy 1-0 in a Difficult Battle; Liu Xianhan Defended Alone, Repelling Thousands of Troops

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Eastern played against the Navy in a Group A football league match at the Navy Ground in Causeway Bay. Many of the Navy's former mainstays have gone to sea with their ships, forcing them to use new forces. However, the overall combat power of the team is still very strong and retains its original style (fierce and fast). The midfield line was not disbanded due to Dixon's absence, and the skills of transportation and interception were fully revealed. For 70 minutes, the Navy's midfielders and forwards were in an advantageous position for 60 minutes. If their two forwards were as good as Philips, Armstrong, and Condie, they would not have lost 0-1.

Yesterday, the Navy's two forwards were restrained by Zeng Zhongyun and Miao Huaguo, losing their ability to support each other. However, each of the midfielders lofted high balls to allow the forwards to charge, and Tuoban and others used their height and long legs to head off several dangerous balls, causing Eastern to panic. If it were not for the strong defense and narrow escape, the score of Eastern's defeat would have been beyond our expectations.

Zhongyun wore new football shoes and was very excited. He did not make a mistake once in 70 minutes. It can be said that this was Zhongyun's best performance in his life. Miao Huaguo and Xu Jingcheng also gave very brave performances. The short-legged tiger Liu Shizan happened to meet the giant Tuoban. One tall and one short, they entangled each other all day long. Although the short-legged tiger was strenuous, the giant also felt a headache.

Eastern's forwards had many injured soldiers. Song Lingsheng had ankle pain, Hou Chengtou had foot injuries, and they lost their mobility. Wu Qixiang made many mistakes, Li Deqi was scattered and incompetent, only Chen Bingtu made amazing progress, breaking through many barriers, which was the source of the victory. Eastern's victory regained a lot of reputation. It is also gratifying that South China FC, who lost to the police on the same day, relied on Eastern to snatch two points from the Navy, so that their highest position was not shaken, and the hope of winning the championship was still higher than everything else. Therefore, Eastern indirectly benefited South China, and its contribution was even greater than South China's victory over the Navy last week.

(Navy Team)

First Half

(One Minute) As soon as the whistle sounded, the contact began. Eastern showed great power and won the treasure. Just as Li Si sent it up, Bingtu ran madly to attack. J. Hanneyville could not stop him. Bingtu crossed the ball at the baseline, and Chengliu lurked at the corner of the goal and headed it in, opening the scoring (1-0).

(Thirteen Minutes) Linbashi cut diagonally into the center, Newlands rushed forward to head the ball, Xianhan caught it quickly, and avoided a mishap. In an instant, Tuoban made a cold shot, Xianhan panicked and撲ed, the ball rolled in front of the goal, and Zhongyun rescued it quickly before Newlands rushed to the front.

(Fifteen Minutes) Jingcheng lofted the ball, and Gorutas rushed out to catch it. Unexpectedly, the target was inaccurate and walked past the landing point. When he turned back, the ball was in front of the goal. Gorutas quickly turned back and passed the ball, and only conceded a corner kick, which was fortunate.

(Thirty-Two Minutes) Allison got the pass from Hanneyville and had a chance to pass the ball into the center. Newlands headed the ball but did not hit it. The left winger Linbashi dribbled forward and shot again, but it was ineffective.

Second Half

(Seven Minutes) McGilista got the support from the midfielder and shot from 30 yards away. Xianhan's line of sight was blocked by his teammates, and he almost made a mistake.

(Fifteen Minutes) Shizan fought with Tuoban and mistakenly committed a handball. Healy took the free kick, and the Navy's forwards poured into Eastern's goal. Tuoban greeted the ball and headed it fiercely. Xianhan patted it out, Linbashi intercepted it and shot it out, and Xianhan caught it with all his might and sent it out with one foot.

(Twenty-Three Minutes) Linbashi headed the ball in front of the goal, Xianhan deflected it out of bounds, and only conceded a corner kick.

(Thirty Minutes) Lingsheng got the ball and attacked. The Navy's guards intercepted each other. During the entanglement, Lingsheng's two shorts suddenly split with a loud sound, exposing his flesh. At this time, Eastern's defense was tight. Lingsheng had to cover his bare flesh with his hands and walked off the field to change into new pants before returning to defense. At this time, the Navy was still attacking fiercely and besieged for a long time but could not win, so they lost 0-1.

### Victory Followed by Defeat: South China Neglects Opponent, Loses; 4-3 Warning; Even Victory is Worth Boasting

(Special dispatch from this station) Generally, people all hope that South China and Police will meet again in the championship match held at the boundary field. The victory or defeat of this police team will significantly affect the overall situation. If South China can remain undefeated after this, then this year's championship will undoubtedly belong to them. However, if they lose one game, the situation will change again, indirectly giving the Seamen a chance to compete. (Fortunately, the Seamen also lost yesterday, otherwise South China's hopes of winning the championship would be slim). Therefore, many fans went to the scene to watch the game, but unexpectedly, the South China team relapsed into their old habits. The generals underestimated the enemy, causing many mistakes. As a result, they suffered a disastrous defeat with a score of 4-3 after initially leading. The fans came full of excitement but left disappointed. South China's lack of ambition is indeed a disappointment to the general fans' expectations.

In yesterday's match, South China faced Police with a complete lineup and should have been more than capable of handling them. However, they failed to win when they should have. The main reasons for their failure were the generals' underestimation of the enemy and poor teamwork. Guo Yingqi had already performed abnormally, and then Zhang Rongcai in the defense was also unreliable. Logically, the generals should have worked hard, secured multiple victories, and laid a solid foundation. However, each member took the enemy lightly. Initially, they used short, dense passes, not understanding that the field was narrow and short, and that short-pass tactics were not suitable. Passing around in circles wasted time and caused Fei De to lose the ball. Then, they were too hasty and abandoned their original battle strategy. Feng Jingxiang, who took the final penalty kick, also shot with excessive force due to his eagerness to draw, and was saved by Mai Hedi. This last chance was also missed. From this reporter's observation, Jingxiang was skilled at taking penalty kicks, but his shooting power was no longer as strong as before, making it easier for the goalkeeper to save. In the future, if South China encounters such a good opportunity, Deng Guangsen should be given a chance to try. Police's performance was mediocre, but the entire team was brave and had plenty of energy in yesterday's battle. The forwards Lai Motu's sprints and Hua Liya's passes created scoring opportunities. The three forwards in the defense were more solid than the two defenders. Mai Hedi's performance was acceptable. The person who gave the best impression to our Chinese fans throughout the match was the Chinese player who played for Police. Their performance had no rude actions and had the demeanor of a great general. Police's final comeback victory was also due to the contributions of Huang and Fan.

With a whistle, the two armies began to fight, like a tug-of-war. At this time, thousands of fans were surprised and delighted to see this situation. After a long battle, Feng suddenly snatched the ball, and immediately passed it to Lao Luo, who got A Dou. He flew along the side and reached the key place, then crossed. At that time, Zhaorong happened to stand in the key place without surveillance. Seeing the ball flying over, he aimed at the target and shot it into the net. After winning, South China continued to besiege. Li and Feng repeatedly shot at the door, but the ball fell wild, so it did not bear fruit. The police also counterattacked. Mo Shi and Wengui attacked along the side one after another. Guicai tried to respond twice, but the situation was quite urgent at the time. Fortunately, Tiansheng was well suppressed and kicked to save the day. At this time, South China escaped a disaster and came to attack again. Yingqi passed to Li in the key place, and Li wrote casually and shot into the net. The police lost again and again, unwilling to do so. So launched a large-scale counterattack. The ball was led by Hualiya, Rongzhao and Shaohan both intercepted. After slight evasion, he shot far to the door. The ball was as fast as an arrow, and Rongcai was so shocked that the ball slipped into the net from the corner. Before long, the first half ended.

In the second half, South China pressed again to Huacha's position. Feng and Li rushed into the key place to knock on the door one after another for no less than five or six times. Then Guangsen brought the ball to the center again. Yingqi rushed to the door to respond. Nafu jumped up and topped it. Unexpectedly, in a panic, the ball slipped into the door. Although Mai Hedi wanted to save it, it was too late. Police lost again, and tried their best to counterattack. Finally, with the short pass of Qu Shide and Wengui, they grabbed back a ball. And Guicai also got the chance to shoot and scored another one, competing to a tie. Finally, Moshide got a wonderful pass from the side, and Guicai used his head to top another ball. South China rose up to pursue after winning first and then losing, and the battle was chaotic. Wang He Nafu rushed to save, and the twelve-yard free kick with his hand and kiss the ball was placed in front of the door and kicked by Jingxiang. How could the magic leg be eager for peace, distracted, miscontrolled, swept too right, and had no strength, so it was saved by Mai Hedi. South China only had a chance to survive, but it was also missed, and there was no way to recover. As a result, he returned with a 4-3 loss. (Solid Book

### Men's Basketball Tournament: Eastern Club Wins Big; Three More Matches Today

The open men's basketball tournament had three games held last night at 6:30 PM in the youth basketball gym. In the first game, Group B International beat Taikoo with a score of 54-35. In the second game, Group A Eastern played South China. Under the contact between the two sides, the competition was very fierce. The two teams were more eager to win, and their actions gradually went out of bounds. This was the only flaw. After the outbreak of the war, Eastern took the lead, and South China was not to be outdone. In the first half, the two sides tied at 21-21. When they changed places to fight again, Eastern tried to take the offensive, and South China tried their best to wait for each other. At the end of the game, South China was defeated by 35-54. The last game Huaxiong won South China with a score of 41-25. The Group A battle continued as follows:

The Group A game should be very interesting. Judging from the strength of the two teams, Hong Kong University has strong combat power with Yang Xuhua, Qin Jingrong, Zhang Shaomian, and Lei Wei Lian and other players. Guangda, such as Liang Jie, Zheng Yutang, Lu Dong, Liang Jiangqiang, and Yu Bingheng are also experienced fighters. However, Hong Kong University has a stronger offensive power and should be able to win. In Group B, Red Star vs. Chenguang, the two teams have equal strength and the outcome is unpredictable. Guangzhong vs. Kangyuan, Guangzhong is quite strong, and Kangyuan may not be its opponent. Also, group tickets can be purchased from Cai Guoping. The players of the two Group A teams are as follows:

### International Film Industry Dynamics

(1) Mussolini founded the "Film Village" in the former Italian capital, specializing in producing films promoting the dynamics of the Italian dictatorship. Last year, the project produced 184 films, which were shipped abroad for screening. Only 18 of them were screened in the United States, 44 in the United Kingdom, and the most, of course, were in his comrades - Germany, reaching 72. The rest were banned.

(2) Japanese actress Uemura Musume, who has been with Paramount Pictures in the United States for seven or eight years, was recently fired by the company. The reason for this is that after the Sino-Japanese War, her productions suffered a sharp drop in box office revenue, which dissatisfied the company's authorities and led to this move. According to the exclusion of foreign actors in Hollywood, it is still unheard of.

(3) Since the completion of the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan, its film industry has also made rapid progress. It is currently producing more than 40,000 reels of newsreels to be sent to the 1939 New York World's Fair. These short films will allow foreign audiences to understand the Soviet Union's overview and its national strength.

(4) There will be a major change in the British film industry. A business group called Philip Joint Enterprise Company is preparing to acquire 600 to 700 cinemas across the UK. At the same time, an Odeon company is also preparing to acquire 300 cinemas belonging to the Gaomeng Film Company. According to general speculation, behind this organization, there must be some Jewish millionaires who fled from Germany to support it, so there is such a huge capital.

(5) There are many overseas Chinese in the Dutch territory, so domestic films originally occupied a considerable force there. After the outbreak of the war, the Cantonese films monopolized the entire market invisibly, which reduced the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in their belief in the motherland. Therefore, everyone is eager for Shanghai's Mandarin films to be shipped there as soon as possible.

(6) China's famous humor writer Lin Yutang has been engaged in writing and screenwriting in the United States, which has been popular for a while and is very popular among foreigners. Recently, he also wrote a new script for child star Shirley Temple, entitled "Little Craftsman", which will start shooting soon. According to the Chinese people who write scripts in Hollywood, this is the arrow.

(7) Hollywood producers have recently been trying their best to make films about the war to cater to the psychology of people all over the world.

(8) The anti-fascist activities in Hollywood, USA, also have a clear performance and strong force. According to statistics, 15,000 film industry employees have joined the Anti-Fascist Committee (including the famous "Earth" star Paul Muni, Louise Rainer, etc.), and the calls for assistance to China and Spain have shocked the entire silver capital.

### The Economic Situation of Movie Stars with Strong Exterior but Weak Interior

Some people say, "Artists are mostly romantic, their purpose is entirely in aesthetics and expression, and their desire is only to obtain a pleasant state. If there is something stored in their hearts, they must express it, so money is scattered as soon as it is obtained, and they have no time to take care of the future. As a result, old age is difficult and they die in poverty." This statement, of course, has sufficient reasons. It can be seen that American movie stars, although their weekly salary income is mostly around 10,000 gold, still have to borrow money to live on, which is nothing more than spending as much as possible and being extremely extravagant. As for whether the facts are completely true, only you can come to complain.

In the past year or two, debt lawsuits have often occurred in the American film industry. Several popular stars have now been heard of bankruptcy, which has attracted a lot of attention from people in society, who have expressed great surprise, thinking that the income of stars is more than other occupations. Where did the money they earned go? Even the judges who interrogated the stars' bankruptcies often raised this question. According to general stars, "Although our starring in a film has a weekly salary specified in the contract, after several layers of exploitation, and then deducting all expenses, the actual amount obtained is very small. No one believes this, and in order to make a living, we still have to make a star appearance and spend money like mud. We have no savings on weekdays, and once our work is interrupted, the original shape will be revealed."

In the past, all film companies signed contracts with Ming Ping directly. Later, because the stars often relied on their status and were not subject to jurisdiction, the major film companies jointly formed an actor introduction office, with self-operated newspapers and magazines, used by contemporary stars for publicity. Since they have the power of public opinion, the stars dare not but listen to their orders, and it is much easier to be convinced in the event of an incident. As a rule, a 10% introduction fee is charged for signing contracts introduced by them, so the salary of the stars is invisibly discounted by 9%.

Taking a weekly salary of 10,000 yuan as an example, a 90% discount should also have 9,000 yuan. In the eyes of ordinary people, it is more than enough to maintain personal life. Unfortunately, the environment is a luxurious place, and it is impossible to be frugal. Anyone who can star in a film must already have a considerable status in the film industry. For the sake of one's own identity, one cannot show a poor appearance to anyone. Speaking of living, a small house in Hollywood costs 750 yuan to 2,000 yuan per month, and a slightly more gorgeous one costs more than 5,000 yuan. In addition, the cost of internal furnishings accounts for about 20% of the star's monthly income. There are also self-built houses, and the construction cost is easily 60,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan. The only way to obtain this huge amount of money is to borrow money from the bank, and the monthly interest will also cost a lot. In terms of transportation, it is really not enough to have only one or two cars. Whenever a car company produces a new car, it always has to find a way to wind it. Some even have to prepare a plane. As for the servants, each has their own expertise, which is the custom in Hollywood. Each person's monthly salary is always between 200 yuan and 400 yuan. In addition, hiring a secretary costs about one month's salary a year. In order to connect with all parties, a dance party once a week must be held. Often the cost of wine and feasts in one night is tens of thousands of dollars. At the end of the month, a huge fee must be written out to subsidize the film reporters stationed in Hollywood in order to show mercy under the pen. Otherwise, the loss of personal reputation is a big deal, and the job is a big deal, so how can it not be? The stars' clothes seem to be very broad, but who knows that they are all prepared for acting. They have to buy costumes at a high price according to the identity of the characters in the play. After a film is over, they work too hard and should take a short trip to recuperate. However, the salary has long been spent. I have to borrow money. If I unfortunately fall into the web of love, then the date of bankruptcy is not far away. What's more, you have to pay huge income taxes. However, people who do good deeds in society only see their income and do not see their expenses. As soon as there is a good deed, they all feel that the stars are the most generous. Who knows that the stars' donations are taken out with gritted teeth?

### Silver Flower

— Yun

Everyone knows that Heidi Lamore threatens Garbo quite seriously, and even Garbo herself can't help but feel a little uneasy. However, there is one thing that is absolutely not in the biography of the mysterious woman, but Heidi Ramore has, that is, likes to make friends. Heidi Lamore loves to make friends, and often goes to dance halls and theaters. Most movie stars refuse to send photos and autographs to people, but she is willing to. She also gladly agrees to fans' requests to communicate and make friends with her. Don't worry, Garbo, no matter what, the title of this mysterious woman is still yours.

The famous critic Matilda Trotter said that under the silver screen, Jack O'Keefe is the only one of the countless male stars in Hollywood who has the most sex appeal. This made Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, and Robert Taylor look at each other, while Jack Kerr said triumphantly, "Matilda Trotter is really the best critic in the world."

### Two Kinds of Peace

— Boshan

Fourteen years ago, when Premier Sun was dying, he intermittently issued a weak cry: "Peace, struggle, save China!"

Fourteen years later, when China launched a great national struggle, shameless traitors stuttered and said: "Peace, struggle, save China."

The former's peace is the peace of struggle. The peace that saves China: the latter's peace, however, is the peace of kneeling compromise, the peace of destroying China. The former is based on patriotism, while the latter is based on a Konoe declaration. The biggest difference is that one is a conscious and spontaneous national awakening, and the other is a traitor who has sold his soul, echoing the harsh demands of the invaders who are trying to destroy our country and exterminate our race. From this, we can see the difference in personality and understanding between the Premier and the traitors. Sincerity and hypocrisy, greatness and shamelessness, the Premier clearly showed us, "To achieve this goal, we must awaken the people and unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally. Struggle together." That is to say, to complete the great mission of the National Revolution, we must awaken the people internally and unite the whole country, and then seek sympathy from the world, and help us and treat us equally. Unite the national and ethnic groups, and struggle together to resist aggression and strive for the ideal of lasting world peace and the rule of great harmony.

Therefore, when the great and heroic anti-Japanese and anti-fascist war began, we not only gave the aggressors a painful blow with a fearless revolutionary spirit, but also followed the Premier's legacy to unite all parties and factions in the country into an inseparable unified front. At the same time, we closely liaised with countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union that were fair and just and helped us, and cut off ties with the fascist bandit countries that were accomplices of the Japanese Kou, so as not to be exploited. This is what the Premier's legacy implies to us, the attitude we should take in this unprecedented environment.

But what about our traitors who talk about peace? They are deeply afraid that China will win and real peace will come. So first, they oppose cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and split national unity; second, they advocate taking the German-Italian route, neglect the friendly assistance of other democratic countries, and reject the moral assistance of the Soviet Union; third, they slander guerrilla warfare and scorched earth policy, and even advocate immediately giving up the war and accepting Konoe's peace demands to realize the so-called peace of the East Asian New Order. This is the traitor's planned means of betraying the country and the nation, and this is the peace proposition that the traitor loudly proclaims.

### Culture and Martial Arts

— Xing Zaitian

Because the Soviet Union is Japan's deadly enemy, the traitors raised by the Japanese are also particularly jealous of Soviet Russia. However, both the master and the traitor have one thing in common, that is, they avoid the Soviet Union and conspire against China and the Chinese people.

For example, in the Northeast and in the occupied areas, the Japanese killed Chinese people by putting a "communist" hat on them. The master's style is like this, and the Han Yu cannot be an exception. They always echoed and shouted indiscriminately. For example, recently several cultural people went to Xinjiang one after another, so this has also become the material for the dogs to bark indiscriminately, saying: "Recently, a group of cultural people who are attached to the Communist Party are singing about going to Xinjiang again - the more generous ones do not hesitate to take the royalties they get from their brains, and buy expensive air tickets, and travel by wind, how enviable!"

In fact, whether those cultural people who went to Xinjiang are attached to the Communist Party, we don't know, but what is commendable is that they use what they have earned from their own labor to supply themselves with airplanes, and "do not hesitate to take the royalties they get from their brains" to buy air tickets, which is even higher than fleeing the country in a stolen plane. And biting those treacherous people who get "gold tickets" from their masters and bark like dogs every day is even more noble. Of course, people who take airplanes to Xinjiang are "enviable people", but treacherous people are hated by people, and it is not an exaggeration to "eat their flesh and sleep on their skin", which is the public opinion of the Chinese people.

For three months, a certain newspaper has never told the truth. Only on that day did they tell the truth. We can also borrow it to admonish treacherous people.

"After all, the cultural level of the southeastern Jiangsu and Zhejiang and southwestern Guangdong provinces is higher, and they opened up earlier. The general public has the intelligence to judge a new problem or a new event. No matter how propagandists propagate or tell lies, it is not easy to be effective for a while."

This is very true, so I often see a certain newspaper being smeared with a ball of ink and written with the four characters "Traitor's Dog Shit" in the reading rooms of several schools, which shows that propaganda and lying are really useless. Not only can it not be effective, but it is even more dangerous, and it is related to life. Therefore, the people not only have a high level of "culture", but also a not weak level of "martial arts" to eliminate traitors and exterminate criminals!

### Record of Mr. Chen Yinke

— Zhang Chunfeng

Before the ancient city fell, in the secluded paths of Tsinghua Garden in the western suburbs, one could often encounter a weak-looking scholar with disheveled hair, a weary spirit, wearing a long gown, Chinese trousers, and Chinese-style cloth shoes, walking unsteadily. He would carry a large bundle of books under his left arm, appearing burdened and in pain from the weight. This frail scholar was none other than Mr. Chen Yinke, renowned in scholarly circles and famous overseas.

Meeting Mr. Chen, one might not immediately recognize his extraordinary knowledge. However, if you engaged in conversation with him, his gentle yet captivating words would undoubtedly leave you completely humbled and in awe. But you must not judge him solely by his unkempt appearance and assume he is merely a bookworm. Confucius himself erred in judging Ziyu by appearances, let alone us ordinary mortals with limited insight.

Those who studied under Mr. Chen almost all knew his quirks. Firstly, he disliked idle chatter. If you visited Mr. Chen and engaged in pointless conversation, he would simply close his mouth first, then close his eyes, waiting for you to take your leave. He detested meaningless talk. Secondly, he needed to rest and sleep at one o'clock every afternoon. This is the reason for his "weary spirit" mentioned earlier. Mr. Chen's health was poor, and he required ample rest, which was the price he paid for his vast knowledge. If a visitor was unaware of this, Mr. Chen would bluntly tell them, "Excuse me, I need to sleep!" However, Mr. Chen's third quirk was his love of reading. During the day, he rarely put down a book, always reading. Surprisingly, he was not an old-fashioned bookworm but a highly scientific and innovative thinker with a practical research spirit. I recall once when Mr. Chen was teaching "Research on the History of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," discussing Liu Tui's "Collected Works," he focused on the preface's line, "Wild water enters the treasury..." He concluded that it referred to the flooding in Hunan province in August and even produced newspapers from the past three years to prove the reality of these annual floods.

### Feelings of the Night

— Dong Hao

Climbing over mountains, galloping across plains, crossing icy rivers, passing through dark forests, carrying a heavy burden, walking on narrow and uneven riverbanks. I lowered my head, letting the cold wind sweep through my tangled hair. The water lightly lapped against the stony beach, like the whispers of ghosts.

Crows circled above the pine forest, their cawing echoing in the air. One, two... the distant silhouettes of sails finally disappeared completely into the darkness: the sparse branches, stripped of their leaves, became a pitch-black mass.

A dusky veil draped over the river's surface. The earth sank into deep slumber once more. Blackness embraced the mountains and rivers, the riverbanks, and the water's surface. The cold wind, like a wounded wild ox, whirled and howled in the sky, as if disturbing their slumber. The distant barking of dogs in the village was tight, striking into our hearts.

Ahead was a small river, lying quietly here, like a small wooden plank laid across, this was the bridge.

To the right was the vast river, the inky sky. From the thickets on the left came the sharp sound of the wind, the withered grass on the desolate and decaying tombs rustling in the gale... all of this painted a night sky brewing a storm. I stood upright by the bridge, gazing into the distance, like a sentinel on the frontier.

Finally, my heart began to beat faster. My legs began to tremble. Then, unconsciously, I sat down, slumped, afraid, like a weary wild beast.

The gale lifted my long coat, cold streams stabbing into my chest. I hurriedly pressed the bundle beneath me. The dogs barked louder and more tightly, the wind howling more mournfully.

"Last night, cold stars filled the night sky; moonlight shone, bringing quiet slumber to the earth. But tonight, dark clouds completely cover the horizon. This terrible night!"

Low chants drifted across the night's wilderness. Whose children were these, voicing their cries under the pressure of suffering? Drifting, drifting toward the horizon, finally swallowed by the gale.

However, what followed was a great roar:

"We need light, we need a clear sky! Let the darkness die quickly, advance boldly! Like a brave warrior, seek the clarity after the storm!"

Between the mountains, in the thickets, in the cracks of the stony beach, the roar echoed in every corner. Like a great bell, like a lion's roar. No matter how the gale howled, it could not drown it out.

I suddenly stood up, as if waking from a nightmare, my heart stirring. Was it God's guidance, or the nightingale's song, telling me of a smooth path? I steadied my feet, suppressed the surging of my heart, picked up the bundle, and hunched over, with light, joyful, and brave steps, walked across the bridge.

The night road unfolded before me. I moved forward without hesitation, a lighthouse of light erected in my heart.

The wind became even fiercer, but soon calmed down. In the verdant pine forest, the sound of the wind still whispered, the clouds in the sky flying.

The moon had already revealed its face. The dense clouds still wanted to struggle. Intense light and the clouds were constantly battling. On the illuminated riverbank, I stepped on the shadows of the tree branches on the ground, watching the dark clouds gradually disappear.

Countless stars shone upon the thickets, the desolate tombs, the riverbanks, and the water's surface, a scene of light! I cheered, I prostrated myself, facing the starry sky.

### He Resolves to Be a Marksman!

— Hu Kao

On the flat beach

The sound of a great storm rises

Bringing the mixed smells of blood and gunpowder

Covering

Villages

Farmsteads

Valleys

——Every piece of soil.

No longer the Peach Blossom Spring of our dreams

This subtropical lush orchard

In the distance

Cattle and sheep in the grazing field

Like countless stars of summer nights

At the seashore

When the sun is about to return

Those dreamy, long coconut trees!

Now

In the atmosphere of gunpowder smoke

Like paper money turned to flying ash.

Hainan

Has my sincere friend

He told me not to worry about his safety

In the guerrilla ranks

He resolves to be a marksman

This must be forged into the tungsten steel-like strength and tenacity

Although our tenacity

Is currently not enough to stop the × people from advancing

But "death" cannot shift his will

The rushing "blood flow"

Is precisely the cultivation of the new China.

### Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

And when her gaze met his and formed a straight line, she felt his eyes flashing with the electric fire of a demon, and her eyes were blinded, instinctively covering her face with both hands. She cried out in alarm.

This cry aroused in him a ruthless violence, as if he had truly become a hideous demon, regretting leaving the greatest evil in this universe; even if he foresaw that tomorrow he would inevitably repent, or others would punish him: however, he would never escape, or abandon this task of a sinner today. He wanted to shoot; his reason prevented him:

"Your pistol is not to harm her!"

So, he could only open his eyes wide, clench his lips tightly, and pull out his pistol from his pocket, threatening her not to make a sound, he...

"When you make a sound, you must be careful..."

But she cried instinctively, crying out loud. This cry was the resistance of the weak.

For his own safety and the success of his work, he had to gag her throat with a handkerchief, making her hoarse; as if letting the maid who replaced her and lived a little longer make up for her shortcomings. He also said:

"When you quit, you must be careful of your life!"

Then, his words, for her, were the most authoritative command.

She obeyed and followed, with only tears, and no cries. The soles of her feet had a uniform elasticity; making her whole body tremble. A weakling, when her life loses its master, her flesh and bones are softened, allowing only a wisp of breath, in panting, to prolong her vitality. She was like a fledgling swallow left behind in a flock of swallows, losing direction in the vast sky, flying blankly towards an unknowable distance, although it had already foreseen that its future destination was an unfortunate nest; however, it could only entrust everything to fate. When a person lets fate decide, it is like a boat that has lost its rudder at sea, letting the wind and waves lead it wherever they please; it is like an ownerless wild grave in the suburbs, never inherited and guarded by anyone, allowing anyone to destroy it. She obediently changed her shoes and put on her clothes. However, she deliberately fastened her buttons slowly, hoping to prolong the time with the buttons, so that she could linger for a moment longer in this bedroom that she had grown tired of in the past; in the meantime, perhaps a rescuing hand would break through the wall and drag her away, drag her to a place of happiness. Illusion, who says it is not beautiful? But, who says fantasy can be beautiful for long? So she only deepened her original pain. (Eleven)
