### Promoting National Spiritual Mobilization: Shanghai's Anti-Traitor Movement

The Press: Declaration Denouncing Traitors

(Special Shanghai Dispatch) The 21st was the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector in the city's spiritual mobilization. Practitioners in the city's press have issued a joint declaration, vehemently denouncing the fallacious arguments and reckless actions of traitors, and calling on all citizens to block all avenues for Wang Jingwei and his cohorts' activities. The full text of the declaration is recorded below:

As the national resistance war has entered its second phase, Japanese imperialism has realized that its dream of annexing China by force is unattainable. Therefore, it is particularly focused on traitorous activities, on the one hand attempting to divide and disintegrate China's resistance front, and on the other hand concealing its new offensives, seeking to relax China's vigilance. Among these, the treacherous activities of Wang Jingwei and his cronies are particularly prominent, appearing with the guise of "peace" and "direct negotiations," spreading national defeatist sentiments with extreme viciousness. Wang's "peace" proposal echoes the smoke screen of Konoe's East Asia New Order. Although he himself can justify it, it is actually a thorough and utter condition for national subjugation. As Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "If this is considered peace, there is no word for surrender in the dictionary!" Today is the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector during the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. We solemnly declare: We are determined to exhaust our efforts to oppose the activities of aggressors and traitors. We will resist all activities of aggressors and Wang's clique! We demand that all citizens rise up together to oppose the ghostly actions of Wang and all traitors, and block the path for any activities by the Wang clique and all traitors.

Shanghai Main Newspaper Editorial: "Launch an Anti-Wang Movement"

Furthermore, the Shanghai Shen Bao's editorial on the 22nd of this month, titled "Launch an Anti-Wang Movement," reads: Today, as the national spiritual mobilization is being promoted, an anti-Wang movement should be launched immediately. Only anti-Wang is the most concrete manifestation of the concentrated will of all of China at this stage.

To recognize the necessity of the anti-Wang movement, it is necessary to first eliminate all excuses for Wang Zhaoming's actions. Some people believe that Wang Zhaoming's absurd behavior is nothing more than a temporary error in observation, and that his motives are still understandable. In fact, Wang Zhaoming's treachery was planned in advance. Therefore, he repeatedly made strange remarks, and finally colluded with Konoe in a charade, acting as an internal accomplice of the Japanese warlords. After the treachery became obvious, he showed no remorse, but instead intensified his actions, forging documents, spreading rumors, and instigating his followers to engage in traitorous organizations. Can this kind of planned and step-by-step action be considered a temporary error in observation? Others cherish Wang Zhaoming's past political life, believing that although he is currently misguided, he may be treated with leniency. In fact, forgiving a person is nothing more than hoping that they can repent. Since Wang Zhaoming will not repent, what is the use of forgiving him? Moreover, a person's goodness or evil depends entirely on their final performance. Although Wang Zhaoming's body has not yet reached the time to be buried, his spirit has already ended his life. He has already manifested himself as a national traitor. Even if he had one or two small good deeds in the past, how can they cover up his final treachery? Moreover, Wang Zhaoming's entire life history is one of speculation. In order to exert his desire for leadership, he habitually engaged in fickle and capricious activities. He cannot even be found to have engaged in minor good deeds and kept minor promises. What can we cherish about him? Still others believe that Wang Zhaoming has no masses except for a few henchmen, and that his remarks are merely personal actions and will not have any effect at all. They argue that we should let him destroy himself and not pay so much attention to him. In fact, it is true that Wang Zhaoming has no masses and is not worthy of attention. However, he is now a tool of the Japanese warlords. His master has taken out some money from that pitiful pocket to promote him and win over ugly people, with serious intentions. At the same time, his henchmen are actively working, planning to use printing materials or the education sector to carry out their ghostly tricks and achieve their conspiracy to bewitch people. If we do not prevent it and allow it to grow, it cannot be tolerated in the process of resistance war.

We only need to read Wu Zhihui's vernacular literary condemnation of Wang Zhaoming to know how deliberately he plotted to betray the country, how he became an internal accomplice of the Japanese warlords, destroyed his political life, and how he continued to carry out his conspiracy without remorse. Therefore, every Chinese should know that Wang Zhaoming is unforgivable, and that forgiving a traitor is a crime.

Since Wang Zhaoming offered his plan to subjugate China to his "friendly nation," Japan has begun a new offensive in Jiangxi and other places since early March. However, in addition to repeatedly stating its firm stance of resistance, the Chinese government is launching counter-offensives when the Japanese side is exhausted, and winning victories one after another. This is tantamount to shattering the joint conspiracy of the Japanese warlords and Wang Zhaoming. However, this is not enough. The Chinese people should coordinate the universal anti-Wang movement with the government's actions, so that Wang Zhaoming's conspiracy will not only be shattered temporarily, but will never happen again.

The content of the anti-Wang movement should be to eliminate all defeatist theories. First, resistance is a national policy, and victory in the resistance is an inevitable result. The facts of the past twenty-one months have proved that China has not been defeated at all, and Japan has already embarked on a path of defeat. Therefore, there is fundamentally no basis for the so-called "mutual destruction." Before reaching the goal of victory, there is fundamentally no peace to be discussed. If one talks about peace recklessly, that is treason. Second, China's united front is established based on actual needs. It is currently growing and being enriched, without any signs of rupture. Even after the resistance war ends in the future, China will still build a brand-new Three Principles of the People republic in the united front camp, and there is no possibility of rupture. Those who make unnecessary worries about China's future are also traitors. In the anti-Wang movement, everyone should bear the responsibility of reporting defeatist theories and correcting them.

The anti-Wang movement should be universal and organized. It should be coordinated with spiritual mobilization as one of the essential items for the implementation of spiritual mobilization. As for Shanghai, the anti-Wang movement should be led by the education sector, and the education sector itself should first conduct a thorough ideological purge, because the nature of the anti-Wang movement is the struggle for truth in consciousness, and it is most appropriate for the education sector to lead it. It is also widely rumored that Wang's henchmen are trying to carry out conspiracies in Shanghai's education sector, injecting ideological germs.

The anti-Wang movement should be expanded as much as possible into the guerrilla areas. Because in the areas controlled by the Japanese puppets, Chinese compatriots are subject to knowledge blockade and cannot easily understand the current situation in China. At the same time, the Japanese puppets are actively carrying out anesthetizing and enslaving spiritual training, promoting Wang Zhaoming as the true savior in puppet newspapers, deceiving Chinese compatriots. Therefore, the anti-Wang movement should infiltrate the occupied areas, using all possible methods to expose the Japanese puppets' intentions in promoting Wang, and promote the true meaning of resistance war, eliminating the spiritual imprisonment of suffering compatriots.

Youth Sector: Expanding the United Front

The 20th was the Propaganda Day for the education sector in the National Spiritual Mobilization. In addition to holding large-unit teaching of the outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization in all schools and publishing special issues in various newspapers, the Education Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association issued a letter to the city's youth. Excerpts are as follows:

Youths are the proud children of the era, with simple minds, intelligent brains, lively spirits, strong bodies, and a glorious revolutionary history. In China, whether it is politics, culture, or science, nothing has not been initiated, promoted, and transformed by youths, and gradually achieved its purpose. During the May Fourth Movement, our country's youths made brilliant contributions to the enlightenment of political culture. Even among the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, most of those who sacrificed were youths. After that, during the May 30th Movement, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, there was no time when youth students were not calling out and active in the great tide of national salvation. From the tense situation in North China to the sound of the anti-Japanese artillery fire at the Lugou Bridge, the dynamics of the youth are particularly worth exciting and encouraging. From the front lines to the rear areas, from regular warfare to guerrilla warfare, nearly hundreds of thousands of youths are braving the wind and rain, enduring hunger and cold, running around and working hard, and sacrificing to save the country. It is indeed worth writing a big book about in the history of national revolution. But what about the youths on our isolated island? There are certainly those who are diligent and hardworking and strive for the country, but more than 80% of the youths are still living their drunken and dreamy lives, maintaining their habits of living in a perfunctory and opportunistic manner, full of lifelessness, not seeking knowledge and not seeking action. All the pioneering and vigorous vitality, the determination to move forward bravely, the frugal and upright customs, and the moral values of loyalty, righteousness, and knowing shame have become as rare as the morning stars on the isolated island. Although there are more than one million youths on the isolated island, most of them are just waiting for the country to be subjugated or waiting for the arrival of victory, and are willing to abandon the sacred mission of saving and building the country during the Great Revolution. Even if they search their hearts in the quiet of the night, they cannot escape the curses of future generations. Now, we hope for the following from the city's youth:

Collective Struggle

The more advanced the society is, the more people's work tends to be collective. Only collective work can generate huge power. Especially in saving and building the country, it is necessary to organize all the people of the country and mobilize them in groups. The National Spiritual Mobilization is to use this group spirit and power to help the army resist the enemy and help the government build the country, so that the final victory, the revival of the nation, can be completed quickly. Therefore, young people should not only abandon their individualistic activities and enthusiastically participate in this group, but also automatically organize this group, or publicize and promote others to participate in this group.

Unified Belief

China's resistance war is not only to achieve national independence and freedom, but also to make nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood advance simultaneously and be implemented concretely. Since we are to build a free and happy new China based on the Three Principles of the People, then we must jointly believe in the Three Principles of the People, study the Three Principles of the People, promote the Three Principles of the People, and strive for the country's salvation for the Three Principles of the People. And after having a common belief, we will definitely be able to trust each other through common faith, making the united front of the people as strong as cement. With this, whatever obstacle cannot be destroyed, and with this to build the country, why worry about not achieving the goal.

Concentrated Will

During the resistance war, after having a common belief, there must also be a common will, without division and without confusion, moving towards a common goal, so that the enemy is weakened and shaken, and collapses from shaking. What is the common goal? That is, no matter what kind of work or career, we must not be afraid of hard work, design meticulously, so that it is helpful to the resistance war and beneficial to the country and the nation. In other words, we must always keep "national supremacy, national supremacy, national affairs first, and victory first" in mind and use it as the future of all work and careers.

Lifestyle Reform

In addition to the above, personal habits and lifestyle also have a great impact on the resistance war and national construction. Economic and time waste will certainly weaken the economy of the resistance war and delay the time of victory. It is to say, being sluggish and lazy, living in a perfunctory and opportunistic manner, and being mediocre and romantic are enough to subjugate the country. Moreover, front-line soldiers are sacrificing for the nation, and countless compatriots are suffering for the country. How can we alone enjoy ourselves? As for the young people studying at school, they should especially be diligent, hardworking, and vigorous, and be a model for the general youth, working for the resistance war and seeking knowledge for national construction. From today onwards, we ask to jointly assume the responsibility of saving and building the country, so that both economy and time can move towards the great road of revolution.

Cultural Sector: Declaration Supporting Resistance

The 21st was the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector. All newspapers and magazines in the city were mobilized to complete their missions in their respective positions. The following is a copy of a declaration: Today is the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector of the National Spiritual Mobilization. We, members of the cultural sector, are members of the nation and should actively participate in the spiritual mobilization movement, reverently swear to abide by the National Covenant, and practice the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline promulgated by the Central Government with all our strength. Culture is originally the spiritual industry of the country and the nation. The cause done by the cultural sector is the spiritual cause of the country and the nation. Therefore, the responsibility of the cultural sector to promote national spiritual mobilization is particularly important. Now, let's talk about it separately based on the views of our colleagues: The three major elements of war are manpower, financial resources, and military force. This is generally recognized. Manpower is the integrated and leading force of these three major elements, and spirit is the original driving force of all manpower. Specifically, spirit is the comprehensive, integrated, creative, and mobilizing force of human behavior. The so-called spiritual mobilization is to concentrate our comprehensive, integrated, creative, and mobilizing forces to work towards the three common goals of national supremacy, national supremacy, military affairs first, and victory first and to concentrate our will and concentrate our strength to complete the sacred task of resisting aggression and building the country. First of all, we must understand the necessity of resisting aggression and building the country. We cannot deny that for more than two hundred years in the past, our nation has indeed been sluggish. In the past, we have repeatedly suffered from foreign aggression, ceded land and paid indemnities, and lost our sovereignty, and we have almost not become a country. However, we still live in a perfunctory and opportunistic manner and do not strive for governance, so that the aggressors take advantage of the opportunity to invade and trample on our country's territory. Since the sleeping lion of East Asia roared angrily at Lugou Bridge, after more than twenty-one months of resistance war experience, we deeply know that only resistance can maintain the independence, freedom, and peace of the Chinese nation. Only building the country can consolidate and create the foundation of the difficult Republic of China. At the same time, international events have also fully proved that failing to resist aggression will lead to national subjugation. Compromising with the aggressor is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger and will inevitably suffer its own harm. From this point of view, we should continue to resist aggression and build the country, and there is no doubt about it. Our question is how to concentrate the country's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and strive to fight with the determination to break the cauldron and sink the boat to achieve the final victory. The task of resisting aggression and building the country is originally the duty of every citizen. We, members of the cultural sector, have always been praised by our compatriots as outstanding members of the nation. The responsibility for resisting aggression and building the country is naturally even more important. When the National Spiritual Mobilization is launched, we should swear to abide by the National Covenant and check our own lives. Make all actions able to conform to the Outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization and its implementation measures. We are all staff members of cultural undertakings, that is, promoters of spiritual undertakings. Our brains are the agency for issuing orders for our behavior. Our mouths and pens are our sharp weapons, and our limbs are our tools for mounting our horses to kill the enemy and dismounting to write announcements. From now on, we will dedicate our entire lives to the country and the nation. As for the implementation measures, we have other regulations and will not repeat them. This declaration.

Vocational Sector: Calling for Expanding Anti-Wang

The 21st was the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector in the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. In addition to issuing declarations, various newspapers also published special issues. The press also issued a declaration denouncing traitors, calling on citizens to block the Wang clique's movements. The 22nd was the Propaganda Day for the vocational sector. The Vocational Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association of this city issued a declaration of establishment. Various newspapers also published special issues. The following is a copy: Our country's resistance war is entering a new and more difficult stage. At this stage, as Supreme Leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has indicated, "To defeat the enemy and to succeed in building the country, a large part depends on the spiritual strength of every member of our nation. Moreover, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult, more difficult, and more dangerous our environment will inevitably be. We must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to achieve final success." Therefore, at this critical moment of life and death, success and failure, we must mobilize all the forces of the entire nation to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy to strive for the final victory of the Chinese nation's freedom and liberation. On March 12, the Central Government promulgated the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures, which is the most effective weapon to mobilize the power of the entire nation and attack the enemy's offensive. The people of the whole country, under the leadership of the government and the supreme leader, are actively promoting it. The General Headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal National Spiritual Mobilization Association was established earlier last month, and our Vocational Sector Headquarters also announced its establishment today following all sectors. In Shanghai, National Spiritual Mobilization has its special significance, and the tasks undertaken by the vocational sector are also particularly important. Shanghai is a political and economic center. The aggressors' political conspiracies and economic plunder are particularly severe, and the activities of traitors are extremely rampant. The Wang clique, which used to be based in other places, has recently moved to Shanghai to establish a major base, spreading rumors of peace, carrying out divisive conspiracies, and attempting to buy off corrupt elements in the cultural sector and the industrial and commercial sectors to serve as its followers. In the economic field, the enemy is issuing counterfeit currency, disrupting our financial foundation, controlling industry and commerce, strangling our national industry, and dumping inferior goods to absorb our funds. These are all the actions of the enemy in preparing for the final offensive. Therefore, our vocational sector must not only cooperate with all sectors in Shanghai to respond to the great call of the Supreme Leader's National Spiritual Mobilization, but also more effectively implement it and resolutely implement the important tasks entrusted to us by the government. However, in order to implement this movement thoroughly and completely innovate, we advocate that vocational sector personnel and vocational sector groups, based on the specific conditions and environment of each industry, take the following points as the center, and completely mobilize the entire vocational sector, regardless of upper and lower levels: (1) Launch the anti-Wang anti-traitor movement, improve political vigilance, eliminate all wavering and compromising thoughts, and strictly prevent the actions of all corrupt elements to eliminate the Wang clique and its followers' activities and strengthen our anti-war front. (2) Insist on not cooperating with the Japanese puppets. The financial sector must not use counterfeit money or engage in economic exchanges with the Japanese puppets. The industrial sector must not sell raw materials to the Japanese puppets or jointly establish enterprises with the Japanese puppets. The industrial and commercial sectors must not buy and sell Japanese goods and oppose all control by the Japanese puppets, so that the enemy has no way to seize our money for its use. (3) Mobilize funds, machinery, and talents to go inland to build a general rear area and consolidate the economic barrier. (4) Eliminate bad habits, crack down on speculation, correct the drunken and dreamy life, cultivate the pioneering spirit of the morning, break the selfish and self-interested attempts, and crack down on illegal business cases and speculation. (5) Participate in collective life. All vocational sector personnel who do not participate in the Commercial Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association should participate in the branch organizations of each industry of this association. Companies and stores should be led by managers to ensure that everyone can automatically and actively participate in collective life. (6) Implement savings and donations, quit bad habits, ban luxury and waste, and reduce the standard of living to save money to help victims and dedicate it to the country, and encourage those with assets to ruin their families to relieve the country's difficulties, and earnestly promote various movements that contribute to the country in spirit or material. (7) Concentrate strength and strengthen labor-capital unity. The general staff should strive to produce work in their posts, and the capitalists should also take into account the wartime staff's life and give considerable improvements. The outline says: "Although the promotion of spiritual mobilization originates from the top down, the real effect depends on everyone's mutual supervision and encouragement. In the family, family members and brothers encourage each other, and in the organization and group, each member should work together and learn from each other. In the society, regardless of identity, those who are equal in identity should supervise and encourage each other in the relationship of comrades and compatriots. Even for those with higher status, if there are thoughts, words, and actions that violate the spirit, they should also earnestly persuade them from the standpoint of the country and the nation to promote their reform. Therefore, mobilization is a democratic movement that is both top-down and bottom-up. It is necessary to strengthen the unity of labor and capital to achieve 'concentration of will and concentration of strength' and exert collective power. We believe that if we can grasp the above points and cooperate to do it, spiritual mobilization will definitely be greatly expanded in the vocational sector. We will use this to encourage and compete with people from all walks of life. Recently, the situation of the resistance war has been turning in our favor day by day, and the dawn of victory has already been revealed. But we must not forget Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's indication, 'The closer we get to victory, the more difficult, more difficult, and more dangerous our environment will inevitably be. It is necessary to mobilize the spiritual strength of the people to achieve the final success.' Let us take on this important task, expand spiritual mobilization and become a widespread and in-depth mass movement, mobilize all the spiritual forces of the nation, complete the cause of resisting aggression and building the country, and realize the new China of the Three Principles of the People with national independence, democracy, and people's happiness. This declaration.

Editorial

### The Diplomatic and Propaganda War on the Eve of the Great War

Since Germany and Italy aggressively advanced eastward, and Britain and France formed an anti-aggression front to stop them, the situation in Europe had been tense to the point where a major war was about to break out. However, in the past few days, the arrogance of Germany and Italy seems to have slightly subsided, and what has followed is a diplomatic and propaganda war between the democratic bloc and the Axis powers.

Diplomatic and propaganda warfare is a characteristic of the period before the outbreak of a major war. Interspersing diplomatic and propaganda warfare between periods of military tension and relaxation can further promote the maturation of the motivations for a major war. It can be seen that the easing of the European situation is only a temporary lull and not a fundamental solution. On the European political stage in these few days, two trends can be seen: First, Germany and Italy have temporarily stopped their military offensives and instead are trying to win over the smaller countries of Eastern Europe, vying with Britain and France for leadership in Europe, and strengthening their own forces. Second, Germany and Italy are launching public opinion campaigns, vigorously attacking democratic bloc countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and launching side attacks against the diplomatic sanctions of the democratic bloc countries. Although Britain and France's creation of an anti-aggression front and the concentration of small Eastern European countries have achieved considerable results in the past few weeks, Germany and Italy's recent efforts to win over Yugoslavia and Hungary are also progressing. Yugoslavia has not only held talks with Italy, and although its attitude of guaranteeing Italy is still hesitant and no agreement has been signed by both sides, Germany is still using its seductive tactics, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will also go to Berlin on the 26th. Italy's biggest effort at present is to seek an understanding between Yugoslavia and Hungary, and it is reported that Hungary has expressed its welcome. At present, Yugoslavia's relationship is very important among the small countries of Eastern Europe. Therefore, Germany and Italy are exerting pressure and enticements on Yugoslavia in an effort to force Yugoslavia to submit. The conditions Italy has proposed to guarantee Yugoslavia are: if Yugoslavia can join the Anti-Comintern Pact, reorganize its army to be commanded by Germany and Italy, and sign a commercial agreement with Italy, then Hungary will withdraw its demands on Yugoslavia, and Germany and Italy will also guarantee not to invade Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has given these proposals thoughtful consideration and acceptance. The progress of this situation is, of course, a major blow to the democratic countries of Britain and France. However, at a time when Britain and France have failed to make concrete and specific provisions for their guarantees to the smaller countries of Eastern Europe, and the creation of an anti-aggression front of large and small countries such as Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Greece, and Romania is still slow to progress, and Britain is still opening the door to negotiations with Germany and Italy, it is inevitable that the small countries of Eastern Europe will have such an attitude. The only effective way is to ensure that the guarantees to the small countries of Britain and France are practical, and that the prevention of the violent actions of the aggressor nations of Germany and Italy is more concrete.

The recent reason why the aggressor nations of Germany and Italy have changed their military actions to diplomatic struggles is nothing more than the following four points: First, following the active attitude of Britain and France, the United States put forward a peace plan, expressing opposition to Germany and Italy's aggression; Second, Britain actively wooed the Soviet Union to participate in the anti-aggression front, and the methods proposed by the Soviet Union were more concrete and effective; Third, the United States and the Soviet Union are actively preparing in the Far East to sanction Germany and Italy's accomplices, and enhance the power of Britain and France; Fourth, Germany and Italy do not yet have the strength and determination to launch a war under the active encirclement of anti-aggression countries. The first three conditions are especially important in the efforts of Britain and France. Therefore, if Britain and France want to achieve victory in the diplomatic war, they must promote the more concrete and rapid development of the first three conditions. President Roosevelt's peace proposal has made Germany and Italy's arrogance hesitate. Now the United States has recalled the Pacific Fleet and is considering how to stop the aggressors and help the anti-aggression countries. Therefore, if Britain and France can more actively and sincerely promote this trend, their strength in diplomacy will be further increased. Secondly, the Soviet Union no longer harbors doubts about Britain and France, and has actively proposed expanding the anti-aggression front. If Britain and France can give sincere consideration and acceptance to the Soviet Union's proposal, then the strength of the European anti-aggression front will increase, and British and French diplomacy can win victories at every turn. We hope that the rumored British-Soviet agreement and French-Soviet agreement can be realized as soon as possible, and that British, French, and Soviet military cooperation can also be concretized as soon as possible. In addition, how actively the United States and the Soviet Union prevent aggressors in the Far East to enhance the power of Britain and France depends on the attitude of Britain and France. Today, not only has the strengthening and perfection of the Soviet Far East Army caused concern for Japan, but also the recent recall of the United States Pacific Fleet has caused panic in Japan. Japan recently convened a five-minister meeting to consider this issue.

The development of the international situation is increasingly favorable to Britain and France, but whether the results of its development can truly be favorable to Britain and France still needs to be determined by the actions and efforts of Britain and France.

The bandits were unable to withstand it and collapsed eastward. We captured a car, a cannon, and countless other spoils.

[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 23rd] At around 11:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd, more than 30 bandit cars carrying 200 to 300 infantry and artillerymen detoured to Zaozhukou from Anbei via the back of Langshan, and then attacked our Wuzhen position with fierce artillery fire. Our defending troops fought bravely to resist, and a portion of them circled from Wuzhen to the rear of the bandits. At 2:00 PM, our circling troops arrived at Puchenchang (twelve miles east of Wuzhen) and launched a fierce attack on the bandits' flanks, fighting fiercely for three hours. The bandits suffered 50 to 60 casualties and several cars were destroyed. The remnants of the bandits were unable to withstand it and collapsed eastward. We captured a car, a cannon, and countless other spoils.

### Our Combat Strength Has Increased After Taking the Initiative, Always Maintaining the Advantage of Striking First, Observations by the Soviet Red Army Newspaper

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] TASS Moscow, 24th. The Soviet Red Star newspaper recently commented on China's military operations, saying that Japanese generals vainly attempted to inflict a major blow on the combat power of the Chinese army and shake the ranks of the anti-Japanese national united front by occupying Wuning and Nanchang. However, the facts have fully proved that the Chinese army's combat power has not suffered the slightest setback, and on the extremely long front line, it has everywhere transitioned to a favorable position of taking the initiative. The newspaper continued, "The battles fought in the past ten days have proved that the Chinese army, which is advancing simultaneously on all fronts, always maintains the advantage of striking first." The newspaper also said that in the past 20 days of April, China has recovered more than 70 cities, and the Japanese army in these cities has been completely driven out. The newspaper concluded by saying that the Chinese army's active operations demonstrate its strong combat power, flourishing morale, and high degree of political determination. They are determined to fight the Japanese aggressors to the end and strive for final victory. We can assert that the Japanese army has suffered serious defeats in many positions, and the position of the Chinese army has made great progress.

### Bandits Incite Anti-British Sentiment in Anqing

[Central News Agency, Tunxi, 15th] The recent anti-British movement in Anqing is extremely strong, with anti-British slogans posted all over the streets, such as "Boycott British goods" and "anti-imperialism", and hundreds of boxes of British-branded cigarettes have been burned, and British-made goods have been destroyed to vent their anger.

### British Ambassador Issues a Statement, Conducting Routine Official Business in Chongqing, Absolutely No Truth to Various Rumors

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] A Central News Agency reporter visited British Ambassador Archibald Clark Kerr at the Foreign Affairs Guesthouse at approximately 9:00 AM on the 25th and had a 45-minute conversation.

Later, he spoke to the reporter about the anti-war sentiments in Chongqing, saying that the impression he got was even better than before.

### The Flames of War Spread in Southern Guangdong, Shipping Greatly Affected, Transportation Between the Siyi Area, Hong Kong, and Macao Relies Solely on the Sanbu-Macao Route

Ferry Survey

[Macao Correspondent, Min Ge She] After the fall of Guangzhou, shipping in South China suffered a major blow. With the recent fall of Jiangmen, shipping in South China has entered a state of near collapse. Transportation between Siyi and Hong Kong and Macao currently only has the traffic from Sanbu to Macao that can be maintained. In the past, many ferries to Jiangmen Province, such as the "Minzu," floated dead and motionless on the sea in front of the mountain. The Heng'an Ferry, which used to travel to and from the provincial capital of Zhongshan, is said to have been used as a dormitory for Zhiyong Middle School in Macao. The following vessels are now able to shoulder the responsibility of transportation:

(1) Lianshang - from Sanbu to Qianshan, transferring to Macao.

(2) Lianshang, Limin - joint connection, the former runs the Sanbu section, the latter runs the Macao section, and can dock at the Macao Wharf.

(3) Heji, Da'an - joint connection, the former runs the Sanbu section, the latter runs the Macao section, the Qianshan to Macao section is connected by small boats.

(4) Hengji, Deji - joint connection, the former runs the Sanbu section, the latter runs the Macao section, the Qianshan to Macao section is also connected by small boats.

(5) Wuyang - small electric boat, travels between Sanbu Shawei, and then connects to Macao from Macao.

(6) Da Taibei - same as (5).

(7) Da Xingye - same as (5).

The above ferries can be said to be the current ferries that maintain transportation between Sanbu and Macao.

Business situation

Because of the reduction in ferries and the increase in fares, the profits of these ferries are quite good. Recently, passengers traveling from Sanbu to Macao have been very crowded, while passengers returning to Sanbu from Macao are fewer. As for fares, the ferries are not consistent, roughly as follows:

Lianshang (direct) - large cabin 6 yuan, dining floor 8 yuan.

Da'an, Heji (connecting) Large cabin 6 yuan, dining floor 10 yuan.

Lianshang, Limin (connecting) - When leaving Sanbu to Macao, large cabin 4 yuan, dining floor 6 yuan; when returning to Sanbu from Macao, large cabin 3 yuan, dining floor 4 yuan.

Hengji, Deji (connecting) - large cabin 6 yuan, dining floor 8 yuan

Wuyang, Da Taishan, Da Xingye and other electric boats - uniformly 6 yuan 4 jiao.

Except for the Lianshang Ferry, which goes directly to Sanbu Macao, the rest pass through the narrow Xiaoyongdao of Fanyu Sha, where it is quite a hardship to be connected by a small boat for two hours at night. Passengers should try to take the direct one (Lianshang Ferry).

Journey Past and Present

In the past, the waterway was open and unobstructed, and it only took 11 hours from Macao to Sanbu. Now, because one part has fallen into the sphere of influence of the bandits, and another part belongs to our army's sealing line, we have to detour through Xiaoyong. For example, in the past, we entered Zhuzhou through Muzhoukou, entered Menjiao, passed Jianchong, and went straight to Denglongshanzui, turned to Zhumuzui and reached Qianshan Macao. Now, after passing Muzhoukou, we have to pass a bow shape through Beihe and enter Quan Zhonggang into Jianchong. After reaching Jianchong, we cannot pass Dengzui, and enter Qianshan Jiangmen in an arc shape. The minimum time required is 15 hours. If the water is shallow, the time is uncertain.

Armed Self-Defense

Following the bandit intrusions, piracy has also become rampant. Recently, cases of ship robberies have been seen everywhere. Therefore, except for a few small electric boats, the rest are all protected by armed forces. Robberies usually occur in the following two places: (1) In Fanyu Sha, because the river channel here is very narrow and quite long, it is easiest for bandits to rob. (2) At Hukengkou, because the river channel there is narrow and relatively remote. But now the armed forces of the ferries are quite substantial and can defeat bandits, so even if they encounter bandits, there is no great danger.

Worth noting

There are currently two issues that deserve our attention: First, prevent the bandits from entering again. If a bandit ship breaks through the blockade line and parks one or two bandit ships near Yinzhuhuo, then this only traffic artery will be cut off. Second, vessels often run aground in Xiaoyong. For convenience and statistics, these Xiaoyong should be dredged. (Lin Ling)

### The Circumstances of the Eurasia Airlines No. 23 Accident in Guizhou, A Detailed Account by Pilot He of What Happened at the Time, The Sudden Change in Mountain Climate Caused the Tragedy

[Local News] On March 12, the Eurasia Airlines No. 23 aircraft crashed in Guizhou, with two male and two female passengers and one telegraph operator on board, all of whom died from their injuries. The plane was also burned. Pilot He Shouying and He Qizhao (formerly mistakenly reported as He Qiming), although seriously injured, were fortunately rescued. After coming to Hong Kong to be treated in a certain hospital, they have gradually recovered. The reporter visited the hospital yesterday and Mr. He Qizhao recounted the ordeal he encountered at the time. On the 12th, aircraft No. 23 flew from Chongqing to Kunming. On the way, the weather suddenly turned bad, and the entire aircraft was trapped in a hazy atmosphere. From the driver's seat, the airman could not see the aircraft's form, showing how heavy the fog was. At that time, in order to escape the heavy fog, they were forced to fly low, descending from 3,000 feet to 2,000 feet. Unexpectedly, due to a sudden change in air pressure, the middle engine was damaged, leaving only the left and right engines, which were no longer easy to use. Although the fog at low altitude was thinner, it was still impossible to see the way ahead, so they had to rely on instruments to make blind flights. Guiyang is mostly mountainous, and there are often towering mountains obstructing the way. After several times of avoiding danger, they unexpectedly encountered a cliff ahead at the last moment, only a few dozen feet away, and they just noticed it. In a hurry, there was no way to turn, and it was impossible to rise higher. At that time, they were in a dilemma, and they had no choice but to fly obliquely into a mountain depression and choose a relatively flat slope to make a forced landing. When landing, the aircraft body swayed, and he and his colleague Shouying were thrown out of the aircraft. The aircraft body was not seriously damaged, but unfortunately the fuel tank caught fire upon touching the ground, causing it to be burned. The passengers and the telegraph operator all died in the crash. After being thrown away, he and Mr. Shouying were unconscious for a long time. When they woke up, they knew everything. Shouying had broken more than half of his teeth and injured his foot. He was splashed with burning liquid all over, and his face was scorched. The reason he did not die was probably because he was thrown farther away. Afterwards, the two helped each other down the mountain and arrived at the plain two days later, where they were rescued by the villagers. Last time, I was attacked by several bandit aircraft on aircraft No. 17 and was finally able to escape. I originally thought myself lucky, but unexpectedly this time I was blocked by the climate and could not escape, causing a major loss. I feel very regretful, etc. During He's speech, he was quite self-effacing. The reporter gave him comfort. According to the investigation, the five people who died in the crash of aircraft No. 23 were all insured by the airline, with compensation of 10,000 marks per person, equivalent to 20,000 yuan in national currency. Both He were graduates of the 4th flying class of the Guangdong Aviation School. He Qizhao also studied mechanics and served in the Air Force for a long time, with outstanding skills. When aircraft No. 17 was attacked by bandit aircraft, he was the driver and escaped, so he was highly praised. He Shouying only treated his teeth, so he did not enter the hospital. He Qizhao is also gradually recovering and will be able to continue his service after recuperating. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was very fortunate that the burning liquid burned on his face without spreading to his eyes, otherwise, even if he could survive, he would be disabled.

### Shanghai French Concession Confiscates National Flags, French Side Promises to Return Them Yesterday, Leaflets Distributed in the Great World Area, Opposing Interference in the Resolution of the Flag Hanging Case

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Shanghai News, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession sent personnel to the French General Police Station this morning to request the return of the confiscated national flags. The police station refused to return them on the grounds that they had not yet received an order from the French Consul. Therefore, the association requested Hua Wei Qu Zhenhua to negotiate with the French Consulate General this morning. He was met by Deputy Consul Broyan, who replied that the French authorities had decided to return the confiscated national flags in the same way as before. However, this afternoon, it was feared that the procedures would be too late, but Broyan assured Qu that the confiscated national flags would be returned to the Taxpayers Association no later than noon tomorrow. According to the English-language "Continental Daily," leaflets were distributed in the Great World area on the 23rd, expressing opposition to the French Concession authorities' interference in the resolution of the flag hanging case, with extremely strong wording.

### Announcement by the Military Affairs Commission: Outline for Propaganda in Guerrilla Areas, Mobilizing Battlefield Civilians to Launch Resistance Battles

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The Military Affairs Commission has recently issued the following outline for propaganda in the battle areas (i.e., guerrilla areas):

The Necessity of Warfare

In the second phase of the War of Resistance, political propaganda work in the battle areas is more important than both at the front lines and in the rear, for the following reasons:

(1) In the vast territories "**occupied**" by the enemy, the enemy can only effectively occupy a few urban strongholds. The rest of the territory is under our control and governance. (According to the statistics of the Executive Yuan on county administration in the battle areas in February of this year: (A) Among the 941 counties in the war zones of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Fujian, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, county magistrates were unable to exercise their powers in only 55 counties; (B) County magistrates in 25 counties where part of the county was occupied still resided in the county seat and exercised their powers; (C) County magistrates in 245 counties where the county seat had fallen relocated to the countryside to work; (D) County magistrates in 23 counties relocated to neighboring counties but were still able to exercise their powers.) We have already established many anti-Japanese bases in these vast areas, left many regular troops, and organized many guerrilla units, whose range of activities extends from six or seven counties to dozens of counties. Therefore, the Minister instructed that all Party and government personnel and revolutionary cadres in the rear of the enemy should remain there. At the same time, the whole country, from top to bottom, should regard the enemy's rear as an important area for our revolutionary work.

(2) The enemy's strategy of military aggression is to use military means to achieve its economic plunder, and to use political means to conceal the facts of its military aggression. The enemy everywhere instigates traitors to establish puppet organizations, and at the same time uses traitors to create various bandit companies, using the name of developing industries to carry out its actual plunder. This is the concrete manifestation of this conspiracy. In response to this conspiracy of the enemy, we must use military cover to launch political offensives, and use politics to assist in military victories. Implementing this countermeasure requires political propaganda work in the battle areas to assume even greater tasks.

(3) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy's strategy of "**quick victory**" and its policy of "**quick peace**" have both failed, and they are caught in a dilemma, unable to stop. Their forces are insufficient, and their finances are exhausted. They have to issue the sound of a "long-term war" and the slogan of "long-term construction." The so-called "long-term construction" is actually "long-term war," which is an attempt to use the manpower and resources of our battle areas to promote further aggression against China's capital. According to recent intelligence, the enemy is stepping up its assistance to the puppet "New China Government": (1) Consolidating the occupied areas and actively reorganizing the resources of the occupied areas, at a minimum, they must find ways to supply the needs of the enemy's expeditionary army in China; (2) Extensively reclaiming and cultivating land in the occupied areas, moving its nationals to cultivate the land; (3 code illegible). To strike at the enemy's illusion, we must first ensure that the enemy cannot plunder resources or organize puppet troops in the battle areas. This task largely falls on the shoulders of political workers in the battle areas. We must extensively and deeply penetrate the rear of the enemy, launch guerrilla warfare, consolidate revolutionary regimes in various places, destroy the enemy's transportation, and obstruct all political, economic, and cultural facilities of the enemy, so that the enemy is exhausted and surrounded and attacked by our revolutionary forces, leading to its complete collapse (Minister Chen's words).

(4) The characteristic of the second phase of the War of Resistance is the transition from defense to offense, from defeat to victory. On the one hand, we must prevent the enemy from attacking, and on the other hand, we must prepare more troops so that they are powerless and dare not boldly attack. At the same time, we must prepare more experienced troops in the rear of the enemy, unite the people with greater resistance, so that they can be used to attack the enemy from both sides and cut off the enemy's retreat during the general counter-offensive.

(5) The battle areas are located behind the enemy, and can be threatened and attacked by the enemy at any time. It is often difficult to obtain supplies from our rear. Therefore, we must step up political propaganda work to raise the national consciousness and spirit of sacrifice of the troops and people in the battle areas. We must "infinitely increase the importance of political work" in order to accomplish this sacred and great task.

Tasks and Targets of the Work

(1) According to the instructions of the Minister in the discussion and resolution on the future work of the Political Department, to sum up, the tasks of political propaganda work in the battle areas are: (A) to launch and expand guerrilla warfare; (B) to establish and consolidate our revolutionary regime; (C) to more strongly organize the people in the rear of the enemy, and to compete with the enemy for the people; (D) to eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake the enemy troops; (E) to destroy the enemy's transportation and obstruct all political, economic, and cultural facilities of the enemy, so that the enemy is exhausted and surrounded and attacked by our vast revolutionary forces, leading to its collapse.

(2) Therefore, the targets of political propaganda work in the battle areas can be mainly divided into the following four types: (A) officers and soldiers of formal troops and guerrilla fighters; (B) enemy and puppet civilians; (C) enemy and puppet officers and soldiers; (D) prisoners of war. The supreme leader, in his instruction at the senior political work conference, gave a keen indication of the meaning of political work and its scope of education, saying, "Political workers are political educators between the army and the people, making them understand political implementation policies." He also said, "The scope of education is not limited to the troops and their members, but wherever the army is stationed, its surrounding environment should take the army as a model and generate the function of educating the people." In the political propaganda work of the troops, naturally the first target is the officers and soldiers of the troops. We must help the training of the troops, improve discipline, boost morale, assist the wounded and sick, and prevent desertion. Second, joining the army as soldiers and returning to the people after retiring, the military and the people are originally one. In the war behind the enemy, it is especially necessary to obtain the support and support of the people. The leader's instruction pointed out that the army must become a model for the people, "generating the function of educating the people." At the same time, the Minister instructed, "Military-civilian cooperation is the only element for our victory over the enemy. In the rear of the enemy, we must compete with the enemy for the people, so the discipline of the troops is the highest requirement of the War of Resistance." Therefore, the political propaganda work for the people in the rear of the enemy must be effectively responsible by the political workers of the troops. It is best to ensure that every soldier can become a propagandist and educator of the people. Third, the battle area is the rear of the enemy, and there is frequent contact with the enemy. Not only is there an urgent need to eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake the enemy troops in combat, but also in terms of propaganda techniques, there is the convenience of deepening and expanding our propaganda to the enemy and puppets. Therefore, enemy and puppet officers and soldiers are also important targets of political propaganda work in the battle areas. As for the official propaganda to the prisoners of war, if it is done well, it will be of great help to our propaganda to the enemy. (To be continued)

### Miscellaneous Feelings on Escaping Bombings in Chongqing

— Jun Sui

Travels in Xinjiang, Part 3

I arrived in Yu on March 19th. Since Chongqing was bombed by enemy planes on January 15th, there has been no recurrence. Although the Chongqing authorities have been vigorously advocating the evacuation of the population, the citizens are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not taken effective evacuation measures, as I mentioned in my second communication. Unexpectedly, an air raid alarm suddenly came at 9:15 p.m. on the 28th. At that time, I was attending a banquet hosted by my colleague, Mr. Ni Er, at the Fenjiang Restaurant in Huixian Bridge. After several rounds of wine, just as we were about to start eating, the sound of footsteps suddenly arose upstairs and downstairs. The host inquired and learned that it was an air raid alarm. The host and guests all left their seats and went downstairs. I asked the host where the nearest air raid shelter was so that we could go and take shelter temporarily. Mr. Luo, who was sitting on the right, immediately took my hand and went downstairs. He learned that he lived in the Bank of Communications, and that the bank's basement was quite solid and could be used as a shelter. We immediately left the restaurant and headed towards our destination. We saw vehicles blocking the road and the order was chaotic. Beside the sidewalk was a newly built water pool, with a rectangular hole every few feet, making it very inconvenient to walk. We were clear-headed and walked and talked, and arrived at the bank's entrance in about ten minutes. We entered through a side door. Inside, we saw women and children gathered, all entering the basement one after another. We followed them in. The basement was originally a tunnel for the bank's vault, with ventilation on both sides. It was about four or five feet wide and had long benches. We sat on the benches. At 9:45, an emergency alarm was issued, and the lights were immediately extinguished. We closed our eyes and sat quietly, thoughts rising and falling. Looking back on it afterward, it was quite valuable to record. At 10:05, the alarm was lifted, and we followed the crowd out of the basement. Mr. Luo and I went upstairs to chat, and I said goodbye and returned to my residence at 11:00.

In the basement, after the emergency alarm was issued, I had many thoughts in the dark: First, it was my personal view of life and death. I believe that life inevitably leads to death, and no one can avoid the coming of death, but one must die in the right way, at the right time, and in the right place. Therefore, when one should die, there is no need to fear death. Conversely, when one should not die, one should not easily give up life. Therefore, when the enemy comes to bomb, we should make our best efforts to resist actively and passively, to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and to weaken the manpower and resources for war. Second, I felt that Chongqing has a population of 500,000 to 600,000, and all the air raid shelters can accommodate at most 100,000 people. There are still 400,000 to 500,000 people who must be evacuated. Speaking of evacuation, I thought of the lack of general transportation. How will hundreds of thousands of people be moved out of the city? Also, the poor security in the countryside. Once dispersed to the countryside, will outsiders be allowed to live in peace? These points are worth discussing. Third, are air raid shelters reliable after all? As last time in Xi'an, when a meeting was being held, they suddenly encountered an air raid. One of the two entrances of the air raid shelter where they were taking shelter was hit by an explosive bomb, and the other was hit by an incendiary bomb. As a result, one entrance was blocked by the explosion, and the other was rushed in by smoke and flames, so that most of the people in the shelter suffocated to death. Although Chongqing has many stone mountains, I heard that the stone is very loose and easily cracked by tremors. If the trenches are dug too large, or the rock is particularly loose, it is easy to "rest in peace." Fourth, the people in Chongqing who are escaping air raids are confident that there is a fixed time, roughly from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. as the time for escaping attacks. Therefore, women and children go to the south bank during this time, and schools and banks are required not to operate within this time. But is it true that the enemy cannot attack in the afternoon or even at night? Fifth, many citizens, in addition to the poor security in the countryside as a reason, also cite the lack of tap water, electric lights, telephones, and modern transportation in the countryside as reasons for not being able to evacuate easily. If every village were the same as the city, would it be possible to avoid the danger of air raids?

The next morning, I saw in the newspapers: "Air raid alarm at 9:10 last night," followed by another headline: "Evacuate the population, without delay." It was clearly notified to the readers that last night's alarm was just a drill. By coincidence, at 11:50 a.m. on the 29th, a real alarm did come. That time, my colleague Mr. Zhang and I were walking on the road, preparing to go to a friend's banquet, when we suddenly heard the alarm. We went to the nearby Bank of China to take shelter temporarily, but the basement was already full and the air was turbid. We chatted in the reception room, preparing to go down again when the emergency alarm sounded. As a result, the alarm was lifted, and we left immediately. The next day's newspaper reported: "Yesterday, 36 enemy planes attacked in two batches. Because our planes fought back, they only dropped bombs in Liangshan and fled." After these two lessons, I don't know whether the citizens' psychology will be able to find a smoother solution to the issue of population evacuation.

After being frightened by the two alarms, I, who am sensitive, have the following kinds of illusions appearing in my mind when I go out: First, walking on Doyou Street, I only see a crowd of people, and I feel very sad when I think of the illusion of death and corpses piled up during the coming catastrophe in the future; second, seeing the dense buildings in the city and the poor materials, I have the illusion of a citywide fire after an incendiary bomb is dropped; third, seeing modern women revealing their snow-white arms and jade legs, I also have an illusion of bloody flesh; fourth, when I come across lively and lovely little babies, I suddenly see an illusion of a pale baby corpse. The newspaper reported that someone in Beipei received a night raid alarm and fell into a cave and died; in the city, there were various news of fights and injuries due to disputes over air raid shelters. I am sweating for the citizens of Chongqing. Doesn't everyone have parents, brothers, and wives? Who doesn't cherish their own and their family's lives? Except for those who cannot leave due to their jobs, why not evacuate and move their families to the countryside early? To carry out the War of Resistance to the end, the most important manpower and resources all depend on the support of the people in the rear. If one sacrifices one's life in vain, it is letting the country down, and it is no different from soldiers deserting. The citizens should be aware of it!

### Britain Resists Aggression, Issues Warning to Germany, Delivered to German Foreign Minister by Henderson, Requests Acceptance of US Peace Proposal

(Associated Press, London, 24th) The British authorities have recently sent a "straightforward note" to Hitler. According to a spokesman today, it actually includes the meaning of protest and warning. If Germany continues to create a tense situation, Britain will be forced to take national conscription measures. The spokesman also confirmed that the British ambassador to Germany, who was returning to Germany from Britain, carried this note with him. Its contents include: (1) Britain reiterated its belief that European problems must be resolved peacefully; (2) President Roosevelt's proposal is the best opportunity to enable Germany to negotiate with Britain; (3) Britain is determined to resist attempts to monopolize Europe by force.

(Reuters, London, 24th) The British Prime Minister today, in response to an inquiry from opposition leader Attlee in the House of Commons, said that the return of the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, to Berlin had no particular significance. Ambassador Henderson was summoned to the country to report to the government authorities. After completing the report, the government authorities gave him a short holiday. After the holiday was over, he left Britain and returned to Germany to resume his duties as usual. Attlee also asked whether Ambassador Henderson's return to Germany meant that the British government had recognized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain replied, "Absolutely not."

(Reuters, London, 25th) The British Ambassador, Henderson, will visit the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today. According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, Henderson will take the opportunity to explain some key points of British policy, including resisting future aggression. At the same time, Henderson will also clearly state that Britain has no intention of encircling Germany, and still maintains a policy of peace. However, the dangers caused by recent events must be stopped.

(Associated Press, Berlin, 25th) The British Ambassador, Henderson, is scheduled to go to the Foreign Ministry between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to deliver Chamberlain's note. It is generally believed that the note will be handed over directly to Ribbentrop by Henderson. Although there is much speculation about the content of the note, the exact content is still unknown. Political figures observe that Germany will inevitably not be pleased with this note, especially if the note indicates that Britain has decided, or will decide, to adopt a conscription system. There is little hope of easing Hitler's speech with this note. Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain abandoned his appeasement policy and adopted a tough attitude, which has long made Hitler resentful.

(Reuters, London, 25th) According to news from diplomatic correspondents of various newspapers this morning, the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, will relay a clear warning from the British government to Hitler on this return to duty. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that Henderson will express that unless Germany has clear evidence of changing its policies, the British government will have no choice but to continue to organize an anti-aggression front and implement conscription. Henderson will suggest that Germany should withdraw its volunteers stationed in the west and quickly demobilize a portion of its mobilized troops. Germany will understand the British government's desire to obtain practical and peaceful methods to resolve all counties and demands through international cooperation. Therefore, the British government expresses its faithful support for President Roosevelt's telegrams to Hitler and Mussolini. This fact has been clearly stated in the British note to the United States. The "Daily Express," while confirming the news that Henderson will request an immediate meeting with Hitler on this return to duty, also firmly believes that Henderson will persuade Hitler to accept President Roosevelt's proposed ten- to twenty-five-year peace plan. The newspaper also said: "The government's frank words will include a clear warning that if Germany rejects President Roosevelt's proposal, the result will inevitably increase the tension of the international situation and only make the world, especially British public opinion, have the worst impression of Germany." The "Daily Mail" made a more powerful expression of the last point, saying that Henderson will make every effort to show that if Germany rejects President Roosevelt's proposal, it will increase the tension of the international situation to the point of rupture.

(Reuters, London, 25th) Member of Parliament and diplomatic correspondent of the "News Chronicle," Butler, made cautious remarks regarding the report that Britain had issued a warning to Hitler, saying, "Regarding this warning, it seems that no one can know what kind of negotiations can be held between the two sides. I have received assurances that within a few hours, the whole world will know for sure that this step shows that the British government's attitude of resisting aggression has not weakened in the slightest." The "News Chronicle" paid close attention to the rumor that the cabinet has agreed on the necessity of conscription. The newspaper's political correspondent said, "At least one minister who discussed the conscription issue with me has pointed out that conscripting 19-year-old youths into the army can increase the local army by 300,000 people." In addition, the diplomatic correspondent of "The Times," after mentioning the return of the British Ambassador to Germany and Chamberlain's simple statement on this matter in the House of Commons, said, "In short, Ambassador Henderson's trip to Germany and his return to duty did not indicate that there was any change in the government's policy, and certainly not a weakening of the government's policy. This point can be shown both domestically and in the talks with foreign capitals in the past few weeks." British officials have not made a clear disclosure of the instructions sent to Ambassador Henderson to be conveyed to Hitler, but it seems certain that the British government has given certain instructions to the German ambassador.

(Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th) The German Ambassador to Britain, Dirksey, will return to his post within days.

(Associated Press, Paris, 24th) It is reported that the French Ambassador to Germany left here tonight to go to Berlin.

(Associated Press, Paris, 24th) It has just been announced by authoritative sources that France will follow Britain and order its ambassador to Germany to return to his post before Hitler's speech on Friday.

### Britain Closely Monitors the Situation in Spain, Gibraltar's Number One Dock Works Day and Night to Complete it Soon

(Reuters, London, 24th) Undersecretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons on the same day that, according to information obtained by the government, the recent activities of Spanish troops near Gibraltar were a natural phenomenon of troop demobilization. A member asked, "Since increasing the number of reinforcements to Gibraltar is not important, why bother doing so?" Butler did not answer. When asked about the issue of expanding Gibraltar's Number One Dock, Colonel Lewin of the Admiralty replied that the work is now being carried out day and night, and the authorities have done everything possible to ensure that the project is completed as soon as possible. The Undersecretary also replied to a question about maintaining the status quo of the Tangier International Zone, saying that the government believes that maintaining the status quo there is of utmost importance. When asked whether the government protested against the Italian government's continued stationing of a large number of troops in Spain after the cessation of the Spanish war, Chamberlain replied that the government did not consider it necessary to protest. In addition, there were questions raised that, fearing that the Italian army would not withdraw from Spain after Franco's victory parade on May 15, the Prime Minister declared that the government was closely monitoring the situation there.

(Central News Agency, Puyo, 24th) Regarding rumors that the Spanish National Army government intends to occupy the international neutral port of Tangier, the Foreign Ministry recently issued a statement firmly denying it.

The Deposed King of Spain Awaits His Return

(Rome, 24th) According to foreign news, the deposed King Alfonso of Spain is still living in the Hotel Rome, awaiting a call from Franco inviting him to return home. At the same time, Alfonso and his queen have also completely reconciled and will soon issue a formal statement clarifying the fact that the two have reunited. The deposed king's secretary announced today, "There is nothing to announce at the moment. King Alfonso is currently paying attention to the developments in Spain. However, when Madrid fell, the deposed king sent a telegram to General Franco, and Franco replied, expressing his heartfelt congratulations." Since the Franco government recently issued an order to return the deposed king's property, the talk of restoration has been noisy. It is reported that the deposed king was forced to leave the country eight years ago, and his queen, Irene, is the granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England. They once had disagreements and wanted to divorce, but they have now reconciled and are staying in Rome together.

### Secretary of State Hull Issues Statement on Attitude Towards Germany; US Will Not Send Ambassador Back to Germany; Rumor of Hitler Planning to Offer Counter-Proposals

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today, saying that although Britain has decided to instruct Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, to return to his post, the United States has no intention of following suit. Official sources believe that President Roosevelt will not make any decisions about reappointing an ambassador until Hitler formally responds to his message. Information received here from the press and diplomatic circles indicates that Hitler will put forward counter-proposals to President Roosevelt's proposals, insisting that Germany's economic and colonial demands must be met first before offering guarantees. It is also rumored that Hitler may seek to restore a policy of reconciliation and designate Mr. Roosevelt's message as an expression of a policy of reconciliation. However, political circles are well aware that President Roosevelt is unwilling to fall into his trap, especially as the strongest opponents of the policy of appeasement are precisely the people within the Roosevelt faction. At the same time, due to domestic policy reasons, the President cannot strongly urge Britain and France to take steps to satisfy the desires of the Axis powers. When the policy of appeasement existed, the press here, encouraged by official sources, expressed that the United States could hardly ignore a proposal to cede West Africa, as it would directly affect South America. Some African groups, fearing the danger of falling under Axis rule, have launched appeals for American protection, such as the US interests in Liberia and local demands for American protection against the Nuremberg racial laws. Therefore, the US government has not formally expressed its withdrawal from all territorial disputes, but in reality, there is a considerable amount of land which, if it becomes the target of negotiations, would make the US government feel uneasy. Therefore, it is generally predicted that Washington may provide a clear explanation in principle regarding the President's suggestions.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] According to authoritative sources here, whether the United States will send an ambassador back to Germany will depend on Hitler's response to Roosevelt's suggestions. As to how Hitler's speech would be satisfactory to American readers, it is still difficult to predict. Members of the Foreign Relations Committee also declined to comment, but it is known that even if US-German relations are restored, Mr. Wilson will be reassigned, and another ambassador will be sent to Berlin to replace him.

### Yugoslav Foreign Minister Departs for Berlin Yesterday; Scheduled to Visit Hungary Next Month; Non-Aggression Pact to Be Signed

[Haitong News Agency, Belgrade, 25th] After returning from Venice, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković visited Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković to report on the results of his meeting with the Italian Foreign Minister in Venice, and to discuss various issues related to the Yugoslav Foreign Minister's visit to Berlin, which commenced this morning.

[Haitong News Agency, Belgrade, 25th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković met with reporters yesterday and stated that the most important issues between Italy and Yugoslavia are the basic principles established in foreign policy. Following the Venice conference, all relevant issues between the two countries have been satisfactorily resolved, and the friendly relations between the two sides have become more solid. He also said that the outcome of the Venice conference can be considered very satisfactory.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th] The well-known German newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter" stated that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will visit Hungary next month. It is expected that a non-aggression pact between Yugoslavia and Hungary will be signed at that time, as Hungary was reportedly willing to sign such a pact in Venice, and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister also expressed his agreement. It is rumored that Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya will travel to the Yugoslav capital to sign the pact. Furthermore, Hungary will not make any territorial demands, but will only request that Yugoslavia guarantee preferential treatment for the Hungarian minority in the country.

### Germany and Japan Negotiating Military Alliance; French Newspapers Urge Britain and France to Pay Attention to Pacific Islands

[Reuters, London, 25th] The "Times" correspondent in Berlin reported that there is no official information regarding Germany and Japan negotiating to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. If Hitler can announce in Parliament on Friday that the Japanese fleet will not remain neutral in the event of a war between Germany and the democratic countries, it would undoubtedly be a success for Hitler.

[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] "Le Temps" published today: "Japan has decided to return part of the Pacific mandated islands to Germany, so that the German and Japanese fleets can build bases there. Britain and France should not ignore the possibility of this happening. Even the smallest islands may be of particular importance militarily."

Short Commentary

### The Mulan of Hong Kong

The historical Hua Mulan of China, whose fragrance has lasted for thousands of years and whose reputation is renowned at home and abroad, has brought much honor to the world of women.

Since the War of Resistance, women from all over the country have enthusiastically participated, from war service groups to military service groups, as well as civilian corps and self-defense corps assisting in maintaining order in the rear. There are even female student soldiers participating in the frontline war. The great spirit of these women, who are determined to serve the country and sacrifice for the nation, is not only comparable to the ancient Hua Mulan, but also has a more significant meaning, that is, they use their own struggles to raise their political and social status and open up a path of liberation for women. It is not just about creating a few female heroes through occasional legends, but about the permanent and thorough liberation of the vast majority of women.

However, women in Hong Kong have always been looked down upon. They are regarded as toys or appendages of men, they are forced to become commodities, and they become pests of society and brokers of sin. This is the shame of women in Hong Kong and of all Chinese women. This shame has not been cleansed since the War of Resistance, and with the arrival of "high-class refugees" and "poor refugees", this shame is even more seriously threatening our female compatriots!

Social leaders and enlightened women must feel a great sense of responsibility for this phenomenon.

However, the "Mulan of Hong Kong" has repeatedly appeared recently. They do not have the social leaders' backing of actors and stars, nor do they have newspapers publishing their "glamor shots" for widespread publicity. They silently and resolutely break away from coddling and say goodbye to comfortable nests to return to the motherland, return to their hometowns, to serve the soldiers, and even to take up arms to defend the country! They have no desire for glory or profit, and even if they are wounded in battle, no one will treat them. Even if they fight to the death, no one will know! However, they have promoted the noble morality and great spirit of the Chinese nation. Their spirit of not seeking recognition and vowing to fight to the death will wash away the shame of the women's world and raise the social and political status of women!

The military service group of the Guangzhou YMCA held a flag-giving ceremony at the Hong Kong YMCA yesterday. The group, consisting of fourteen people, will go to the Shaoguan front line to serve within days. We cannot describe the greatness of this group of new Mulan of Hong Kong, even with all the glorious and beautiful words! They are all young women, and they all have the youth that most people envy, but they have broken away from coddling, studies, and careers, and embarked on a path of hard work and service. They are not for fame, not for profit, and there is no temptation. What power can force people to abandon coddling and comfort and go to sacrifice and struggle? In addition to praising their will and bravery, can we not be excited and encouraged for the victorious future of the Chinese nation?

Female compatriots who are deceived by love and pleasure, are you not ashamed? Female compatriots who are groaning in pain, darkness, bullying, and insult, are you not moved? Wake up from the mirror-like love and comfort, wake up from pain and darkness. The road to self-help, the torch of light, and the banner of victory are already in front of you!

### Britain to Implement Conscription; Cabinet Meeting Already Discussed; Formal Decree to Be Issued Immediately; Churchill Says the Government and Opposition Unanimously Support It

[Associated Press, London, 24th] The British Cabinet held a meeting this evening at the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons for two hours and fifteen minutes to discuss compulsory military service. It is generally believed that nationals aged 19 to 25 will be conscripted. This issue will be discussed again at the regular meeting on Wednesday, and a formal decree will be issued before the end of the week. The "Daily Herald" and "News Chronicle" reported that the Cabinet has decided to approve the principle of compulsory military service and that nationals aged 18 to 20 will be conscripted first. The formal decision will depend on the content of Hitler's speech on the 28th. The "News Chronicle" also stated that a cabinet member said that conscripting 19-year-olds would add 500,000 to the territorial army.

[Central News Agency, London, 25th] Churchill, a leader of the extreme right wing of the Conservative Party, gave a speech at the Munchin Club yesterday, hinting at the implementation of compulsory military service. He said that the British territorial army has been actively expanding and is on par with wartime staffing levels. The work of building the country's defenses for the second time is also progressing smoothly. Such achievements are indeed rare. The government has previously provided guarantees to various European countries, stating that if any of those countries are invaded, Britain will do its utmost to jointly resist. On this point, the government and opposition across the country have unanimously expressed their support. However, to date, Britain has not taken appropriate steps to strengthen its army and support its promises. It is hoped that the government will implement compulsory military service, regardless of the specific format. In general, Britain will soon implement compulsory military service.

### Japan's Spiritual Mobilization

— An Excerpt

Ginza is Tokyo's Piccadilly Circus, a bustling street with all kinds of neon lights dazzling on the streets.

But now there is no such scene anymore. Tokyo has become a series of gloomy, desolate, and dim streets. When a tourist treads on the uneven and winding road, the first question is "Is Tokyo preparing for an air raid?"

When he learns that air raids are limited to Chinese cities, he will undoubtedly suspect that perhaps Tokyo is under the threat of war and is trying to conserve its electricity supply. But he is wrong again.

Undoubtedly, everything in Japan is placed under a strict system of economic control and restrictions. But abolishing neon lights and many similar things has little to do with normal economics, because electricity is Japan's cheapest product.

The reason why they make everyday life so bleak is simply to make the people on the 'rear front' as much as possible experience the suffering of the soldiers on the battlefield. This is called spiritual mobilization.

Those who participate in spiritual mobilization have already formed a very powerful group here. At the same time, since they have taken the Rising Sun flag as their symbol and the so-called "Japanese spirit" as their foundation,

All kinds of inexplicable plans have become national policies.

From a certain point of view, this spiritual mobilization may represent a little bit of the characteristics of the Japanese people - that is, the docile nature of rejoicing when others are happy and grieving when others are sad. Asking them to sacrifice these luxurious pleasures and give up some habits of enjoyment to show sympathy for the soldiers on the front line is very likely to move them.

But the spiritual mobilizers have pushed this very natural feeling to the most ridiculous extreme. Due to excessive efforts to save, it has caused serious threats to people's lives. Here, a major economic problem is how to achieve a balance of international trade without causing too many unemployed people. For example, the strict restrictions on the import of cotton and wood will inevitably lead to a large number of unemployed people in the textile industry.

The climax of spiritual mobilization has also created excessive excitement in some people. They demand that people no longer build new houses, wear new clothes, attend social gatherings, abolish commonly used ribbons and ties, and all human comforts, enjoyments, and entertainments, even all necessities are abandoned, regardless of whether it will cause a large number of people to suffer unemployment.

But when they were almost reaching the point where the government would prohibit department stores, cinemas, restaurants, and other public places from installing air conditioning equipment, they could no longer use their skills.

A restaurant owner once said that without air conditioning, his exquisite underground restaurant would have to close its doors, and this mere two and a half cents a day expense was maintaining the jobs of about fifty people.

But the spiritual mobilizers got another string on their bow. Their main justification is to create a fiercely hot atmosphere. They say that their soldiers on the front line are fainting under the scorching heat of 110 to 120 degrees. Why shouldn't we be like this? This kind of justification is almost convincing. Few passionate officials are willing to say that they want to make the minds of the people in the rear cooler than the soldiers on the front line.

The most prominent feature of spiritual mobilization is the attack on all enjoyments, luxuries, entertainments, and banquets that are somewhat Western in nature. Now in Japan, going to dance halls, organizing dances, and dancing are practically criminal acts. Even foreigners, even diplomatic personnel, are not allowed to hold dances.

The reason for this behavior is that, with their passionate minds, they feel that it is absolutely impossible for young men and women to dance together without leading to chaos.

They do not pay attention to what is generally considered moral. They are just anti-Western, and their stubborn xenophobia is even worse than that of the ignorant Chinese Boxers. (Translated from London's "Northern Communication")

### Coping with Extraordinary Times: The Hong Kong Government Urges Residents to Stockpile One Month's Worth of Food

Recently, residents have been specifically advised to stockpile one month's worth of food to prepare for emergencies. The authorities' aim is to prevent merchants from exploiting opportunities to monopolize and raise prices for profit, thereby increasing the burden on citizens. The authorities, mindful of the impact of the European situation on Hong Kong last November, which led to the disruption of various food and canned goods supplies, coupled with Hong Kong's limited inventory, caused merchants to seize the opportunity to monopolize and inflate prices to an abnormal extent. Relief arrived later with shipments from the Philippines, and as the European crisis eased, the situation gradually returned to normal. As for food storage, canned goods that are easy to preserve are best, and the longer the storage time, the better. However, excessive storage may not be feasible, so one month is the limit. Stored food should be replaced with fresh items regularly, using the older ones first to maintain the freshness of the reserves.

Stockpiling for One Month in Preparation for Emergencies

The authorities have also referenced the living habits of Europeans and provided a table detailing the monthly needs of a two-person household, as follows: 28 plates of breakfast food, 28 plates of lunch food, 18 plates of dinner food, 28 plates of lunch vegetables, 28 plates of dinner vegetables, 56 plates of soup, 20 bowls of potatoes, 24 plates of dry bread, 4 plates of dried eggs, 4 plates of butter, 8 plates of sweet biscuits, 8 plates of sweets, 16 plates of sugar cubes, 4 plates of tea, 8 plates of cocoa, 32 plates of pudding mix, 4 cakes, 10 pounds of corn flour, 8 plates of fruit sugar, 4 plates of oil, 64 cans of condensed milk, 20 cans of dried milk, 8 plates of wheat flour, 8 plates of dried plums, 4 plates of barley, 13 pounds of lentils, 8 bottles of fruit syrup, 8 bottles of coffee, 12 bottles of lemon juice, 8 bottles of honey, and 25 pounds of flour. As for upper-class overseas Chinese, given their wealth, they can freely purchase as much as they wish. Even following the methods of foreigners would not pose a problem. However, middle- and lower-class overseas Chinese constitute the majority. For a family of ten, the minimum food storage required would be 200 catties of rice, 15 catties of cooking oil, 500 catties of firewood, 5 catties of salt, 200 salted eggs, 10 catties of salted fish, 20 catties of salted pork, 10 catties of sugar, 5 jars of fermented bean curd, 20 pieces of preserved bean curd, 10 catties of preserved mustard greens, 15 catties of vegetables, and 4 catties of soy sauce. In winter, the storage of sausages and preserved meats can be increased as appropriate. Storing food in summer is more difficult than in winter. At the same time, due to the financial constraints of the general middle and lower classes, storing even the minimum one-month supply of food may be challenging. It is unclear how the authorities will resolve this issue of food storage for the majority of residents.

Building an Airfield in Taiping

According to yesterday's report in the Hong Kong Telegraph, reliable sources indicate that the Japanese army has recently been constructing a large airfield about fifty miles from Hong Kong. The initial news of this reached Hong Kong from a refugee who had fled from Dongguan. Subsequent investigations by reporters have confirmed this news. The location of the Japanese airfield is in Taiping, which is part of Dongguan County. Once the airfield is completed, Japanese aircraft taking off from there can reach Hong Kong airspace in just ten minutes, calculated at the most ordinary speed. The airfield is approximately five to six miles away from the Humen Forts. The Japanese troops stationed there are currently forcing local villagers to work on the construction. Those conscripted are only provided with food and no wages. The project began last week, and although it is not yet fully completed, Japanese aircraft have already been taking off and landing there. Recently, some of the Japanese aircraft participating in the battles on the East River front also took off from this airfield.

Building Safety Cellars in the New Territories

In Hong Kong, in addition to the Hong Kong government actively strengthening the defense capabilities of Hong Kong, the public is also actively planning for the prevention and evacuation in the event of a future war, under the guidance of the government. Due to the terrain of Hong Kong, the general public's evacuation target is the villages in the New Territories, as the New Territories have more mountains, which are safer than other places in the event of war. According to information obtained by reporters from people in the construction industry, most of the wealthy in Hong Kong are now planning for the safety in the event of a future war and are spending heavily to build shelters in remote areas of the New Territories. The construction of these houses is not much different in appearance from ordinary villas, but the interior has various safety facilities for avoiding bullets and poison gas. As of now, there are more than ten newly built villas of this type, and several more have been under construction in the past two months. When these shelters were being built, the villa owners spared no expense in hiring military strategists to survey the sites. Their locations are mostly chosen to avoid proximity to urban railways, highways, and other military strongholds. The construction of underground cellars is a must for every new building. Currently, in addition to the newly built houses with the above-mentioned safety and defense facilities, other existing villas in the New Territories are also hiring workers to build them, in preparation for a safe haven in the event of war.

### Robberies in the New Territories Continue Unabated; Twelve Thieves Rob in Separate Groups, One in San Tin Village, One in Tong Lin Village; Robbers Carried Guns and Hand Grenades

Robberies have been rampant in various places for the past month. Unexpectedly, just as the authorities were planning to tightly secure the New Territories, two robberies occurred again yesterday morning at 1 a.m. The first case involved the San Hop Hing Chinese medicine store in Lok Ma Chau, where the owner, Li Cheung, was robbed by six armed thieves of more than three hundred dollars. The second case was a farmhouse without a street number in Tai Po, New Territories, where the owner, Chung Kai-fat, was robbed of dozens of dollars by six thieves. The details of the two robberies are described below.

Six Thieves Rob a Chinese Medicine Store in the New Territories

The San Hop Hing Chinese medicine store at the entrance of San Tin Village, Lok Ma Chau, New Territories, is owned by Li Cheung (51 years old) and co-owned by Mak Hing and Leung Tsan. There are four partners and three other women. The business has been profitable throughout the year, making it a target for thieves. At 1 a.m. yesterday, as everyone was sound asleep, thieves suddenly broke open the door, making a loud noise. Li Cheung was awakened by the noise. Li knew that they were thieves and was about to get up and call for help, but the thieves had already entered the store. Among the six thieves, one was holding a hand grenade, one was holding a revolver, and one was holding a metal crowbar. Seeing that they had such dangerous weapons, Li was frightened and was stopped from making any noise. He was pushed into the room, and the door was tied tightly with hemp rope. Then, they searched the store extensively, emptying boxes and overturning cabinets, taking everything of value in the store, leaving nothing behind. Before leaving, the thieves cut the hemp rope tying the door with a knife and fled with loud cries. After the thieves left, Li checked the lost items and went to the police station to report the case for investigation. The total loss was valued at $368.29.

Farmhouse in Tai Po Robbed Again

A mud house without a street number in Tong Lin Village, at the entrance of the Lam Tsai Shan valley in Tai Po, New Territories, is inhabited by five people. The owner, Chung Kai-fat (41 years old), works as a sailor on a ship. His son, Chung Kam-lung (17 years old), his nephew, Chung Tin (15 years old), Yau Ting-song (21 years old), and Wong Kam-wah (65 years old) live in the house together. Unexpectedly, at 1:25 a.m. yesterday, six thieves suddenly broke in. Three of the thieves were holding short guns, making a menacing display. As soon as they entered the house, they restrained everyone and then began searching, taking everything clean in about three minutes, and then calmly fled. Chung went to the police station to report the case yesterday morning. The stolen items included a gold watch worth $25 and a gold ring worth $10, totaling $37.80. After receiving the report, the police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to Yang Xie to hunt down the thieves.

### Hong Kong Weaving Association Helps Manufacturers Request Reduction of Electricity Fees in Kowloon; Peninsula Residents Have Doubled, Should Be No Reason for Refusal; Electricity Company Said to Be Considering a Reasonable Reduction

Hundreds of manufacturers in Kowloon have recently appealed to the Kowloon Electricity Company through the Hong Kong Manufacturers Association, stating that with the increasing number of residents in Kowloon and the gradual prosperity of the market, the number of users has increased, and the electricity fees charged by the Kowloon Electricity Company for factories should be reduced appropriately. However, the electricity company has not made any statement to date. The Hong Kong Weaving Association, in order to take a unified step, has again requested the Kowloon Electricity Company to reduce electricity fees after several meetings. The request of Kowloon manufacturers to reduce electricity fees was made several years ago, but it was not accepted by the electricity company on the grounds that Kowloon had few residents, thus increasing electricity costs. Now that the number of Kowloon residents has more than doubled, there should be no reason to refuse. It is also learned that the Kowloon Electricity Company is considering a reasonable reduction in fees and will hold a board meeting to discuss and decide soon.

### Throw Away Your Makeup Kit and Put on Your Wartime Robe! Modern Mulan Joins the Army

— Chi Cheuk

The Guangzhou YWCA Military Service Corps Held a Flag Presentation Ceremony Yesterday

The great era cannot contain the hearts of daughters. They finally threw away their makeup kits and put on their wartime robes.

When Guangzhou fell, the ruthless artillery fire of the Japanese scattered the Guangzhou YWCA members. However, this was a temporary separation, a process of growth and training. After wandering for a while, they reorganized strongly and bravely, and worked hard in Hong Kong and other places to carry out all their work.

Starting at 8 pm last night, the Guangzhou YWCA Military Service Corps held a flag presentation ceremony at the Hong Kong YWCA. This manifestation of spirit is truly "the light of women" and "the light of the nation," weaving together a great scene.

These excellent children - fourteen of them - some are students from Guangzhou, some are students from Hong Kong, and some have given up their careers to come. This young group - around fifteen or sixteen to twenty years old - have healthy bodies, lively spirits, and alert minds. In green military uniforms, blue ties, and white gloves, they were all tough and energetic, "Who can tell if I am male or female?" The one or two hundred friends sitting in the audience were ashamed, admired, and gained new inspiration.

Under an atmosphere of solemnity, the grand ceremony unfolded scene by scene:

Mrs. Chen Zuoxuan, the chairman, said: We must not forget patriotism because of escaping. We should be more patriotic because of escaping. - This is certainly a pertinent statement aimed at Hong Kong society.

After Mr. He Xiangning presided over the flag presentation ceremony, all the members of the corps swore: "Obey the teachings of the Premier, support the supreme leader. Serve the war of resistance, and spare no sacrifice." - The blood in everyone's body circulated rapidly.

After the oath, Mr. He Xiangning delivered a message, first extending that the Premier's Three Principles of the People are in line with Jesus's freedom, equality, and fraternity. We should "unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together," and then said that to serve the wounded soldiers and refugees on the front line, we must cherish the essence of our nation. Finally, using the experience of serving wounded soldiers in Shanghai, he encouraged the members not to be afraid of the smell or the dirt, but to work bravely for the country. - The elder's benevolent heart, every sentence is moving.

Mrs. Hu Jihong, the president of the YWCA, said: We must stand up straight and go to the front line. We should not have the affection of children. "I have come to serve, not to be served." Jesus's spirit of "washing the feet of his disciples" is our example.

After the Hong Kong YWCA and the True Light Girls' Middle School presented their flags, the corps leader, Zheng Qingguang, gave a reply.

He reported to everyone vividly about the heroic and hardworking situation of the front-line soldiers and their service process. Hearing about "lice growing on the body," "the song of salted fish and sausages," "a seventeen-year-old girl directing the entire army in guerrilla warfare"... especially made people laugh and sigh! Their work is truly great! Their spirit is truly cheerful!

Singing also touched everyone's hearts. The meeting ended at about 10 o'clock, and everyone's heartstrings were highly vibrating. Everyone was reluctant to leave, and the reporter got more inspiring good news.

The "Nethersole" Hospital will give the hospital site to the corps to train Samsung Ming and provide various conveniences. In addition, warm-hearted people from China and abroad, such as American Mrs. Nadini and the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, have generously donated large sums of money and medicines. These are all the assistance that the corps is grateful for. In particular, the original general secretary of the South China YWCA, the American "Yuan Mei," who provided spiritual and material assistance to the Guangzhou YWCA, gave us a deeper understanding of the international friends' noble sympathy that the War of Resistance will definitely win, and the justice and fairness of mankind are shining brighter day by day.

### Eastern Front News: Enemy encircled and annihilated at the foot of Mount Luofu; invaders fleeing along the Boluo-Zengcheng highway; large numbers of enemy aircraft discovered in Haifeng, intentions unclear

[Dongjiang Quick Report] Our forces, after a planned withdrawal from Zengcheng, have adopted a steady and pragmatic strategy to cope calmly. Therefore, we maintain a favorable and proactive position in maintaining security. In recent days, the results of fierce battles with the enemy have been fruitful. The military situation is as follows:

Enemy Assault on Su Mao Ping, Encircled and Annihilated

The weather here has been extremely bad in recent days, with dark clouds and heavy rain, which is very favorable for our military operations. On the 21st, more than 600 enemy troops reinforced from Guangzhou to Zengcheng, equipped with more than ten small cannons, under the cover of aircraft, advanced through the rain towards our army's position at Su Mao Ping, at the foot of Mount Luofu. Our Wei and Chen regiments, garrisoning the area, defended the strategic location and calmly fought back. In addition, the Lin Junsheng unit of the Third District Guerrilla Force was dispatched to the enemy's rear, launching a surprise attack from behind, engaging the enemy in close combat. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered over a hundred casualties, not counting reinforcements, and fled in panic.

Invasion of Lychee Pass, Another Crushing Blow

According to a forward telephone report, at 4:00 PM that afternoon, another 150 enemy cavalry troops moved out from Yang Mei Long and invaded Lychee Pass. Our defending troops, Chen Ji's unit, having received prior notice, immediately dispatched 200 elite soldiers to ambush in the mountainous areas of Liu Tai and Jun Ping Feng, awaiting in strict formation. Soon, the enemy cavalry arrived swiftly. Our army remained silent, waiting for them to pass the position, and then suddenly launched an intercepting attack, using hand grenades and bayonets in close combat. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy fled in confusion along the Boluo-Zengcheng highway. Our army did not pursue. It was found that more than ten enemy soldiers were killed in the battle, and more than twenty warhorses were captured. In addition, two enemy horses were captured alive. We also suffered several casualties. Also, at 3:00 PM the same afternoon, twelve enemy aircraft (all bombers) flew along the Guangzhou-Zengcheng highway, spying on the areas of Feilongmen, Zheng Guo, and Pai Tan, dropping thirty to forty bombs, but most of them fell in the wilderness, and we suffered no losses.

Enemy Ships on Alert in the Shilong River

According to a telephone report from the front line in Shenzhen, on the evening of the 23rd, near Wen Tang on the Wan-Zhang Road, the Chen Liu unit of our guerrilla's *th company sent a team to attack the enemy in Wancheng, engaging the enemy in Zhenhua Road, Daxi Road, and the highway station outside the west gate of the city. The fierce battle lasted for more than an hour, killing more than ten enemy sentries. The enemy troops in the city heard the alarm and rushed to reinforce. Our team, having completed its mission, left calmly. Furthermore, the Yuan Huazhao unit of the Dongjiang Special Operations Detachment, recently assigned to the command of Commander Wang Ruozhou of the Fourth War Zone Guerrilla Column by order of Deputy Commander Zhang of the Fourth War Zone, was reorganized into the Fourth District Guerrilla Independent Detachment. Yuan's unit was originally stationed in the Pinghu, Guanlan, Longhua, and Buji areas along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Commander Wang Ruozhou, in order to strengthen the front-line defenses, secretly ordered Yuan's unit to advance towards Wancheng and Shilong. It is reported that Yuan (Huazhao), upon receiving the order, had already deployed his troops to the destination and participated in the battle. Therefore, the front-line strength has greatly increased. The enemy, entrenched in Wancheng, has now dispatched two wire-laying ships and more than ten motorboats from Humen to patrol the Shilong River, guarding against our surprise attacks.

Large Number of Enemy Aircraft Discovered in Haifeng

At 10:00 AM on the 24th, twenty-four enemy aircraft were discovered in Haifeng, flying from the southeast across the sea. They did not drop bombs and continued flying towards Zijin and Longchuan. Their intentions are unclear.

### Misinformation About Enemy Invasion of Huiyang and Boluo; False Alarm; The Truth Is Due to Misunderstanding of Armed Clashes in Jiazibu Township

[Huiyang Quick Report] After our Eastern Route Army launched a series of counter-attacks against the enemy, in order to contain our progress, the enemy, in addition to sending reinforcements to resist stubbornly, also released rumors of invading Huiyang and Boluo in an attempt to shake our army's morale. Yesterday, on the 20th, late at night, the county seat suddenly spread rumors that the enemy army was attacking Boluo, plotting to invade Huiyang. Upon hearing the news, the residents were greatly panicked and dispersed spontaneously. The chaotic situation was almost the same as on the eve of the fall of Huizhou last year. On the 21st, the reporter, in order to clarify the truth, made a special visit to the responsible persons of the military and political authorities here to inquire. It was learned that the reason for the rumors of the enemy's invasion of Huiyang was that late at night on the 20th, a telephone call was suddenly received from the Boluo County government, reporting that many figures were found along the river near Guanghe, with flashlights shining and gunshots quite frequent, suspected of being enemy troops coming to harass. Therefore, a request was made to send troops to defend. As a result, the people in Huicheng were somewhat agitated. It has now been ascertained that the evening event was due to armed clashes between the Chen and Huang families in Jiazibu Township and that it was by no means an enemy invasion. The authorities are now actively dispelling the rumors and stabilizing the people's minds. It is reported that we have deployed heavy troops in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River and the Luofu Mountains, and the defenses are exceptionally solid.

### Facilitate the Transmission and Distribution of Publications; Guangdong Province Establishes Cultural Relay Stations; First Established in Ten Counties and Cities, Including Qujiang

[Xingning News] In order to strengthen propaganda and adapt to wartime transportation for the transfer of propaganda publications, the Central Propaganda Department, in conjunction with relevant central agencies, has established Cultural Relay Stations, specializing in the transmission of publications, designating responsible persons, and assigning branch station work and distribution responsibilities. It is planned to establish branch stations in important cities and towns in each province, with the provincial party headquarters in charge. It is reported that Guangdong Province will first establish branch stations in Qujiang, Xingning, Shantou, Heyuan, Huiyang, Luoding, Maoming, Taishan, Hepu, and Guangning counties and cities, and designate the secretaries-general of the party headquarters in each county and city to be responsible for the branch station work. The Qujiang branch station has already begun operations. In the future, central propaganda publications will be distributed by the branch station.

### Enemy Aircraft Rampage, Hepu Bombed, Damage Surveyed; A Total of Nineteen Bombs Dropped, Significant Losses

[Nanlu Quick Report] After the city of Hepu County and Zongjiangkou were狂bombed by enemy aircraft on the 13th, there have been air raid alarms every day. Yesterday (the 19th) at 9:00 AM, eight enemy aircraft again took off from Wuzhou and flew into Liancheng, dropping nineteen bombs. Five bombs hit Shangcangkou and the impoverished residential area. One bomb hit the Mo residence, destroying several houses. One bomb hit the Yihe store, destroying four stores. One bomb hit No. 20, destroying one room. One bomb landed between Nos. 8 and 6, destroying No. 6 completely and collapsing part of No. 8, also affecting the residences at Nos. 10, 12, and 13. One bomb landed between the Ma Guoxiang residence and the Ye residence, destroying both residences completely. Five bombs also landed on Dabeijie, including two bombs hitting the Ma residence, destroying it completely. One bomb hit the Xie residence at No. 14, destroying a wall and one room. One bomb landed in the back garden of No. 16 on the right side of the Xie residence, destroying a courtyard wall. One bomb hit the Xiangtai Sauce Garden at No. 17, destroying fifty to sixty jars of sauce, causing losses of several thousand yuan, and also affecting several residences. The above two disaster areas were bombed for the fifth time. In addition, one bomb landed in the open space at the gate of Zhongshan Park, damaging the main gate archway. One bomb landed in the hall of Wang Zhi's home on Xiaodongmen Street, destroying the hall and affecting several rooms. One bomb landed by the pond near Dongpo Park, causing no losses. One bomb landed on the right side of Xiaobin Xing, damaging several papaya trees, with no other losses. One bomb landed at No. 19 Huiai East Road, destroying several residences. One bomb landed in the Wang family's garden on Fumin South Road, destroying several walls. One bomb landed in the river opposite the Wang family, destroying several bamboo trees. There were also two bombs that landed in open spaces, injuring only one person's tongue. Also, when the enemy aircraft wantonly caused destruction, our defense troops fired artillery to resist, but unfortunately, they did not hit.

### The Enemy's Quagmire Deepens; The Diverse Scenes on Hainan Island; Internal Strife Between the Enemy's Army and Navy Increasingly Sharp; Fearful of Our Forces, They Implement Terrorist Policies

[Guangzhou Bay Special Report] Since the enemy invaded Qiongya (Hainan Island), it has been more than two months. The enemy is desperately seeking to completely occupy Qiongya and has spared no effort to send large reinforcements. However, due to the joint heroic resistance of our military and civilians and the launch of extensive guerrilla warfare, the stubborn enemy has been repeatedly annihilated. The enemy now feels that their quagmire is getting deeper and deeper. The recent situation on Qiong Island is reported as follows:

Intensifying Internal Strife Among the Invading Enemy Troops in Qiong

The enemy troops' invasion of Qiongya has been constrained by our guerrillas, who are tired of coping and unable to achieve their intended purpose. The enemy's army and navy invading Qiong are blaming each other, and conflicts of opinion are frequent. It is reported that the commander of the enemy's army in Qiong, Iida, recently had a conflict with Katsumada, the chief advisor to the army and navy on Hainan Island dispatched by the enemy, due to disagreements. At one meeting, they clashed with each other. Iida drew his gun to shoot Katsumada, but was dissuaded by other officers. Since then, Katsumada has been demoralized and has recently been absent due to illness. The two sides are at odds, and the internal strife has intensified. According to another report, the enemy general Iida, because the military situation has not progressed and he has been repeatedly punished by his superiors, has become passive and there are reports that he will resign and return home.

Implementing Terrorist Policies Against the People

In the two months since the enemy troops invaded Qiong, due to the exceptional activity of our guerrillas, they have suffered repeated heavy blows and are extremely angry. Therefore, they have been wantonly massacring and plundering the people in our occupied areas. Recently, they have implemented terrorist policies in an attempt to intimidate our people and make them submit to their clutches. According to visitors from Haikou, the number of people being indiscriminately killed and arrested by the enemy in recent days is countless. On the 12th of this month, the enemy in Haikou, under the pretext of convening a citizens' meeting, forced our resident citizens to attend the meeting. At that time, more than 400 people were forced to attend, but the enemy detained all of them and has not released them to this day. Their fate is unknown. The remaining citizens are in a state of panic and are looking for ways to escape. The entire city of Haikou has become a world of terror.

Guerrillas Active, Inflicting Repeated Blows on the Enemy

The people in all areas, because of the enemy's invasion and the brutal killings, are filled with hatred and vow to avenge their hometowns. Therefore, the guerrilla teams are exceptionally active, launching surprise attacks on the enemy troops. According to military intelligence, on the 18th of this month, our guerrillas advanced to a certain place several miles away from Qiongshan City and attacked the enemy, annihilating more than a hundred enemy soldiers and capturing a large number of guns, equipment, and documents. The enemy has now retreated into Qiong City and is trapped there, fearing another attack by our guerrillas. On the same day, the enemy airfield in Huachang, Chengmai County, was also suddenly attacked by a guerrilla team of ours. The fierce battle lasted for several hours. As a result, two to three hundred enemy soldiers were killed. The enemy transported the corpses to Hongshan Beipu near Haikou for cremation. The enemy was so ashamed and angry that they sent several enemy aircraft to fly to the villages near Huachang and indiscriminately bombed them, causing many civilian casualties. The situation is extremely tragic.

Enemy Troops in Haikou Implement Martial Law

Recently, because our guerrilla teams have been exerting great effort and repeatedly breaking into enemy positions, the enemy troops are panic-stricken and have become extremely vigilant. Since the enemy occupied Haikou and Qiongzhou, they have established their headquarters at Qionghai Middle School outside the west gate of Fucheng. All combat strategies are issued from there. Recently, as our troops have launched offensives in Wenchang, Ding'an, and Qiongshan, the sounds of gunfire can be heard in the suburbs of each county city. The enemy troops are greatly alarmed and have been relocating various military agencies out of Haikou for days. Even the enemy headquarters is transporting its stored equipment and documents by vehicle, reportedly to be moved to ships to operate from there. The extent of their panic can be seen from this.

### The New Haimen Steamer Harassed by the Enemy in Fujian; Safe Thanks to Protection by British Warship; Foreign Merchant Ships Often Illegally Harassed; Two Norwegian Ships Seized to Taiwan

Disregarding international law, the enemy navy frequently harasses and illegally detains foreign merchant ships sailing along the Chinese coast, and even forcibly seizes them. Many ships have not yet been released. On the 18th of this month, the enemy ships harassing Wenhai again harassed foreign merchant ships, including the New Haimen, anchored in Fujian. In addition to burning the cargo barges of each ship, they also seized the Norwegian cargo ship Dali Hua, which has not yet been released. After the incident, this port received a telegram from Shantou reporting that the New Haimen was also detained for a time. People in this port expressed great concern about this. The ship arrived safely in port yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The reporter made a special visit to people on the ship, and they gave a detailed account of the events in Fuzhou, which are described as follows:

Encountering Enemy Harassment on the Waters of Fuzhou

This incident occurred on the 18th of this month at Fuzhou. At the time, the ship was anchored at Cangshi waters in Fuzhou, outside the blockade line set up by the Chinese military authorities in Fuzhou. It was loading cargo from Fuzhou, preparing to sail to Shantou, and then from Shantou to this port. At the same time, there were four other cargo ships anchored there: the British merchant ship Haikou, the Greek cargo ship Panama (transliteration), and the two Norwegian cargo ships Sanmin and Dali Hua. The above four ships were all anchored outside the blockade line. At the same time, several barges loading cargo from Fuzhou were anchored near the ships. The British warship Scott, stationed in Fuzhou to protect overseas Chinese, was also stationed near the ships. At noon on the 18th of this month, a single enemy ship invading the waters suddenly dispatched dozens of enemy soldiers, driving a motorboat to the anchorage. The enemy soldiers first boarded the Dali Hua and Sanmin ships, harassing them at will.

Setting Fire to Ships, Enemy Aircraft Threatening

At that time, there were many barges attached to the two ships, all fully loaded with Fuzhou export goods, ready to be transferred to the Sanmin for export. After the enemy soldiers boarded the ships and harassed them, they immediately threw ropes on the barges and dragged one of them away. When the enemy soldiers were wreaking havoc, many enemy aircraft flew low and circled over the ships, threatening them. The British warship Scott immediately sent many sailors, driving a motorboat to this ship (New Haimen) to provide strict protection. The English officer sent by the British warship immediately negotiated with the enemy regarding the enemy soldiers harassing the Dali Hua and Sanmin barges. The enemy soldiers, seeing that this ship was protected by British soldiers, immediately returned to the motorboat and retreated to the enemy ship.

Seizing Two Ships, Releasing One

The next day (the 19th), an enemy motorboat came again. At that time, the Haikou had already left Fuzhou and was sailing in Cangshi waters. Only this ship and the Sanmin, Dali Hua, and Babinla were left anchored. The enemy soldiers boarded the Sanmin and Dali Hua again. The owner of this ship, fearing that the enemy soldiers would wreak havoc again, immediately ordered the barges to quickly return to the port. The enemy soldiers then boarded this ship. The ship owner and the English officer met with the enemy soldiers. First, they asked about the nationality of this ship. The ship owner immediately replied that it was a British merchant ship. The enemy soldiers then asked if the cargo was being transported to China. The ship owner replied that the cargo was being transported to Hong Kong. The enemy soldiers could not find what they were looking for and retreated to the motorboat. They then went to the Dali Hua and Sanmin ships and used force to coerce the ship owners to follow the enemy ship and sail away from Fuzhou. It is reported that they have been taken to Taiwan. When this ship left Fuzhou, the Sanmin had been released and was sailing back. However, there has been no news of the release of the Dali Hua. It is reported that the seized Norwegian ship Dali Hua was full of timber. A month ago, a sister ship of the same company was originally planning to load cargo in Fuzhou and sail to Shanghai, but after the first ship sailed, it was seized by an enemy ship on the way. Therefore, the company authorities telegraphed the Dali Hua to temporarily anchor in Fuzhou and not sail. The ship obeyed the order and anchored in Fuzhou for several months, but in the end, it could not avoid being detained by the enemy ship.

### Shantou Visitors Talk: Shantou Is As Peaceful As Usual; Evacuation Order Is Good; Cargo Transport Is Normal

The Yusheng, a boat that goes between here and Shantou, arrived. A reporter went on board to interview the recent events in Shantou and is hereby providing a collection of what was found out.

Evacuation Situation

According to the crew, after Shantou entered wartime preparations, residents evacuated one after another. On the highways from Shantou to Chaozhou and other places, pedestrians were endless. 80-90% of the machines in the factories are being returned to the interior of the eight counties. The evacuation was carried out in good order. Those who are currently staying in Shantou belong to the local defense army, the Self-Defense Regiment, and a portion of people who are unwilling to leave due to business relations. The local area is still as peaceful as usual.

Slightly Less Cargo

Although the situation in Shantou is very tense, cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou is still normal. Ordinary cargo is less than before. As for grain and rice, they are still being shipped continuously from Hong Kong. Many of the rice and grain in Chaozhou and other counties rely on external supplies. They are being transshipped from Shantou. The amount of supplies being delivered still needs to be large.

The day before Chen Yunshang left Shanghai, Tong Yuejuan specially gave her a diamond ring, worth 1,700 yuan (actual price). The rumored 17,000 yuan is not accurate.

The film industry in the occupied areas is very active. Previous productions by various companies have been pirated. Silent films sell for about 200 yuan each.

Manager Jin Cheng and Guohua Supervisor Shuangren Liu Zhonghao are busy promoting "Song Jue Lei Hen" these days.

Huang Jiamo's "Three Musketeers" movie song has been recorded by Baidai Company. This is his debut work and will definitely create a sensation.

Bu Wancang is practicing economy and has sold his car. There is also news that Wu Yonggang is going to Hong Kong.

Xi Qiuyun is currently surrounded by various film companies, all wanting to sign a long-term contract with her. It is reported that Ms. Xi's conditions focus on the director and script. It remains to be seen which company will hire her.

Wang Yuanlong's "Yanzi Li San" has now been renamed "Yanzi Dao" and will be filmed after "Three-Episode Incarnation Girl."

"Wang Zhaojun" was originally planned to be filmed by Xinhua Company, and Li Minghui was designated as the lead actress at the time. Now that it is being filmed, the lead actress has been changed to Chen Yanyan.

Diao Banhua, who has been away from the silver screen for a long time, will soon be filming a new film, "Four Demon Kings."

The first scene of "Mysterious Madam" is a casting call for a beautiful face. The first scene of "Three-Episode Incarnation Girl" is a pair of treasures - Han Langen and Guan Hongda being bedridden.

After "Ying Cheng Ji", Chen Kengran has decided to direct "Women's Apartment."

The famous amateur singer Wang Huigu recently played the role of Su Qiu in "Mysterious Madam" as a guest appearance. Her initial tryout was amazing. If it's not a genius, how can one attain this? We hope she does well.

"Chu Bawang" (The Conqueror) is being screened in Hong Kong. The prosperity of the business is greater than in Shanghai, therefore it aroused the attention of Hong Kong film circles, who believe that the film has a very grand scene, thus causing the Hong Kong film circles to feel great interest. Thus there are plans for ten companies to jointly produce a costume drama, and thus Wang Cilong came to Hong Kong to answer the call.

### The Lineup of Great Hollywood Directors Continued

(23) Leo McCarey, Best Director of 1937. Who would have believed that in his early years, he was directing Laurel and Hardy's short films?

### Happy Angel (11)

"Please forgive me, I remembered the woman I knew before again. But, you have always had platinum hair," he stared at her shiny, silky hair.

"Why not? Ever since I could understand things, it hasn't changed," she smiled, "The one you remember, did she also have silver hair?"

"She had red hair, but I still suspected it."

"Tell me, what was she like?"

"She was a graduate of the University of Vienna and also the most imaginative liar I've ever met. Do you understand any Russian songs?"

"Ah, yes," she nodded, "When I was a child, my father taught me some."

Harry quickly ran to the piano and started playing. "Do you know this song?"

"One Night of Joy!" she said softly.

"That's right, what's your name?"

"Ai...Lin,"

Harry clapped his hands victoriously and shouted, "I knew it, you're the one!"

"Which one?" she asked, widening her eyes in confusion

"That red-haired lying child, Ailin, I knew I would never be mistaken. You don't need to shake your head and make strange faces. No matter how you lie, you can't erase the memories of that night at the Omorkai dormitory."

Ailin raised her head, suddenly burst into laughter, then suddenly stopped, and held out a hand to him, "Good night, friend, my red-headed friend."

"Good night," Harry said dully. He stood there blankly, feeling a strange emptiness and failure.

"Thank you, because you made me laugh too much." She added. (To be continued)

### Basketball Association Meeting Tonight to Discuss Shenbao Cup Charity Tournament; Summer is Approaching, Hope to Organize it Soon

(Our Newspaper Special Report) At the end of last year, our newspaper suggested to the Basketball Association to find ways to hold a women's charity event to raise funds to help our compatriots. The trophy would be donated by our newspaper. At that time, Mr. Gao Xiwei, Chairman of the Association, expressed his agreement and proposed it at the Executive Committee meeting, which resolved to hold it.

Later, the Association re-elected its officers and focused on organizing the open men's league. Due to being busy, the resolution for the charity tournament was put aside. Until now, there is still no definite news about when it will be held.

Since the new officers of the Association were elected, they have been very active in carrying out the association's affairs, which has been well received by all parties. Therefore, it is hoped that the association will not forget about the charity tournament and will try to make it happen in the near future. If it is not held soon, it will not be suitable when the hot summer weather arrives, because that narrow basketball hall is really not suitable for holding a competition that attracts a large number of spectators in the summer.

In short, the Association, remembering this unfinished matter, will hold an Executive Committee meeting tonight to discuss preparations for organizing it.

Regarding the participating teams, the idea from relevant parties is that since this is a charity tournament, it is best to keep it open. Every unit, whether it is a school or a group, should be able to form a strong team to participate in the competition, without strict restrictions. If this is the case, it can greatly increase the interest of the entire tournament. Moreover, this is a charitable cause, and the only meaning is to appeal for the suffering compatriots. The principle of championship should not be overemphasized. For basketball players, it is just a small effort, so why not do it? (Dong Lang)

### Yesterday's Tennis Singles Semi-Finals: Xu Wei Pei Defeats Da Lin Zhen; Today Xu Run Pei vs. Li Huitang

The All-Hong Kong Open Tennis Singles Semi-Finals were held yesterday afternoon, and Xu Wei Pei met Da Lin Zhen. Many people came to watch, and the seats were full. This match was a best-of-five-sets format, and the starting time was advanced by fifteen minutes.

In the first set, Da Lin Zhen used offense as defense, and his forehand sweeps were beautiful and interesting, taking the lead all the way, with an absolute advantage of five to two. Everyone thought that Da Xu would definitely give up the first set, save his energy, and then plan in the second set. However, Da Xu calmly responded, using left-handed strokes and right-handed chops to chase to a five-to-five tie. Da Lin Zhen tried his best to counterattack, his strokes and presses were exquisite, and the applause was endless, taking the lead again with six to five. Da Xu didn't take it to heart and calmly parried, finally winning the first set with nine to seven.

In the second set, Da Xu changed his strategy, using the method of returning the attack near the net, making Da Lin Zhen run around, reducing his energy. Da Lin Zhen tried his best to cope, although he exhausted a lot of energy, he didn't care, and he kept smashing all the way, and his ambition was finally realized, winning back one set with six to two, but at this time he was already panting like a cow.

In the third set, Da Xu took advantage of his opponent's fatigue and began to smash and press, the angles were accurate and sharp, Da Lin Zhen found it difficult to cope and could not parry, so Da Xu won another set with a score of six to one.

In the fourth set, Da Xu's situation improved in the third set, and at this point, his determination to fight was even stronger. Although Da Lin Zhen did not show weakness, he once took the lead with a three-to-one game, but Da Xu shook his spirits again, and his divine power was greatly displayed, his long strokes and short hits were all appropriate, and he completed the final set with a six-to-three in one go. The overall result was three to one, Da Xu won.

Another singles semi-final will be held today, Xu Run Pei vs. Li Yingtang. Xiao Xu is a rising star with extraordinary skills, while Li is rich in experience and can often win with skill. Today, Xiao Xu meets him, and their ball skills each have their own merits, so it is impossible to predict who will win.

### What Chinese People Should Do in the All-Out War of Resistance

— Zou Falu

The War of Resistance has reached its current stage, and the war zone has spread across the country. North China, Central China, East China, and South China are all covered with war clouds. Under the joint initiation of "guerrilla warfare," "mobile warfare," and "positional warfare," battles are taking place almost anytime and anywhere. The huge consumption of resources in the military aspect can be imagined. To compensate for this consumption, we must not only open up sources of income, but also cut spending. If any member of the public or any industry can save a penny, the economic power of the War of Resistance will be enriched by one point, the sustainability of the War of Resistance will be extended by one moment, and the certainty of final victory will be increased by one point.

If the physical exercise industry can strive for economy, it can ultimately contribute to the economy of the War of Resistance to some extent. This is the principle that current sports must adhere to: economy.

Since this War of Resistance is all-out, we should follow the leader's declaration that "everyone, regardless of gender, age, or strength, should resist the war." Every member of the Chinese nation is responsible for the War of Resistance. To shoulder this arduous and difficult responsibility, it is difficult to be competent without quickly possessing a physique like a cast iron pot. To enable everyone to quickly possess a strong physique, there must first be a sport that can be effectively implemented by everyone in a short period of time. Engaging in exercise without achieving results, complicated movements, numerous methods, consuming a lot of time in learning, and spending little time on exercise, or sports that only a few people can learn and most people cannot, are definitely not the ideal sports we need. This is the principle that current sports must adhere to: ease of learning.

Based on the aforementioned reason that everyone must possess a strong physique to support the precarious situation, then this type of sport must be able to be implemented by everyone, everywhere, and at all times among our 450 million people and within our 3.5 million square miles of territory, whether it is spring, summer, autumn, winter, wind, rain, morning, or dusk. If it limits the number of people, the venue, the weather, the equipment, etc., and only a few people, a few regions, or a few times can do it, while the majority cannot, it is difficult to achieve widespread implementation and great results. This is the principle that current sports must adhere to: ease of implementation.

Today's sports methods, Chinese, foreign, old, and newly emerging, are too numerous to count. Let's try to review them according to the above three principles. Which ones are suitable for the current needs? Those who love national sports think that playing ball is sports, and sports that are not ball games are not sports. Buying balls requires money, and building venues and equipment requires money. It does not conform to the principle of economy. The movements are complex and the methods are numerous. It is not something that most people without athletic talent or foundation can learn. It does not conform to the principle of ease of learning. It cannot be done with many people or few people. It cannot be done without venues and equipment. It does not conform to the principle of ease of implementation. Is it the track and field sport that is the most agile and can dazzle for a while? It has the same shortcomings as ball games to some extent. Is it horseback riding, swimming, and all kinds of apparatus gymnastics? They either require funding and equipment, or they are difficult to learn, or they must choose the time and place to implement them. These are not the sports that we urgently need in the current environment. I think the sports we need now are "national martial arts," "calisthenics," "running," and "mountain climbing." Let me explain the reason.

National martial arts and calisthenics can be done with equipment, and can also be done without equipment. This is economy. One person can do it, and hundreds or thousands of people can do it. It can be done in the open air when the weather is clear, and it can also be done in a small room when it is raining. This is easy to do. Although their movements also need to be learned, once guided, anyone can imitate them, and after learning a part or a set, they can practice it for life. This is easy to learn.

Climbing and running not only do not require any equipment or cost a penny, but they also do not need to be learned. As long as you can walk and run, there is no way you can't do these sports. Although running is difficult in rainy weather, and climbing is impossible in places without mountains, you can still use national martial arts or calisthenics to replace it when it rains, and you can use running to replace it in places where there are no mountains to climb. It still does not violate the principle of ease of implementation.

In short, if we can practice these four sports alternately, not only those that cannot be done can be replaced with each other, but also those that are biased towards the lower limbs, such as climbing and running, can be remedied with the upper limb movements of national martial arts and calisthenics. The movements of national martial arts, which involve more limbs, can be remedied with the trunk movements of calisthenics. Those who are new to exercise or are weak can use national martial arts and calisthenics to build a good foundation before climbing and running. If everyone can truly make up their minds to do it, then regardless of gender or age, in a small room, in a deserted mountain, in windy or rainy weather, or in cold or hot seasons, there is no place or time where they cannot practice sports without spending a penny, truly achieving the mission of universally improving their physique.

Some people say that these sports are monotonous, boring, and lack interest. Forcing oneself to do them will definitely feel pain in the spirit. It is better to do ball games and track and field sports, which are free and lively and have a strong interest, which can make people develop the intention of self-exercise, and the value comes to be great. Indeed, some people can have this kind of phenomenon. The author has always loved this kind of fascinating sports, and I deeply agree with this statement.

However, let's examine carefully how many people in the whole country can play ball games and other sports. What is the result of schools having formal classes and training in these sports all day long? Isn't it just cultivating a few special athletes with athletic talent? Isn't the sports field the exclusive property of a few flamboyant athletes? Most students still don't know what these sports are, even if they exist, it's as if they don't. The so-called interest is just the interest of a few people.

As for saying that the movements of national martial arts and calisthenics are monotonous, and climbing and running lack interest, it is true that they have not recognized the true meaning of these sports. The so-called monotonous movements are by no means a problem in themselves, but a problem of the method of operation and the selection of materials. The same kind of materials, those that are monotonous can be improved by making the method of operation lively, and in terms of material selection, it can be arbitrarily controlled whether it is monotonous or lively. In addition to exercising the physique, climbing and running can also appreciate the scenery of nature, roam the eyes and enjoy the heart, and sing a song after reaching the destination, which can cultivate character, which is not something that ball games and other sports that are confined to one corner can achieve. What's more, the great achievements of national martial arts in annihilating the enemy have been indelible. After the War of Resistance has shifted to the mountainous areas, the skills of crossing mountains and ridges and advancing and retreating quickly are even more closely related to climbing and running.

The success of a career must be achieved through hard work. The so-called "bitterness ends with sweetness" and "eating all the hardships in bitterness to become a superior person" is the meaning of this. If we give up doing it because it is "boring" or "painful," then our War of Resistance today, seeking life in death, can be said to be incomparably difficult, and it can be said to be extremely boring to plan to kill the enemy and achieve results all day long. We can also stop here and be at ease as slaves and horses of the enemy. Is this the attitude we should have?

Compatriots, at this final juncture of life and death, we seem not to ignore the facts, not to examine the surroundings, and still only seek pleasure and value interest, and specialize in doing those aristocratic and pleasurable sports, and not be willing to strengthen our will and struggle to overcome difficulties to seek the liberation of the nation and the freedom of the country.

Economics Column

### Germany's Price Stabilization Policy

— Translated by Chen Baorong

This article was written by the German economist Wagner, and translated from the Japanese International Economic Weekly, issue 991. The original title was "The Formation of Prices and Their Stabilization Policy"! Translator

Monetary System Based on Labor

The central issue of price policy is none other than the issue of stabilizing prices. How to prevent changes in the price market when drastic changes occur within the economy. There are often various reasons for believing that this kind of fact is irresistible, and even the so-called "quantitative boom" is based on "price boom." In the past, capital and its income always occupied the center of economic life, but today, the key to our desire to analyze all economic phenomena will be found in labor and its payment. Therefore, although Germany's monetary system was initially based on gold, today it has been changed to labor as its foundation. At first, we believed that the best way to guarantee the future material life of the people was to accumulate currency, but today, this kind of guarantee for currency has lost its confidence. What has replaced it is our right to labor, and it is necessary to grant it permanent labor rights. Moreover, it is not only the right to carry out labor, but also to guarantee its income at any time.

Germany's New Price Policy

Since the economic theory of the German National Socialist government fundamentally adopts this kind of attitude, it can be used to explain the impact of price changes and the various reasons for price changes based on economic fluctuations. Therefore, the new price policy of the National Socialist government is not only satisfied with eliminating the current obstacles. In the past, the most outstanding price commissioners only needed to solve their practical problems in an agile way, but now, in addition to practical problems, it is also necessary to solve their fundamental principles, that is, how to make price changes fully adapt to today's economic life. High-price policy, that is, the policy of striving to raise prices and seek to overcome panic, may not be able to stimulate the general economy and recognize the prosperity, but the sharp rise in prices does have various major dangers, and must be given deep warning. In the transitional period, although high prices may have the effect of revitalizing the economy, they are also creating deadly toxins at the same time. Therefore, German National Socialism does not unconditionally oppose the rise in prices, nor does it unconditionally adopt the policy of preventing the rise in prices. For this kind of enterprise, the essence is also completely different from the general policies. In a word, it is to seek to establish a fair price.

Establish a "Fair Price"

When a tendency for prices to rise is found in all aspects of the economy, that is, on the one hand, it has affected external economic relations and has a negative effect, and on the other hand, the raw material economy has changed due to the increase in the burden of ancestors. This tendency is still unable to fully overcome the panic that dominates the various sectors of the economy. In this situation, the National Socialist government, on the one hand, sets "maximum prices" so that the vigorous plan in the price policy is fully and reasonably completed to maintain the possibility of construction, and on the other hand, conducts individual and fundamental reviews of the various economic parts to ensure that the prices of each part are in line with the characteristics of that part, that is, individually applies various special controls.

Examining price policy cannot only focus on monetary prices. If this point of view is used, it cannot be consistent with its purpose. Usually, when prices fall, there is always hope for them to rebound, but it is not known that the level of prices is not the main issue. The truly main issue is whether the interrelationship between prices is balanced and whether they are mutually adapted to the national economic life and other factors. In other words, whether the price level maintains a fair relationship is the focus of the issue.

The so-called "fair relationship" is generally determined by the national economy. Therefore, the concept of price must be criticized from the standpoint of the entire national economy, that is, criticized from the business point of view on the one hand, and criticized from the market price on the other hand.

Today's prices in Germany are adapted to production on the one hand, and adapted to labor income on the other hand. The only thing that the German leader is most concerned about for the German economy today is how to adjust the necessary labor.

The Task of Germany's Price Policy

In recent years, although Germany's price policy has fulfilled its function of stabilizing economic life, it has not yet been able to fulfill its task in this way. Because in a certain period, it should try to reduce the impact of external price increases (that is, reduce the impact of the world's price increases), and at a certain time, it should try to help open up sales markets and establish appropriate and strong prices. After the technological development of new raw materials, it should determine how to enter the market at a price, and even solve all the needs in social policy and the technical problems in supply, etc. New tasks can be generated in price policy.

### On Doing Good Deeds by Zhang Chunfeng

— Zhang Chunfeng

Feng Yingwang has a poem: "Just know to do good deeds, don't ask about the future." This contrived saying has the same steadfast and unyielding spirit as the saying "Laugh at those who cry for help, I will be a good official myself."

In fact, these two lines of poetry, when discussed today, must first be given a footnote, otherwise, it is very easy to be greatly misled. For example, everyone knows that donating wealth to the country is a good thing, a responsibility that every Chinese person should fulfill, but it is inevitable that petty people will take the opportunity to amass wealth, swindle, and extort. Just like some time ago, some people even used the name of an art exhibition to help disaster relief to carry out fraudulent fundraising, and as a result, the charity money was embezzled, and they absconded with the donations. From this, it can be seen that although good deeds should be done, it is right to ask about the future first, otherwise, not only will you be deceived, but villains will also take advantage of these two lines of poetry to perform their tricks, which is what we should be wary of first.

The Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian scholar Shao Kangjie had words to teach his son: "You should certainly do good, but you must also do it according to your ability. If you don't measure your ability, even if it is good, you shouldn't do it."

Although these words make Feng Lianwang's poetry more reasonable, they only see one side and miss the other. That is, people who do good deeds must of course have the effort of measuring, which means that the recipient of the good deeds should also have some measuring work. Measuring is not only measuring and weighing, but also the work of on-site investigation. For example, if the people who cheated money through the art exhibition had been suspected and investigated at the beginning of their scam, the scam would probably not have succeeded.

### Elegance and Vulgarity

— Moye

In the past, the elegant scholar Ni Yunlin was caught by Zhang Shixin in Taihu Lake one day and whipped almost to death because he refused to write for Zhang Shixin. But he did not utter a word while being whipped. Someone asked him the reason, and he said: "Opening my mouth would be vulgar."

Unbelievable, such an elegant scholar, not even caring about his life, is truly rare. However, isn't such affectation a bit too elegant? Because in my opinion, not opening one's mouth can only be considered tough and unyielding, a good man, but has nothing to do with elegance. If you deliberately want to use this as elegance, it would be too elegant and become vulgar.

Too elegant becomes vulgar, just like what is said in *The Scholars*, "elegance becomes too vulgar." At that time, ordinary literati would drink wine, look at flowers, and compose poems at the slightest opportunity, claiming to be refined, so Wu Jingzi greatly ridiculed them for a while, and it is still a topic of conversation today.

Speaking of this kind of elegant habit, it seems that the remaining influence is still not completely gone today, or it has even become more intense, with everything having to be elegant, and nothing willing to be vulgar. There is no need to say anything else, just take the elegant names, pen names, and aliases of a few people as an example. They have already exhausted the wonders of elegance, and one cannot help but sigh at the exquisiteness of elegance. There was a time when names always used flowers, birds, insects, and fish to represent them, and were accompanied by melancholic and sorrowful adjectives. This can be said to be soft-style elegance. Now, it has finally changed, and everyone is using "口口口口口, 口口口口" these words to name themselves. This may be said to be hard-style.

I am not saying that these names are not elegant at all. On the contrary, I admit that they are elegant. But when one person initiates and many people follow, any elegant thing becomes unbearably vulgar, just as Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty was an elegant person with many elegant deeds. The likes of Tang Bohu and Zhang Mengjin of the Ming Dynasty, imitating others awkwardly, made people want to vomit.

It is certainly not easy to define elegance and vulgarity. However, I say that there seems to be some scope here, in addition to the initiator being elegant and the followers being vulgar, there is also: the intentional being vulgar, the unintentional being elegant. I find Ni Yunlin to be vulgar because of his intentionality. He was originally a person from the end of the Yuan and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, which coincides with what is said in *The Carnal Prayer Mat*, that people of the Yuan Dynasty each had an alias, so he was called Yunlinzi, which is also one of the signs of his vulgarity. As for his old habit of being obsessed with cleanliness, he was simply learning from Bi Miyuanzhang, and only made his vulgarity reek. Dang Jixian's writing poems in Beijing and in Hanoi can be seen in the same light: imitating elegance, vulgar, vulgar, vulgar!

Mo Junli's "Acting Pretensely"—imitating Gao Junerji's elegant name—is a portrait of these elegant people. I want to collect these materials, and I am afraid that there are countless of them, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, which can be used for combat and can fill countless volumes.

However, elegant things are only for literati, and illiterate people have no share; therefore, just as there are too many elegant literati who become vulgar, there are also too many vulgar illiterate people who become elegant. Grand Tutor Dang's gold-decorated account, lamb and fine wine, is a clear example of this, while the Black Whirlwind of Liangshan opening his mouth with "Laozi" and closing his mouth with "Iron Ox" is really cute and not vulgar at all. Even Ah Q under Lu Xun's pen, several times saying "I want...", I also consider him the second most elegant person in modern times. Why? It is only because of their innocence, unintentional towards elegance, and what they say and do, unprecedented and unmatched, naturally wonderfully unique, and vulgar to the point of being too elegant.

Among the literati, Huang Shangu is still somewhat reasonable. When he arrived in Xuanzhou, someone asked him to write calligraphy, and he accepted all requests and responded to every need. Some people felt sorry for him because he gave it to vulgar people. He smiled and said, "If there is a non-vulgar person, bring one to me to see." These words are truly extremely pleasant. Conversely, who is an elegant person, who is not a vulgar person? From this, I can also see some of the truth about elegance and vulgarity.

I often hear people say that articles should be "appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar" to be considered excellent articles. I don't quite believe this, because what can be appreciated by the elegant cannot necessarily be appreciated by the vulgar, and what can be appreciated by the vulgar cannot necessarily be appreciated by the elegant. Therefore, I think that perhaps "not appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar" is an excellent article. As for my not-so-excellent article, since it is difficult to approach elegance and difficult to descend to vulgarity, I can only say that it is "not appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar."

### Mother and Son

— Tian

Just after putting down the rice bowl, Big Mazi's wife and son started arguing again in the low house.

"Damn it, really damn it!" Uncle Shubo knocked on his dry tobacco pipe, stretched out his firewood-like hand, wiped off the porridge soup stained on his whiskers, moved his mouth and said: "With such a tired mouth, what are they arguing about so fiercely? They can't even get food in their mouths, but they have the leisure to quarrel, alas, alas!" He sighed while groping for his already empty dry tobacco pouch.

Aunt Shubo was tearing apart the old clothes under the eaves of the house, pulling out the stocking yarn to make wicks. Seeing Uncle Shubo sitting on the threshold sighing, she turned her head and glanced at him: "Old thing, mind your own business, take care of yourself! You won't die from smoking a few less pipes. Didn't you hear Wang Er, who carries the groceries, say that he went to the city to get some goods and suffered the anger of those Japanese soldiers? He almost took off the felt hat on his head, but he was beaten until his teeth bled, and he was hit twice in the back with rifle butts. He swore not to go into the city again, and would sell off the remaining goods, preferring to starve to death at home. So even if you have money, you won't be able to buy tobacco to smoke." She said venomously.

"See when these evil ghosts will cause trouble..." Uncle Shubo swept the ground and added a line.

But the mother and son in Big Mazi's low house were arguing even more fiercely, with curses, wails, and the sound of breaking bowls coming one after another. Aunt Shubo, who had just told Shubo not to interfere, dropped the broken clothes and yarn balls, and was the first to run to the low house, muttering: "Alas, arguing, arguing, turning the world upside down, it's still mother and son... what good can come of it..."

Just as Aunt Shubo was about to step into the threshold of the low house, Big Mazi's son desperately rushed out of the house, followed by Big Mazi's wife, her face turning from white to green with anger, panting, clutching a door bar in her hand, obviously trying to chase after and beat her son. Aunt Shubo was quick-witted and quick-handed, grabbing her and saying, "What's wrong? Why are you so angry? Calm down, what big deal is there between mother and son? It's always better to discuss things. After your husband, Big Mazi, died, he left only this little treasure, and there are no other daughters and daughters-in-law here."

"Auntie, you don't know, uh, today I must beat him half to death, this unfilial wretch! Does he even have me, his mother, in his eyes!" Big Mazi's wife couldn't get rid of her anger for a moment.

Aunt Shubo managed to persuade and drag her to her own door, and placed a stool for her to sit down. "Ah, ah, Big Mazi's wife, everything can only be done roughly these days." Uncle Shubo wiped his beard and stood up from the threshold, saying this.

"I'm not hiding it from you, uncle and aunt. I'm willing to agree to anything else he wants, but I won't agree to this!" Big Mazi's wife gritted her teeth, looking very determined. Aunt Shubo eagerly asked: "What exactly is going on?" Big Mazi's wife snorted and then said a long string of words:

"What's going on! He's going to be a worker for the Japanese soldiers, repairing the motor road! Do you think his heart is good? Big Mazi was shot dead by the Japanese soldiers next to the motor road. For no reason, he died so pitifully, lying in the ditch, his head shattered by the shot, blood flowing into the ditch, brain matter flowing into the ditch. At that time, the Japanese soldiers had just arrived, and no one dared to collect the body during the day. Uncle and aunt, you all know. It was the Jiangbei man from the ancestral hall who secretly dragged him back at night... This unfilial wretch, isn't he blind and can't see? Now he doesn't want to avenge his father, but he wants to be a worker for the Japanese soldiers. Hmph, earn money! I don't care about millions of taels of silver, I'd rather starve to death, but I won't allow him to earn blood money... I want him to see his father... Big Mazi's corpse..." When she said this, her voice trembled so much that she couldn't continue, and she burst into tears.

Uncle Shubo was indignant when he heard this, and knocked his dry tobacco pipe on the stone slab, intending to find Big Mazi's son in the village to teach him a lesson. "We don't allow anyone in our village to be a traitor!" He muttered to himself.

### [A Discussion of a Decisive Battle]

— Yang Mei

Since the start of the War of Resistance, twenty-one months have passed. Although Japan has relied on its own superior military equipment to achieve victories in form, what it has gained are only a few transportation lines and a few cities. The vast land still remains in the hands of the Chinese army, and the battle line is prolonged and scattered, which is deeply taboo for military strategists. If a full-scale counter-offensive is launched, and all areas are intercepted, communication will be cut off, and the head and tail will not be able to take care of each other, inevitably leading to collapse. However, when Japan launched the Lugouqiao Incident, it originally wanted to take some small advantages, but it never expected to receive the most fatal retaliation of "long-term resistance." As the war has progressed to the present, it has become more and more deeply mired in the quagmire, revealing its embarrassing situation. Its own regular army, reserve army, and Korean-Japanese army have all been deployed to the front line to fight, and it still feels that it is not enough to allocate. In the occupied "Kingdom of Righteousness and Paradise," it keeps bumping into Chinese troops, gaining this piece and losing that piece, getting dizzy, and becoming exhausted. It can be seen that the collapse of the Japanese army is not far away. We can get stronger proof by looking at the following telegrams.

According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Lieutenant General Sakuraji, commander of the Japanese army in Central China, declared: "Please China's government send strong troops to the Central Plains for a decisive battle, and no longer run around to the east and west, losing its national dignity," and so on.

Lieutenant General Sakuraji's declaration coincides with the words of Lieutenant General An Teng, commander of the Japanese army in South China, on December 19 last year, "I wish Chairman Chiang would come to Guangdong with his military qualifications for a desperate battle," which are similar and consistent. It can be seen that they have reached the end of their road and are not far from collapse!

The French Shanghai Daily once said that General Joffre of the European War retreated completely after being defeated in Belgium and finally won an unprecedented victory on the Marne River, which is definitely correct and unwavering. These days, the counter-offensive in various parts of Central China has been a great victory, like a bamboo being split. It is the prelude to the transformation of defeat into victory in the second stage of the War of Resistance!

From this, we know that Sakuraji's declaration is nothing more than a lament before the collapse.

### The Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"It's just a small knife wound, what can't be forgiven?"

"A knife wound can be forgiven—" After she spoke to herself? She let go of her emotions and casually asked, "What if it's a gunshot wound?"

"If it's a gunshot wound, you're dead!"

"If you're still alive?"

He smiled coldly, replacing the answer. Then, he deliberately asked her sternly:

"If you had a gun last night?"

"Then you wouldn't die in my house, you'd die on the street!"

At this time, she remembered the scene of last night again, especially his devilish eyes; the hateful night, came again. Hatred regained her heart, and the meager friendship she had gained today was thrown into the fire like snow. She avoided him, softly fell beside the bed, and cried.

When he called her, she bravely stood up, found his cheek, and slapped him hard. She stopped crying, pointed at his eyes, and shouted irritably:

"Get out, you bandit!"

He was at a loss, listening blankly to her curses.

"Enemy, you dog thing, I can't forget you..."

At this time, he was to her like a model mother to a mischievous child; when the child is crying and acting wilfully, she must try her best to obey her, make her happy, and then correct her mistakes. He tried his best to control his often impulsive feelings, and gave her a forced smile, as if he could let her hit him—if she could satisfy her desires. She pushed him away hatefully, not allowing him to come close, fearing that he harbored evil intentions. He became even more bored and had no choice but to step aside and ask:

"What about our friendship just now?"

"What?"

"Friendship, friendship!"
