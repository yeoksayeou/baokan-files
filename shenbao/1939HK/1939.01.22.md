### Economic Retaliation by Britain and America Against Japan

— Bo An

Since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese have been loudly advocating the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," implementing economic monopolies in occupied areas and excluding the interests of third countries. In North China, they have implemented trade controls, and in Central China, they have used the pretext of private arms smuggling and dangerous navigation to refuse third-country ships from navigating the Yangtze River. As a result, Japanese goods now account for more than half of the value of imports in North China. Japanese goods in the Yangtze River basin have also jumped from third to first place. The so-called principle of open door and equal opportunity has been fundamentally broken. Recently, Japan has even openly declared that the old principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are no longer applicable to the new situation, and it intends to unilaterally break the treaty. Under this current situation, Britain and the United States have only to decide whether or not to withdraw from the Far East. Britain's decades of hard work in China have already taken root. Although trade with China has declined in recent years, investment still ranks first. Although the United States has less investment, trade often ranks first. Therefore, Britain and the United States are unwilling to passively abandon their past hard-earned businesses and withdraw from the Chinese market. Recently, due to the ineffectiveness of protests, economic retaliation has been considered.

The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions

Since the failure of the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy during the Italian-Abyssinian War, many people have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of economic sanctions. The Italian-Abyssinian War broke out in early October 1935. In November, the League of Nations held a meeting and decided to impose economic sanctions on Italy. Of the League of Nations' 58 member states, except for Italy, Abyssinia, Austria, Hungary, Albania, Paraguay, and other countries that refused to impose sanctions, 52 countries participated in the sanctions. The sanctions included: (1) Financial disconnection; (2) Trade sanctions, including prohibiting the import of Italian goods and prohibiting the transport of military supplies, mineral products, and metal products to Italy. After the implementation of the League of Nations' sanctions, Italy also used the means of boycotting imports from participating countries as retaliation, and implemented financial, trade, and consumption controls to resist. In addition, Italy is a country with an import surplus, and in recent years, the import surplus has often been more than 20 billion lire. In foreign trade, Germany and the United States are the largest. Imports and exports to Germany both rank first, accounting for 17% of imports and 16% of exports. The United States ranks second. However, both countries are non-member states and have no obligation to fulfill the League of Nations' resolutions. The same is true for Japan and Brazil. Switzerland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and other member states cited their close proximity to Italy and close trade relations as reasons for reserving their positions on the sanctions. The steps taken by various countries were inconsistent, and the methods were not thorough. For example, coal and gasoline were never prohibited from being exported to Italy. Therefore, the League of Nations' sanctions failed to stop Italy's war of aggression. In June 1936, Britain took the lead in advocating the lifting of sanctions against Italy, and other countries followed suit. This marked the end of the era of economic sanctions in modern history.

The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Japan

In military terms, Japan's situation is different from Italy's. The Italian-Abyssinian War lasted only more than half a year, and the effect of economic sanctions was not seen before Abyssinia was lost. Japan has been using troops against China for a year and a half, and both sets of capital have been exhausted (Yosuke Matsuoka said that Japan has three sets of capital: (1) government reserves; (2) idle social capital; (3) private material resources). The end of the war is nowhere in sight. The Hiranuma cabinet intended to strengthen fascist control and conscript private material resources to achieve its goals; however, it is already mired in China, and it will be difficult to support if it encounters external shocks again.

In terms of international trade, the situation in Japan and Italy is also very different. Economic sanctions against Japan were proposed by Britain and the United States, and Japan's trade with Britain and the United States accounts for more than half of its total trade. In 1937, Japanese goods sold to Britain and British territories reached 900 million yen, and goods shipped to the United States also reached 600 million yen, accounting for half of Japan's export trade. In the same year, goods from Britain and British territories shipped to Japan reached 1.2 billion yen, and US goods shipped to Japan also reached 1.27 billion yen, accounting for one-third of Japan's import trade. Japan's trade relations with Britain and the United States are so huge that the serious impact of economic sanctions by Britain and the United States can be imagined.

Looking at the goods traded between the United States and Japan, silk is the largest commodity shipped from Japan to the United States, with an annual value of about 300 million yen, followed by cotton cloth, with an annual value of about 50 million yen, followed by clothing and porcelain, pottery, etc. Cotton is the most goods shipped from the United States to Japan, with an annual value of about 300 million yen, followed by coal, gasoline, and metal products, each with an annual value of about 100 million yen, followed by military equipment and machinery, etc. In terms of trade volume, the United States has a trade surplus and Japan has a trade deficit, giving the United States an advantage. In terms of the nature of the goods, the goods shipped from the United States to Japan are mostly necessities, such as coal, gasoline, metal products, and machinery, which are all essential for Japan's national defense and industry. Even cotton is an indispensable raw material because China's production is not enough to meet Japan's needs. The goods shipped from Japan to the United States are consumer goods. If the United States imposes commercial sanctions on Japan, there will be no adverse effects domestically, while Japan will suffer significant losses. For example, if sales of silk in the United States are cut off, Japan's rural economy will be hit immediately.

British-Japanese trade is similar to US-Japanese trade. Seafood is the largest commodity shipped from Japan to Britain, with an annual value of 30 million yen, followed by raw silk and cotton cloth. Machinery and boats are the largest commodities shipped from Britain to Japan, with an annual value of about 20 million yen, followed by metal products. British goods are necessities, while Japanese goods are consumer goods. Japanese goods are also in a surplus position, so Japan has the greatest advantage in British-Japanese trade. As for the trade between Japan and British territories, it is almost an exchange of manufactured goods and raw materials. For example, Japan imports about 300 million yen of Indian cotton every year, while it ships about 200 million yen of cotton textiles to India every year. Australia ships about 100 million yen of wool and about 20 million yen of wheat to Japan every year, while Japan ships 50 million yen of cotton textiles to Australia every year. If British colonies cut off trade with Japan, Japanese manufactured goods will lack a market, and raw materials will lack a source, suffocating industry.

Recent trade statistics between Japan, Britain, and the United States (unit: million yen)

Why Haven't Britain and the United States Launched Economic Sanctions Yet?

Since Japan is poor in resources and relies on foreign trade, economic pressure from Britain and the United States would be a fatal blow to Japan. Why haven't Britain and the United States taken active action? The political reasons are beyond the scope of my discussion. The commercial reasons are the obstruction of some businessmen. For example, Indian cotton, metal traders, Australian wool and wheat merchants, and US cotton, machinery, coal, and oil merchants all oppose sanctions against Japan due to their own interests. The British and American governments are also worried about mutual retaliation, which could lead to serious disputes. President Biffman said that economic sanctions could bring aggressors to justice, while Bola said that economic sanctions could lead to war. Whether economic sanctions can lead to war does not have a definite conclusion in theory. It depends on the actual situation. The key question is whether Japan can resist Britain and the United States economically and militarily. I believe that if Britain and the United States take a united front and are determined to curb Japanese aggression, the Japanese warlords may not take the risk immediately. However, the fear of war in Britain and the United States is enough to increase the arrogance of aggressor countries and use their intimidation tactics. In September last year, when the League of Nations asked its member states to provide individual economic assistance to China and impose sanctions on Japan, the Japanese government spokesman threatened that if the powers changed their neutrality, Japan would consider its attitude towards foreign concessions in China. Britain and the United States have the largest interests in China, mostly in Shanghai. According to Lamer's statistics, British investment in China is 119 million gold, of which Shanghai accounts for three-quarters. US investment in China is 100 million US dollars, of which Shanghai accounts for 64%. In addition, according to the "International Investment Problems" published by the British "Royal Institute of International Affairs" in 1937, US investment in Japan totaled 440 million US dollars by the end of 1933, mostly government bonds, about twice as much as investment in China. British investment in Japan was estimated at 63 million pounds in 1930, which is only a quarter of the 110 million US dollars invested in China. However, according to Kindley's estimate published in the Economic News in December 1937, British investment in Japan at the end of 1936 was 53 million pounds (mostly government bonds). Investment in China was 41 million pounds. This means that British investment in Japan is greater than investment in China, which contradicts Lamer's estimate. The exact situation remains to be verified. In short, both investments in Japan and China are under Japanese control. Perhaps Britain and the United States have a fear of harming the cause when implementing severe economic sanctions against Japan?

Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Retaliation by Britain and the United States

The difficulties encountered by Britain in retaliating against Japan in commerce are temporary. From the perspective of the entire British economy, it may even be considered beneficial. For example, the British textile industry has always felt the pain of Japanese competition. After sanctions against Japan, although Indian cotton and Australian wool exports to Japan will decrease, the British cotton and wool textile industry will prosper, and the cotton and wool raw materials can be digested by the British mainland. The same is true for US cotton. Before the war, Japan only imported 1 million bales of cotton from abroad, while Britain imported 4 million bales. Later, due to the prosperity of the Japanese textile industry and the decline of Britain, Japan's imports of foreign cotton increased to 3.6 million bales in 1935, while Britain's imports decreased to just over 2 million bales. The world's cotton trade volume has always been around 12 million bales (each bale weighs 500 pounds gross and 478 pounds net) for decades, without major fluctuations. Therefore, US cotton sales can still return to Britain. Other US goods, such as coal, oil, and machinery, do not rely on Japan as a customer. As for the concern about Japan's so-called retaliation, the actions of Japan when Britain and the United States provided loans to China show that this is unlikely to happen.

### A Study of Resistance Tactics Against [Enemy]

— Chiang Kai-shek

On the Important Tasks of Improving Troops (3)

Second, all troops must pay attention to mobility and teamwork. Regardless of what kind of tactics we use, mobility and teamwork are indispensable to achieving combat results. The current combat organization of each troop is known to everyone to have mobility, but it has never been achieved. Once there is action, it cannot be achieved quickly and nimbly! In the future, the mobility of the troops must be cultivated, the command deployment must be appropriate and suitable; the marching ability must be improved as much as possible; attention must be paid to nighttime actions and the use of transportation tools. These are all important conditions for increasing mobility. Only with great mobility can troops cope with modern three-dimensional warfare, exert combat power, seize opportunities, and defeat the [enemy]. As for teamwork, it is especially important in relation to the victory or defeat of war. As I said just now, the [enemy] is accustomed to using the tactic of defeating us individually to make our troops lose contact. We must cultivate the habit and ability of officers and soldiers to cooperate in action. In particular, we must use the front to attack and defend, and use the main reserve to carry out flank attacks. All officers and soldiers must have the spirit and ability to cooperate in action in order to achieve offensive and defensive results. Also, the [enemy] attacks our army, specializing in attacking our weak forces or gaps in the position to break in. Therefore, we must deploy reserves and establish firm contact in the adjacent areas of each unit. If the [enemy] attacks one point of our position, the surrounding neighboring units must cooperate in action, assist friendly forces, and annihilate the [enemy]. We must know that in the face of a great enemy, the life and death, success and failure of our entire national army are integrated. There is no possibility of a friendly army being defeated and we still being able to exist—there is no room for preserving strength at this time. If we want to preserve our strength, we will inevitably follow in the footsteps of the puppet Manchukuo army, falling into a miserable situation where we cannot live or die, and being forced by the [enemy] army to take machine guns to the battlefield to kill our compatriots. Our revolutionary soldiers must be able to distinguish clearly between right and wrong and see the advantages and disadvantages clearly. Today, we can only share life and death and share weal and woe. To kill the [enemy] and save the country and fight in coordination, we must fundamentally eliminate the past military mentality of talking about factions, distinguishing between each other, watching friendly forces sacrifice, and preserving one's own strength—the entire national army must be united as one and act in concert to complete the task of resisting the [enemy] and saving the country—

Third, we must strive for initiative. The key to initiative is that we must set a plan and implement it step by step, forcing the [enemy] to act according to our plan. To put it plainly, it is to "attack what they must save and take what they must fight for," so that they have no time to defend themselves and are everywhere in a passive position. When the [enemy] is passive, we can exert our combat power to defeat them. Now that the [enemy] has penetrated deep into our interior, the front line is extended, and the war zone is expanded. This is a good opportunity for us to vigorously carry out active offensive warfare. In the future, whether we are attacking or defending, we must act proactively. To be proactive, our chiefs of staff must have keen eyes and resolute courage when planning and deciding—based on detailed enemy intelligence, determine all strategies. The flanking tactics to break the [enemy]'s "cone-shaped突擊" that I mentioned above is the only secret to taking the initiative to attack and defend—once we have set this tactic, everyone must adapt to the actual situation of the [enemy] in each battlefield and implement it accurately. Only by controlling the [enemy] in everything and maintaining the initiative at all times can we achieve tactical and strategic success!

The above is about the tactics of breaking the [enemy]'s "cone-shaped 突擊" habit and the necessary conditions for using tactics. Now I will talk about several important tasks that the combat troops should improve in the future:

First, we must treat prisoners of war well and reward the capture and preservation of spoils of war. This operation has been going on for more than half a year, and very few prisoners of war and spoils of war have been sent up by the front-line troops. This shows that our combat troops lack knowledge or the level is insufficient, and they do not know that with prisoners of war, we can interrogate the [enemy]'s situation, and treating prisoners of war well is the morality that soldiers should have during wartime and an important method of disintegrating the [enemy] army. Various spoils of war are the most valuable materials for studying the [enemy]'s situation. Now the officers and soldiers at the front kill prisoners of war at will, and many [enemy] equipment documents!—operational orders and plans are casually lost or discarded. There are materials for research, but they do not know to submit them. Valuable spoils of war are obtained, but they do not know how to research and preserve them. These are all the results of our imperfect peacetime troop education! The [enemy] is not like this. They turn in everything, even a shoe, a hat, a piece of paper, a single word, and use it as a reference for research. Important things are studied, organized, registered, and labeled with the name of the item, unit number, officer and soldier's name, time and place of acquisition, and stored in the historical exhibition hall as educational materials for aggression—we now need to study the [enemy]'s situation, lack materials, and leave valuable memories for the sacred war of resistance to comfort the heroic spirits who died for the country and show future generations the historical lessons—and the spoils of war from the front have not been submitted piece by piece. This is a matter that urgently needs to be improved. In the future, everyone must especially warn their subordinates that, first, it is forbidden to kill prisoners of war and they must be ordered to send them up; second, no matter how big or small the things captured from the [enemy], whether it is a gun, a knife, a piece of clothing, a hat, a piece of paper, or a line of words, they must be submitted to the command and sent to the military committee for research and preservation. Our senior commanders and chiefs of staff must teach their subordinates in every way and must implement rewards in accordance with the war reward methods promulgated last time so that they know that capturing prisoners of war and spoils of war is extremely meritorious and honorable. It is also the most rare opportunity for our officers and men to leave a heroic name in the history of the war of resistance. Every officer and soldier must have this knowledge, and everyone must take pride in treating prisoners of war well and sending in spoils of war. If our education can produce this extremely effective result, we can invisibly increase the combat power of the troops a lot!

Second, orders must be implemented, and the supervision of the implementation of orders must be strict. Everyone must know that the orders of the army are the orders on which the life and death of the entire army depend. Whether the order can be executed and whether the execution can be implemented is related to the safety and survival of the entire army—therefore, any order, no matter who it is given to, must be taken seriously and implemented thoroughly, and there must be no slight ease, negligence, or disloyalty in the execution. Everyone must also know that the superior's order is a path that shows our lives. We obey the order,

### Battles on All Fronts Intensify; We Fight Steadily and Seize the Initiative; [Enemy] Forces Suffer Setbacks Everywhere They Invade

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Our military forces on all fronts continue to fight steadily to adapt to the long-term war of resistance. Therefore, the [enemy]'s advance is difficult, and we can take the initiative and operate freely. We continue to do our best to maintain the traffic in the areas entirely controlled by our forces. For example, trains from Guilin can go directly to Jinhua. As for the railways in the areas occupied by the [enemy], we use guerrilla forces to destroy them at any time. Although the [enemy] has been constantly attacking us in Guangdong, Shanxi, Hubei, and eastern Henan recently, they have made little progress. Our situation in central Hubei is stable. Fierce local battles continue on all fronts in Guangdong. It is certain that a certain elite unit of ours has cut off the communication between Conghua, Zengcheng, and Dongguan, and the battle situation will develop within days.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] According to information, Chinese and Japanese troops engaged in fierce battles near the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province, from Quanzhoudian through Hua County to the Zhongshen area. On the South China front, the Japanese army attempted to cross the river near Sanshui and advance northward along the Yuehan Railway in separate columns, but they were blocked. Also, the Japanese army concentrated their forces near the northern coast and shelled the onshore forts, but the Japanese army was unable to land. It is also reported that when the Japanese army retreated from Sanshui, they were about to launch a major offensive in central China. The Japanese army is also attempting to advance along Hankou to Yichang, and fierce shelling has been reported.

The Situation in Guangdong is Tense

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 20th] The war in Guangdong has been showing a state of alternating weakness and tension. In recent days, they have suddenly launched fierce attacks on our positions everywhere. According to the situation on various telephone lines at the front, (1) five or six hundred [enemy] soldiers attacked a certain regiment's certain battalion's position at Daguan in Zengcheng the day before yesterday. Fierce fighting lasted all day, and the [enemy] suffered casualties amounting to a quarter of their force. The stalemate continued until last night, when the [enemy] fled back to Zengcheng. We suffered dozens of officer and soldier casualties. (2) The night before last, a certain [enemy] regiment launched an attack on a certain battalion of ours near Longgang Market. After fighting until the hour of Jia, we retreated to the vicinity of Huaxian to defend due to excessive losses. (3) More than four hundred soldiers of the Kōhashi unit launched a sneak attack on a certain regiment of a certain division of ours. A battle occurred in the vicinity of Gao and Dian. Last night, the [enemy] sent reinforcements of six or seven hundred men to attack us, and our army responded calmly. The battle situation is quite fierce.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 21st] The [enemy]'s 119th Division has arrived in the Yongxiu area from Taiwan. Currently, there are six [enemy] divisions in northern Jiangxi. In addition, there are 20,000 [enemy] soldiers who arrived in Tianjin a few days ago and then went to western Sui.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 21st] The [enemy] forces that successively departed from Sanshui to Henggang and Langgang were attacked along the way by our self-defense teams and retreated to Sanshui on the 17th. The [enemy] forces in Tanbu also withdrew to Wupin Market on the 19th.

[Central News Agency, Haikou, 21st] A total of eleven [enemy] ships, including one aircraft carrier, continued to arrive at Weizhou Island on the morning of the 17th, but there were no movements.

[Enemy] Troops in Southern Hebei Stir

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 20th] Military information indicates that the [enemy] in Hebei is attempting to invade southern Hebei again to eliminate our anti-Japanese armed forces. Currently, more than a thousand [enemy] soldiers have arrived in Jin County and are attacking Donglu, Huai, and Lingping. The [enemy] in Qijiawan is attacking Julu and is fighting with a certain unit of ours on the riverbank. There are more than a thousand [enemy] soldiers in Heping Township, and two thousand [enemy] soldiers have been added to Yongnian. Three hundred [enemy] soldiers have arrived in Feixiang, and more than a thousand [enemy] soldiers have arrived in Guangping, attempting to encircle us. The [enemy] in Quzhou and Dezhou are showing signs of advancing towards Wucheng and Zhengjiakou. Our Second Guerrilla Team and the People's White Team have been properly deployed.

[Central News Agency, Hequ, 18th] The puppet army under the command of Yu Ni Zhi, which attacked our position from Guyang a few days ago, has been defeated and fled back to the city. A certain unit of ours has now advanced to the area between Guyang and Anbei to carry out guerrilla warfare against the [enemy].

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] News reports that the traffic on the railways in North China is constantly being sabotaged by our army, completely breaking the [enemy]'s propaganda that "there are no guerrilla teams within 30 li of the railway line." A section of the temporary track newly built at the Zhangzhuang broken section of the Pingjin Line has been opened to traffic. A [enemy] troop train on the Jinpu Railway was overturned on the 19th, and it only ran from Tianjin to Cangxian.

### Foreign War Correspondents Assert That China Will Win

[Local News] Recently, a famous American war correspondent observed the Chinese and Japanese sides on various battlefields in China and has now returned home via Hong Kong. He pointed out more than ten advantages of our army, proving that our army will win the final victory in the war of resistance. At the same time, he pointed out several weaknesses of the Japanese army, proving that the Japanese army will suffer a crushing defeat in China. (1) The more Chinese troops die, the more they fight, and the braver they become. (2) The fewer Japanese troops die, the less they fight, and the more discouraged they become. (3) The Japanese mechanized units completely lose their power after entering mountain warfare. (4) China has a large reserve of new-style firearms, which is sufficient for long-term war of resistance, and the small-scale ordnance factories in the Chinese rear can manufacture rifles and bullets themselves, which is sufficient for the needs of the army. (5) China's international routes in the north, south, and southwest are open, and the latest-style airplanes, artillery, and tanks are being transported to the Chinese rear, and the Japanese army's airplanes, ships, and vehicles cannot stop their transportation. (6) The Japanese army's rear forces are weak, making it extremely difficult to cope with Chinese guerrilla attacks. After a considerable period of time, the Japanese rear will become China's front. (7) The Japanese military expenditure is five times that of China, so they will not be able to support a long war. (8) China has rich resources in the southwest and north, and the economic power of the war of resistance is endless. (9) The Japanese army's forces have now become exhausted, and the time of their defeat is not far away. If China can continue the war of resistance, it will win the final victory.

### Active Guerrilla Teams Near Xuzhou

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] External news from northern [location]: (1) A spokesman for the Japanese [Army] said that 2,000 Chinese troops attacked the Japanese army in Lincheng on the Pinghan Railway on the afternoon of the 18th. (2) On the 17th of this month, the Japanese army clashed with 700 Chinese troops in Pei County, northern Jiangsu, which shows that the Chinese guerrilla teams near Xuzhou are active again. Chinese and Japanese troops have also repeatedly engaged in fierce battles in the southeast and northeast of Baoding.

### [Enemy] Planes Attack Liling

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 20th] At 1:00 PM on the 20th, two batches of [enemy] planes, six in each batch, invaded the airspace of Liling, circling and spying for half an hour. One batch dropped more than a dozen bombs in the vicinity, destroying more than a dozen houses and killing four residents and injuring three. At the same time, another batch invaded Banshanpu, 30 li from the city, dropped more than a dozen bombs, destroying more than a dozen houses and killing or injuring seven or eight residents.

### Ten Million Refugees in the Three Provinces of Shanxi, Shandong, and Hebei

[Reuters, London, 20th] Dr. Williamson, chairman of the Shandong Relief Committee of China, told the Japanese National Church of England that at least ten million people in the three provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, and Hebei have no clothes or food. He recently returned from an inspection in North China and said that there are twenty church hospitals in the three provinces caring for hundreds of thousands of patients who have nothing to live on.

### No Troops Allowed to Be Stationed in Chongqing Urban Area

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] The authorities ordered that military and police agencies in Chongqing are not allowed to station troops in the urban area. Those responsible for tasks in the urban area should provide assistance to air raid rescue at any time.

### Japanese Merchant Ships Break Into the Yangtze River

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 20th] While the [enemy] is rejecting the British and American requests to open the Yangtze River, [enemy] merchant ships are flocking upstream. Warships and sailboats have been discovered on the surface of the Poyang Lake near Hukou, and the number is endless. The ships are full of [enemy] goods, and all the ships are flying flags with the words Tongqu.

### Sino-Japanese-French Understanding Still Not Reached

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 21st] A foreign dispatch from Hankou states that the Japanese and French sides had originally agreed that starting from the 20th, the Japanese would supply tap water to the French Concession and the barriers of the French Concession would be completely open. However, neither of these events materialized yesterday. The reason is unknown, and neither the Japanese nor the French have provided any explanation. Japanese troops are strictly inspecting pedestrians entering and leaving outside the barriers along the riverbank.

[Cha**, Central News Agency, 21st] A foreign dispatch from Hankou states that the Japanese authorities have suddenly banned the transport of food to the Hankou refugee area. Even if the food trucks have passes issued by the Japanese, they are not allowed to pass. The Japanese have now announced that anyone who has received a residence permit issued by the Japanese should immediately leave the refugee area and return to their homes, otherwise they will be severely punished.

### ×Intimidating Annam, Nakamura Also Makes Absurd Remarks, US Expresses Doubt About Arita's Statement

[Hankou, Associated Press, 21st] Nakamura, Chairman of the Japan Oriental Culture Association, recently returned from the United States and told this agency's reporter that the so-called New Order in East Asia includes Annam and * countries, because the people of * countries do not enjoy the treatment they deserve today. He said, "Frankly speaking, the purpose of our building a New Order in East Asia is to make other countries deal with China through Japan."

[Washington, Associated Press, 21st] American figures welcome Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's renewed statement that Japan has no intention of closing the Open Door in China. However, because many private individuals and merchants in China have been discriminated against by the Japanese, and foreign businesses in the Three Eastern Provinces have been completely shut down by the puppet government's suppression, officials here fear that commercial activities in China will also receive similar treatment in the future. Therefore, they frankly express extreme skepticism about Arita's statement. Furthermore, Arita's threat to Annam to stop transporting military supplies to China, otherwise necessary measures will be taken to deal with it, is still considered by officials here to be trapped in the old ways of power politics, a tactic often used by spokespersons for Japan, Germany, and Italy in recent years. Therefore, some of the best-informed diplomats believe that the US's fortification of Guam is a means of resisting this kind of power politics.

### The National参政会 (People's Political Council) is About to Convene, the Secretariat Issues Notices, Ye Chucang Will Serve as Minister of Propaganda

[This, Chongqing, 20th Special] (Delayed Arrival) The Speaker of the National People's Political Council was originally intended to be Dai Chuanxian or Ye Chuqiang. Later, in order to strengthen its power, Chiang Kai-shek was recommended to serve concurrently. Recently, the People's Political Council will convene, and Ye will serve as Minister of Propaganda.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 21st] The National People's Political Council will convene its third session soon after adjourning from its second session in November last year. According to information, the Secretariat of the People's Political Council has issued notices at the instruction of Speaker Chiang, asking each council member to arrive in * before February 10th to prepare for attendance. As for the date of the meeting, it will be determined on a temporary basis.

### Gu Weijun To Be Appointed Foreign Minister?

[Paris, Reuters, 20th] Tokyo reports that Dr. Gu Weijun has been appointed Foreign Minister by Chiang Kai-shek. The ambassador of * here has not heard of this. Dr. Gu is scheduled to return here next week.

### Ministry of Finance Plans to Levy a Wartime Consumption Tax, Yunnan Province Allocates Cultivated Land Tax for Construction Funds, Sichuan Province to Issue Construction Bonds

[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 21st Special] The Ministry of Finance plans to levy a wartime consumption tax, and the regulations are currently being reviewed by the Executive Yuan.

[Kunming, This Newspaper, 21st Special] Starting this year, the Yunnan Provincial Government will allocate the cultivated land tax from various localities as construction funds for each county in order to complete the great undertaking of resisting Japan and building the nation.

[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 21st Special] He Bei*, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, has come to Chongqing to negotiate with the food, tung oil, and pharmaceutical companies, which have all been settled and will soon be established.

[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 21st Special] The Sichuan Construction Bonds are planned to be issued first for five to ten million yuan.

### Japanese Parliament Opened Yesterday, Hiranuma and Arita Delivered Speeches, Budget Bill Is Main Agenda Item

[Tokyo, Reuters, 21st] The House of Peers reopened this morning at 10:00 AM after the New Year recess. Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita both delivered speeches. The two explained the current situation and plans, and stated the future policies of the Japanese government. They also hoped that the Chinese would cooperate with Japan and Taiwan without harboring any fear; otherwise, establishing a New Order in East Asia would be impossible. Hiranuma said in a 3,500-word speech that for the Chinese who do not understand this intention and still resist Japan, we have no other path to follow but to eliminate them, and so on. Contrary to expectations, Arita did not directly mention the recent notes from Britain, France, and the United States. Subsequently, the Ministers of the Army and Navy will provide reports on the war situation in China. The House of Representatives will meet at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and the members will also listen to speeches by the respective ministers.

Arita's Speech Attacks the World Situation, Revealing Aggressive Ambitions

[Tokyo, Associated Press, 21st] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita addressed the Parliament, asking Britain, the United States, and other major powers to jointly enjoy the prosperity of East Asia, but only on the condition of recognizing Japan's major position in East Asia. Arita also warned France and the Soviet Union, advising them not to aid China against Japan, otherwise retaliatory action would be taken. The main points of the speech are roughly as follows: (1) Japan must maintain its announced determination to build a New Order in East Asia through the cooperation of Japan, China, and "Manchukuo," so that the whole world will benefit in the future. (2) Japan intends to impose considerable restrictions on China and "Manchukuo," but this restriction is related to national defense and will be limited to the minimum extent. (3) Japan intends to link the East Asian economy with the world economy in order to increase the material prosperity of mankind. (4) If Chinese military supplies are still transported through Annam, then "appropriate steps" will be taken to deal with it. (5) Japan hopes that the new central government of China (?) will soon be organized and cooperate with "us to resolve the Sino-Japanese War." (6) Japan will continue to attack the Third International, because Japan believes that the purpose of the Third International is to make China and the whole world red. (7) Although the Zhanggufeng Incident has been resolved, Soviet-Japanese relations will continue to be tense, especially since the Russians in Northern Sakhalin are now interfering with Japan's oil, coal, and fishing rights.

[Tokyo, Reuters, 20th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita stated at the opening of the Japanese Diet that trade between Britain and the United States and "Manchukuo" is even better now than before "Manchukuo" was established. Under Japan's plan to create a "New Order in East Asia," China and "Manchukuo" will maintain their independence and actively cooperate. Japan believes that this can achieve true peace and world happiness. He repeatedly stated that Japan does not demand "China" to cede land or pay indemnities, and will fully respect "China's" sovereignty and consider abolishing extraterritoriality and concessions. Although Japan has repeatedly stated its position, there are still various misunderstandings from the outside world that Japan wants to close China's open door. In fact, some important areas have been restricted, but other areas are still wide open. Not only are the rights and interests of foreigners and their people not affected, but foreign participation is also welcome. He discussed the "China Incident," saying that Japan is working hard on construction and fiercely attacking the Third International, stating that the disruption of peace and order in Europe and Asia is due to the Third International's planning. The prolongation of the Chinese war and the guerrilla warfare strategy are all from the Third International, and asked that the main reason for the world's unrest today is due to striving to maintain the status quo, but maintaining it is not in accordance with justice, but in relying on selfishness to prevent the progress of emerging countries.

Party Politics Show Division at the Opening of Parliament

[Tokyo, 20th] On the eve of the opening of the new parliament, there are signs of a split in the Seiyukai, one of Japan's two major political parties. Fifty members of the party held a separate meeting today to express their distrust of the party's executives. In addition, various political parties also held general meetings today to determine their attitude towards the opening of the new parliament. For example, the Minseito, which ranks first, passed a declaration stating that the fate of Japan and the peace of East Asia depend on the outcome of this Sino-Japanese war. All the people should firmly unite and overcome all difficulties in order to achieve this goal. The declaration also urged the government to establish a "unified new government of China" and seek cooperation between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." The Seiyukai's declaration stated: "The Chiang regime" has retreated to the interior but is still continuing to resist Japan, and third countries are gradually indicating their intention to assist Chiang. It will take time for Japan to achieve its goals, so it should mobilize its spiritual, cultural, economic, political, and military forces to fulfill its mission.

Cabinet Meeting Decides on Measures for Parliament, Reviews General Budget

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 20th] Tokyo News: The Japanese Cabinet meeting was held at 10:30 AM on the 20th. First, the general budget for the 14th year of Showa (1939) and the special accounting budget bills to be submitted to the parliament were reviewed. Finance Minister Ishiwata explained the budget, and then it was decided. Next, opinions were exchanged on measures for the parliament. The meeting adjourned at 12:35 PM.

[Central News Agency, ***, 21st] Tokyo News: Japan's military budget for 1939-1940 is estimated to be 549 million yen, of which 49 million will be paid from the ordinary budget, and the other 50 million will be allocated from the special budget. The ordinary budget can be submitted to parliament for discussion today, and opinions on the special budget will be exchanged on February 30th. This special budget is entirely for the cost of the war against China and the stationing of troops in "Manchukuo."

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Former Japanese Home Minister Suehiro Nobusada, former Finance Minister Yuki Toyotaro, and Seiyukai leader Shimada Toshio have all been appointed as advisors to the Hiranuma Cabinet.

### The Newspaper Industry in Yunnan

[Kunming Special Correspondent] Yunnan is located in a remote border region, and the newspaper industry has not been very developed due to transportation, culture, and other factors. The earliest published newspapers appeared during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. However, at that time, the public was uninformed and lacked knowledge of newspapers, not like today when people have a paper in hand and regard it as spiritual food. Furthermore, reporters were looked down upon, just like in Shanghai in the past. Therefore, although Yunnan's newspapers have more than 20 years of history, it is not easy to see their role in promoting social reform and customs. The current situation of various newspapers in Yunnan is introduced as follows:

(1) "Minguo Daily," run by the provincial party headquarters, with Wang Songlu as the president and Yan Zhuhe as the editor. The office is located on Huashan South Road, with a circulation of over 2,600. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, there are editorials written by the Central Propaganda Institute, instructing people on their understanding of the war effort, and there is a supplement called "Daguan." It was previously suspended due to the reduction of pages due to the war. Recently, starting from New Year's Day this year, given that its fellow newspaper "Yishi Daily" has special supplements such as "Nian Yuan Di" and "Zhaobao" also has a supplement, it has been gradually publishing essays and novels to restore its old appearance, with a circulation of about 7,000 to 8,000 copies.

(2) "Yunnan Daily," the official newspaper of the provincial government, with Chen Ke as the president and Zhang Kecheng as the editor. The office is located on Wenmiao Heng Street, facing the Provincial Kunhua People's Education Museum. Its circulation covers all prefectures, counties, and towns in Yunnan Province, reaching about 13,000 copies, making it the most widely circulated newspaper in Yunnan. Local news is quite detailed, and it has been published to over 1,050 issues. In addition to expanding the office and recruiting staff, starting from December 12th last year, it has also restored the "Nanfeng" supplement, which was changed to a weekly due to the war. Each issue can only publish "4,000 words," containing novels, essays, poems, notes, etc., with a similar nature to the "Daguan" supplement of "Minguo Daily." This may be due to the lack of flexibility of hard news, and is intended to compensate for it. The newspaper's weekly reviews are written by specially invited famous domestic writers, with a fee of at least 10 yuan in national currency per article.

In addition to "Minguo Daily" and "Yunnan Daily," there are also "New Commercial Daily" (President Wang Hansheng, Editor Hu Zheng), "Social New Daily" (President Long Zimin, Editor Tu Xiu*), "Fearless Daily" (President * Renfu, Editor Ma Zhongling), "Righteous Voice Daily" (President Zi Jucai, Editor Li Xiaochun), and "Jun Daily" (President Duan Quanchang, Editor Zhao Yusheng). However, compared to the progressive and widely circulated newspapers, only "Yunnan Daily" and "Minguo Daily" were available before the Double Tenth Festival last year.

"Nanjing Zhaobao" was forced to withdraw in the winter of the previous year with the fall of the capital. Manager Wang Gonghong came to guide the preparations for a long time, and it resumed publication here on the Double Tenth Festival of the 27th year (1938). It is a small sheet every day, with the same format as it was in Nanjing. The first page has domestic telegrams, the second page has international news, the third page has local news, and the fourth page has a supplement, with a circulation of about 7,000 to 8,000. When it was first published, one could hear newspaper vendors selling it on the streets early in the morning at around 7:00 AM. The general public mostly read it because it was published very early. In comparison, "Yunnan Daily" and "Minguo Daily," which were published later, had to compete with each other by issuing their newspapers earlier. In addition, the influence of the * undoubtedly made it much more convenient for those who loved to read newspapers.

Following "Zhaobao," there is "Tianjin Yishi Daily," which was forced to suspend publication in August of the 26th year (1937) due to the pressure of the anti-Japanese war. It is the propaganda organ of the Chinese Catholic Church. Under the leadership of Bishop Yu Bin, it first launched "Yishi Weekly" here last year on the Double Tenth Festival, and then resumed the daily newspaper on December 8th. Every day, in addition to occasional communications from various places, there are also weekly supplements on religion and culture, border areas, history, education, reading, women, youth garden, and book reviews. This is unique to the newspapers in Kunming and is a characteristic of the newspaper, which is quite popular among young students. However, the newspaper has very little local news, which seems to have been overlooked, and is a bit of a shortcoming.

The prices of Kunming "Yunnan Daily" and "Minguo Daily" when the reporter first arrived - in July of the 27th year (1938), were only 6 jiao (cents) per month in national currency for subscription, and 2 fen (cents) per copy for single sales. Later, it rose to 7 jiao. Due to the rising exchange rates and increased paper prices, "Minguo Daily," "Yunnan Daily," and "Zhaobao" jointly announced that from December 1st of the 27th year (1938), the prices would be raised uniformly. The subscription prices for "Minguo Daily," "Yishi Daily," and "Yunnan Daily" were 1 yuan per month, 5 yuan and 5 jiao for half a year, and 10 yuan and 5 jiao for the whole year, with retail prices of 4 fen per copy. However, "Zhaobao" alone, due to its smaller size, had a slightly more reasonable price, with 7 jiao and 5 fen per month, 3 yuan and 8 jiao for half a year, and 7 yuan and 5 jiao for the whole year, with a retail price of 2 fen and a half per copy. Postage is charged separately.

As for news agencies, there is only one local news agency, the "Yunnan News Agency," run by the provincial party headquarters, with its office inside the provincial party headquarters on Huashan South Road, with Chen Tingbi as the president and Gan Rutang as the editor. In addition to being used by local newspapers, many newspapers in other provinces also subscribe to its manuscripts. The agency has recently recruited stenographers and reporters, and is planning to improve and expand its operations. As I write this, I suddenly saw an advertisement for the establishment of a Kunming branch of the Central News Agency. The veteran reporters in the guerrilla area will have many opportunities to come to Yunnan and discuss with the reporters of the Yunnan News Agency. There is nothing to worry about. (Xiao Wenhu)

### Guo Moruo's Speech on Wartime Cultural Work at a Forum for Cultural Figures in Chongqing

[Chongqing Correspondence] The meeting room for the cultural forum was crowded with forty or fifty people, happily coming to listen to Mr. Guo Moruo's speech.

Zhang Shenfu, the chairman, first briefly introduced Mr. Guo's past efforts in the cultural field. Mr. Guo approached the podium with a smiling face.

After a few polite words, the main topic began. Mr. Guo said:

"Culture is progressive and develops forward with the evolution of mankind. Especially when it is combined with the war for freedom and peace, its progress is even more rapid. We all know that our current war of resistance is for the justice of mankind and can also be said to be for defending the progress of culture. Therefore, our culture has made rapid progress since the War of Resistance. On the * side, there is undoubtedly regression, because not only can he destroy our country's cultural construction, but his own domestic culture has also been regressing since the "September 18th Incident." Their thoughts are not free, their speech is not free, and it can be said that the entire culture is under white terror. In the past, they flaunted their "university freedom," but now "university freedom" has become a historical term. Since last July, nearly 10,000 writers have been forced to be slaves under the iron hooves of warlords.

Speaking of this, Mr. Guo sighed deeply, resenting the demons in the world who hindered human culture. However, after a pause, he changed to a pleasant tone.

Before the War of Resistance, our culture seemed to have not yet broken away from that "translation" state, that is, culture had no connection with general practical requirements. People returning from abroad, because what they learned was not what the general public needed, felt the pain of not using what they had learned, and cultural workers became increasingly alienated from practical requirements. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, this alienation has gradually disappeared. Due to practical requirements, many undertakings that should have been held many years ago were completed without people realizing it. For example, the opening of the Xiang-Gui Railway is a good example.

This good phenomenon excited everyone in the room. Then he talked about the question of "what should wartime cultural workers do?" He solemnly and slowly said:

"Because our War of Resistance is a war to defend culture, our wartime culture should be: domestically, how to enhance the people's strength to resist Japan? How to make the soldiers have a sense of common hatred? On the * side, how to disintegrate the * army? Internationally, how to win more support?"

"In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we have achieved considerable success in these three aspects," Mr. Guo listed such as the unity of the whole people, the bravery of the soldiers, the *'s anti-war, and the increasingly good international attitude towards us. All of these are the power of cultural workers.

"However," Mr. Guo continued, "in the first phase of the War of Resistance, our culture only moved from this city to that city. When the war on the Northeast battlefield was most intense, everyone put forward the slogan "cultural people move inward." Some people did it due to subjective efforts, and some people did it due to objective pressure. The inward movement of cultural people has made a great contribution to the development of wartime culture. However, up to the present stage, the cultural people are only still moving to the cities, and have not yet moved to the vast countryside. In the past, cultural people were mostly ambitious and unwilling to approach the common people with low cultural levels. Now, cultural people have lowered their heads held high, but what they do has not yet been truly popular."

He said very angrily that there are still many people who believe that once all works are "popularized," our culture will go bankrupt. He believes that this is nonsense, because it is useless to only close yourself in a room and shout "improve culture" without first improving the cultural level of the general public. Therefore, he advocated that "in the second phase of the War of Resistance, cultural people should move to the countryside, and their works should be absolutely "popularized." Then he cited the works of the painters in the Third Department of the Political Department, which did not attract the attention of the general public, and the newly produced anti-Japanese films, which also failed to make the common people understand. Although movies and paintings are good propaganda tools, "in the future, all works should be simple and clear, because the largest number of ignorant and ignorant old people are precisely our main force in the war, and the strong men who defend the motherland are also being conscripted among them."

"In addition to this, cultural people have another most important trend, that is, "cultural people should move to the * rear."

"The main strategy in the second phase is to open up a vast guerrilla area in the * rear."

He used the example of Wutai Mountain to prove the strength of guerrilla warfare in the * rear. He said that if we can establish ten guerrilla areas in the * rear like the two buildings in Wutai Mountain, the * will simply have no way to deal with it. According to Mr. Peng Dehuai's report, in Wutai Mountain, not only were three * divisions tied down, but three * divisions were simply annihilated." Such success, "he said loudly, "Is it possible to fight with force alone? No, in addition to force, the main thing is to mobilize the people and organize the people, and the responsibility of doing this work lies with the cultural people. Our cultural people, in order to actually help the war of resistance at present, should move to the * rear in large quantities and quickly establish a strong guerrilla zone."

He took a sip of tea, thought for a moment, and then said, "Our entire strategy is "protracted war," and "protracted war" depends on enriching the rear to maintain it. But how to enrich it? Then we need a large number of staff from the various production departments, so cultural people at this time also have the important task of encouraging young people to learn specialized skills."

He hated the fact that many selfish professors, in order to satisfy their own material needs or fear air raids, hid in safe areas. He believed that these people were only a piece of paper away from the traitors in Beiping. Therefore, he finally shouted loudly, "If we want to save the country, we must first learn the ability to save the country ourselves. Not only must we learn ourselves, but we must also teach young people the ability to save the country."

### All Nations Will Consult on Effective Aid to China in Accordance with League of Nations Resolution, British Government Decides to Allocate £3 Million to Consolidate and Stabilize Our Currency and Foreign Exchange

[Geneva, Central News Agency, 21st] Before leaving here to return to France, Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun told a Reuters reporter that the Executive Yuan's resolution stated, "We hereby invite all member states, especially those with direct relations with the Far East, and other countries with direct relations with the Far East, to consult and consider the suggestions made by Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun to the Executive Yuan on the 17th of this month, in order to take effective measures to assist China." I am deeply impressed by what I have seen here. The consultation mentioned in the resolution can be started in the near future. The remarks made by British representative Butter on the Executive Yuan are enough to indicate that the British government is prepared to provide financial assistance to China, which is very gratifying. The requests I made to the Executive Yuan on January 17th, including a ban on transporting aircraft and gasoline to Japan, have been notified to all member states by the League of Nations."

[Geneva, Reuters, 21st] Before the League of Nations Executive Yuan passed the resolution on China yesterday, French representative Chevalier expressed France's sympathy for China, saying that the French government is prepared to participate in all efforts to restore peace to China. New Zealand representative Jordan pointed out that 30 million people in China are currently trapped in hunger and cold. The Soviet representative said that he is very willing to support China's requests. British representative Butter said that he believes that the governments of all countries that sent representatives to Geneva deeply sympathize with China's suffering, and said that the British government has considered some of China's proposals since the last Executive Yuan meeting, and has carefully reviewed them, hoping to fulfill the expectations of the Chinese people when the situation permits.

[Special Correspondent, Central News Agency, Geneva, 21st] Before the Executive Yuan passed the resolution on the Chinese application yesterday morning, New Zealand representative Cho Tsun stood up and said, "I support the resolution, but the content seems too weak." The French representative said, "The French people deeply sympathize with the Chinese nation in this war. The Chinese people have fully demonstrated their heroic patriotism in this unprecedented catastrophe, and their heroic resistance to protect the independence of their motherland should arouse the admiration of people all over the world." In addition, the British and Soviet representatives also stood up to express their deep sympathy for the Chinese people.

[London, Central News Agency, 21st] According to the London Daily Herald, the British government has decided to allocate £3 million as a special fund to consolidate the Chinese currency system and stabilize Chinese foreign exchange. All procedures to be carried out have been completed.

[London, Reuters, 21st] According to sources from the City News Editor of the Daily Herald here, the British government has lent £3 million to China to stabilize Chinese finance and exchange rates. These procedures will be completed soon. Regarding the news carried in the Daily Herald, Reuters confirmed that the British government is carefully considering the issue of financial assistance to China. The British government does not deny the news transmitted by the Daily Herald, but cannot provide more detailed information at present.

### Important Speech by the U.S. President Regarding Authorization to Use Significant Funds for Improving Defense in Guam, and the Army's Intention to Increase Garrison in the Canal Zone

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] President Roosevelt stated, "I approve of the proposal to authorize the government to use five million dollars to build a naval base in Guam. However, it should be noted that the proposal only mentions 'authorization' and not 'appropriation.' According to the content of this proposal, it is planned to dredge the port of Guam, improve aircraft landing facilities, and build a new naval camp. It would be beneficial to the nation if the American press could explain the difference between 'Congressional authorization' and 'Congressional appropriation.' The commencement of defense projects requires Congressional appropriation. Furthermore, 'approving appropriation' does not necessarily mean starting construction immediately. Neither this Congress nor subsequent Congresses are obligated to transform 'authorization' into 'approval for actual payment of funds.' In practical terms, 'authorization' only represents what Congress desires or its aspirations, much like an individual making a 'New Year's resolution.' In recent years, Congress has authorized the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars, but many projects have not been implemented. According to the report of the 'Special Naval Committee,' there are many other plans related to the construction of a port in Guam, totaling six hundred million dollars. Currently, my concern is the actual needs of the nation, not long-term plans. I do not want to restrict myself or make any decisions, as international situations may change next year, potentially rendering today's plans obsolete." Someone specifically questioned President Roosevelt about his approval of the five million dollars for defense construction in Guam. He replied, "According to the Navy Department's estimates, one million dollars is needed in the next fiscal year to begin dredging the port of Guam, which I approve of. Furthermore, there have been no talks between the United States and Japan regarding the defense construction in Guam." It is noted that the Japanese press strongly opposes this, claiming it is detrimental to Japan's national defense. Some members of the U.S. Congress have also made criticisms. At the same time, Congressional leaders plan to pass the Naval Air Base Act as soon as possible. Chairman Vincent of the Naval Committee stated that public opinions could be heard openly starting next week.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] According to authoritative sources here, the U.S. Army authorities advocate that the strength of the garrison in the Panama Canal Zone should be doubled from its current 13,000 troops.

Daily Newspapers Continue to Criticize the United States

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese criticism of the U.S.'s defense construction in Guam has not diminished. For example, the "Japan Times" stated, "If the meaning of this action by the United States is not to interfere in Chinese politics or to seek a voice in the political arena of East Asia, or even to promote its trade through the power of cannons, then building a new naval base near the coast of Japan will only disturb the peaceful situation." "Asahi Shimbun" quoted Borah's words, "This defense plan is the most provocative plan in the last fifty years." The United States wants to gain a foothold in the Pacific, but on one hand, it calls Japan an aggressor, and on the other hand, it is carrying out aggressive actions to resist Japan. It is now believed that U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson must have reported inaccurate information to Washington authorities.

### U.S.-France Air Route: France Permits U.S. to Open

[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st] The French government has permitted the United States to establish a U.S.-France air route, with no more than four flights per week, on the condition that the United States grants France the same treatment in the future.

### Reasons for Schacht's Resignation: Germany Keeps Secrets Strict, Business Figures in Washington believe it will have no practical impact on German-American commerce.

[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] Today, the entire city of Berlin is actively trying to find out the reasons for Dr. Schacht's resignation as President of the National Bank. The secret is kept closely. Hitler met with Schacht today, thanking him for his loyal service to the country. Judging from Schacht's expression and attitude yesterday, there was nothing to prove that he foresaw today's events. On the contrary, according to information from well-informed sources obtained by this agency, the reorganization announced today was discussed in a cabinet meeting where Schacht was also present. All parties now deny that there will be any changes in Germany's finances and economy after the change of the head of the National Bank. Official circles firmly stated that the reason for this change is that the government hopes to unify the control of national finances and economy. The impact of this change on the Berlin market was better than expected. By the close of the market, the market situation was generally firm. Furthermore, there will be no change in the German government's attitude towards foreign debt (including Dawes and Young loans). Regarding the issue of Jewish resettlement, according to usually reliable sources, Schacht may still be responsible for negotiations.

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Dr. Funk has been appointed as President of the German National Bank. A senior official here said, "This move is tantamount to giving the United States a slap in the face." Other officials also stated that Funk is "notorious for his anti-Americanism." However, business figures believe that Dr. Schacht's "dismissal" will have no practical impact on German-American commerce, as Schacht was merely a puppet, and Germany's actions have already been more than enough to damage its trade with the United States. However, according to general predictions, although Germany is trying its best to reduce purchases of American goods, it still cannot help but rely on the United States for various necessities such as cotton, kerosene, copper, lead, and sulfur ore, as these items are urgently needed by Germany.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Schacht's dismissal has caused various speculations in diplomatic circles. "Commentary" reported that Schacht's dismissal was the result of a conflict between the radical and moderate factions of the National Socialist Party. On the other hand, it is believed that Schacht's departure is Hitler's deliberate demonstration to Britain that the moderate faction of the National Socialist Party has lost power. Also, Schacht's dismissal will leave a bad impression on British financial circles.

### Britain Will Increase the Construction of Warships to Counter German Submarine Construction

[Reuters, London, 21st] This agency's naval correspondent stated, "Since Germany has announced its intention to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain, Britain's shipbuilding plans will inevitably increase warships sufficient to counter submarines, such as escort ships and patrol ships, all of which are included. In addition, the addition of destroyers is also not impossible. Among today's main issues, there must be the issue of equal rates proposed by Germany, but what is known so far is that the 'National Observer' recently stated that 'Germany will only gradually expand its submarines to be equal to Britain's strength.'"

### Political Situation in Romania (Continued)

Fascists use the issue of ethnic minorities as a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and as an excuse to demand the territory of other countries. According to the invasion plan set by Germany's Goering, the first item is "to attack Ukraine from Czechoslovakia and Romania." After the Munich Conference, Czechoslovakia has already become a vassal of Germany, and now the flames of Fascism have successively burned to Romania. That country has abundant resources, such as oil, timber, herds, and food, and Hitler has long been eager to possess them. He wants to use Romania as a sacrifice to attack the Soviet Union, so Hitler pretends to be the protector of ethnic minorities in Romania and begins to weaken Romania's power. However, Carol goes against the tide and does not unite the various ethnic groups in the country under the principle of equality to protect the interests of the country. Instead, he goes astray and makes things difficult for ethnic minorities in the country, which is simply a policy of suicide.

The Romanian government's oppression of ethnic minorities stems from the suppression of the revolutionary upsurge of the working class and peasants against feudalism. The purpose is to shift the target of the masses' struggle. After the Goga cabinet was established, it followed Germany's lead in targeting Jews, wanting to shift the hatred of the working class for the ruling class to ethnic minorities. After Carol implemented monarchical dictatorship, he intensified his efforts and promulgated unilateral laws restricting their rights. He also appointed Țepelea, a member of the Iron Guard and a Fascist thug, as Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities.

Carol also fantasized and divided the country into ten regions, each with a royal supervisor. All administrative officials in the region were appointed and dismissed by the supervisor. Any group had to register with him. The supervisor also had the right to dissolve them. The supervisor of the Bessarabia region was a famous Fascist. Although the other supervisors had no party affiliation, they were all very reactionary.

Anti-Jewish Movement

Most of the land in Romania belongs to the landed gentry of Greek origin. The entire countryside is shrouded in feudal power. In order to save salt, the peasants kept the leftover vegetable soup from their meals to cook with next time, unwilling to throw it away. The hardship of their lives can be seen from this. The cultural level is very low. Illiteracy is widespread. They are also very superstitious and easily deceived. The peasants cannot bear the government's heavy taxes and levies and the landlords' exploitation, and class hatred is deepening. In order to avoid revolution, the rulers promoted the anti-Jewish movement to shift the direction of the peasants' struggle.

There are approximately 850,000 Jews in Romania, accounting for 5% of the country's population. The history is very long. There were Jewish immigrants as early as the time of Jesus. The number gradually increased in the 18th century, especially during and after the European War, when a large number of Jews moved to Romania. Their living habits, language, and writing have all been assimilated. Especially those who migrated from Spain in 1494 have almost assimilated everything. Jews have made great contributions to Romania's economic development and therefore occupy an important position in the industrial and commercial sectors.

According to Article 8 of the "Treaty for the Protection of Ethnic Minorities" signed by Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, and Romania on December 9, 1919, "All people of Korea shall be equal regardless of race, language, or religion." Article 7 stipulates, "Jews residing in Romania, except those who already have other nationalities, shall be considered Romanian citizens." Romania also promised that if it violated the provisions of the treaty, members of the League of Nations could issue warnings. The League of Nations Council would take appropriate action. However, after Goga came to power, he took the lead in advocating the anti-Jewish movement.

The Goga government stipulated that Jews who became citizens after 1922 would have their citizenship revoked and would not be allowed to own land or sell government-patented products such as alcohol, tobacco, and matches. They were also not allowed to serve as newspaper editors.

The Fascist thugs in Bucharest used the Funset Palace as their headquarters, parading in groups and swaggering through the streets. They would insult anyone who looked like a Jew at will, and even tie them up and take them to Funset Palace for private torture and beatings. Dr. Blumenfeld, the editor-in-chief of the "Dimineața" newspaper, was kidnapped by Fascist thugs for advocating justice. He was imprisoned in this house and almost beaten to death.

### French Chief of Staff Postpones Inspection Tour to North Africa, Aboriginal Troops of Abyssinia Reportedly Concentrating in Diredawa

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 21st] It was announced here this morning that the French Chief of Staff originally intended to travel to North Africa with Navy Chief of Staff Darlan on Saturday and Sunday to inspect the fortresses of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. However, this plan was suddenly cancelled, and the reason is unknown. According to several French newspapers, the French Chief of Staff's inspection tour has been postponed to the end of next week. According to sources in political circles, the postponement may be related to the recent situation in the Spanish Civil War.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th] "Paris Evening News" recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Djibouti, French East Africa, stating that eight thousand to ten thousand Abyssinian aboriginal troops belonging to Italy have recently been concentrated in Diredawa, eastern Abyssinia. This city is on the railway line from Addis Ababa to Djibouti Port. The French Amboran faces the sea on one side and is surrounded by mountains on three sides, making the terrain dangerous. However, it can be attacked via this railway line.

### Ukrainian Government in Czechoslovak Territory Opposes Czechoslovak Cabinet Members, Diplomatic Relations Severed

[Haitong News Agency, Prague, 20th] The autonomous government of Carpatho-Ukraine has severed diplomatic relations with the central government of Czechoslovakia because the Czechoslovak central government appointed General Prchala as a member of the autonomous government's cabinet. The mayor of Khust and two other cabinet members of the autonomous government telegraphed the central government, stating that if General Prchala takes office as a cabinet member, they will not be able to attend according to the constitution.

### The Circumstances of the Shanghai Customs Being Punished! (Continued to the end)

— (Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Shanghai) Zhi Ping

The Situation After the Agreement Was Concluded

1. Japanese Goods Imports Take the Top Spot. Since the outbreak of the war, foreign trade has been greatly affected, but it has gradually recovered. Taking Shanghai as an example, the import value of Japanese goods in June of the 27th year was only 200,000 yuan, which was insignificant. In July, it jumped to more than 4 million yuan, in August to more than 3 million yuan, in September to more than 4 million yuan, and in October to more than 5 million yuan, taking the top spot in imports. As for whether all goods entering and leaving Hongkou are fully taxed, it is still questionable.

Looking at the national figures, in January, the United States ranked first in imports with 11,569,000 yuan, and Japan ranked eighth with 2,440,000 yuan; in February, the United States ranked first with 18,024,000 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth with 6,023,000 yuan; in March, Germany ranked first with 19,062,000 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth with 10,227,000 yuan; in April, the United States ranked first with 13,245,000 yuan, and Japan ranked second with 10,240,000 yuan; in May, Japan ranked first with 15,361,000 yuan; in June, Japan ranked first with 18,372,000 yuan; in July, Japan ranked first with 19,701,000 yuan; in August, Japan ranked first with 23,825,000 yuan; in September, Japan ranked first with 24,755,000 yuan; and in October, Japan ranked first with 20,625,000 yuan (all figures in thousands of yuan).

2. Smuggled Goods Still Flooding In. Since the customs agreement was concluded, it was hoped that smuggling would decrease. However, according to reports, items such as wool fabrics, serge, rayon, soybean cake, matches, and canned fish daily necessities are still being smuggled in large quantities. Because no tariffs are paid, the selling price is often one-third lower than the market price, which has a significant impact on legitimate businesses. Furthermore, according to a report on October 8, although the Jianghai Customs has resumed anti-smuggling work in the East Shanghai area, it is often obstructed by military forces, making it impossible to strictly enforce the law. The practice of smuggling to evade taxes is still rampant. In the past week, the import of smuggled goods has been dominated by daily food products such as rice, white sugar, and salt. It is hoped that businesses will not import goods of unknown origin. From the above, it can be seen that smuggled goods are still very abundant.

3. Customs Forced to Fly Defunct Flag. During the customs agreement negotiations, the flag issue was a major sticking point. Relevant parties once indicated that the customs would no longer fly any flags as a passive compromise. However, on November 4, it was said that under the orders of the puppet organization and puppet officials, the five-colored flag, a defunct banner, was raised high on the roof of the Jianghai Customs Building and on all customs ships patrolling the Huangpu River, causing onlookers to frown and public opinion to be in an uproar, with people questioning the customs authorities. Afterwards, the defunct flag was hoisted several times. According to Inspector General of Customs Maze, he had not received a report on the flying of the defunct flag and had reported to the central authorities for instructions.

Failure of Seeking Cooperation with a Tiger

Regarding the customs agreement, some believe that it is an unavoidable temporary measure during wartime. Otherwise, the act of armed robbery might be unavoidable. The entire customs authority would fall into the hands of others, with them taking whatever they wanted. The principal and interest on various foreign debts secured by customs revenues would also not be guaranteed. Therefore, when the customs agreement was concluded, domestic and foreign public opinion, in addition to expressing regret and stating that China would reserve the right to free action, had little else to say. However, there are points that should be noted: the motivation for the agreement was to prevent smuggling, but smuggling continued as before, without any reduction, this is the first point; the British originally hoped to use the agreement to alleviate Japan's oppression of British commercial interests in China, but the opening of the Yangtze River was still refused, and British interests in China were even more harmed by constant concessions and damage, this is the second point; the customs revenue, in addition to paying foreign debts and indemnities, has a large surplus, which is deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, which may be used as × by the Japanese and puppet sides, and foreign newspapers have questioned the Japanese spokesman the day before yesterday as to whether the "Reformed Government" had withdrawn or borrowed funds from customs duties, and used customs duties as collateral, and the Japanese side avoided answering, this is the third point. Furthermore, the payment of foreign debts is to maintain our foreign credit, but since Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangdong have fallen one after another, the authority is no longer in our hands. Foreign reporters also asked the Japanese spokesman whether the customs surplus deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank would be used to pay foreign debts secured by customs duties, and the Japanese only used adjustments as a pretext. All of this was unexpected by the British. However, with the arrival of the incident, the Japanese merchants have also made great concessions, and the Shanghai Customs has agreed to the Japanese Shipping Company's request to use Japanese bills of lading and fill out Japanese inventory lists. This kind of additional example, with the bill of lading of one country's customs allowing the use of foreign languages, was originally abnormal, but now the texts of various countries, British and Japanese, are mixed together, which is even more unexpected. Do short-sighted politicians who are focused on reality and seek cooperation with a tiger hope to maintain their interests in the Far East?

A Short Commentary

### Speech by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita

Japanese Foreign Minister Arita gave a speech in the Diet yesterday, explaining Japan's future diplomatic policies. The important points are: (1) Japan is determined to implement the policy of forming a "Japan-Manchukuo-China Group" and establishing a "New Order in East Asia." Here, he fully explained that Japanese diplomacy is a tool of the Japanese warlords, and future policies are a manifestation of the intentions of the Japanese warlords. The so-called "hope that China will quickly establish a new central government" is to use diplomatic conspiracies as an auxiliary to promote the emergence of a new China, a pseudo-Manchukuo II, in the warlords' intentions. (2) He also stated that Japan is still determined to open China's doors, but it is necessary for Japan to impose considerable restrictions on matters related to national defense. This again illustrates Japan's intention to deceive countries such as Britain and the United States. However, the so-called considerable restrictions have no specific boundaries, and the narrowness of the "open door" under Japan's special permission can be imagined. Although Britain and the United States are tired of resisting, they will at least not be so foolish as to willingly be baited by this lure and serve the Japanese aggressors to boost their power. (3) He also stated: "Japan cannot remain silent on the fact that the Soviet Union and France are aiding China, and will take countermeasures against Vietnam becoming a gateway for China to obtain military supplies from abroad in order to retaliate." This is even more unreasonable intimidation of France and the Soviet Union, and it is in line with Germany's eastward advance and anti-French intentions. Unfortunately, this kind of intimidation is already too late. The Soviet Union is not afraid of intimidation, and China is even less like Czechoslovakia! In addition, Arita tirelessly called out the crisis of communism and loudly sang the praises of Asian anti-communism, almost forgetting the great event that made the world laugh at them, their recent submission to the red flag of Zhanggufeng! In short, Arita's declaration is not enough to make the powers feel interested, and it only increases the boredom of the people of the country. We cannot name it, so we call it "self-deception"!

### Mr. Bosman's Advice

Former students of the "Great Library," the predecessor of the University of Hong Kong, the highest institution of learning in the territory, held a reunion party the night before last. More than twenty Chinese and foreign alumni attended, the youngest of whom was seventy-one years old. Mr. Bosman even returned from afar to participate. In his speech, he highly praised the doctrine of his former classmate, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, commended Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's policy of uniting all parties in the country to persist in the war of resistance, and praised the progress of our country in recent years in terms of ideology and material construction. Finally, he pointed out the close relationship between Hong Kong and China's war of resistance, and called on foreign residents in Hong Kong to urgently donate to the victims of war and refugees. He said, "For British nationals, whose wealth comes from Hong Kong, I ask whether we are being loyal? At the same time, do we recognize China as a loyal ally? If so, then we should do our best to save China from the ravages of war. You are all advanced in age and living comfortably, but within the realm of possibility, you should not indulge yourselves too much, and should spare a thought for the refugees." The reader should reflect on this: if foreigners are so concerned about our national affairs, how much more should our wealthy compatriots in Hong Kong be? If foreigners firmly believe that the Three Principles of the People and the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to persist in the war of resistance are the only path to China's victory, how should our compatriots regard those who advocate a truce, oppose communism, and criticize the Three Principles of the People? If a white-haired foreign old man is so concerned about our war-stricken refugees and warns against excessive indulgence, how much more should our young compatriots with wealth and strength redouble their efforts to support the war of resistance and rescue the refugees?

### Establishment of the Commission to Celebrate Countries Not Participating in Japanese Aggression

The American Commission to Celebrate Countries Not Participating in Japanese Aggression has been established under the leadership of Mr. Stimson. In the future, it will strive to completely ban the import of military or auxiliary military equipment into Japan. The establishment of this commission fully demonstrates the pain and resentment of peace-loving and righteous people in the United States towards the expansion of the aggressor Japan's war and the harm to mankind, and fully expresses their pain and resentment towards the direct or indirect assistance of a small number of industrialists and businessmen in the United States to Japan's aggression. At the same time, it will be of considerable significance in helping our heroic war of resistance against Japanese fascist aggression. We should launch Chinese and foreign public opinion to enthusiastically support this action of international peace-loving and righteous people, which is in line with the requirements of the progress of human culture. We should call on other democratic countries and their peoples around the world who demand peace and freedom to quickly establish such mass organizations to oppose fascist aggression and stop the spread of the great war during this new era of imperialist war, universally develop the mass movement against fascist aggression war throughout the world, and at the same time strive to unite this movement to become an irresistible force.

### Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, Points Out: Hong Kong's Relationship with China is Extremely Close; Hong Kong's Fortune is Closely Related to China's Fortune; Hoping for an Early End to the Conflict in the Pacific to Bring Peace to Hong Kong

Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong, recently published an article in the British "Imperial Colony" entitled "The Position of the Colony of Hong Kong in the Pacific." He gave a detailed account of the improvements and construction of Hong Kong's municipal administration. He stated that in the coming years, Hong Kong will undergo improvements in scale and magnificent construction. Regarding the issue of densely populated areas, the government is currently reviewing various administrative measures to seek improvements. A new agency has been added to handle labor affairs and protect the well-being of workers. The current efforts are to develop education and health administration, and there is also an urgent implementation to protect the well-being of women and children of a certain class. The article specifically mentioned that Hong Kong will hold its centenary celebration in 1941, hoping that by then, the conflicts in the Pacific will come to an end, allowing Hong Kong to live and work in peace with its friendly countries.

Hong Kong's Close Relationship with China

The Governor pointed out that Hong Kong's fortune is closely related to the happiness of its great neighbor. China's relationship with Hong Kong is particularly close during this difficult and arduous time. Many goods are imported from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland, and at the same time, the number of people fleeing to Hong Kong has suddenly increased, causing difficulties for the original residents, especially the poor. Due to the soaring rents and rising prices, the cost of living is high, and the government has made it a matter of urgency to legislate to restrict this. Due to the sudden increase in population, the supply of housing cannot meet the demand, and every corner is crowded. However, there are still many people living on the streets, and the government has taken measures to resettle them.

The Aviation Development Has a Bright Future

Continuing on the development of Hong Kong's civil aviation industry, he briefly stated that due to the rapid development of Hong Kong's civil aviation industry, Hong Kong's commerce will have a promising future. Although affected by the war, the civil aviation traffic in the first seven months of 1938 exceeded the entire year of 1937, with 4,024 more passengers, 157 tons more cargo and mail, and 101 more flights. Its future is limitless.

T Industry Manufacturing is Well-Known in the Far East

Hong Kong, including the New Territories leased land, has an area of only 400 square miles. It is not possible to expect too much in terms of raw material production, but Hong Kong has become the base for many kinds of industries. Shipbuilding is famous in the Far East, and it is the most famous. Most of Hong Kong's industry manufactures low-priced goods that are suitable for consumption by the poor in various ports, especially in the dependencies under the empire. These goods can obtain preferential import duties in accordance with the imperial preferential tax regulations. Hong Kong has a pleasant climate and excellent scenery, making it a popular destination for escaping the cold. It has comfortable hotels, horse racing and other sports facilities, everything is available.

Economic Fluctuations are Frequently Affected

The world is rarely matched. Finally, the economic rise and fall of Hong Kong is discussed, which is often affected by external factors. As an import and export trading port, its prosperity follows the world's economic situation, and it is also subject to the destruction of nature. The two typhoons in 1936 and 1937 caused losses of 1.5 million to the Hong Kong government alone, and the losses of private property, shipping, and industry were even greater. On July 19, 1926, heavy rain of 21 inches fell within 24 hours, causing great damage to various buildings, and the repair costs reached several million dollars. Despite these setbacks, Hong Kong has completed various major projects in the past few years, and is still pushing forward. In the coming years, it is hoped that the various major buildings will be completed with income from the public treasury. However, Hong Kong's most difficult problem is that on the one hand, there is very little land for construction, and land needs to be reclaimed from the sea; on the other hand, the population is increasing rapidly, resulting in extreme population density and great difficulty in housing. Efforts are being made to solve this problem.

It welcomes opinions and practical participation from organizations, groups, schools, manufacturers, and individuals.

### Kowloon Motor Bus Company Will Implement Double-Decker Buses in the Short Term; The Parks Department Has Cut Down Trees on Both Sides of Nathan Road

The Kowloon Motor Bus Company previously ordered a batch of double-decker buses from the United Kingdom, intending to use them to run on various lines in the Peninsula. After testing on Nathan Road, it was found that the trees and street lights on both sides of the road were obstructing the passage, so it was delayed. The company has now obtained the consent of the transportation authorities and the Director of Parks to cut down the trees on both sides of Nathan Road, raise the street lights crossing the sky, and order the removal of store signs that are too low, so as to ensure unobstructed passage. After testing on Nathan Road again, they were satisfied, so double-decker buses will be discovered in the Peninsula in the shortest possible time. It is reported that the company will temporarily use four buses to run on routes 1, 2, and 6, with separate first and second class fares.

### Air Defense and Sea Defense Go Hand in Hand; Hong Kong Organizes 6,000 Air Raid Wardens; Now Begins Recruiting 2,000 Women to Serve; Blockade Engineering Ship Arrived in Hong Kong from the UK Yesterday

The Hong Kong air defense authorities are paying close attention to the training of the public in wartime and have already implemented the wartime public air defense service plan, organizing air defense instructors, appointing area air defense committees, and training wartime service personnel. The organization plan is to prepare 6,000 instructors, of which 2,000 are planned to be filled by women. The recruitment of Chinese and Western women in Hong Kong has now begun. According to Air Defense Commissioner Steel Perkins, speaking to reporters yesterday, it has been proven in the World War that women do have the same courage and魄力 as men. We especially encourage women in Hong Kong to automatically participate in the service. Each of the 2,000 air defense stations in Hong Kong will have three instructors. We hope that one of the three will be a woman. Although there is no age limit for instructors, it is still most appropriate for those over 30 years old. There is absolutely no restriction on the nationality of the instructors. Twenty-two sub-district committees have now been established in Hong Kong, and the training of air defense instructors is also proceeding smoothly. 800 male and female instructors have already signed up to participate in the service, and there are 8 instructors in charge of training. It is believed that the air defense committees in each district will be able to recruit instructors in the short term, and it is believed that 6,000 people will be obtained. In addition, in order to enhance the sea defense in the Far East, the British naval authorities have not only increased the deployment of powerful cruisers to Hong Kong, but have also recently sent personnel to blockade engineering ships, one named the Balia, stationed in Singapore, and one named the Baran, stationed in Hong Kong. The former arrived in Singapore last year, and the latter also arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. After a brief trial, it was handed over to the Hong Kong Naval Department. It is reported that the sole mission of this warship is to lay iron wire nets and other blockade work, specializing in defense, and is called an interception defense ship. The equipment is quite new and is the first to be seen in Hong Kong. In addition, the new British naval transport ship, the Austria, will carry a batch of naval personnel to Hong Kong in March.

### The Disaster Situation in Huiyang is Tragic; The Emergency Relief Association Actively Provides Relief; Branch Associations are Established in Hui to Provide Relief in Boluo

The branch association specially sent three committee members, Si Mingzhong Shaoping and He Zehong, to Hong Kong yesterday to report to the Hong Kong Emergency Reporting Association about the progress of future work, and to receive a large amount of money and medicines to return to Hui to provide relief.

### National News Weekly Publication

Huang Yanpei, a giant in the cultural world, founded the "National News Weekly" in the 12th year of the Republic of China. The argument is fair and the materials are rich, which is highly supported by all walks of life. The circulation reached more than 12,000 copies, which was one of the few influential periodicals at that time. After the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, it worked even harder and became one of the central creations during the Anti-Japanese War. It was suspended until our army withdrew. Later, at the urging of all parties, it was re-published in Chongqing last year on "August 13". Tao Xingzhi and Wu Han joined as editorial committee members, and the content became more exciting. Recently, in response to the requirements of readers in South China and overseas, a Hong Kong version has been added, which was published yesterday. The content is rich, including Huang Yanpei's "My View of Life and the Basic Theory of Our Engagement in Vocational Education", Tao Xingzhi's "Five Bow Song", Fang Xingyan's "New Trends in Overseas Chinese Education", etc. The Living Bookstore and all large and small bookstores are selling it, and the price is 3 Hong Kong cents per copy.

### Mr. Tao Xingzhi Speaks

— Qi Zhuo

Comprehensive Education in the War of Resistance at the Cadre Training Class of the China Arts Association

Although it was a cold night with a biting north wind, the hearts of a group of young people who were thirsty for knowledge were burning like a raging fire. They put on heavy winter clothes and walked eagerly across the cold and deserted roads, stepping into the Cadre Training Class of the China Arts Association, which was full of warmth, to listen to Mr. Tao Xingzhi's lecture.

A large classroom was already full. After a thunderous applause, Mr. Tao calmly and peacefully began his speech:

"Today is the opening day of the Cadre Training Class of the Hong Kong China Arts Association; I am very happy to be able to participate in this grand event. I was also very pleased to see the many important issues you want to explore. Now, the topic I want to talk about is the one you agreed upon, "Wartime Education"."

After a brief introduction, Mr. Tao began to talk about the topic:

"After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there are still people who do not recognize "Wartime Education". When I was overseas, I heard the president of a certain university express his "high opinion", saying that he had never studied wartime education and did not know how to do it. Then, he used the banner of "a century-old plan" to cover up.

In fact, this is obvious: now Japanese imperialism has already turned China into a wartime China. All our lives and activities should be suitable for the needs of wartime. No one can dodge, and education is of course no exception.

If the president of a certain school does not run wartime education and does not study wartime education, he should resign, otherwise he will sit and eat the country's salary. It's really a joke!

I strongly disagree with his opinion, so I wrote a poem to reply to him:

"Plague spreads everywhere,

Mom is lying in bed sick.

Asking him to pour a cup of water, he says he is busy with homework.

Asking him to call a doctor, he says he is busy with homework.

Asking him to buy a dose of medicine, he says he is busy with homework.

Until mom dies,

He is busy writing an obituary;

Busy writing a eulogy;

Busy being an orphan."

Causing the whole audience to burst into laughter. Mr. Tao said again with hatred for evil:

"Even now, there are still people who are educating for the sake of education, teachers are teaching dead books, teaching dead, and teaching books dead. Students are reading dead books, reading dead, and reading books dead.

——Another burst of laughter.

"They are doing peacetime education, living their detached lives under the banner of "a century-old plan". They don't care how painful and dangerous our mother - the Chinese nation - is. Until mom dies, he will be busy writing an obituary, busy being an orphan.

After Mr. Tao severely criticized the negative "peacetime education", he turned to the positive topic:

"The second phase of the War of Resistance is a comprehensive war of resistance, and the requirement for education is comprehensive education. The meaning of comprehensive education is to expand education to our front and the enemy's rear, and even to the entire world, so that the whole world can be awakened to expand the anti-aggression movement. This is in terms of space. In terms of object, education is not the patent of a few young masters and young ladies, those who have money, leisure, and face. It should be expanded to all young people, all children, all adults, all old people, and even all old women.

Maybe some people will say: What is the use of children and old women? In fact, if the children are like the children's singing troupe in Taierzhuang, turning the traitor surnamed Huang into a small soldier - the child surnamed Huang was deceived by the enemy and became a small traitor. Because he was moved by the children's propaganda team, he raised his hand to repent of his experience as a traitor. And he reported to our army about the enemy's situation, and as a result, he destroyed the enemy's arsenal, guns, etc., and changed from a small traitor to a small soldier - the power of the old women can increase many times if they are like Zhao's mother. Therefore, education should be expanded to the ranks of children and old women, and expanded to the entire nation.

Mr. Tao paused slightly after talking about this passage, and then continued to talk about how comprehensive education should be done with great enthusiasm:

"Wherever a group occurs in wartime, education should be expanded there.

When there are wounded soldiers in wartime, education should go to the wounded soldiers. If there are five hundred wounded soldiers' hospitals, they should be run as five hundred wounded soldiers' schools. The adverse effects of the wounded soldiers not being educated are unimaginable. The power generated by the wounded soldiers being educated is very grand. They can influence the public in the local area and affect the morale in the front. This is an obvious truth.

When there are refugees in wartime, education should go to the refugees, so that the consumed relief becomes a productive force. When troops are conscripted in wartime, education should go to the ranks of the strong men, so that all the strong men will enthusiastically serve as soldiers and enthusiastically join the army, making our source of soldiers inexhaustible and inexhaustible. This is also a very important question.

Not only that, we must also expand education to the enemy's rear, so that the puppet regime cannot be established, the anti-war movement in Japan is strengthened, and it is expanded to the whole world, so that international assistance will become increasingly accumulated.

### Comedy Musings

— Tan Youyi

Recently, the film market seems to be running out of folk tales. The release of erotic and sensual films like "A Bath" and "Teasing Eyes," as well as terrifying works resembling "playing the pig to scare the tiger," has not proven to be popular. Therefore, some clever filmmakers are scratching their heads and, with a plan in mind, are using comedies with titles like "Laugh to Death" as a selling point. In reality, whether a film is a box office success, in other words, whether it can attract a large audience, is entirely a matter of its intrinsic qualities, unrelated to its form. Empty content and poorly made works, no matter how you promote them, can only deceive the audience temporarily. As for those toxic films that violate the spirit of the times or spread messages that weaken the resistance against Japan, they will naturally be despised and rejected! On the contrary, a work with correct ideology and mature artistry, whether it is a tragedy or a comedy, a romance or a detective story, will be equally welcomed, and there is no need to worry about it "going out of style." Theatergoers are the most amiable customers; they only want good things and fundamentally have no preconceived notions about what kind of plays should be shown at any given time. If you can further adopt themes that are closely related to them and nurture them through art and skill, then that is the "infallible method" for "unfailing success." They will absolutely not make demanding requests to use a particular dramatic form to express a line of agreeable thought. The so-called "what they wanted in the past is not what viewers want now" perspective is simply "smashing a mirror with your head," unable to see one's own shortcomings. We should get to the point. Let us assume the "current film market will be dominated by comedies" is a misconception and discuss comedy to provide some reference for producers and enthusiasts.

Comedy, according to its literal definition, is a drama that evokes laughter. However, because it belongs to drama, a branch of literature, and especially film, considered a comprehensive art, the achievement of comedy should not be as simple as "purely aiming to evoke laughter." We should imbue it with life and greater effect, so that the emotions of the audience are not limited to just laughter. Here is a brief list of the categories of comedy:

Slapstick Comedy: This is a type of comedy that cannot be said to have life or a greater effect and is the lowest quality of comedy. The plot can be strung together haphazardly, the jokes can be cobbled together, there is no need for ideology or to consider the content. It is almost a mess, a chaotic hodgepodge. As long as you think that "men getting pregnant" and "turtles growing wings" are the most hilarious storylines, feel free to use them as much as you like! "Torn pants" and "crazy antics" are unprecedentedly funny jokes; just insert them in large quantities. In any case, the only purpose is to deliberately force the audience to laugh while watching, without needing to conform to physics or human nature, not caring whether there is any aftertaste or impression. Of course, it also disregards the disgust and contempt of knowledgeable people and more progressive audiences. The works of Western actors like Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Brothers are the authentic representatives of this type of comedy. Most of the so-called "comedies" in Chinese films follow this shallow and boring path.

Light Comedy: This is a middle-grade comedy. It requires a more complete story, but it is often fantastical. It also needs reasonable jokes, vaguely has a shadow of life, and the effect seems to be more than just laughter. The screenwriter, director, actors, and all other personnel involved in this type of production must do their utmost to show off their cleverness, focusing on developing humor and wit from small details, with the aim of scratching the audience's itch and making them feel relaxed and happy while watching. American productions excel in this style, and Ernst Lubitsch is considered a master of this art.

Satirical Comedy: This is a high-grade comedy, with substance and a special effect. Perhaps the plot on the surface is not necessarily close to human nature, but it must target certain, or multiple, behaviors of society or life and subject them to sharp, exaggerated, and unforgiving satire. Although the performance uses the form of comedy, its effect can give the audience unexpected warnings and leave a deep impression. Even those being satirized in the audience will laugh at first, but after realizing the truth, they will feel as if they have thorns in their backs. This type of comedy is not easy to create from beginning to end in one go. Charlie Chaplin often incorporated some or a large portion of satirical material into his works, and Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" achieved 80% success. The only complete one the author has seen is the Soviet production "The Marionettes."

Between middle-grade and high-grade, we can also find a type of tragic comedy. This naming seems very contradictory, but the reason for its success as a middle-to-high or high-grade drama lies in its contradiction. It is not surprising for a tragedy to make you cry, but it is great if a comedy can also move you to tears. The reason why Charlie Chaplin still firmly occupies the throne of comedy and has the largest audience is that most of his works have tragic content but are performed as comedies. From silent films like "Shoulder Arms" and "The Kid" to more recent ones like "City Lights" and "Modern Times," they are all bitter and realistic stories expressed in a humorous way. He makes you laugh, laugh heartily, but if you are not numb and can reflect a bit after laughing, you cannot help but pity the fate of the poor man in the play, and even shed a tear of sympathy for him. In this way, its effect and impression are naturally more circuitous and powerful than a direct tragedy, and is its life not more vibrant and active than some other superficial comedies?

The musings about comedy provided here are only this meager, but they can勉强算得上 "the sparrow may be small but has all vital organs. " It is hoped that filmmakers and viewers who are interested in comedy will expand their vision from this small point and determine their attitude towards production and appreciation, striving to ensure that it is not a waste of resources and time.

"The Newly Appointed Magistrate" Steals Chickens (The Era Drama Troupe Performs in Macau)

A wonderful scene from "The Newly Appointed Magistrate": Liu: "I want to marry you!"

### "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" and "Beside Oneself"

— Fan Jia

Performances by the Era Drama Troupe and the China Art Drama Troupe

Play Review

Two months ago, a script caught the attention of Hong Kong drama troupes and was simultaneously rehearsed: "Beside Oneself" by the China Art Drama Troupe and "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" by the Era Drama Troupe. Although the names are different, it is actually the same script. The China Art Drama Troupe performed it in Mandarin, while the Era Drama Troupe performed it in Cantonese. Both troupes belong to the Hong Kong Drama Movement Center and are directed by Mr. Mo Yang Yuqian, so the performance results can certainly be trusted.

The Era Drama Troupe's "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" went to Macau for a charity performance in mid-May and premiered on the 15th. The author has already seen it. The China Art Drama Troupe's "Beside Oneself" was also staged at the Central Theatre in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. The author has seen it as well. If we put these two performances together and talk about them, I think it would be very meaningful.

The script is the soul of the play. With a soul, plus the means of arrangement (director), a body with flesh and blood is produced. With the same script, and then processed by the same director, the same things should appear, right? But wonderfully, after seeing these two performances, they gave me different feelings and different interests. The China Art Drama Troupe's "Beside Oneself" is heavy and silent, while the Era Drama Troupe's "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" is light and flowing. The former is closer to tragedy, and the latter is a comedy. The performance methods are the same, the composition of the stage, and the position of the actors are also not very different, but the style of performance has such differences, probably because these two groups have different styles.

Originally, this play exposes the various ugly states of a group of rogue thugs who accidentally become successful at a certain opportunity, and at the same time shows the misery of the common people under the dark forces who are ruined and killed. The first half is comedy, and the second half is tragedy, forming a very serious contrast. The more powerful this contrast is, the greater the effect. If the comedic parts are performed heavily, and the tragic parts are performed frivolously, they are all failures. "Beside Oneself's"

The first two acts committed the mistake of being heavy and silent. The actors did not fully express the "得意 (beside oneself)" parts, nor did they express the "忘形 (forgetting one's place)" state. In terms of stage design, the use of clean-lined scenery and yellow-toned lighting made the first half of the play seem peaceful and quiet. Using such a posture to perform this group of ugly people is undoubtedly insufficient. "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" was performed very lightly and lively in the first half, using exaggerated movements to strengthen the comedic elements, making people feel that this group of nouveaux riches are both ridiculous and pitiful. Looking at the two performances, "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" was relatively more successful, with a greater audience response, and it was able to express the original meaning of the script.

A play with the first half being a comedy and the second half being a tragedy is the most difficult to act. If done poorly, it is easy to turn into two unconnected pieces. Experienced actors know to be careful in this area. The second half of "Beside Oneself" continues from the first half, maintaining the heavy and silent atmosphere, so the effect of the third act is very good, but it is slightly too long. This responsibility should be borne by the playwright and has nothing to do with those who acted it out. The China Art Drama Troupe's acting is strong in stability and is most suitable for performing the third act of this drama. It is a pity that Miss Tong, who plays Little Silver Brother, did not get to show her strengths, which is a fly in the ointment. "The Newly Appointed Magistrate's" second half also developed the atmosphere from the first half, so it was slightly more flowing. However, this also has its advantages. I remember that when it came to the third act, many audience members were moved to tears. I was moved to tears, perhaps because the tragedy of the Xu family touched my heart about the destruction of my family.

The difference between these two performances is certainly due to the different styles of the individual groups. At the same time, I feel that the difference in dialects is also an important reason. Cantonese people are not as compliant as people from other provinces, and people from other provinces are not as lively as Cantonese people. To put it bluntly, they are not as "slippery." Performing comedy is more suitable for Cantonese people. For example, for plays like "The Paint Isn't Dry," northerners are not as good as Cantonese people in performing it lively. There are many subtleties in Cantonese slang that Mandarin does not have, especially in the lower classes. For example, the phrase "他媽的 (his mother's)," which is often used in the play's lines, is far less direct and effective than "×那媽." "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" often uses a lot of slang from the lower classes, which is both fluent and natural, and is perfect for the personalities of those thugs who have risen to power and become successful. This is a big reason why "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" has a good effect.

2.  Organizers of Drama Performances A. The Director's Task

There used to be a film called "42nd Street" that wrote about a director who painstakingly rehearsed a play, and on the day of the performance, it was indeed a huge success. However, as he sat at the entrance, listening to the audience's criticisms, they only praised the actors, completely forgetting about the director. He was very sad!

That's right, this is the director's sadness. When the drama completes its rehearsal process and is performed on stage, the director is not involved in the direct connection between the artist and the art-appreciating social class.

When the art of drama is carried out on stage in its most complete and concrete creation, although the director is rejected, this complete creation can be said to be the director's hard work.

The art of drama is a comprehensive art, and the person who independently, artistically, organically unites and organizes the various departments is the director. Therefore, the director is the organizer of the drama performance.

Therefore, as a director, he must not only have literary accomplishment to understand the script, but he must also know art, stage design, acting theory, music, dance... all stage techniques; because the director is not only an organizer of the drama performance, but also a conductor of the group, just like a conductor of an orchestra.

The most important thing for the success of a drama performance is neatness and perfection, so the creation of the art of drama should be carried out under a unified will and a unified purpose, and the director's greatest task is to stand between the playwright and the creative group of the theater to unify the creative will of all the group members. The so-called directing technique is to connect the art of the playwright with the performance of the actors and give it limitations; the director explains to the actors and other artists the themes and image system given by the playwright; the director's creative materials are the art of the actors, composers, designers, etc., the creative intentions of the drama, the plans and forms of the drama performance, etc., which are mostly the power of the director.

From this point of view, the art of drama seems to be only the self-expression of the director, but this view is wrong. The director does not use drama to express his own creative personality, but to propose important issues in life to solve them—this is the mission of drama. And the solution of the problem. The group is equally responsible, and the artists of each actor and each department should maximize the independence of their own creative will. Drama is not a tool for the director to show off his cleverness. If the director's art goes beyond the drama and oppresses the creative will of other artists, the drama will not exist, and we will only come into contact with one of the elements of the drama, the isolated art of the director. Moreover, sacrificing many opinions in order to cater to the director's personal opinions and forcing the artists to engage in involuntary artistic creation violates the principles of artistic creation and makes creation impossible. Therefore, the director's work, his responsibility, is not to force the group to belong to himself, to make it a lifeless tool that has lost its creative will, but to give inspiration to all creative parties in the theater. To organize them and encourage them to ask the greatest creative will and enthusiasm to complete the entire perfect creation of the art of drama.

The art of drama can be said to be a diverse unity, and the greatest task of the director is not to make everything belong to himself, but to collect these diverse artistic departments, each with its own independence, and the creative will of each artist, and adjust, criticize, measure, and comprehensively organize them by artistic means, so that they become a general goal, a unified will, an organic whole, and a great creation. The director's task lies in this, neither too little nor too much. If you can achieve this step, then the entire perfect success of the drama performance is undoubtedly. (To be continued)

### This Year, Finance Becomes More Stable, Developing the Economy of the Rear (Part 2), The International Balance of Payments Situation Sees Further Improvement, Funds Flow into the Mainland to Assist Development

Encouraging Movement Inward, Funds Flowing In

After the war, funds flowed into cities, and with the regulation of public and private financial institutions, funds became more abundant. The interest rates in various places remained unchanged throughout the year. The interbank lending rate of the city's money industry association fell to 1.1 cents at the end of the year. Although wartime reduced the opportunities for capital utilization, it was also a reason for the constant interest rate to tend to fall. However, elsewhere, it was also a manifestation of financial stability and stable prices, and also a powerful testimony to the constant value of currency. However, the government has been working hard to make funds flow into the mainland to develop the economy of the rear and enrich national power, so it encourages the movement of banks inward. For example, the number of bank headquarters and branches in the six southwestern provinces has reached 120.

The International Balance of Payments Tends to Improve

After the Trade Commission made efforts to rectify my country's international trade, the months of June, July, August, and September of last year actually turned into a trade surplus. In the long term, the trade deficit for the first ten months of the 26th year was 117,750,125 yuan, while in the same period of the 27th year, the trade deficit was 111,101,442 yuan, which proves the success of my country's controlled trade. The increase in remittances from overseas Chinese is very large, and it is said that it totaled 600 million yuan last year, which is double the increase compared with previous years, which is enough to offset the trade deficit of goods and have a surplus. Recently, since the success of the British and American credit loans, the inflow of foreign capital into my country's international balance of payments has tended to improve.

Maintaining Legal Exchange Rates From Beginning to End

In order to stabilize foreign exchange, the Central Bank, China Bank, and Communications Bank have always maintained statutory prices. Although the Japanese side has repeatedly attempted to disrupt, such as taking foreign exchange from the United Notes and reducing the value of currency in North China, all plans have ultimately failed. The issuance of Chinese legal currency has increased unabated, and it has gained the trust of the people. It circulates naturally and has a premium rate. The exchange rate on the open market has always stood at 8 pence and zero. People's confidence in my country's currency has been completely restored. The near and far price differences of foreign exchange have also gradually disappeared. Many of my country's capital funds have recovered their funds invested in foreign exchange. Half of this is because they fear that the exchange rate will always rise and lose the opportunity to profit, and half is because the investment funds actually have more favorable places than foreign exchange.

### Today's Big Soccer Match: Li Wah Cup, Chinese United Takes the Field, Clash with the Naval Combined Team at the Hong Kong Stadium

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Excellent soccer matches are numerous this season. Today is the second act of the Li Wah Cup preliminary round, with Chinese United facing Naval Combined. Both teams are renowned, with outstanding skills. They will put on a great show that will captivate soccer fans.

To meet the requirements of the Association, Chinese United selected and re-selected before determining their lineup. Li Huitang was also invited to participate and reluctantly agreed. Li Huitang's foot injury has not fully healed, and he has also gained weight due to stopping training for half a month after the injury. He is participating this time to alleviate the Association's dissatisfaction with South China's breach of contract. It is out of enthusiasm, without regard for other considerations. Therefore, he himself is not confident whether his performance will be satisfactory.

In my opinion, this lineup of Chinese United is evenly matched against Naval Combined. It is bound to be a difficult and closely contested match. The outcome is unpredictable. If we rashly conclude that Chinese United will lose, it would be demoralizing. If we insist that Chinese United will win, we cannot be so sure. In short, the facts after the match will be clear.

It is said that Song Lisheng's foot injury has not fully recovered and he will not be playing. If that is the case, Liu Shidu should replace him. As for Luo Weiquan's position, it should not be changed under any circumstances. At the same time, I hope that those players who are new to big matches will play boldly and not be timid.

It is also said that Hou Chengtou is also having problems, If he is also absent, the forward line will be significantly affected. In that case, as a last resort, Huang Jingcong is a suitable substitute.

The Art of War says, "Move after careful consideration; one who knows the plans of indirect and direct approach will win." Soccer matches are similar to the art of war. Especially today, Chinese United must pay attention to strategy. First, they should carefully observe the opponent's strengths and weaknesses, attack where they must go, and go where they do not expect it. This is called seizing the initiative. Second, they should take advantage of their own team's strengths, assess the situation and act, and advance and retreat according to the situation. This is called measuring the enemy to achieve victory.

With Li Huitang as the center forward, they must adopt the "conical attack" method. But the two inside forwards on the left and right must provide Huitang with sufficient support at all times. They can also use the wings to attack from the sides, drawing in the opponent's defenders so that they cannot gather their strength to counter the conical attack from the flanks, which will make it easier to achieve results.

Chen Bingtu should pay attention to short passes. It is not enough to simply cross the ball into the center and be done with it. Short passes and crosses must also be timely, otherwise it will be in vain. Therefore, my suggestion is that Bingshi should take advantage of the situation and attack quickly, while Chengtou should use his intelligence to lure the enemy. Although the strategy is not fixed, it must be adapted to the situation. However, to make it easier for Huitang's conical attack to progress, it is better to often use flank attacks to lure the enemy and control their counterattacks from the center.

This time, Chinese United strengthened its forward line, which is the unique insight of the selection committee. The question of whether Chinese United wins today depends on how the three forwards perform. If Lingsheng is not absent, this line will be strong and will have a solid foundation for advancing and retreating. But even if Lingsheng is replaced by Shizan, it will not affect the overall situation. I have faith in this line's ability to launch attacks and assist the defense.

Hou Rongsheng and Weiquan have a heavy responsibility for defense, but the most important thing is to contain the two wings of Naval Combined. The interconnectedness of the three forwards is also their natural responsibility. Therefore, taking care of the inside defense is their most important task in this match.

The Naval Combined team excels in short passes and speed, especially on the wings, and their defensive strength is also not weak. Therefore, how to win depends on the efforts of the Chinese United players.

Finally, a word to the fans: if you want to see a good show, please arrive early. But please do not bring small "kai" (knives). Also, do not buy tickets sold outside the stadium for profit. Each spectator may purchase no more than three tickets. Once the seats are full, ticket sales will stop. The battleground is the Hong Kong Stadium. The match starts at 3:30 PM. The lineups of the two teams are as follows (Football Field God):

Chinese United

Tan Junqian, Luo Weiquan, Hou Rongsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Liang Rongzhao, Song Lingsheng, Hou Chengtou, Luo Wenzhi, Li Huitang, Zhuo Shijin, Chen Bingtu

Substitutes: Li Deqi, Miao Huaguo, Liu Shizan, Liu Xianhan, Zeng Zhongyun, Wu Qixiang, Yang Zixiang, Zhong Lin, Huang Jingcong

### Guanghua Courageously Defeats St. Joseph's

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's soccer matches, due to the influence of the Li Wah Cup Western Civil Servants vs. Army Combined match, most of the original schedule was changed. Only one match was held in the First Division League. Guanghua faced St. Joseph's in their first match. After a hard-fought battle, Guanghua won. Yesterday's match, because both teams had given up hope for the championship, the outcome was not enough to shake up the overall situation. St. Joseph's defeat was due to an abnormal performance. The team's offensive strength lies in the two wings, but yesterday they were restrained by Guanghua's defenders and could not move an inch. There was no opportunity to cross the ball into the center. Li An'na was brave, but could not get support, so he had no chance to show his skills. The five defenders in the back were quite willing to work hard, but their coordination was not tight and their movements were slow, so they could not stop the enemy forwards. On the Guanghua side, Wenzhi and Shijin performed wonderfully and deserve the most credit. The forwards made good use of the wings and did not easily hold onto the ball, making it difficult for Joseph's defenders to cope. The two goals scored by Shijin were due to taking advantage of Sousa's mistakes and cutting in to score. The defender Rongsheng performed better, being wise and decisive, and saving many dangerous situations. Guoqi's goalkeeping skills are improving rapidly and he will become a great player in the future. The battle situation is briefly recorded as follows:

At the start of the game, An'na led the two wings to advance in the center. As soon as they reached the 30-yard area, they were tackled by Huilin, who followed through and sent it further. Guanghua's dragon fight was surrounded, and the first alarm was sounded. Fortunately, Rongsheng was the bravest of the three armies, breaking through the heavy defenses and opening a path of blood. Shijin took the opportunity to counterattack. Qian and Zou lost twice, supporting each other from left and right, and advancing straight with short passes. Sousa blocked the way, heavy doors and deep soup, this route was impassable. Jingcong changed to infiltrating from the border pass, probing a few steps, and cutting the ball into the center field. The ball's trajectory was low and rapid. Wenzhi had already been lying in wait, without any hesitation, he shot at the goal. Ma Guishi faced the red sun, his vision was unclear, and he could not rescue it in time, unexpectedly suffering a loss first. The creation of this goal was no more than five minutes from the start of the game, which can be described as extremely fast. Starting from the center circle again, the St. Joseph's team was not discouraged despite being ambushed, and tried their best to counterattack in order to wash away their shame. So they came and went, fighting hard. Zixiang monitored An'na, inevitably becoming lax, and the center was repeatedly broken through, turning the hinterland into a city full of storms, where every blade of grass seemed an enemy soldier. Soon after, An'na sent a long pass, Wodi flashed in, and vigorously kicked it in front of the goal. At that time, Guanghua's rear was empty, and only Guoqi was guarding it alone. The situation had become very dangerous. Many fans expected Guanghua to be unable to escape this calamity. Fortunately, Guoqi was aware of the situation and abandoned his position to rescue the danger, and at the moment of impact, he collided with the incoming ball, bouncing the ball back into the field, escaping the great disaster. This ball did not go in, which was truly St. Joseph's misfortune. After that, Guanghua dominated the advantage. Zhuo and Zou shot three times, but unfortunately they were too hasty and went over the bar, losing a sure victory. At the end of the first half, Guanghua was only ahead by a score of 1-0.

After changing sides, the battle became more intense. The St. Joseph's team, having failed to score, roused their spirits and charged forward bravely. Center forward Li An'na led the team himself, and attacked the Yellow Dragon like a broken bamboo. Guanghua's position was shaken and the situation was critical. Hou Zifen disregarded his own safety and used his back to block An'na's iron bullet, narrowly escaping death. Guanghua's dangerous situation was resolved, and the forwards launched another quick attack. Wenzhi with three knives and two axes, rushed straight at the opponent, Zhifen charged horizontally, trampling on the enemy camp. Xia Xian only looked after the left, and did not guard against Shijin's surprise attack, who came from behind to capture the treasure and send it into the net, scoring another goal. St. Joseph's, having lost two cities in a row, was not reconciled, and tried hard to chase, adding more land along the edge to cut in. Huilin intercepted, carelessly committing a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. Seruo sent the ball high in front of the goal, the landing point was beautiful, and Jin suddenly fired a cold arrow from the crowd, shooting it straight into the goal, Guoqi was too late to stop it, breaking their duck egg record. The two sides continued to struggle, with each side attacking and defending in the midfield melee. The St. Joseph's team once gained the upper hand, but their forward shooting skills were good at shooting aimlessly, and every opportunity was picked up by Guoqi. After a long time of attacking without success, the front line could not advance, and the rear became eventful. The hinterland was surrounded, and water could not pass through. Zhifen took advantage of the wonderful ball delivered by Jingcong and vigorously kicked it at the goal, but was blocked by Ma Guishi. Jin Shi's eyes were sharp and his feet were quick, adding another kick, hitting the bullseye again, making the score 3-1. After that, Guanghua's offensive became even stronger, and Shi's aura was awe-inspiring. De Rong was eager to save the ball, and collided with him face to face, injuring his hand tendons, groaning and leaving the field for treatment. He returned shortly after, and fought until the end of the game, without making any achievements. As a result, Guanghua won St. Joseph's by a score of 3-1. The lineups are as follows:

Guanghua

Li Guoqi, Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng, Huang Huaji, Yang Zixiang, Zhang Shuhui, Huang Jingcong, Zou Wenzhi, Zhuo Shijin, Qian Zhifen, Liang Bingjin

St. Joseph's

Ma Guishi, Sousa, Xia Xian, Paniella, Wu Derong, Si Ma Guishi, Ya Lieweishi, Jin Shi, Li An'na, Wodi, Jia Shidili

Li Wah Cup First Act: Western Civil Servants Eliminate Army Combined; No Exciting Results, 3-1

Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the Army Combined and the Western Civil Servants competed for the Li Wah Cup final spot at the Kowloon Club stadium. The Army Combined's center forward was originally scheduled to be Wenton from the Army Service Corps, but at the time, Piason was appointed instead. The rest was consistent with the original, with a very neat lineup. Everyone thought that the weak Western Civil Servants would be beaten beyond recognition. Unexpectedly, as a result of the battle, the Army was miserably eliminated by 1-3. The two-time champion was put on the stage. The Army's defeat lay in the scattered forwards, the incompetent center backs, and the left winger Corulu, who often made useless interceptions and repeatedly missed opportunities. Could it be that Corogan and Watson, who are scheduled to return home tomorrow on a British transport ship, performed poorly because their hearts were already set on returning home? And the small venue was also one of the reasons. The Western side's defense was good, and the individual strength matched the opponent. The ordinary Cololus was able to safely defeat the enemy. The forwards Liao Yachen and Fula, and Zuo Zhi performed the best. The Zuo brothers saw through Haoli's path, (Haoli is the Kowloon Club goalkeeper in this league), and avoided the heavy and took the light. Haoli was not disturbed by them. Fula's horizontal charge and straight attack, scoring two goals alone, was also a miracle. The great war broke out on time. The military took the offensive first, and the civil servants tried their best to fight back. At ten o'clock, Dipaluo crossed from the baseline. Fula, who was standing in front of the goal, jumped high to head the ball, but hurriedly missed it. Zuo Zhi's sweep went over the bar, and both missed the opportunity. At 12 minutes, Zuo Zhi took a long shot, the ball was not strong, but the angle was very good. Haoli did not dare to delay, and flew to push it out of bounds, only conceding a corner kick, which was ineffective. At 15 minutes, Corulu forced a corner kick, which was in vain. At 20 minutes, Liao Yachen made a diagonal shot, Haoli went to save it out of bounds, conceding another corner kick. Dipaluo took the kick, but there was still no effect. At 28 minutes, in the melee, Liao Yachen made a diagonal pick, and the ball flew into the net. Haoli could not save it, and the Westerners won first with a score of 1-0. At 34 minutes, Nov threw a sideline ball, Hou Lu passed it to Fula, Fula dribbled twice, then shot, and again scored (2-0). The whistle for half-time sounded.

Changing sides and fighting again, Corulu rebelled at the border defense, only got a corner kick, and returned without success. At 18 minutes, Watson left the field, and Guni _ defended the right flank, and Gan Wenbei rushed to the center. In the penalty area, he committed a foul and was penalized with a 12-yard free kick. Jia, the main player, fell to the wasteland diagonally, losing a sure-win opportunity. At 27 minutes, the military team launched a major counterattack, and the wind was howling, and the grass and trees were all soldiers. In the melee, Piason lifted his foot and swept it, and the ball went into the net (1-2), breaking the egg. After that, the military coalition's forwards were very sharp, and it seemed that they had the momentum to catch up with the draw, but in the last minute, Zuo Zhi passed it to Fula, and added another kick, winning another goal, eliminating the military coalition with a score of 3-1. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

### Army Combined

Haoli

Shi Han, Watson, Weijianbai, Bolodo, Yongli, _ Shi Dan, Corulu, Shu Shi, Piason, _ Ni, Corogan

Western Civil Servants

Cololus, Wulieqi, Pajia, Hanni Bolu, Beili Tu, Nov, Liao Yachen, Hou Lu, Fula, Zuo Zhi, Dipailuo

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment... Princess and Attendant

Baroness and the Buller

Originally a famous stage comedy, now adapted into a movie. The story itself has a strong comedic appeal, coupled with the energetic performance of the humorous star William Powell and Annabella, making this film an extremely excellent and successful work.

William Powell plays an attendant, the most capable servant in an earl's household, handling all household matters in an orderly manner. The entire earl's family is extremely satisfied with him. Unexpectedly, this attendant is secretly engaged in political activities and is elected as a member of parliament, standing on the opposite side of his master's party. In his profession, he is a loyal servant, but in politics, he delivers political speeches, relentlessly attacking his master. The earl is quite broad-minded and has some understanding of him, but the most unconvinced is the earl's daughter, a standard aristocratic lady (played by Annabella). In this situation of conflict and contradiction, a series of jokes ensue.

The film has wonderful dialogue, containing truth within humor and wit. William Powell's style remains unchanged, calm and composed, naturally eliciting laughter. Annabella, in this film, makes her first appearance in an American-made movie, and she also delivers an excellent performance.

Queen... Color Film Highlights

The pen-and-ink animation produced by Walt Disney is praised and welcomed by every audience. Especially after the success of his bold attempt with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," it has received great attention from general movie enthusiasts. A screening of "Color Film Highlights" selects and assembles his recent works, totaling ten reels. The film titles are listed below:

### "The Fox Hunt," "The Strange Parrot," "Livestock Symphony," "Playing Ball Jokes," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairy Tales," "The Whale Hunt," "Lucky Day," "The Non-Fighting Bull," "Giants' Tale"

The painting techniques, as well as the coordination of colors and tones, are all perfect. The stories are concise, lively, and full of rich interest. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations, among which "The Non-Fighting Bull," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairy Tales," and "Giants' Tale" are particularly outstanding.

Safety... Modern Female Detective

The Mad Manton

A film that combines romance and mysterious murder cases, presented in a humorous and crazy style. Barbara Stanwyck plays a completely ruined socialite who accidentally discovers a corpse, reports it to the police, but by the time the detectives arrive, the corpse has been moved away by the murderer. Because of her usual behavior, people think she made up a lie to show off. This is clearly a false accusation against her. What she can't stand even more is that a young editor (Henry Fonda) satirizes her in the newspaper. So, she gathers a group of sisters and starts detective work. After discovering a second corpse, people sympathize with and believe her, especially the young editor, who helps her greatly. At that time, the murderer wants to kill her to silence her, but thanks to the police detectives encircling and annihilating the murderer, she is spared. The plot in the film lacks some possibility, but due to the excellent performances of the actors, the development of the story is natural and relaxed. The arrangement of the murder case is quite tortuous, but it does not occupy an important position in the film, because what makes this film captivating is not a tense and serious detective story, but a rich comedic interest.

East... Singing and Dancing Together

Everybody Sing

Starring Judy Garland, her singing voice, although not as moving as Deanna Durbin's, is still an extremely outstanding talent among newcomers. The family portrayed is drama-crazed, so everything is focused on comedy and song and dance. It is a typical Hollywood song and dance film in color. She not only sings well, but also has good expressions. Allan Jones is not as outstanding as he was in "A Day at the Races."

Great China... Adventures of a Boy

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer

It is a very excellent literary film, adapted from Mark Twain's masterpiece. Although the entire film is very long, the director handles it well. The light and lively script makes us not feel bored. A part of it is due to the excellent performance of a group of child actors, especially the two main characters. Mildred Natwick, who plays the aunt, also performs very well. The color production further increases the value of this film.

Scenic Star... Go West

Way Out West

New World... A True Romantic

Starring Xu Li and Kuang Shanxiao

Central... Pearl Shirt

It hasn't been long since the death of Hollywood's Charlie Chan, and already a "Frozen Charlie" has been produced in the Chinese film industry. This speculative tactic does not require spending on publicity and can reap the benefits of the name. The cleverness of Chinese filmmakers can be seen from this. However, the script of this film failed to do its best, and at the same time, each tense scene also failed to be fully developed. The description of the behavior and actions of bandits is more of a failure than a success. The distribution of actors is also not very suitable. Apart from Liu Qiong, who has considerable achievements, Gu Lan Jun and Hong Jingling don't have much to do. Xu Xinyuan's Charlie Chan's facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of his actions is still not up to par.

Puqing... Stage Play

Chinese Art Troupe

Daytime Performance... The Government Inspector

Evening Performance... Thunderstorm

Taiping... Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Troupe

Daytime Performance... Thief Family

Evening Performance... Perfumed Chamber Hero

Gaolu... Cantonese Opera

### A "Thorough" Question

— Jing Cheng

Recently, I saw a Trotskyist propaganda publication. They actually consider themselves the most thorough in resisting Japan. In their descriptions, it seems that the National Government has not fought a single round with Japanese imperialism in the past eighteen months. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are constantly preparing to surrender. As for the Communist Party, they only use all their strength to attack their group of "Trotskyist bandits" and do not resist Japan. The only ones who truly "thoroughly" resist Japan are this group of "Trotskyist bandits," and their current main course of action is to "wage an irreconcilable struggle against the repressive policies of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party."

This is the new task of this group of shameless bandits under the new political situation. From this, we can fully prove their new conspiracy and their two-faced nature. This true face is that they are now using the name of "thoroughly resisting Japan" to conduct "irreconcilable struggles" against the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the national war of resistance government, the army, and the people.

However, just now, let us grab this fox's tail and knock their mouths awry. This is the easiest to do. We only need to raise such questions and ask these shameless fellows to answer:

First, in the past eighteen months, the army under the leadership of the National Government has launched a battlefield stretching thousands of miles and countless people fighting bloody battles. More than ten million soldiers and armed civilians have directly participated in the war, killing and wounding over 700,000 Japanese soldiers, and depleting one-third of Japan's national strength. Which of these tasks were done by the Trotskyists? If they did not participate, then they fundamentally did not participate in the resistance against Japan, let alone thoroughly resist Japan.

Second, in the past eighteen months, hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members have been working behind enemy lines. They have organized hundreds of thousands of people's anti-Japanese armed forces. In the enemy's rear, they have established anti-Japanese base areas and anti-Japanese regimes. Speaking only of the Eighth Route Army, in the past year alone, it has seized 9,100 Japanese rifles, destroyed 120 Japanese planes, and killed, wounded, and captured countless Japanese soldiers. Now, it has sent two brigades to advance into the territory of the puppet Manchurian state. In the Northeast, Communist Party members such as Yang Jingyu and Zhao Shangzhi have organized hundreds of thousands of people's anti-Japanese armed forces and have been fighting hard in the Japanese-occupied areas for eight years. Which of all these tasks can the Trotskyists do? If they cannot, then they cannot resist Japan, let alone resist Japan more thoroughly than the Communist Party.

Third, since the Trotskyists want to thoroughly resist Japan, and at the same time say that the enemy's strength is great, and we need to increase our strength by thousands of times to win, yet they want to first "wage an irreconcilable struggle" against the two largest political parties with millions of members, and oppose the establishment of an anti-Japanese national united front, may I ask what strength the Trotskyists rely on to wage a "thorough" war of resistance against the enemy? The enemy has invaded most of our territory for eighteen months, and in the future, there will be more intense and cruel battles. In such a critical time of survival, will the Japanese stop their general offensive and let these Trotskyist masters eliminate the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and then come to "thoroughly resist Japan"?

Fourth, since the Trotskyists boast that they are the most "thorough" in resisting Japan, then is it that their party members participating in the Japanese army's special operations team in Xuzhou and plotting riots in Guangxi are considered their "thorough" expressions of anti-Japanese action? If these are their thorough anti-Japanese actions, then the Chinese people, based on their eighteen months of anti-war experience, know how to put out these traitors and are fully confident in putting out any activities of these traitors.

Now, anyone can see the conspiracy of these shameless bandits, right? They attempt to lead people away from the true path of thoroughly resisting Japan—the anti-Japanese national united front—and follow their fake "thorough" path of resisting Japan, which is to dismantle the anti-Japanese front—the traitor's path. This is the Japanese imperialists' political disintegration plan, and the Japanese are using the Chinese to control the Chinese. Whoever cannot see that these are spies directed by the Japanese is a fool.

Perhaps some people think it is strange that these good-for-nothings also put up the banner of resisting Japan, but in fact, this is precisely the characteristic of all spies. Look, wasn't Wang Jingwei, who advocated peace, the one who used to talk about resisting until the end and sacrificing everything? Trotskyist bandits are especially good at playing this trick.

### Delayed Around Xingdian Temple

— Tang Xiru

The day before yesterday, it rained. On the red clay road, the low-lying areas were still patches of mud, but the high side, blown by the northwest wind, was frozen harder than rocks—the iron-rimmed wheels of the wheelbarrow were constantly jumping on this uneven road, full of ruts. Although I was not used to riding this kind of cart and my butt kept sliding down, listening to the monotonous hiss of the wheels on the mountain road and looking at the withered grass and red leaves everywhere (with a few white clouds drifting overhead), my heart couldn't help but relax. The soldiers stretching for miles, the crowds of fleeing refugees, the speeding trains, the crowded ferries, seemed to be things that happened a long, long time ago, and their authenticity was highly questionable.

A woodcutter was chopping firewood on the mountain. A country lady, sitting sideways on a donkey with copper bells hanging around its neck, came loudly, then walked away. If it weren't for the fact that my ears could still clearly hear the dull sound of Japanese planes bombing the capital, I would really suspect that I had just had a nightmare.

It was noon on the third day when I arrived at Xingdian Temple, surrounded by mountains. There was a market going on there. People selling mountain goods, selling New Year's goods, Lantern Festival vendors, vermicelli vendors, horses tied to trees, donkeys, it was so lively. Could it be that the smell of gunpowder and the sound of bombing were really blocked by the surrounding high mountains? The local people were so happy, quiet, and unconcerned.

After dinner, many strong villagers ran into Hanwu's house, listening to news of the war outside while asking how the "matter" was being prepared. They still had a indifferent expression, not even raising their eyebrows much.

It was only after they left that Hanwu told me that Xingdian Temple was even more "annoying" than Nanjing. If the Japanese occupied Pukou and Chuxian, Xingdian Temple would be completely under blockade. At the same time, bandits who hadn't dared to show their faces for more than ten years were now daring to discuss collecting weapons in tea houses. So, outside of Xingdian Temple were the Japanese, and inside there was the threat of bandits.

He then smiled, as if to comfort me, and told me that he had organized a guerrilla team of several hundred people. He and a cousin were both instructors at the Central Military Academy, so they had no problem with training and combat. Their first step was to eliminate the bandits and then annihilate small groups of intruding Japanese soldiers. I only stayed in Xingdian Temple for three short days, but the situation became increasingly serious. Enemy planes were bombing Nanjing and Pukou every day. Moreover, the sound of artillery could already be heard. So, I took my wife out of the mountains for the second time and embarked on the Jinpu Line, preparing to go to Guangdong.

The red clay road was no longer deserted. People from Pukou, from Nanjing, carrying chests, carrying bundles, riding donkeys, riding carts, walking, old people, women, children, shouting, clamoring, crying, formed an indescribable torrent of grief. This torrent was rushing towards Xingdian Temple.

Outside the city of Jiangpu County, we got off the bus and ate a few bowls of sweet dumplings. The old man selling dumplings told me:

"In this year, it's better to die than to live and suffer! When you die, your eyes are closed and you don't know anything, but when you live, you have to suffer. Yesterday, six or seven children fell on the road here, crying so miserably. There are even more today. Why do you say we should avoid the Japanese devils? It would be good if they came to fight! Wasn't it impossible to find them before? Living is to suffer, to be angry, and when you die, you have nothing, so why not fight?"

When I gave him the coins, he was still shaking his head.

It has been more than a year since I left Xingdian Temple. Recently, I received a letter from Hanwu, informing me that his plan has gradually been realized. The bandits were wiped out within a few months, and several small groups of Japanese soldiers have been annihilated. The guerrilla team has expanded to four or five thousand people. So far, no one has officially entered the city of Jiangpu County. He has been supported by the people of Jiangpu as the county magistrate since the fall of Pukou (formally appointed by General Li Zongren before the Battle of Huaihai), and it has been almost a year now.

I thought of that mountain city, that group of resolute mountain people. Although I didn't stay long in Xingdian Temple, their spirit of fearlessness is enough for me to remember and learn from for the rest of my life.

### Sea Breeze Song

— Luo Xi

The sea is surging, the wind is howling. On the shore and mountainside, the blood of fishermen has dyed the vast blue sea and the green weeds red.

The sea is the home of fishermen, and fishing is the life of fishermen; for thousands of generations, no one would leave the beautiful fishing village, this fish-rich harbor.

Huge battleships floated from the horizon, dyeing the blood of fishermen a bright red.

Whoever dares to go to sea will not be able to return; whoever dares to go home will die under the knife: the chests and necks of the fishermen are blooming with red flowers every day.

What kind of world is this!

People outside the knife's edge dare not go to sea, dare not go home. In the remote wilderness, people roar, people clamor:

"We want to go home, we want a harbor, we cannot starve to death in the wilderness!"

"Since we are going to die anyway, let's fight him!"

So, the men picked up fishing spears, and the women picked up stones: for the fishing village, for the harbor, the fishermen are no longer afraid.

The sea is surging, the wind is howling, blood and blood are swirling, flesh and flesh are fighting, in the fishing village, at the head of the bay.

### And Speaking of "Home"

— Guo Nidi

Another year has begun, and there should be a new atmosphere in the literary world as usual. We have already seen articles such as "New Year's Writing" and "Welcoming the Republic Year XX." We have also seen many articles about "regretting the past" and "hoping for the future." Although they are similar to "embellishments," they are also in line with human nature: as long as they don't "beautify peace," that can also reduce a little "shameful" psychology.

Since I was a child, my concept of festivals has been pitifully weak. When I was older, I simply forgot about them completely, but this year I can't help but have some feelings. I think the first thing is probably related to the War of Resistance. And what I want to say is not some major party and national affairs, but something very small, a personal problem, that is, "home." When the Northeast fell, I was still a small chick sheltered under the maternal wings of "home." After listening to the teachers' beautiful reports at school, saying that countless compatriots there were displaced and suffered the disaster of being without "home," my fragile heart couldn't help but feel miserable. Who knew that since last year, I have also encountered the same "fate of having a home but being unable to return." Although I don't have to sleep on the streets now, and the place I live in has a roof above my head, my status is that of a freeloader. However, the one being freeloaded off is not some Lord Mengchang or the like, but a relative who is not a high-ranking official. Therefore, there is no help to be offered, and I should be idle enough. Indeed, there is idleness, but it is "enough" to be panicky. Children quarrel in groups, and the radio plays all day long, making it impossible to read and write freely. In addition to feeling emotional, I can't help but think of "home." However, please see: "Our mountain forest was burned down by Japanese soldiers this spring. Fourth brother and sixth brother's mountain forest, along with all the mountain forests near the village, were burned down. The reason is to prevent bandits from hiding in the summer. The villagers are all complaining. Where will we get firewood next spring?"

Indeed, where will we get it? The above is just a snapshot of a corner of the Northeast, from which we can also know one aspect of the Japanese army's virtuous governance. Although my hometown does not have mountain forests or nurseries, it does have quite a few chickens, ducks, and livestock. The newspapers a few months ago published a message about the Japanese army's wonderful method of catching chickens. Under their tyrannical power, even livestock are not at peace, let alone people?

Of course, there are many other virtuous policies. Shooting and beheading are their consistent practices, and I'm tired of hearing about them. However, I can't help but feel ashamed and live in peace on the prosperous foreign concessions, having the leisure to read some lewd entertainment texts. My happiness is not high enough.

But when I think of "home," I can't help but feel guilty.

### Marching Notes

— Li Huiying

The more we talked, the more intimate we became. Even the situations of the battles between the two armies were revealed. I felt like I was in a myth, listening with vivid details. From this, we became new acquaintances and established friendship with each other.

Today, when he saw me, he acted like an old friend, asking questions about this and that. Then he said:

"The team was stationed so well, why is it moving out?"

"This is the order."

"Probably things are tight on that side."

"That's probably true."

"I hope you win every battle and succeed immediately!" He excitedly picked up a cup of tea. "Come, Comrade Li, have a drink!"

"Thank you, we'll see each other on the battlefield in the future." I couldn't talk to him too much, because I was too far away from the team, and I wouldn't be able to catch up. I said goodbye to him.

"Good! One day, you can see me ambushing and killing the little devils in the mountains around here! I won't keep you! Goodbye!"

Ancient Tomb Village—what a special name! The people of Ancient Tomb Village, how can people forget them!

It was a cloudy day, and a cool wind was blowing everywhere. This was the best day for marching, because if the sun came out, people would feel uncomfortable all over, and hot sweat would flow from their bodies and wet their clothes. When I got to the highway, I still couldn't catch up with the shadow of the main force. The short conversation delayed the journey quite a bit. "Walking is not afraid of being slow, but afraid of stopping. Stop for a while, and it's two and a half miles." This is absolutely true.

I didn't want to chase anymore; anyway, the team would rest at Linshan River after having lunch. There were always some soldiers coming and going on the highway, some with crutches, some limping, covered in a layer of dirt. There were very few cars, just like the common people on the road, you wouldn't see one for half a day.

This section of the highway was in terrible condition in some places. Some gathered people were doing repair work. The supervisor should be the Baojia head, sitting on the side so leisurely.

On the dilapidated temples, on the walls, on the bridges and tree trunks, there was no lack of red, white, and blue slogans everywhere. Everywhere were the same words. Who says this is not a good phenomenon? Slogans have penetrated into the people. But whether the people understand, I don't know.

It just so happened that on the wall of a house, the political department of the XX division had written a slogan of "Military-Civilian Cooperation" in large characters, but the house was empty with no one in it. The tables, chairs, and benches were still neatly placed there. What kind of feelings do the slogan and the house reflect with each other... (To be continued)
