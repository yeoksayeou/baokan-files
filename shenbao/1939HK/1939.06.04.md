### Vocational Youth and Remedial Education

Humans have an innate desire, and that is the desire for knowledge. A babbling infant constantly asking this and that of their mother is one expression of this pursuit of knowledge. We know that humans are the animals with the most desires. The advancement of humanity and the civilization of the world are precisely because of this desire, and the desire for knowledge is the primary driving force for human progress. The desire for knowledge is universally and equally possessed by everyone. The ancients said that intelligence, foolishness, and wisdom were predetermined at birth, but now I know that this is an unreasonable notion from an old era. Due to unequal educational opportunities, most people do not receive education, so most people become "unintelligent." Indeed, intelligence has a natural disposition, but if everyone's desire for knowledge could be satisfied, I think many social problems could also be reduced.

Today, our vast number of vocational youth need education and knowledge, which is a manifestation of the unmet desire for knowledge. We know that vocational youth, as the name implies, are young people who have left the school and entered society. Their need for education is clearly for two reasons: first, they did not receive a good education before employment, and second, after employment, many new problems arise in the environment that cannot be resolved. The emergence of vocational remedial education is not accidental, but precisely to adapt to this objective need.

Speaking of remedial education, one must first talk about past education. The shortcomings of traditional education are that whenever education is mentioned, a very proper-looking school and students come to mind, specializing in studying, creating a large number of so-called specialized scholars. These schools cannot be universally established, nor can they accommodate a large number of students. Many people who seek education are shut out of the gates of these "schools." Therefore, enlightened people loudly appealed, saying that education is not for the enjoyment of a few, but should be universally applied to the people of the whole country. Because of this trend of socialized education, they also strive to realize a democratic political system. Because we know that in modern countries such as Europe and the United States, the popularization of compulsory education, the development of social education, and the widespread establishment of remedial education are all closely related to democratic politics. Now we want to talk about the main topic of remedial education. Remedial education has four advantages, which can also be said to be effects:

First, it is flexible and cost-effective. Remedial schools are not as rigid and mechanical as formal schools. Whether in terms of curriculum, equipment, or training, they can be used flexibly. Under the principle of adapting to student needs, the content and methods can be changed at any time, so that there is no problem of learning being inapplicable. As for the costs of both the school and the students, it goes without saying that they can certainly be saved a lot.

Second, it does not consider level or qualifications. Ordinary schools always have a grade system. From the first book to the second book, one should enter a certain grade, and it is impossible to skip grades, and it is also difficult to transfer classes. Remedial schools, on the other hand, do not consider level. You can learn whatever you want to learn, regardless of qualifications, only asking about ability.

Third, doing and learning are integrated. What is learned today can be applied tomorrow. When problems arise in practice, you can learn on the spot. Learn a little, use a little; use a little, then learn some more. Vocation and learning are combined into one.

Fourth, learning and life are integrated. The entire life and learning are integrated into one. Use what you learn to improve your life, and strengthen learning from life. Learn a little, gain a little, so-called "learn to understand life."

We believe that the benefit of remedial education lies in this: it does not waste time or money, and at the same time, it does not create bookworms. Although we dare not say it is perfect, it can be considered specialized and refined.

I have always had a feeling that the most noble and valuable people in the world are the vocational youth who are constantly learning and working hard at the same time. People who are constantly learning will not fall behind or become decadent; people who are constantly learning can increase work efficiency. The country's undertakings all rely on this kind of person. We must never underestimate ourselves as a small vocational youth. You must know that a former British Minister of Commerce had never attended a formal school, but came from a remedial school. There are eighty-year-olds in remedial schools in the United States!

Since remedial education can have such universal, social, equal, and practical advantages, and at a time when a large number of talents are needed in the current process of resisting aggression and building the country, how can we not actively promote it? We hope that there are more and bigger remedial schools, but the responsibility for promoting them should be borne by all parties.

First, we hope that government leaders will take the lead in promoting it; second, we hope that people from all walks of life will help; third, we also rely on the self-creation and efforts of vocational youth! As for the methods and implementation steps of remedial education, this short article cannot fully describe them, and they will be discussed in another article later.

### World Trends in a Week: May 8 to June 3, 1939

As the month turns, the world situation has also undergone many changes.

The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, which initiated the anti-aggression front, are still proceeding tortuously, while the aggressors such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, especially Japan ××, have become even more restless. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a sensational diplomatic speech at this time, warning Japan ×, advising Britain and France, and supporting China, which will have a major impact on the future world situation; it is something we cannot lightly overlook.

The War of Resistance Against Japan has recently achieved major victories in Hubei, Hunan, and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. From an overall perspective, the war situation has indeed gradually entered a stalemate. Precisely because the war situation is becoming more and more favorable to us, the international aid-to-China movement is also progressing day by day; and precisely because the war situation is becoming more and more favorable to us, Japanese × traitors have again taken aggressive steps, using various methods to undermine our unity. The activities of Wang Jingwei and others cannot be lightly overlooked!

The Mutual Assistance Negotiations Between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union

Are Still Progressing Tortuously

If the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can sincerely unite and help each other, then the two countries of Germany and Italy in Europe will naturally be afraid and dare not wantonly invade, and even the robber Japan in the Far East will not dare to run rampant and kill and plunder. However, the power of Britain and France is in the hands of financial capitalists. They are currently aware of the serious crisis, and although they have to unite with the Soviet Union to strengthen their momentum, they are also afraid that the prestige of the Soviet Union will be excessively promoted, threatening their class interests. Therefore, the mutual assistance negotiations with the Soviet Union have been tortuous for two months, without being frank and enthusiastic. The joint agreement proposed by Britain and France last week contains many rifts. In this way, there is no harm to the Soviet Union, which has nothing to ask of others, but it is extremely dangerous for the anti-aggression movement and Britain and France themselves. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a diplomatic report on May 31 in the Soviet Parliament, in addition to severely attacking the three aggressors of Germany, Italy, and Japan, solemnly declared: "The Soviet Union thoroughly advocates uniting all peace-loving countries to jointly resist aggression. But the Soviet Union will never allow others to use it to take chestnuts from the fire!" In this way, on the one hand, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is enthusiastic about organizing an anti-aggression front to maintain collective security, and on the other hand, it points out the British and French scheme of using "negotiations with the Soviet Union" to externally lure Germany to invade the Soviet Union to internally appease the anti-government sentiment, pointing out that this scheme will only mislead themselves. The British report can greatly remind Britain and France. Since June 1, the British and Soviet diplomatic authorities have continued to discuss the agreement issue, and it is expected that the future situation will be more progressive than the past tortuous progress. Because the progressive parties and the broad masses of the people in Britain and France have further pushed their governments to move forward on the road of sincere cooperation with the Soviet Union.

Japanese Puppet Troops Invade Outer Mongolia

The Soviet Authorities Loudly Warn

The Japanese aggressors in the Far East ××, in order to divert attention and cover up their major defeats in central Hubei and northern China last week; in order to alleviate internal strife and anti-war anger; in order to please Germany and Italy and closely coordinate the aggressors; in order to confuse Britain and France and extend the anti-aggression front to the Far East; and even more to emphasize anti-communism in order to help the traitors alienate and incite some stubborn and narrow-minded elements in our anti-war front, and to help the traitors strengthen the puppet organizations in the occupied areas; in order to realize this attempt, Japan × deployed military actions to provoke Outer Mongolia in late May. By the end of May and early June, on the one hand, they spread rumors that the Outer Mongolian Red Army was attacking Manchuria, and on the other hand, they boasted that they had shot down a large number of Soviet planes and repelled Outer Mongolian troops, and the Japanese puppet troops advanced into Outer Mongolia.

The Soviet authorities naturally do not allow Japan × to do evil like this—Foreign Minister Molotov, in his speech in Parliament on the 31st, loudly warned Japan ×, saying: "The Soviet Union will never allow Japanese puppet troops to make any provocations on the border; according to the Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Agreement, we must do our best to protect the Outer Mongolian border, just like the Soviet border! This is our sacred act. If the Japanese puppets know what is good for them, they should quickly stop the provocations, because our patience is limited! We have issued a warning to the Japanese ambassador in Moscow!" We believe that this provocation by Japan ×, in addition to further enhancing the world's credibility in the Soviet Union's adherence to agreements and assistance to aggressors and its national defense strength, even if Japan × is still shameless enough to provoke twice or three times, the result will only be Japan ×'s repeated disgrace and aggravation of its internal and external crises!

Unprecedented Great Victory in Hubei Province

The Collapse of the × Army in Jin-Cha-Ji

Recently, China's War of Resistance Against Japan has presented a lively and victorious atmosphere in all aspects. Especially important are the following: First, in the Hubei area: We have crushed the Japanese ×'s "May Offensive." In early May, the × people originally wanted to divide into three routes from southern Henan, northern Hubei, and central Hubei to "encircle and annihilate" our "twenty-odd divisions" of troops in the Dahongshan area, but after we implemented a new strategy of mobile warfare targeting the weaknesses of the × army and utilizing the advantages of the terrain, by the end of May, we not only broke the × army's encirclement, but also caused the × army to suffer two or three thousand casualties, driving the × army to retreat four or five hundred miles. Our army not only recovered Xinye, Tanghe, Yang, but also crossed the Xiang River to counterattack, recovering Yuekou, Zaoshi, and Lishan in eastern Hubei (see the editorial of this newspaper on June 1 for details). This battle was the first major victory since Taierzhuang, and the embarrassing retreat of the × army was unprecedented since the start of the war. Second, in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, a large number of troops were successively drawn from the front lines to invade our anti-Japanese base area in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. The fighting started on the 7th, and a total of more than thirty consecutive bloody battles have been fought, and the × who invaded from Wutai, Dongye, and Dongfan, from Daying and Shahe to the south, and from Dingyi and Erxian to the west have been defeated one by one, killing more than a thousand × and capturing even more. In addition, in the past week, our army in central Hubei has taken advantage of the victory to counterattack and has encircled Zhongxiang. The × army in northern Hunan was defeated on the 28th after dividing into four routes to attack the north bank of Xinjiang and Hebei in late May, with more than two thousand casualties. In southern China, the × army has been bombing Shaoguan and other places in northern Guangdong for days since the 27th, and the Pearl River Delta and Hainan Island × have also made many attempts to stir up trouble, but most of them have lost the power to launch large-scale attacks. Our army has repeatedly won small victories in Conghua, Huaxian, Dongguan, Baoan, Heshan, and Xinhui. Looking at the overall situation of the War of Resistance, the × army is increasingly retreating and defending due to insufficient troops, difficult transportation, demoralization, and the development of our army's battle behind the × army. Although the × army still has residual power in northern Hunan today and even in northern Guangdong in the future and can launch larger offensives, its purpose is only to consolidate the borders of the occupied areas east of the Ping-Han and Yue-Han lines, and to cover up its suppression of the anti-Japanese guerrillas and base areas in various areas. Therefore, our military task today is to intensify the strengthening of the combat effectiveness of the front line and develop guerrilla warfare behind the × to break the ×'s military plan.

The Soviet Union is Actively Assisting China

Britain, the United States, and France are Unwilling to Lag Behind

Due to the Chinese people and government's persistence in unity and resistance, not only has the × army begun to retreat and collapse on all battlefields, but also the aid-to-China movement of various friendly countries has been promoted day by day. First of all, on the Soviet side, Foreign Minister Molotov announced in Parliament on May 31: "You all know that Stalin's statement on assisting the invaded countries fighting for independence can be fully applied to China, which is fighting for national independence. The Soviet Union has been continuously implementing this policy in practice, and it is fully in line with the principle of working hard to organize a unified anti-aggression front of peaceful countries in Europe." Secondly, on the international front, two resolutions on the Sino-Japanese incident were passed on the 27th. The first resolution mainly clearly accused Japan of being an aggressor, expressed the international community's deep sympathy for China's heroic resistance for independence and territorial integrity and the suffering of the Chinese people due to Japanese aggression; and advocated that member states should take appropriate measures to assist China, provide relief to Chinese refugees, and other aid-to-China measures. The second resolution mainly condemned Japan's bombing of undefended Chinese cities, and expressed concern about the suggestions made by our country to send personnel from the League of Nations to China for investigation and to ask various countries to ban the supply of airplanes to Japan. These are certainly not enough to satisfy us, but we can promote the aid-to-China and sanctions-against-Japan movement in various countries based on these principles and the applications reserved by our representatives. In addition, Britain, the United States, and France are also unwilling to lag behind. The main points are: (1) Our country has established a Trade Commission in the UK to promote Sino-British business relations and find ways to promote the sale of our country's products. (2) On the US side, it has recently reiterated that it will never stand idly by on the Far East issue. In the past week, Japan × has continued to invade the various concessions and continue to blockade the coast, while also threatening the United States. Now the US ambassador to China has come to Chongqing to pay a visit to our authorities, hoping to further achieve success in the Far East anti-aggression movement and Sino-US friendly cooperation. (3) The French aid-to-China movement is also progressing, such as the Anti-Aggression Branch held the International Conference for the Defense of Democracy in Paris in May, passing a strong resolution to aid China. All circles in Paris held a rally to aid China on June 2 to promote the aid-to-China movement.

The × Government Writes Its Own Evil

Wang Jingwei is Deserted by All

Finally, we must also pay attention to two things. The first is that the internal and external crises and difficulties of Japan × have developed in the past week. The most obvious example is that Japan's financial difficulties and the excessive issuance of banknotes have caused malignant inflation. The price of the Japanese yen has plummeted rapidly. The price of was said to have fallen to eight jiao and eight fen of our legal tender per Japanese yen—according to financial circles, the price of the Japanese yen will inevitably go downhill in the future and cannot be saved. The second is that Wang Jingwei is falling into a dead end. According to various dispatches, confidants of Wang Jingwei, such as Chen Gongbo, have recently had disagreements with Wang. Wang's ××××, even ran to Shanghai and Nanjing to Japan. His opposition by the masses and the desertion of his confidants were not accidental. However, we must point out here that precisely because the internal and external crises and difficulties of Japan × are becoming increasingly serious, Japan × will inevitably intensify its political offensive against us in the future, on the one hand, opening up an anti-communist movement to intensify the alienation of our internal unity, and on the other hand, supporting the traitorous regime and uniting the corrupt, stubborn, wavering, and counter-revolutionary elements to strengthen its rule, exploitation, and plunder in the occupied areas. At the same time, precisely because Japan × urgently wants to carry out this political offensive, it will inevitably use Wang Jingwei and others as puppets, road clearers, and executioners. Vice Chairman Feng Yuxiang said it right at the joint memorial week of the Central National Government in Chongqing on May 29. He said, "Wang is falling step by step into a tool to be played with by × chieftains, and now it is completely clear. This is like a piece of rotten flesh on a person's body. We should dig it out without hesitation so that new muscle can grow." Yes, we want everyone to work hard to assist the government.

### The Tasks of Youth in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction (Part 1)

— Special Correspondence from Xi'an

What is our unity for? It is for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The work of War of Resistance and National Reconstruction needs us in all aspects. The army needs us, the government needs us, and the broad masses of the people need us. Various agencies and groups all need young people to go to work. Various provinces have organized wartime youth work groups. Everyone needs young people because young people are pure, enthusiastic, and full of vigor, and are the pioneers of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.

The first task of young people in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is in the military aspect.

Our young people are the main force of the anti-Japanese army. Many of the troops fighting on the front lines have more than half of them being young people. To build a new army and realize a new military system, we cannot but rely on the efforts of our young people. We should not only participate in the army ourselves, but also work hard to assist the government in carrying out mobilization work among the broad masses of young people.

There are many serious malpractices in the current mobilization work. In many places, corrupt officials use the mobilization of able-bodied men to make money; in many places, people who do not understand the truth use many inhumane methods to deal with conscripted able-bodied men. This adds to our responsibility. We should use all methods to carry out propaganda work, creating a enthusiastic tide in the military movement, making the broad masses of young people voluntarily join the army, and regarding joining the army as the highest honor. For the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, we should use all methods to implement preferential treatment; for the phenomenon of desertion, we should use return work to eliminate it. Only by coordinating the work of mobilizing voluntary joining the army, treating the families of anti-Japanese soldiers preferentially, and returning to the team can we achieve the goal of enabling the broad masses of young people to participate in the army.

The widespread establishment of youth semi-military organizations has a very important relationship to the mobilization work of youth. To realize the compulsory military service system, we must go through this process. The youth semi-military organization is not only the best assistant to the compulsory military service system, but also the best assistant to the anti-Japanese army and the best assistant to consolidating the anti-Japanese rear. Because this kind of semi-military organization is of an armed self-defense nature, the work is mainly to stand guard, stand sentry, enforce martial law, and eliminate traitors. Any old-fashioned weapons, such as broadswords, anchors, and earthen guns, can be used, so it is relatively difficult to start. The places with the best results in youth mobilization work now, such as Shanxi, Guangxi, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, and the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, have achieved success mainly by relying on the help of organizations such as the militia self-defense team, women's self-defense army, youth anti-Japanese vanguard team, young pioneers, and children's corps.

Young people in the army are often the basic driving force of the army's political work. Young soldiers play a very important role in consolidating the troops, opposing desertion, opposing wine, women, wealth, and anger, and destroying discipline, in improving the quality, reputation, and combat effectiveness of the troops, in mass work, especially in linking up with the local youth movement, and in disintegrating and winning over the puppet army. Learning is also an important task for young soldiers. The young soldiers of the rear guard regiment of the ×× army in the ×××× district once learned the skills of workers, farmers, merchants, and soldiers in a short period of time. They learned to knit shoes, socks, and gloves, make tables and chairs, build houses, chop firewood, burn charcoal, cook, and make tofu, which is work; they learned to reclaim land, grow millet, vegetables, raise cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens. When necessary, they can not eat public meals, which is agriculture; they learned to run cooperatives, do various small sales, and learned to keep accounts and calculate, which is commerce; they learned to read, read newspapers, write newspapers, sing, act, and play ball, which is learning; and finally, they were originally soldiers. This is another kind of great unity of workers, farmers, merchants, and soldiers, and this is our model for young people.

In addition to directly joining the army, young people can also do various kinds of work to serve the army. There are generally two aspects to military service: on the one hand, assisting the army's internal education, entertainment, and political work, and on the other hand, strengthening the relationship between the army and the people. Strengthening the relationship between the army and the people is very important for the army's operations. Many armies welcome youth work groups to go to the battlefield to mobilize the people and organize various kinds of stretcher teams, guide teams, communications teams, mine-clearing teams, singing teams, laundry teams, and comfort teams to help the army solve the problems of food, accommodation, and transportation at any time and any place.

Whether the relationship between the army and the people can be harmonious depends on whether the two sides can understand each other. Our task is to promote their mutual understanding. We certainly want the army to improve its traditional attitude towards the people, and at the same time, we must make the people know that today's army is their own army. Once, the troops stationed in a certain place in Henan had very bad discipline. Our young people launched the people to comfort them in various ways, so that the troops felt very ashamed and were no longer embarrassed to harass the people.

The second task of young people in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is in the political and social aspects.

Young people should actively participate in administrative organs at all levels, participate in various anti-Japanese national salvation and various anti-Japanese national salvation organizations. Perhaps their institutions and work cannot satisfy us, then we must be more determined and patient to improve their unsound places and enrich their unfulfilled places.

We must greatly strengthen our propaganda work, produce various kinds of literacy education, expand production, rescue wounded soldiers, cultivate and harvest wheat for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, write letters for illiterate people, investigate opium, investigate Japanese goods, and run cooperatives. These tasks are all directly or indirectly beneficial to the War of Resistance and are urgently needed by the masses. We must pay close attention to the propaganda of small pamphlets on the theory of the War of Resistance, the theory of the united front, and various common sense of social sciences. We must pay close attention to international propaganda and propaganda to the puppet army; everyone should learn to use Japanese and Japanese to incite Japanese soldiers to oppose the war.

### Fierce Battles Unfold on Both Sides of the Xiang River; Attempted Crossing at Yuekou Under Encirclement; Our Army Reinforces Continuously, Controlling the Overall Situation

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Chinese sources report that Japanese troops, after forcibly crossing the Xiang River at Qianjiang yesterday, have been surrounded by Chinese forces. The Chinese army is continuing to send reinforcements, and it is believed that the Japanese vanguard can be completely annihilated.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Chinese sources report that Japanese troops have forcibly crossed the Xiang River south of Yuekou and west of Qianjiang, but are already surrounded by Chinese forces.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Foreign military experts claim that the Chinese side has a large army stationed in Qianjiang and along the Hanyi Highway. Although the Japanese troops were able to cross the Xiang River this time, it is believed that the Chinese side, with rapid reinforcements, has the possibility of resolving the situation and preventing the Japanese from encroaching on Yichang. The number of Japanese troops crossing the river is currently unknown, but the Chinese side claims they are being eliminated.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Chinese sources report that Japanese troops in North China are currently building bridges and roads on the Yellow River within the territory of Baotou and Suiyuan in order to facilitate the crossing of military vehicles. This action is intended as preparation for invading southern Shanxi and Shaanxi. However, the mountains and hills in the two Shaanxi provinces are rugged, and any Japanese attempt will be difficult to achieve.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd] About two hundred bandits on foot and horseback harassed Xifeng Temple on the afternoon of the 31st. They were attacked from both sides by our forces. Fierce fighting continued until evening, when they retreated towards Bo'ai. In this battle, one hundred and twenty to thirty bandits were killed or wounded.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to front-line news, since the Japanese troops captured Yuejiakou on the Hanyi Highway, they have repeatedly attempted to cross the river and advance towards Qianjiang. Although no detailed reports have been received here, military observers say that the Chinese army in the area is very strong and can cope with any unexpected changes. The Chinese army in northern Hubei is currently sweeping away remnants of bandits, pressing directly on Suixian and Anlu, in order to cut off the Japanese rear transportation and prevent further reinforcements. Observers also said that the Japanese army will attack Shashi, or try to further penetrate northern Hubei, forcing Xiangfan, but the Chinese army, under the command of General Li Zongren, will certainly be able to cope with it calmly.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd] A Japanese military spokesman in Shanghai declared yesterday that the current lull in the war on all fronts is a prelude to a future major battle.

[Our Newspaper, Shaoguan, 3rd Special Dispatch] The battle situation in Longkou, Xinjie, Jiangcun area is silent. Several hundred Guangdong troops rushed to Longkou the day before yesterday to reinforce. There seems to be a substantial action planned within days.

[Our Newspaper, Shaoguan, 3rd Special Dispatch] A certain unit of our division attacked bandits in Huangtang, a county of Sanshui, on the morning of the 2nd, annihilating more than twenty bandits. A bandit battalion came to reinforce from Sanshui, and we have withdrawn.

[Our Newspaper, Shantou, 3rd Special Dispatch] More than a dozen enemy warships are anchored on the sea off this port. At night, searchlights are shining in all directions. Enemy planes fly over in shifts all day long. The situation is once again tense.

[Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 2nd] The fighting outside Nanchang has been quieter in recent days. After bandits occupied Xincun Market, there has been no further progress. Our army is now guarding the line of Tianwangdu, Xishan, Luolikou, and Duyuindu, with only minor skirmishes.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 2nd] On the evening of the 30th of last month, a unit of our army ambushed near Qingshan (south of Wuxing), destroying a bridge there and cutting off a large number of enemy military wires. At 10:00 a.m. on the 31st, more than sixty enemy troops from Qingshan advanced along the highway near Wangqiao and were surrounded by us, who launched a fierce attack. Almost all of the enemy were annihilated, with only a few dozen fleeing in defeat.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 3rd] When our air force bombed Wuhan a few days ago, a guerrilla detachment reported that the enemy army suffered heavy losses. Three enemy warehouses were completely destroyed by our bombing.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Convenes Six-Province Transportation Conference to Prepare for Joint Transportation in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi; Develop Freight and Increase Sales Outlets for Agricultural Products

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 1st] In order to adjust wartime trade, the Ministry of Economic Affairs specially convened transportation authorities and relevant personnel from the six provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi to hold a six-province transportation conference in a certain place to discuss ways to maintain freight transportation. It was decided to prepare for joint transportation in the six provinces, so that agricultural products can be sold smoothly in the interior, and increase wartime economic production.

### Shanghai × Declares Blockade of Nine Ports in Jiangsu, Fujian, and Zhejiang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] According to the Shanghai Continental News, a Japanese naval spokesman stated that the Japanese naval authorities have applied to the customs authorities to prohibit foreign merchant ships from sailing to Haimen, Qidong, Xinyang Port, Funing in Jiangsu, and Xinghua, Quanzhou, Hanjiang, and Haimen in Zhejiang from the 1st. Any merchant ships sailing to the above ports without Japanese permission will be ordered to stop by the local Japanese naval authorities. When asked whether the customs authorities have the right to stop customs clearance, the spokesman replied that they do. A reporter then asked whether there was a precedent for the Japanese blockade of these nine ports. The spokesman said that he himself did not know, but the British authorities have already implemented a ban on foreign ships from docking at British concession wharves on the Yangtze River.

### Chongqing's Air Defense is Being Improved

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Efforts are currently being made to improve air defense facilities here. The Air Defense Department announced that in the future, air raid alerts will be issued one or two hours before emergency alerts, because during the last enemy plane raid, the air raid alert was only issued forty-five minutes in advance, and many people did not have enough time to take shelter.

### Wu Dingchang Inspects Western Yunnan; Ren Kecheng Goes to Southern Guizhou

[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 2nd] Wu Dingchang inspected various counties on the Puxi Road on the morning of the 2nd and presided over the third district's conscription and military training meeting in Xingren. Ren Kecheng also went to various counties in southern Guizhou to inspect the administration. The United Association of Friends of Justice and store owners and employees telegraphed the central government requesting sanctions against Wang Jingwei. The original telegram read: "Chairman Chiang of the Central Party Headquarters, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Wang Jingwei has abandoned his duties, made presumptuous claims, shaken people's hearts, and undermined the war of resistance. Recently, he has secretly planned to go to Japan, plotting to sell out the country. He seems to be insane. All nationals are indignant. We earnestly request the most severe sanctions to be imposed to uphold discipline."

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd] According to well-informed sources, Wang Jingwei arrived here on Saturday. However, the details are not known. It is heard that Wang's private residence in the French Concession has been quite lively recently.

### Wang's Retreat is Embarrassing; He is Being Subjected to Factional Strife by All Sorts of Ugly People in Shanghai; Recently There Was Another Story of Him Going to Hankou

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to foreign sources, Wang Jingwei is indeed in Shanghai. The plan to organize a puppet central government has not been accepted by the enemy. Moreover, Wang is being secretly obstructed by Liang Hongzhi, Chen Qun, and others, and progress is quite difficult. The enemy recently planned to order Wang to go to Hankou to organize a puppet government in Wuhan, equal to the puppet organization in Beiping, and then the puppet governments in Beiping and Hankou would jointly form a puppet federal government. Because of this, Wang's retreat is very embarrassing.

### British Concession in Tianjin Extradites Anti-Japanese Elements; Ambassador Guo Protests to Britain

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The British government instructed the British Consul in Tianjin to hand over anti-Japanese elements to the Provisional Government of Puppet Beiping at the request of the Japanese side. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, went to the British Foreign Office today to lodge a strong protest against this instruction, and pointed out that agreeing to this unreasonable demand from Japan is equivalent to giving the puppet government of Beiping "de facto" recognition.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] According to news from here today, well-informed sources say that the report in the newspaper that the Japanese authorities issued an ultimatum to the British Consul-General in Tianjin, demanding the handover of the murderer who assassinated Cheng Xigeng, the puppet customs superintendent of Tianjin, is somewhat exaggerated. However, the British Consul is indeed holding negotiations with the Japanese authorities to resolve the matter. It is heard that the British Consul has been ordered to put forward several proposals, but the content is unknown.

Brief Comments

### Six-Province Transportation Conference

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to adjust wartime trade, specially convened the transportation conferences of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. It was decided to prepare for joint transportation in the six provinces. This matter has extremely important significance. It can not only enable the circulation and smooth sale of agricultural products in various provinces, increase wartime economic production, but also adapt to the needs of the military and civilians in the rear of the enemy.

Provide timely assistance. At the same time, it also helps to solve the livelihood problems of the people who have fled from the six provinces' war zones or occupied areas. However, to achieve this goal perfectly, it not only depends on the implementation of a unified plan by the government, but also depends on the cooperation of the local authorities and social leaders in each province. It is necessary not only to maintain close contact with the military and civilians in the guerrilla areas, and to prevent the infiltration work of bandits and traitors at any time, but also to maintain close contact with the overseas Chinese community and welcome overseas Chinese to cooperate in developing inland production undertakings.

### Two Thousand Overseas Chinese Pioneers

### At the League of Nations Opium Committee Session, the US Representative Praised Our Efforts; Unveiling the Enemy's Conspiracy to Poison Our Country

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Geneva Correspondence, That the enemy uses opium and drugs as a tool to destroy our nation is their consistent policy. In recent years, international opinion has unanimously condemned it. At the 24th session of the League of Nations Opium Committee held in Geneva in May this year, our representative Hu Shize gave a speech, stating that the government's ban on planting and smoking has not only not been suspended due to the war, but has been doubled. Annual reports from domestic and foreign sources such as India, Annam, and the Shanghai Public Concession praised our country's achievements in banning drugs. On the contrary, in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, opium and drugs are everywhere and are becoming increasingly worse. When the US representative spoke, he praised the completeness of our country's annual report and cited the fact that after the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Hankou, and Guangzhou, the situation of opium and drugs deteriorated.

### Fujian Provincial Chairman Chen Yi Speaks; Points Out the Enemy's Intentions in Disturbing Fujian; Exposes the Enemy's Rumor-Mongering Tactics

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd] A Central News Agency reporter recently visited Fujian Chairman Chen in a certain place. Chen had just attended the Provisional Council in Yong'an and expressed satisfaction with the establishment and resolutions of the council. When talking about the enemy ships and planes harassing the coast in recent months, he said that they have no more than two effects: one is spiritual intimidation, and the other is economic blockade. The former not only cannot make the people submit, but can instead stimulate resentment and perseverance. For the latter, we have long completed wartime preparations in the coastal areas, and ordinary trade has not been suspended. The enemy's implementation of the blockade will damage the commercial interests of third countries, while we can reduce the import of foreign goods and maintain economic strength. Finally, Chen said that the enemy's rumor-mongering broadcast a few days ago only made listeners feel contempt, and had no harm to him personally. He also said that this is the enemy's consistent and unchanging divisive policy, and that they will intensify this trick in the future, which is worthy of our vigilance.

### Negotiations in Gulangyu Have Made Slight Progress, × Ministry of Foreign Affairs News

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo External News, A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson stated that negotiations on the Dailangyu issue have made slight progress. The Xiamen Consular Corps held a meeting yesterday afternoon to freely exchange views on the Japanese proposal to reorganize the Public Concession. The general discussion focused on the second point, namely, the appointment of Japanese personnel as weaving members of the Public Works Bureau. Yesterday afternoon's meeting still ended without results, but the situation has improved slightly. The positions of the British, American, and French consuls are now known to the Japanese.

### Enemy's Embarrassment Fully Exposed; Prohibition of Tobacco and Alcohol Imports to Prevent the Outflow of Japanese Yen; Failure to Grow Cotton in the Occupied Areas of Hebei

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo Telegram, In order to prevent Japanese yen from going abroad, the Japanese government will ban the import of tobacco and alcohol. Previously, tourists to Japan were allowed to bring 100 cigarettes and 50 cigars. After the new restrictions are implemented, they will only be allowed to bring half the amount. Also, those who were previously allowed to bring two or three bottles of wine will be completely prohibited from now on.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tianjin News, Since the beginning of spring, Hebei Province has been experiencing a severe drought. Except for the Tianjin area, which had seven rainfalls in May, other areas such as Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Dezhou have not seen rain so far. Cotton fields have not yet been sown, resulting in the failure of the enemy's plan to plant cotton in the occupied areas this year.

### Enemy Provokes Outer Mongolia; Foreign Experts Observe; Intimidation of Britain and Discord between British and Soviet Relations; Right Wing Attempts to Conclude a Military Alliance with Germany and Italy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] In the two weeks since May 11, the enemy has harassed the border of Outer Mongolia with airplanes and tanks, and has been conducting propaganda domestically and internationally. The intention is greatly valued by the general public. According to an expert:

The Japanese provocation on the border of Outer Mongolia this time was during the British and Soviet negotiations and the discussion of whether the enemy should join the German-Italian military alliance. Therefore, there are only two points.

First, make Britain fear the Japanese-Soviet border disputes, there is always the possibility of a war. Then Britain cannot hesitate to protect the border in the Far East. A further attempt is to destroy the British, French, and Soviet anti-aggression coalition. Second, the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany and Italy. The opinions in the enemy country are obviously divided into two factions. One faction advocates maintaining its position in East Asia and not participating in the European War. Therefore, it is certainly in favor of strengthening the connection between Germany, Italy, and Japan, but it is not necessary to be restricted by military mutual assistance. Those belonging to this faction are veteran senior officials, current cabinet authorities, and soldiers of the Itagaki line. The other faction advocates that there is no room for compromise between Japan and democratic countries. In the future, the opposition between the two major camps in the world has become an inevitable trend. Since it has a close relationship with Germany. Then, it should form an inseparable lineup at this time, so that democratic countries will also be wary of the Japanese. Those belonging to this faction are extreme right-wing soldiers. The two factions are fighting fiercely, and the Pyeongyang Cabinet is inclined not to join the alliance. Therefore, the extreme right-wing soldiers followed the old habits of 1918 and provoked on the border of Outer Mongolia, making the Pyeongyang Cabinet feel that it was difficult to advance or retreat. If it can create a situation more serious than the Zhang Yanfeng incident, then the proposal to join the alliance can be achieved. The provocation action is here. The propaganda effect is also here.

However, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, in his speech at the joint meeting of the Supreme Council the other day, mentioned the Outer Mongolia incident this time, and his wording was very strong. He said that when talking about border issues, it seems that the countries concerned at the moment should recognize that the Soviet government will never tolerate any provocations by the Japanese and European troops on its borders. Regarding the borders of Mongolia, we must now make them remember the point. In accordance with the mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Mongolia, we believe that giving Mongolia the necessary assistance to protect its borders is our duty. We attach great importance to the fact that the Soviet government has signed a mutual assistance treaty. I must warn that we will defend the borders of Mongolia as resolutely as we defend our own borders in the mutual assistance treaty we have concluded. It is laughable and foolish to accuse Japan of invading Mongolia, this is the time. It is also necessary to recognize everything and recognize that all tolerance has a limit, this is the time! Therefore, they should stop the frequent provocations of the Japanese and Manchurian troops in time. We have warned the Japanese Moscow Ambassador about this intention: If Japan does not realize it, the situation will deteriorate, or it will exceed the Zhanggufeng incident.

It is heard that on May 31, the Japanese army sent a large group of planes to invade the territory of Outer Mongolia and wantonly bombed it, without any intention of repenting. What the future holds is still unknown. In short, the key issue for the current Japanese authorities is whether to join the German-Italian alliance. Both political and military Poland will arise from this. This can be regarded as the greatest test of Pyongnams's skills and strength.

### 100th Anniversary of the June 3rd Anti-Opium Campaign; Chairman Chiang's Message to the Nation (Continued from Yesterday)

All established anti-opium policies will not only never be changed, but I will continue to infuse my spirit into them at all times. In particular, I am determined to complete the deadline for the ban at the end of the 29th year of the Republic as scheduled, and I am determined not to make any further concessions. This has absolutely no difference from whether I personally hold the post of Director-General or not. As long as opium and drugs are not eliminated for one day, I will not neglect my responsibility for banning opium for one day. Therefore, after I did not hold the post of Director-General last year, I still paid attention to, instructed, and urged the anti-opium work of the provinces and the Anti-Opium Association as before, and continued to issue personal orders. Even recently, I have listed the opium ban issue as the most important work for the administrative work and training of party and government personnel in the southwestern provinces, and imposed extremely severe and practical supervision. I hope that the responsible personnel at all levels of the party, government, and military in all provinces will truly understand my will, take out the sincerity of serving the country, abide by the established policies and my instructions, and do it seriously. In addition, all preparatory work related to the anti-opium administration must be carefully studied and completed quickly, so that we will not lose our posts, and our national people will have the hope of revival and complete our revolutionary cause.

Now that the war of resistance has entered the second stage, and final victory is approaching day by day, we demand that the nation have a glorious and independent existence, and we can only fight with a strong and vigorous spirit. The final deadline for the opium ban will soon be reached. I hope that all compatriots in the country will unanimously recognize that opium and drugs are the internal harm of our national people. But no matter in the towns or villages, anyone who sees people with a gaunt face, thin bones, and ragged clothes, who are like beggars, there is no doubt that they are people who have been infected with opium and drugs. This kind of person, in himself, is not only pitiful, but also shameful? In our country and nation, there are still all kinds of unworthy compatriots, especially the greatest shame and the highest stain on the whole nation. If we do not thoroughly eliminate it, how can we compete with other nations in the modern world for survival? Therefore, I earnestly and sincerely hope that all compatriots in the country must cooperate with the government and implement the anti-opium policy with the same spirit of resisting and killing the enemy. Everyone must consider the opium ban as their own responsibility. On the one hand, no one is allowed to be infected among families and clans. Those who have already been infected must be forced to quit. On the other hand, neighbors should also persuade and encourage each other to develop a trend of quitting, regardless of wealth or poverty, and consider being infected with opium and drugs as a great shame. On the one hand, they should also report and expose those who privately hide and sell opium and drugs at any time, so that they can be punished by law and dare not try again. Moreover, the anti-opium affairs should be listed as one of the most important tasks in the Baojia regulations. As long as all our compatriots in the country are united and of one mind, it is possible to ban it as scheduled. At the same time; (To be continued)

### A Bird's-Eye View of Jin and Shaanxi: Tongguan in Henan Province

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

The journey seemed to be as safe as resting at an inn. After being swiftly transported through Tongguan by a train that obscured its flags and silenced its drums, one barely had a few hours of rest at the ××× station before being compelled to launch a "dawn attack" and hasten back to Tongguan, to pay respects and interview that guardian—the grand hero of Tongguan, a bulwark of defense.

From the ××× station to Tongguan, a short distance away, one must maintain a vigilant "as if approaching a deep abyss or treading on thin ice" mindset even amidst the morning mist and dim dawn light. One must condescendingly pass through a segment of "road" and "fire line" that were born from the marriage of the so-called "transportation." Because it is a crucial point of the defense line, a dangerous area within the range of × soldiers' firearms!

The road passes through towering mountains and great rivers, and every step is strategically important for national defense. Going slightly northwest, one first enters "Liancheng Pass," also known as Thirteen Liancheng, which stretches thirty miles from the southern suburbs to Songcha Valley. In ancient times, beacon towers were set up here, especially at "Jin Gou," which was the most dangerous. During the Tang Dynasty, Huang Chao, and during the Ming Dynasty, Li Zicheng, both breached Tongguan from this location. Continuing forward for × miles, the mountain ravines on both sides stand tall, naturally precipitous, truly possessing the force of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand unable to pass." After another necessary inspection, one enters the "Jin Dou Pass" at the junction of Henan and Shaanxi, also called "First Pass," and the section of road that leads directly to Tongguan's east gate. As the Fenglingdu ferry of the Yellow River gets closer, the journey becomes increasingly difficult and dangerous. However, please don't be overly apprehensive; as the saying goes, "God has his reasons." The river defense troops there have already prepared a safe passage for you.

If you can muster the minimum courage that every citizen should possess, and occasionally shift your gaze to admire the north bank of Fenglingdu, then you will clearly see the roaring Yellow River, the majestic and lofty Zhongtiao Mountain, and the × soldiers' "fox"-like lookout posts and their ghostly activities. Of course, our river defense troops, facing the × soldiers head-on, are also working day and night, summoning a hundredfold spirit, and stubbornly carrying out the sacred task of defending the Northwest. You fire a few shots at me, and I return the favor with a few shells. If you dare to cross the line, I will give you a painful blow head-on. Time flies so fast; since the fall of the north bank, such a stalemate has lasted for fifteen months.

Tongguan's heroic resistance over the past fifteen months has ultimately prevented × from crossing the river and grazing their horses southward. On the one hand, it has solidified an important cornerstone for defending the Northwest, but on the other hand, it has also suffered considerable sacrifices in striving for this cornerstone. Regarding this, we only need to pay our respects as we enter the city and make a tour of the four major streets in the southeast, northwest, and northeast. We will then see that almost all the shops and businesses of the past have been bombed into broken walls and ruins by × planes and shells. The city, once known as the most prosperous area in eastern Shaanxi, has been transformed into a battlefield filled with the smoke of war! Of the city's original population of 40,000, those who are still struggling to make a living amidst the rubble, after accounting for the dead, injured, and escaped, are now as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Of course, there are many other cities more prosperous and important than Tongguan that have also been destroyed by × soldiers' bombings. However, the concentration of bombing targets, the severity of the disaster, and especially the duration of the bombing threat, which has lasted for fifteen months and will continue until "at least the eradication of × in southern Shanxi," is unlikely to be found in any other city besides Tongguan!

The × soldiers hate Tongguan, this hero-like fortress, as if it were a sharp sword deeply embedded in the spinal cord of their long-dreamed-of military strategy to cross the river and invade Xi'an and Lanzhou. Therefore, they constantly bombard it with cannons from across the river and bomb it wildly with airplanes from above. Their ferocity is as if they must swallow the entire Tongguan whole!

However, what is the result of their massive bombing? On the same moving scene, there are ironclad facts to answer. Although they have destroyed many civilian buildings in Tongguan, haven't they also stimulated the strengthening of Tongguan's river defense works day by day? Although they have bombed away and killed many civilians, women, and children in Tongguan, isn't Tongguan also constantly increasing its river defense army with new forces? Although they previously focused on bombing the large iron bridge in the city and recently continuously attacked the First Min Dashandong outside the pass, their deliberate efforts are all aimed at disrupting the Longhai transportation. However, isn't the Longhai train, bearing heavy responsibilities and traveling far, still coming and going freely? Especially, after each wild bombing and fierce attack, they always have to brazenly attempt to cross the river stealthily, only to send a few rubber boat ghosts to the raging Yellow River. But look at that five-story building in Tongguan, built during the Tang Dynasty, which "towers high into the clouds" and offers a "magnificent view of the mountains and rivers," isn't it always there, "safe and sound" and "surpassing the ages," making it something they can only hope for but never attain?

### Molotov Invites British and French Ambassadors for Meeting, Personally Delivers Soviet Reply, Agrees to Proposals in Principle, Requests Guarantees for Baltic States

[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] The British and French Ambassadors to the Soviet Union, upon the invitation of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this evening, went to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Soviet authorities personally handed over the Soviet reply to the British and French proposals to the British and French Ambassadors. It is believed that the wording of the Soviet reply is in accordance with the main points of Molotov's speech.

[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd] It is learned that the Soviet Union has replied to the British and French proposals, requesting Britain and France to provide guarantees to the Baltic states bordering the Soviet Union. This guarantee must be automatically applicable.

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] It is reported that the Soviet Union's reply to the British and French proposals expresses agreement in principle, but still makes extensive reservations on several points.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Regarding the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Britain and France previously drafted a proposal and sent it to the Soviet side. The Soviet government has now submitted a reply to this proposal. The reply was delivered to British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds yesterday. It is expected that the content will be based on the content of the speech delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the two houses.

[Central News Agency, Capital of Lithuania, 2nd] After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov gave a speech requesting guarantees for the Baltic states, people close to the government here commented that Lithuania does not border the Soviet Union. The Baltic states referred to by Molotov probably only refer to Latvia, Estonia, and Finland.

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] French Chief of Staff Gamelin is scheduled to arrive in England on June 7. A Turkish military delegation will also arrive at that time.

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] The Soviet reply was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here this morning. Daladier and promptly studied it, declaring that the Soviet Union did not put forward any counter-proposals. Subsequent negotiations will still be based on the British and French drafts. The Soviet side put forward some revisions, most of which concerned guarantees for the Baltic Sea area.

### Difficult Rescue of British Submarine Accident, Crew's Chances of Survival Are Slim

[Reuters, London, 3rd] This morning at 5 o'clock, several divers re-entered the water to investigate the position of the "Thetis" submarine, and exchanged messages with the people in the submarine. After they came out of the water, they gave a detailed report to the naval personnel responsible for the rescue work. The pessimistic attitude of today's newspapers has changed, retaining limited hope. The comments of some newspapers were written when the news was at its most critical, so they unanimously expressed respect to the people in the submarine, while acknowledging that the rescue was particularly difficult due to the position of the ship and the obstruction of the tide. The "Daily Mail" recalled the rescue of the American submarine accident and said, "The fact is that the diving bell is difficult to use in Liverpool." At the same time, the "Taiwusi Post" discussed the "Davis" life-saving device, saying, "The reason why the Davis life-saving device cannot continue to be used is that the air stored is insufficient due to the rising and falling of the sea water." The "New Chronicle" put forward the cause of the accident, that is, the reason why the rescue failed.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Before 1 a.m. this morning, the Lars Shipyard Company had given up rescuing "Thetis." The authorities issued an official report saying that there was little hope for the people in the submarine. The wives of the victims all cried upon hearing the news (Note: There were 90 people in the submarine, and four people were able to celebrate their survival by using the "Davis" escape method. It is unknown why the remaining 86 people could not continue to use the "Davis" escape method).

[Reuters, London, 3rd] According to a naval report, divers heard faint knocking sounds inside the submarine when inspecting the hull of "Thetis" on the seabed at 1 a.m. this morning.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] It is estimated that the air inside the "Thetis" submarine is only enough to last until midnight tonight. Rescuers are working actively and fighting against time. It is generally hoped that after the tide recedes, more of the stern of the submarine will be exposed above the sea, and a hole can be drilled in the hull to send air in and enlarge the hole so that the people inside the submarine can climb out. This afternoon, the Navy also frankly stated that the situation of the people in the submarine was critical and worrying. It is understood that the front of the submarine has been flooded, and the "Davis" life-saving devices are mostly ineffective. The four people who were rescued and survived used the "Davis" life-saving device at the stern. After coming out of the water, they were rescued by naval personnel and sent to a destroyer for treatment. At the same time, many warships and various rescue ships sailed to the scene and surrounded the sunken submarine. This afternoon, divers communicated with the people inside the submarine by knocking. At 6:56 p.m. this evening, the Navy issued an official communique saying, "According to the latest report at 4:50 p.m. this afternoon, in addition to Arnold and Shi Shi, who were rescued at 9:50 a.m. this morning, no one else has been rescued yet. According to the two survivors, the people in the submarine are preparing to use the 'Davis' life-saving device, but for some reason, no one has escaped yet. Rescuers are now trying to drill holes in the submarine, but this attempt must be temporarily abandoned, and can only be started at about 6 p.m. after the tide recedes, because the current high tide is submerging the hull."

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The struggle to rescue the people in the "Thetis" submarine now seems to be a race against time, as the air supply inside the submarine is gradually decreasing. According to current estimates, it is only enough to last until 1:40 a.m. this morning. Whether the people inside the submarine are retaining oxygen and preventing sea water from entering the submarine, or there are other reasons, it is not possible to continue using the "Davis" life-saving device. The Navy has not yet been able to clarify this. Many workers carrying electric drills and other tools have gone to the scene of the accident, intending to drill holes in the submarine so that air can be sent in after the tide recedes. At the same time, the stern of the submarine has a "floating tank (a long cylinder made of steel, containing compressed air)" to prevent it from sinking. The wives of the victims stood in front of the Lars Shipyard Company all day, listening to the news. In the evening, Mrs. Bola (her husband was also trapped in the submarine) advised everyone to go home and sleep peacefully without being anxious. Lars Company announced a list of the people in the submarine, saying that there were at least 90 people inside, including 58 crew members and 32 shipyard workers. Currently, only four people have been rescued and survived. The submarine is now forming an angle of 45 degrees with the sea surface, and the bow of the submarine is sinking into the seabed. According to current knowledge, it is believed that the submarine is colliding with a shipwreck on the seabed, resulting in the accident.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Navy announced at 10 p.m. this evening that the hope of rescuing the people in the "Thetis" submarine is gradually decreasing. The stern of the submarine did not float up at 6 p.m. when the tide receded, contrary to the expectations of the general public. The authorities are now planning to float the ship so that the submarine will float to the surface of the sea. Rear Admiral Waters, commander of the submarine, arrived in Liverpool tonight to direct the rescue work. The Lars Company authorities announced that there is now a rope under the bow of the submarine, and it is hoped that it can be moved soon. Six experts who helped rescue the German fleet left Okney Island this evening and flew to the scene of the accident to assist in the rescue. A salvage ship from Okney Island, carrying salvage equipment, has also arrived to provide rescue. It is understood that the front of the "Thetis" submarine has been flooded, but according to the rescued people, there are no crew members trapped in the front of the submarine. Mrs. Horr of Devonport received a telegram from the Gosport submarine station tonight saying that her husband had failed to escape from the "Thetis" submarine and is believed to have died. The "Lennox" lifeboat carried a doctor to the scene of the accident this afternoon and returned here today. According to the captain of the lifeboat, he knew that six people had escaped from the "Thetis" submarine, and three others had attempted to escape but failed, resulting in their deaths.

### British Jewish Guard Attacked by Arabs, Jewish Congress Declaration Condemns Terrorist Acts

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 2nd] The British Jewish railway guard team was ambushed by a large number of Arabs this evening, and a battle broke out between the two sides. Four British people and three Jewish people died. British military aircraft also dispatched to cooperate with the infantry. A bombing incident occurred in Jaffa, killing five Arabs and injuring nineteen. The British military commander then ordered the suspension of the Jewish long-distance bus route. Therefore, half of the Jewish long-distance bus routes in the city have been ordered to be suspended. They will only be restored when unexpected incidents no longer occur. The Jewish Congress here issued a declaration expressing condemnation of terrorist acts of violence and calling for the restoration of discipline and order.

### New Italian Law Prohibits Jews and Non-Jews from Forming Joint Ventures

### The Axis Powers Try Hard to Win Over Yugoslavia, Prince Paul Arrives in Berlin, Germany Expresses Special Courtesy

[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 2nd] The Berlin authorities expressed special courtesy to the visit of Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul to Germany. Paul and his party will stay in Berlin for eight days. When they passed through the streets in a car, the crowds stood by the roadside to express their welcome. Later, they went to the New Chancellery to meet Hitler. Hitler is scheduled to host a banquet tonight. A large-scale military parade will be held tomorrow morning.

[Haitong Agency, London, 2nd] What kind of decision Yugoslavia will make in international politics has aroused serious attention from the British press. After mentioning the fact that Germany grandly welcomed Prince Paul, the British press went on to discuss whether Yugoslavia will become a member of the Axis powers. The country occupies an important position in Eastern Europe, so the Axis powers must try their best to win its cooperation. At the same time, German-South commercial relations are also very consolidated. However, the "Daily Telegraph" stated that Yugoslavia will not be tempted by the Axis powers. "Because the country is a Slavic nation, it will not join the anti-Soviet group." At the same time, South and Turkey are both Balkan Entente countries, so South will not alienate Turkey.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 2nd] Political circles in this country attach great importance to Prince Paul's visit to Germany. The press has also commented on it. "Le Figaro" expects that Yugoslavia will maintain neutrality at the very least, but will still maintain friendly relations with the Axis powers. "Le Petit Parisien" said that Prince Paul's visit to Germany is entirely a gesture of friendship and has no important political significance. Therefore, it is expected that the result of this trip will be that German-South commercial relations will be further improved.

### United States Builds New Ships, Including 45,000-Ton Battleships, Navy Department Has Signed Contracts with Shipbuilders

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. Navy Department signed a contract with shipbuilders yesterday to build 24 new ships, including two 45,000-ton battleships and one 20,000-ton aircraft carrier. The construction cost is $350 million.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] The 24 new ships built by the U.S. Navy Department include two 45,000-ton battleships, one aircraft carrier, eight destroyers, seven submarines, four auxiliary cruisers, and two small boats. The government expressed satisfaction.

### Romania Completes General Election, Government Expresses Satisfaction

[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 3rd] The Romanian general election has ended. More than 1.75 million people voted. As a result, the existing government officials received the most votes. The government expressed great satisfaction with this, believing that this general election is tantamount to passing a vote of confidence in the government's domestic and foreign policies.

[Associated Press, Bucharest, 3rd] Romania's parliamentary election campaign ended today. All voters fully support the government, at least in the case of the election of lower house members. The government said that it was very satisfied with the result of today's election, but this result was also expected by the government. The number of votes obtained by the cabinet ministers was the most among the voters in their respective constituencies. However, Foreign Minister Gafencu and Labor Minister Lears lost some votes, because some people said that the two were "full of sexual allure." The election tickets had photos of the two. Some female voters took the election tickets home without putting them in the ballot box. Six representatives of the German minority party and seven of the eight representatives of the Hungarian minority party have been elected. However, the Bulgarian minority party did not win a single seat.

### Roman Pope Continues to Strive for Peace

[Reuters, London, 2nd] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, the Pope's declaration to the clergy academy has aroused great attention in London diplomatic circles. According to the Pope's declaration, it is sufficient to confirm the general speculation that has been lacking in evidence, that the Pope has received letters from Hitler and Mussolini.

### Thirteen Prisoner Interviews

[Central News Agency Guilin Report] Thirteen prisoners were recently transported from the front lines by the headquarters. This morning, a reporter accompanied Staff Officer Zhu Qiyu of the headquarters to interview them. After five hours of conversation, each prisoner revealed their sorrowful state. Four common impressions were gained: (1) All thirteen were supplementary soldiers who had undergone only twenty-odd days of training before being sent to the battlefield. According to their own accounts, they were physically weak and did not meet the qualifications for enlistment. (2) Among them were only sons, leaving their parents helpless and without support, and being sent abroad to fight. (3) Among the thirteen, many had received secondary education. During the conversation, their strong indoctrination was evident. Initially, they pretended to be stubborn, affirming the righteousness of the invasion of China. Subsequently, when expressing their feelings, they revealed boundless sorrow about the war. (4) That Chinese soldiers are becoming more courageous in battle and that the vast expanse of land is boundless was unanimously acknowledged by them, and that they could not be subdued by the Japanese army. Moreover, after less than two years of fighting, the families of the Japanese people have been devastated and society is in a state of terror and instability. If this continues, Japan will be defeated. The confessions of each prisoner are detailed below:

(1) Ishii Dai, 23 years old, from Tokyo, graduated from middle school, worked as a merchant, and was a private first class (supplementary service). He was captured in Gaoyou City on April 28th of this year. When attacking Nanchang, he was in the reserve team and did not participate in the front-line fighting. He followed the main force to the opposite bank of Nanchang. In mid-April, he advanced to Gaoyou City via Gaoan. At 10:00 AM on the 27th, he was attacked by Chinese soldiers and retreated to the southeast of Gaoyou City at noon, where he was captured in a sudden encirclement. After Ishii Dai recounted his capture, the reporter asked for his impressions of the war. He lowered his head and pondered for a long time before saying, "Having become a prisoner, what else can I say? I cannot return to my country, nor can I reunite with my family. I hope the war ends soon, so that my younger brother will not be driven to the battlefield and leave my widowed mother and orphaned sister without anyone to care for them." When the reporter asked about his impressions of the Chinese soldiers, he said, "At the beginning of my capture, I was guarded by a young soldier who was very courageous and extremely disciplined. Whether buying chickens or rice, he paid the price. This spirit of distinguishing between public and private matters is truly rare and admirable." The reporter then asked why the discipline of the Japanese soldiers was so poor. He showed a look of shame and replied, "The poor discipline of the Japanese army is not from the heart, but because during the war of resistance, everyone believed that they would die in battle sooner or later. Therefore, in boredom, they had to seek temporary pleasure, resulting in various despicable incidents. It is also unfortunate."

(2) Kawada Yoshiaki, 26 years old, from Hyōgo Prefecture, graduated from ordinary elementary school, worked as a factory worker, and was a private first class (supplementary service). He was captured on April 7th of this year on the embankment west of Xiahekou (near Zhi). On that day, he and three comrades went out to catch chickens when they were suddenly attacked by Chinese guerrillas. Except for one comrade who died in battle, he and Mr. Nishimura were captured. After Kawada finished speaking, he continued, "Your country's guerrillas are elusive, making it difficult for the Japanese army to defend against them. At the same time, your country's villagers' spirit of non-cooperation is also truly frightening. Whenever our troops arrive in a village, except for seeing one or two old people, we see nothing else. Therefore, we have to go out to find food. Many comrades who seek food are attacked and captured." When the reporter asked about the prospects for Japan's invasion of China, Kawada replied without hesitation, "Those who have not come to China do not know the size of China and the difficulty of military operations. Our country's victory over your country is probably not as ideal as we thought."

(3) Hatori Shigeo, 24 years old, from Ibaraki Prefecture, graduated from elementary school, worked as a carpenter, and was a private first class (supplementary service). He was captured in Changqiao City on April 20th of this year. Hatori landed in Shanghai in September of last year, stationed there for three days before heading to Hangzhou. The next day, he transferred to Yuhang. On the 20th morning, he was foraging for rice nearby when he was captured by Chinese plainclothes soldiers. Hatori Shigeo was extremely depressed and physically weak. When his eyes moved, he seemed to have deep thoughts to express. After the reporter inquired further, he stared at the portrait of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the wall for a long time before sighing and saying, "Our country's attack on China is truly a mystery. When I was in my country, everyone said that the Chinese had bad tempers, but based on my personal experience, your country's people are kinder and more amiable than our country's people. What I regret most today is being a prisoner and having no chance to return home. Otherwise, I would return home to do proper propaganda to avoid mutual slaughter. I tell you all, fighting on the front lines is the most tragic thing." After Hatori finished speaking, he shook his head repeatedly, looking distressed.

(4) Yamamoto Kiichi, 23 years old, from Shiga Prefecture, graduated from elementary school, worked as a farmer, and was a private first class (supplementary service). He was captured in Yangjiashan on May 6th of this year. He landed in Dingzan on December 28th of last year and soon arrived at Yangjiashan. On the morning of May 5th, he was suddenly surrounded by over a hundred Chinese guerrillas. Captain Ran's entire squad was annihilated. On the morning of the 6th, he went down the mountain alone to find food and was immediately captured. According to him, the guards treated him very well, which was very touching. He doesn't know where he is now, but the kindness of the Chinese soldiers is the same everywhere, which is beyond his expectations. He hopes that if the people of his country are fortunate enough to enter China in the future, it would be the greatest happiness. However, he cannot bear to imagine the situation of his aging mother and weak younger sister. He finished speaking and tears fell silently. (To be continued)

### Over a Hundred Groups in Hong Kong and Kowloon Held a General Mobilization Oath Yesterday to Practice Three Goals and Five Guidelines, Eliminate Lethargy and Corruption, and Boost Morale

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, over a hundred organizations and schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon jointly and solemnly held a National Spiritual Mobilization Oath Ceremony at the MacPherson Stadium in Mong Kok. Over a hundred organizations and schools participated, with over three thousand representatives. The situation was unprecedentedly tense. The police dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order. A portrait of the Premier was hung high on the stage, with the phrases "General Spiritual Mobilization, Unite Together to Defend the Republic of China" and "Everyone is Responsible for Prosperity and Decline, Work Together with One Heart, and Be Worthy of the Descendants of the Yellow Emperor" written on both sides. There were also the phrases "Nation First, People First, Victory First, Military First, Concentration of Will, Concentration of Strength, Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction." The layout was extremely commercial and the meaning was profound. After the ceremony was held according to schedule, the chairman reported,

Purpose of the Meeting

Bi Jikai began the oath, which read, "We swear on our conscience to abide by the National Covenant, absolutely protect the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and do our best to serve the country. If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept punishment from the government. We solemnly swear." After the oath was completed, the supervisor delivered a speech, which read, "Comrades, today is the day when our various organizations and schools in Kowloon, following the orders of the supreme leader, hold the spiritual mobilization and National Covenant oath. I, Miao Ying, am honored to supervise the oath. I am ashamed of my lack of virtue and ability, but I am happy to unite with everyone and take the same steps. This spirit of unity is a good sign of our country's victory. I feel very happy. The War of Resistance has now entered its second stage, which is a full-scale war.

Implementation Period

In the past twenty-odd months of the War of Resistance, we have frustrated the arrogance of the enemy and depleted their strength, fundamentally shattering their dream of "swallowing China in one gulp." Therefore, in addition to military failure, the enemy is focusing on political offensives, attempting to divide our anti-Japanese united front. A group of conscienceless people in our country are speaking out for them, spreading their bizarre, absurd, and contradictory fallacies, intending to use their deceptive, numbing, and intimidating tricks to supplement their military failures and achieve their ambitious goal of destroying our country. This cannot be said to be ruthless. However, our people are all able to recognize that the enemy wants to completely destroy China. Our compatriots have suffered directly and indirectly from all the enemy's evil deeds, which are deeply imprinted in their minds and will never be forgotten. However, the aggressors are cunning and deceitful, and the masses are inevitably shaken by fallacies. In order to crush the aggressors' political offensive conspiracy, strengthen our anti-Japanese spirit, achieve the final victory quickly, and realize Chairman Chiang's

Spiritual Mobilization

There was a thorough explanation, "After the War of Resistance entered its second stage, the enemy was already in a military dilemma, becoming more and more embarrassed and more and more at a loss. Recently, the enemy has focused on political manipulation, fabricating facts, and alienating our people, just to subdue our spirit first, decompose our spirit, and then conquer our entire nation." From this point of view, spiritual mobilization is indeed an urgent matter. As for modern warfare, it is certainly important to have material abundance, but it is not known that spiritual power is even more important than material. Therefore, what we rely on is spiritual. Sun Tzu said, "To subdue the enemy without fighting is the supreme excellence," which fully demonstrates the importance of spiritual warfare. If we look at the history of the fall of the Ming Dynasty, it can serve as a warning. Looking at how the former Premier overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established our Republic of China, we can get an ironclad proof that the spirit is of great importance to the rise and fall of the country. Now that the enemy is trapped in the quagmire, it is in a situation where they cannot stop and cannot seek peace. Therefore, we must unite to support the leader and consistently implement the three common national goals of spiritual mobilization: "(1) Nation First, People First, (2) Military First, Victory First, (3) Concentration of Will, Concentration of Strength" and the five guidelines: "(A) The habit of a drunken and dreamy life must be corrected, (B) A vigorous spirit must be cultivated, (C) The habit of living a perfunctory life

Must be eradicated

(D) The attempt to be selfish and self-interested must be broken (E) The divergent and chaotic thoughts must be corrected." After we take the oath today, under the three common goals, we will consistently and forever abide by the National Covenant. The spiritual mobilization is not about how grand the oath is, nor about how strict and flawless the guidelines are, but about the implementation of the oath and the consistency of the implementation from beginning to end. Otherwise, everyone will take an oath once, but after the oath, it will be no different from when they had not taken the oath, then what is the use of the oath? Therefore, from now on, we should eliminate all the obstacles of lethargy and corruption, shake up our spirits, stand on our own posts, do our best, and strive to complete the great cause of building and revitalizing our nation under the highest leader." After the speech, photos were taken, and the participants slowly withdrew from the ceremony hall at about 4:00 PM.

### School Dropouts to be Tested by District Today

The registration for school dropouts at the China Righteous School has been closed on the 1st, with over six thousand people registered. A grading test will be held by district today. Also, because the number of applicants exceeded the original quota by two-thirds, the association had to slightly set up screening methods during the test. The first to be admitted are school dropouts due to the war. About two hundred schools will be established first in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and then gradually expanded. The curriculum will be elementary school in nature. As for the middle school aspect, preparations have already begun, and registration of middle school teachers will be held within days.

### Certificates of Origin for National Goods to be Reinstated Regularly, Goods Banned from Transporting from Chongqing

The China Manufacturers Association previously changed the inspection and issuance procedures for certificates of origin for national goods, and issuance was once suspended. Hundreds of manufacturers in Hong Kong and Kowloon felt very inconvenienced. Recently, the procedures have been sorted out and it has been decided to resume issuing certificates of origin from the 15th of this month. Manufacturers who wish to obtain certificates of origin for national goods must fill out forms to the association before the 15th for investigation. However, the association recently received a quick mail telegram from our Ministry of Finance, regarding the transportation of goods from the occupied areas to Hong Kong and the dumping of goods in various foreign ports, especially flour and woven products. When issuing certificates, we must be careful to prevent this. It is checked that the agencies authorized to issue this certificate of origin for national goods in Hong Kong, in addition to the Manufacturers Association, also include the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the China Weaving General Association, and the Nanyang Export Federation. It is hoped that each organization will have a healthy organization.

### Seen During "Sweeping the Floor"

— Yu Wan

Island Scenery

Hong Kong is a "peaceful" place, a safe haven, a paradise............ Literally, the three words "peaceful place" may be interpreted in this way. But those who have lived on the island for a long time have already understood: This is the Hong Kong government's order to "clean the floor"——a big clean up.

——This is what I saw: Several yellow-clad, white-capped clerks brought two long, iron-made boxes. This was undoubtedly to carry out this cleaning movement of the building. How is it rotated? This, he had already given notice. When the orange sun slowly rises, shops, houses, upstairs and downstairs, the door plank is removed. Disorderly goods, utensils, and sundries are piled up on the door plank first. All the ground, the stairs are the water that the employees are pouring. Children are playing in the water. The servants are barefoot and hitting the brooms.

Men and women, old and young, weaving a lively scene. First, they slammed their bed boards on the threshold and stone steps. Bedbugs came, one hundred? Or eighty, rolled down! Children use their hands and feet to rub on the ground, to trample in the water, like a fox trot. Two are bed boards, and another is also a bed board. The foul water came, and the yellow-clad clerks brought the foul water in. After washing and soaking for half an hour, the bed boards were put down, twenty sheets, thirty sheets, indeed, an average of two sheets per person. This small two-story building, the front room, the middle room, the end room, the attic, the beds... Under the sunlight, more than thirty "boards" were actually placed. Among them, there were those that were not polished, not waxed, and not dried. The water on the boards evaporated upward——the children were still squatting, digging out the bedbugs from the cracks in the boards, and the old guys were also busy, odd sundries, new and old shoes, moving back and forth, the stench was frantically exhaling, trench warfare, guerrilla warfare, the foul water had to be poured more intensively.

On the second floor, the third floor, and the fourth floor, the clothes on the drying racks, dry and wet, were heavily stacked. Because the houses are small and there are many people, they will quarrel——competing for drying racks, competing for drying sheds, the good clothes of the anxious people are exchanged.

Ragged clothes, barely able to make ends meet, mostly ash-colored, hemp cloth, patched with variegated cloth pieces, some with bare shoulders and knees... It goes without saying that these are the clothes of poor farmers and country women. Striped and plaid, gray-blue, unbuttoned shirts, wide and short pants, half-torn collars, and incomplete buttons... These, these are the clothes of the working masses. As for the graceful and welcoming, narrow-waisted and short-sleeved, Japanese floral cloth, Japanese silk cheongsams, red, green, flowing, cyan patterns, floral, short-collared sleeves, Western-style coats, autumn and winter furs, suits, fancy, long shirts, short jackets... These, then, are difficult to describe fully——they are ladies, ladies, young mistresses, courtesans, and madams! These are their clothes. What about children's "clothes"? There are those that are so dirty that it is impossible to tell whether they are silk or cloth, those with horizontal and vertical waves, those that are like Shirley Temple's dance clothes, and those that are like the Scottish band's kilts, the work clothes of young workers, aviation suits, sailor suits, hunting clothes, lantern sleeves, and turned-down collars... Each floor has its own characteristics. Is this a division of the times or a disparity between the rich and the poor? Poor farmers and country women, they are renting beds and living in small attics. They are refugees who fled here. The working masses, they sleep in bunk beds or on the floor. Some of them have guerrilla "homes". As for the rich, the wealthy, and the young ladies, they are enjoyers and plunderers. They have copper beds and sit on sofas.

The self-made "helpers" came. "How many people still live here? Kitchen? Toilet—" "Oh, only twenty people..." The "second landlord" mumbled vaguely. "How can there be so many bed boards and beds?" "..."

The garbage trucks took away piles and piles of garbage, and the yellow-clad clerks also left. A floor still has two or thirty "people" and seven or eight "families."

### Postmaster's Order: Strict Crackdown on Illegally Established Radio Stations; Granting Special Powers for Land and Sea Searches

In light of the continuous discovery of illegally established radio stations in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Telecommunications Authority, considering this situation, petitioned the Hong Kong Government to grant it the authority to execute crackdowns on illegally established radio stations at any time. The Hong Kong authorities then instructed the Legal Department to draft new regulations to supplement the exclusive right to manage telecommunications, prohibiting the illegal use of wireless telegraph equipment. Individuals suspected of illegal activity, their residences, or their belongings may be searched and arrested. Any ship, except for warships, may be searched if officials deem its activities suspicious, and merchants who sell or manufacture wireless telegraph equipment may have their shops and related components searched if officials believe they have violated these regulations. Officials may also forcibly enter premises or board ships to conduct inspections. These new regulations were published in the Gazette yesterday morning. According to the purpose and rationale stated in the new regulations, the past experience has shown that the provisions of the new regulations are necessary for effective crackdowns, and the strictness of the crackdowns is equivalent to cracking down on the manufacture and sale of red pills. It is believed that illegally established radio stations will be completely eliminated in the future. The text of the new regulations is as follows:

Part on House Searches

(1) This regulation is named the Telecommunications Traffic Amendment Regulation of 1939. (2) The clauses contained in Article 31 of the Telecommunications Traffic Regulation of 1936 are amended and replaced by the following example sentences: Article 31 (a) It is legal for a person authorized by the Postmaster to do the following on behalf of the Postmaster: (a) If a person authorized by the Postmaster suspects that someone has violated this regulation or the regulations arising from this regulation, and the suspicion is reasonable, the person may be arrested and prosecuted in court. (b) A person authorized by the Postmaster may search a person or house and make an arrest, but if the person is a woman, she must be searched by a woman. If the person objects to being searched in a public place, she should also be allowed to be searched in another place. (c) A person authorized by the Postmaster may search a place if the person has reasonable grounds for suspicion and any item may be confiscated according to section (e) of this regulation. (d) If a ship (excluding warships) is suspected, and the person authorized by the Postmaster has reasonable grounds for suspicion, the ship may be searched, and if necessary, it may be ordered to stop sailing for inspection. (e) A person authorized by the Postmaster may search shops selling or manufacturing wireless equipment, and may require the owner of the shop to present various receipts and inspect the goods in stock. (f) May be confiscated, transported and detained. (1) Any item suspected of violating this regulation. (2) Any document suspected of being directly or indirectly related to the illegal sale of wireless equipment, or intending to sell wireless equipment, where such sale violates this regulation.

Part on Ship Searches

(3) Other instruments deemed to be capable of providing evidence, (g) A person authorized by the Postmaster may (a) destroy internal and external doors and fences regardless of location, (b) use force to arrest anyone who resists arrest or move any item, (d) detain anyone during the search of a place for the duration of the search, (h) The special powers granted by the Postmaster are based on these regulations, and the person authorized may use them as appropriate. (i) No one shall delay or prevent the detention, arrest, search, inspection, confiscation, or removal stipulated in this regulation. (j) If a machine is discovered due to a violation of the regulations, whether the person arrested has been convicted or not, it is legal for the court to rule that the seized machine be confiscated by the government.

Lu Fu: Esteemed seniors, comrades, today is the third meeting of the "Shen Bao" Film and Drama Symposium. We are honored by everyone's presence. The central topic of today's discussion is: "The China Salvation Troupe's Performances in Hong Kong and the Future of the National Salvation Drama Movement." Regarding the China Salvation Troupe, everyone certainly has a clear understanding already. At our second Film and Drama Symposium—the welcoming symposium for the China Salvation Troupe—there was already a considerable review of everything the China Salvation Troupe has done in the past. For twenty months, they have traveled across the northern and southern battlefields, traversing the wilderness of the motherland, coming and going amidst bombings, struggling in hardship,

calling on people to engage in widespread national salvation propaganda. In their 740-plus performances...

on the one hand, actively participating; on the other hand, also gaining experience in the reality of the War of Resistance, learning vividly from the broad masses of the people. For twenty months, they have been constantly tempered, constantly practicing, opening up a bright future for the emerging Chinese drama movement, and establishing the foundation for a new national drama. It not only arose to meet the needs of the War of Resistance but also strives thoroughly to uphold the War of Resistance and strive to build a new China!

In the short two-plus months of their activities promoting abroad to Hong Kong, they have already deeply moved countless people; countless people have felt deeply ashamed, especially in the recent large-scale charity performance, the 742nd, to raise funds for the Hong Kong All-Circles Joint Conference for Relief of South China Refugees to aid wounded soldiers and refugees, and the 743rd large-scale promotional performance to entertain Hong Kong students and the public. Their serious and thorough work ethic, their courageous and hardworking determination, their simple and sincere high enthusiasm, their hardworking and enduring struggle life... especially their exquisite and magnificent performances that pass living, bloody reality through collective understanding and high technique, the sacrificial spirit of voluntarily bearing over five thousand Hong Kong dollars in performance costs, not only strengthened ××'s publicity, not only served the wounded soldiers and refugees, but also unprecedentedly expanded the realm of dramatic influence and effect,

The "China Salvation Troupe"'s thorough working attitude of doing drama for national salvation and propaganda, this fighting spirit of redoubled efforts, perseverance, and hard work, in addition to paying our deepest national respect, we hope that the esteemed seniors present can provide further and more rigorous review and encouragement for this performance, so that Hong Kong drama workers can learn how to accept their valuable experience and lessons. In order to focus the discussion, we would like to roughly define the scope of this discussion: 1. The impact the China Salvation Troupe has had on the national salvation drama movement—the China Salvation Troupe's work spirit, the China Salvation Troupe's work goals, the China Salvation Troupe's work methods; 2. The significance and impact of the "China Salvation Troupe"'s performance in Hong Kong—the significant meaning of the performance, the impact on the general audience, the appropriate reaction of Hong Kong drama workers; 2. Criticism of this performance—script, acting, stage technology, other; 3. Prospects for the national salvation drama movement:—What is the foundation of the national salvation drama movement? The consciousness and form of the national salvation drama movement, the form and content of the national salvation drama movement, the efforts that drama workers should make in the future... We hope that all the esteemed seniors and comrades present will not be polite and express your opinions as much as possible!

Ouyang Yuqian: After the "China Salvation Troupe" arrived in Hong Kong, we felt very excited and happy; the "China Salvation Troupe"'s stimulation of society is very profound and moving. I remember saying at the reception at the Sze Hau Hotel last time: "The China Salvation Troupe has been forged from great practice." They have high enthusiasm and firm belief, which is something we should pay special attention to.

This performance of the China Salvation Troupe does not meticulously investigate individual aspects, but focuses on creating the atmosphere of the entire theater scene, causing resonance among the audience, which is a very correct approach.

"National Salvation" is adapted from William Tell; although the script is somewhat unrealistic; however, the "China Salvation Troupe" performed it very vividly and tensely, which is the unique skill of Mr. Jin Shan, the director of the "China Salvation Troupe."

"Spring in Taierzhuang" is all vivid, bloody historical fact, so it naturally comes across as more intimate and moving. From this, we can also see that the China Salvation Troupe has a fiery enthusiasm and a steel-like organization.

The effect of many drama troupes' performances in the past was not necessarily very good. The main reason is that their enthusiasm, experience, and organization are still insufficient. We don't need to compliment Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and other comrades of the "China Salvation Troupe" on how realistic the acting is, how well they are coordinated; even the daredevil team with broadswords is done very realistically. Without practical experience, there would definitely not be such authenticity.

The "China Salvation Troupe" handles the crowds on stage very well. Many great Soviet performances also pay attention to this aspect. This is a problem of directing, and also a problem of construction. But the China Salvation Troupe has had great success in this area, such as the last scene of "Spring in Taierzhuang," where the regimental commander is in the middle of the Taierzhuang train station platform, with soldiers on one side and the masses on the other, the composition is very appropriate.

Secondly, the set design and lighting are also very successful. The backdrop is most admired by the audience. This time, the China Salvation Troupe used the backdrop to its best effect. The beauty of the backdrop is truly unprecedented in Hong Kong.

The China Salvation Troupe's performance this time was really very energetic, and they put their energy where it should be, right on the key points. Without a strong organization, it would not be possible to be so meticulous and orderly. Therefore, I say: "Serious, orderly, enthusiastic, and intimate" encompasses the greatest advantages of the China Salvation Troupe.

Now, let's turn around and review how the Hong Kong drama movement should work hard in the future.

The facts tell us that many Hong Kong drama troupes still lack work, and the enthusiasm and spirit of many young people—especially those from the war zone—are not bad, but what they lack is good organization, coupled with extremely difficult material conditions.

Some time ago—around the fall of Guangzhou—I was in Guangzhou and Zhongshan, and I was very moved by what I saw. No matter how the × planes bombed or how difficult the environment was, young drama workers were still working hard in poverty. They had nothing, and even rags were used as curtains. Mr. Xia Yan, who is present today, has also seen this situation. But these useful young people, after arriving in Hong Kong—many of whom came to Hong Kong for the second time after failing to find work back in the mainland—are at a loss. The reason is that there is no organization, no place to perform. Even if they barely find a place, costumes, lighting, sets... all become problems. There are serious difficulties everywhere. Even if they exert every ounce of strength, they can only perform once, and no one will watch the second time. After accumulating a debt, they cannot continue to perform. If they don't sell tickets or sell them cheaply, they can't cover their expenses. If they sell tickets, people don't want to watch. This is really very difficult.

Also, to make a performance a success, it must be rehearsed thoroughly, and the preparation time must be extended, which increases expenses. To overcome this difficulty, the comrades of the drama troupe should share the joys and sorrows and persevere to the end. The China Salvation Troupe already has a considerable working foundation, and the comrades have been working hard together since August 13th for a common goal. From the China Salvation Troupe's performance in Hong Kong, we drama workers staying in Hong Kong should gain new understanding and experience, accept the China Salvation Troupe's strong spirit, and organize ourselves meticulously. Grow up in difficult and challenging circumstances.

Drama is not something that one or a few people can do. We also hope for the help of all sectors of society, and that everyone will work together and contribute their ideas.

Xia Yan:

Luo Jingyu: In order to enrich the content of its films, the China Film Studio once asked friends from the China Salvation Troupe to help shoot "The Last Drop of Blood" in Wuhan. But it was interrupted after only 60% was completed due to destruction by × planes. Now, seeing the China Salvation Troupe continue to shed blood in Hong Kong, I myself am also very excited.

Short plays are especially suitable for the vast overseas Chinese community. This time, I saw the China Salvation Troupe's four short plays of "Defending the Motherland" and wept along with the surrounding masses—all genuine people. Mr. Xia said that we should create scripts, and I think we especially need to create scripts for short plays. On the surface, they may seem very simple and superficial. In fact, the effect is especially great. The first of the four short plays, "Thief," already includes everything. So I say; the China Salvation Troupe is "beautiful and simple." The performance of the work is too moving. I hope the China Salvation Troupe maintains this enthusiasm—without letting it run wild and dissipate—and continues to fight until the victory of the War of Resistance, so that we can say to our descendants: We have already shouldered our responsibilities for you.

Zhang Xuefeng: The ability to maintain emotional tension through four one-act plays together is the extraordinary power of the China Salvation Troupe. All other aspects of each play, whether it is acting or sets, are very good. However, the lightning effect is only in a portion of the space and has not been applied to the entire stage. The exterior scenes also need to be made more realistic, so that the audience cannot tell that they are stage curtains. Of course, this is a demanding request to go one step further after achieving great success.

Ma Guoliang: I am an outsider to drama; with experts here, I dare not speak. However, I feel that the China Salvation Troupe's performance has another, even greater significance.

The War of Resistance is almost two years old, but due to environmental reasons, the Hong Kong public has not had the opportunity to express their enthusiastic national salvation sentiment. This six-day public performance—especially the last three days—through drama. The theater is like a mass meeting. The audience doesn't say a word, but from their expressions and their love for the China Salvation Troupe, they express their passionate feelings.

In the past, all kinds of national salvation activities, such as dances and music, were held in hotels, which had absolutely no connection with the public. This time, the China Salvation Troupe lowered ticket prices from one dime to four dimes, giving the public and young people the opportunity to attend. I hope drama workers will learn this approach and strive to make more contributions.

Zhang Guangyu: I am also a layman when it comes to drama. From the perspective of us painters, the sets, lighting... of the China Salvation Troupe's plays are really very beautiful and good. I am not the only one who feels this way. I have heard the opinions of many painting comrades, and they all praise them similarly.

Ding Cong: I only have a small suggestion to add. I was sitting next to the first row, but in the fourth act of "Spring in Taierzhuang," I could only see one person acting—the curtain blocked the view. I hope you can find a way to change it.

Huang Qinghua: I have been a faithful audience member for the China Salvation Troupe's plays every day. I once interviewed workers who watched the plays and asked them what they thought after watching the China Salvation Troupe's plays. He said that he was very moved by the spirit of the China Salvation Troupe. "When I heard the air raid siren, I thought back to the situation in Guangzhou. Everything on stage is simply a reflection of our lives."

I also interviewed tram workers, who said, "Although I can't understand Mandarin, every move on stage seems to make me understand. So, every night when I drive the tram to the entrance to wait for the show to end, I have to go in and take a look, and it really gets more interesting the more I watch it."

These facts can give a head-on blow to those who advocate defeatism in anti-Japanese drama. They say that anti-Japanese drama cannot sell tickets. In fact, the reason they don't sell tickets is that they lack superb skills.

Wang Yongzai: I would like to offer an opinion from the perspective of education, bringing the "China Salvation Troupe" into the classroom. The classroom and the stage are inseparable, especially in a country where the number of illiterate people accounts for more than 80%, the facts tell us that the latter—the stage—has a greater effect on arousing the public than the former—the classroom.

The significance of bringing the "China Salvation Troupe" into the classroom is to open the curtain on the union of drama and education. It is the most unique prelude to a wedding ceremony with education. In the meantime, one side is friends who eagerly engage in drama should not forget to enlighten the friends of education on the other side should not neglect drama. Specifically: It is hoped that before the China Salvation Troupe leaves Hong Kong, there will be a public lecture on drama. That is equivalent to a few drama education lessons, but the location is transferred from the stage to the classroom. It is hoped that the friends of the China Salvation Troupe will frankly and systematically tell the public about the past, present and future of the group. Whether it is organization, directing, acting, stage design, or backstage management, etc... Let everyone have the opportunity to exchange ideas.

Jin Shan: We are very grateful for this serious and sincere review meeting. We will not only listen to all criticisms of our shortcomings, but also make practical improvements. When we go back, we will hold a meeting to discuss and accept everyone's instructions and encouragement. When we first arrived in Hong Kong, we also said at the welcome banquet that we would never give up any opportunity to learn. This time, the performance of the three plays means that we are learning with such an open mind. Today's symposium has given us many valuable inspirations and is another opportunity for us to learn.

Regarding the hopes for the Hong Kong drama movement, Mr. Ouyang said very pertinently that organization is very important. We hope that enthusiastic young people can have the opportunity to give full play to their talents in an organized group. It is a pity that vitality cannot be used.

We also have a counter-request to Mr. Xia, which is to hope that playwrights will provide us with more scripts so that we can rehearse more. It is really difficult for us to write scripts while we are performing. Therefore, we must cooperate and divide our work. Playwrights write scripts, and we perform, just like a film studio. Mr. Luo is the manager, Mr. Ouyang is the screenwriter, and Mr. Zhang Chu is the director. Each has his own responsibilities, and things will be easier to handle. I hope everyone will be our backing so that we have no worries. Before going abroad, we also hope to have the opportunity to cooperate with various drama troupes for joint performances.

Wang Ying: Comrade Jin Shan has missed a point: We are very grateful for the help we received from all parties this time. For example, for the two big plays, because we didn't have enough people, we received the help of enthusiastic comrades from the China Art Troupe, the China Travel Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, the Red and White Troupe, the Amateur Troupe, etc. Their spirit of sacrifice and hard work has impressed us very much. We should take this opportunity to thank our friends who care for us.

Lin Shu: This time, I am very happy to see the veteran comrades in the drama circle caring for us and loving us so kindly. After each performance was full, there were often more than a hundred compatriots outside the door who could not get in. I was both happy and very sorry. Especially the friends who helped the China Salvation Troupe perform, like the comrades in our troupe, were so busy that they couldn't sleep or eat. I was able to sleep four or five times a night, which was much more comfortable than them, and I felt very ashamed! This time, I played Commander Chi in "Spring in Taierzhuang." At first, I thought it would be easy, but I knew that the next day my voice was hoarse and I had to announce my resignation. Acting is really not easy!

Ouyang Yuqian: I still have to add a few words. Mr. Xia's strict criticism of the China Salvation Troupe just now is very correct, but there are indeed difficulties in reality. I have experience in this and know it very well. For example, the China Salvation Troupe only has twenty-seven people. When there are not enough actors, the accountant, the lighting manager, the set designer, and the prop manager have to be pulled in to make up the numbers. How can the division of labor be good and scientific? For example, I am in charge of directing at the China Art Troupe, but I often have to carry props myself. If I don't do this, what can I do?

For example, Mr. Hu Chunbing wrote a script in two weeks. In theory, it shouldn't be done so hastily, but the demand is urgent, so it has to be done this way.

In Hong Kong, there seem to be many drama workers, but when it comes to doing things, you immediately feel that there are not enough. Regarding the development of work, Mr. Jin said it right: "Don't miss the opportunity to learn." We should all learn from each other's strengths. There are some things that I also need to learn from Mr. Jin Shan. We inevitably make mistakes in doing things. It doesn't matter if we make mistakes, as long as we admit them and correct them. The China Salvation Troupe said that they will hold a meeting to review. I think that some of the strict criticisms, after the meeting, will not be easy to fully implement, but don't be afraid, slowly find a way, and one day it will work.

I will no longer compliment the China Salvation Troupe for their skillful and orderly performance this time. I can only congratulate them on the success of this performance. But I don't know how much sweat they shed, how much brainpower they wrung out, and how many times they were dissatisfied and depressed... to get this price. This success is the harvest of a hard struggle and is extremely valuable. I hope to expand this success into even greater success.

Lu Fu: Thank you for your valuable opinions, which made today's symposium particularly fruitful! I don't need to repeat the specific opinions that all the gentlemen have expressed on this performance of the "China Salvation Troupe." To sum up, this performance of the China Salvation Troupe has been very successful in all aspects,

Yes, today we made a sincere review of this performance of the "China Salvation Troupe." I hope we will continue to strive to open up a bright future for China's emerging drama movement and to build a new foundation for the national drama movement!

Today's meeting made a sincere review of the "China Salvation Troupe" on the one hand, and at the same time, we have somewhat explored the impact of this performance of the "China Salvation Troupe" on the Hong Kong national salvation drama movement, and we have reached a few conclusions. First: The China Salvation Troupe itself is a close-knit and strong organization, so it can exert great work efficiency. This is a very important factor; this is how it has been for twenty months of work, and this is also what has been shown in this performance. Second, the China Salvation Troupe has a work goal of thoroughly promoting the War of Resistance and opening up new paths for emerging drama, has a strong ability, has high enthusiasm, has the perseverance to work hard, and has a sincere attitude, so it can move forward happily towards this goal. Third: All possible methods, go deep into their ranks, This is based on the correct recognition of the "China Salvation Troupe Comrades". Fourth; scripts, acting, are reflections and experiences of bloody reality, are art that is understood and accepted by the public, and at the same time, the comrades of the China Salvation Troupe have been committed to spoken drama for more than ten years. They have absorbed the essence of the spoken drama movement since then, passed through the public, and retained it, so that today it is shown on the stage, can create a new record for Hong Kong's spoken drama.

From the China Salvation Troupe's work goals, and the conditions they have to achieve these goals, we are really fortunate for the future of emerging drama. However, standing on the position of drama for national salvation, we hope that the influence of the China Salvation Troupe today will not disappear after the China Salvation Troupe leaves. Every young drama worker staying in Hong Kong should accept the valuable experience and lessons of the China Salvation Troupe, first of all, organize themselves closely, learn the successful advantages of the China Salvation Troupe, learn the working spirit of the China Salvation Troupe, create drama content and forms suitable for today, expand the impact of drama. Together, we will lay a new and solid foundation for the emerging drama movement—the future of the emerging drama movement is very optimistic!

### Yesterday's Baseball Game: Youpi Heavily Defeats Hong Kong Club - Hong Kong Club Almost Scores "Zero" to Six

[Our Special Correspondent] Yesterday was a sunny day with gentle sunlight, perfect for outdoor activities. Consequently, the baseball league, which had been suspended for two weeks due to rain, resumed at Jia Shan.

The scene of this competition had a unique atmosphere. Being among it, one could hear many witty and humorous remarks, enough to make one burst with laughter and relieve worries.

The outcome of yesterday's battle was as expected: Youpi secured victory, defeating Hong Kong Club resoundingly with a score of six to one.

Although the combat was not particularly intense, there was plenty of humor in the stands. People were singing and responding to each other, creating a pleasant atmosphere. The air was filled with joy, making one forget the coldness of the game. There was also a black musician who brought a trumpet to liven up the event. Whenever the players made a move, he would play a tune, creating a lot of laughter. Someone from Youpi offered him a bottle of beer, which he accepted with a bow, displaying a similar generosity to that of the "Brown Bomber," Joe Louis, after his victories.

Youpi's victory was naturally the result of the entire team's superior skills. During the competition, apart from Leonard's two errors (one of which led to the loss of a point), there were no other flaws. Therefore, they were able to control the entire field and maintain an absolute advantage. If Leonard hadn't been careless in the third inning, Hong Kong Club would have likely ended with a "zero."

Hong Kong Club's performance was originally not bad. They managed to hold their own until the third inning with a score of one to one, showing that they were not easily defeated. Pitcher Lawes had excellent skills, but he couldn't sustain his performance. By the fourth and fifth innings, his pitching power weakened, marking the beginning of their defeat in the fourth inning.

However, the loss of points was not entirely due to the pitcher. The most problematic player was third baseman Boleno, who was short in stature and lacked agility. He made several mistakes and allowed several stolen bases, failing to stop any of them. Thus, at least four of the six points lost were attributed to his errors.

Walker's throwing accuracy was also lacking. Several times, he failed to catch runners attempting to steal bases because his throws were off-target. This also proves that Hong Kong Club's defense was not well-coordinated and had many loopholes. The area between second and third base was particularly weak.

Outfielder Barnes, on the other hand, made several good plays, demonstrating his ability to catch high balls.

Youpi's pitcher, Harold, was able to handle the situation with ease because few of the opposing players were skilled hitters. He did not throw any four-ball walks, and only a few two-ball counts. This shows that his pitching technique still gave the opposing batters chances to hit. Furthermore, Hong Kong Club had a total of 25 at-bats, reflecting that Harold's pitching skills were not particularly strong. He relied on the solid defense of the entire team, increasing the number of strikeouts and catches, creating a tight defensive front.

Minimizing or eliminating errors is essential for a defensive team. In this game, Youpi only made two errors, while Hong Kong Club made four. This comparison explains why Youpi won. A team with more errors clearly experiences a lack of coordination in its defense. Therefore, Hong Kong Club's defeat due to more errors indicates their inferior skills.

The first three innings were tense, but after Youpi opened the door to victory, they cruised smoothly to a six-to-one victory.

The entire game unfolded as follows: First, Hong Kong Club's offensive efforts yielded nothing. Then, when Youpi took to the offensive, Ali, Duckett, and Harold reached base successively, creating a "bases loaded" advantage. However, Hong Kong Club's defenders remained calm and collected. When Ali tried to return to home base, Boleno and Walker intercepted him, eliminating Ali and slightly improving the situation. But as one wave subsided, another arose. Leonard freely reached base, creating another dangerous situation with three bases occupied. With the good hitter Harold at bat, everyone thought Hong Kong Club would inevitably suffer. Unexpectedly, Lawrence displayed great prowess at this moment, skillfully throwing curveballs, first striking out Harold, and then striking out Teague, who was next at bat, with three strikes. Youpi's superior position completely disintegrated. This inning was the most exciting scene of the entire game, and Lawrence's composure in handling the situation was particularly commendable.

In the second inning, Youpi scored first when T. Leonard hit a triple and then returned home with Wu Yiwen's sacrifice hit. Hong Kong Club went three up and three down, adding another zero to the scoreboard. The third inning saw both sides come away empty-handed.

In the fourth inning, another remarkable scene unfolded. During Hong Kong Club's offensive, Boddie scored a point due to an error by Leonard. In Youpi's counterattack, S. Leonard first reached first base with a hit and then stole two consecutive bases, reaching third base, creating a good opportunity to score. However, T. Leonard hit a fly ball that was caught by left fielder Barnes, resulting in his strikeout. Wu Yiwen also hit a high ball that was skillfully caught by center fielder Hatton, sharing the same fate as T. Leonard. Hong Kong Club, seeing that two of their opponents were out, believed that Youpi's momentum could not be prolonged. But the game's situation changed unpredictably. Ali hit a single and then stole third base. Duckett hit a good ball, and Boleno missed the catch, allowing Ali to score, while Duckett also advanced to second base. Harold hit a high ball that was caught by second baseman Hatton, ending the offensive.

In the fifth and sixth innings, Youpi scored a total of three points, while Hong Kong Club was at a loss and unable to score. In the sixth and seventh innings, they went three up and three down, ultimately being defeated by Youpi with a score of one to six. The game, filled with laughter, came to an end, and the general public descended the mountain (the baseball field).

### Today's Baseball Game: Two Chinese Teams Clash – Two Games: Mintinnu vs. Western Club

Today, the baseball league features a game between the Chinese team and the Nanhua team at 10:00 AM, followed by a game between the Western team and the Mintinnu team at 11:30 AM, both at the Jia Lu Lian Shan Naval Stadium. Since losing Bao Jia Ping and Feng Jing Xiang, Nanhua has been striving to recruit good players. Thus, today, they can still field a complete lineup to compete against the Chinese team. However, catcher Liang Zhuo Quan injured his finger during practice a few days ago and cannot play today. Situ Bi will fill Liang's spot. According to Wu Zhenfu, the team's backbone, Zheng Biao, a baseball talent from the Far East, may make an appearance today. If so, their strength will be comparable to the Chinese team, and there will be a fierce battle to determine the winner. We urge baseball fans not to arrive too early and go up the mountain to watch these two powerhouses clash. The second game, the Mintinnu team is stronger and should defeat the Western team.

### College Students Play Small Football: Nanda vs. Minda Charity Match – To Be Held on the 10th of This Month

The Lingnan University Alumni Team and the National University Alumni Team have agreed to hold a small football charity match on the 10th of this month. College students are playing small football to raise funds for the Women's Comfort Association, which is truly commendable. At a time when football events are declining, this gives everyone a chance to watch.

The two teams are ready to compete. The lineups are as follows:

(Lingnan Team)

Guo Linbao (Captain), Xu Heng, Huang Dingfen, Chen Yaochi, Li Shutang, Lu Guanyi, Lei Biao, Chen Guangyao, Xu Baozhao, Chen Hongbin, Xu Baohan, Huang Shubang, Sun Dianlian, Zhang Guansheng, Wu Shunde, Hu Hao, Li Jincai, Huang Guangcan, Liu Zifei, Guo Linshan

(National Team)

Tan Jun'gan, Huang Fu, Liang Baiwei, Lu Jiaxing, Zhang Manrong, Yu Zhaoluan, Li Deguang, Li Zhaoguang, Li Deqi, Yang Jianbang, He Guoqiang

Looking at the players on both teams, they are all well-known figures in the football world. This small football match, held in a unique style, will naturally have its own merits. Philanthropists, please do not overlook it just because it is small.

After one game, there will be a second game. The competing teams are all championship teams from Hong Kong. This is not all; there will be various side events and entertainment that cannot be fully described. You will know when you arrive. For now, it remains a secret. The Women's Comfort Association has sent letters to various sectors, asking them to buy tickets in advance to avoid disappointment. The original letter is as follows:

"We are writing to inform you that we recently received a letter from Commander Bo Ling of the X War Zone, stating that the war in the war zone is developing rapidly, with countless enemies killed, and many of our soldiers and citizens in the war zone are injured, requiring a large number of first-aid kits. He requested us to help procure 500,000 kits. Therefore, our association is launching a campaign to expand the procurement of first-aid kits, and our association is responsible for supplying 20,000 kits. We now request the alumni associations of Lingnan University and National University to hold a small football charity match on Saturday, June 10th, at 4:00 PM to raise funds for the manufacture of these first-aid kits. We are sending you tickets, and we hope that you will consider the affairs of the country and have a charitable heart, and will be happy to sell them. Please deposit the funds before the 8th of this month for settlement. We are very grateful for your trouble."

This charity match may be small, but it is of great importance. Buying one more ticket saves one more life. Fellow citizens, please buy tickets enthusiastically. The referee is Li Huitang.

### Volleyball: Pui Ying Lightly Defeats Yucai – Southwest Defeats Ying Huang

The school volleyball tournament featured junior matches yesterday, all held at the Blake Garden at 4:30 PM. In the first match, Pui Ying played Yucai. The two sides competed fiercely. Pui Ying's entire team played with tacit understanding. Yucai also responded bravely, but their defense was weaker and repeatedly broken by Pui Ying, leading to their defeat. After the start of the match, Pui Ying immediately launched an offensive, with Zhou Gengshen, Lu Fangxing, and Huang Huahan attacking from three directions, while Zhu Jinquan and Huang Jiyao also pressed from the left and right. Seeing the opponent's fierce attack, Tan Yimou, Deng Xianchu, Wu Fengxing, and Liao Jianming of Yucai responded calmly, resulting in mutual gains and losses. After a while, Pui Ying took the first game with a score of 21 to 16. Considering the first game's defeat, Yucai's entire team woke up and tried to recover their lost ground. Huang Jiyao attacked in front, and Tan Bolin smashed from behind. Li Zexian, Huang Yize, and Huang Zheyuan also cooperated, taking advantage of their momentum. However, Pui Ying's strength was overwhelming, and Yucai lost the second game again with a score of 15 to 21. After that, Pui Ying's momentum was like a rainbow. With the addition of new players, Yucai felt even more besieged and lost again with a score of 13 to 21. Pui Ying then won with a score of 3 to 0.

In the second match, Southwest played Ying Huang. Southwest's entire team played, and their coordination was consistent. Ying Huang only played with eight players, which affected their offensive power. After the two teams engaged, Liang Zanguan, Guan Heng, Liang Jinwu, and Liang Jinchang of Southwest attacked from four directions, while Jiang Yingchao, Yu Runde, Liang Hua, Chen Lunhui, and Huang Maoxian also advanced separately. Southwest seized the opportunity to launch fierce attacks and won the first game with a score of 21 to 12. Ying Huang, considering the previous defeat, immediately rallied their entire team. Jiang Yingchao and Yu Runde combined pressure, while Fu Zhuohua, Chen Lunhui, and Huang Maoxian suddenly扣壓擊了旁擊, and the back row also provided adequate cover, resulting in repeated successes. They then won the second game with a score of 21 to 15. Since Southwest had an advantage, their entire team was active, and Ying Huang was busy blocking. Their defense deteriorated with a score of 11, and Southwest took advantage of the momentum to launch a fierce attack. Ying Huang was besieged on all sides and lost the fourth game again with a score of 11 to 21. Southwest won with a score of 3 to 1. The lineups were as follows:

Pui Ying Team

Zhou Gengshen, Zhu Zongquan, Li Qinran

### Responsibilities of Football Players

Regarding the forwards, there are five in total. The center forward is the leader, supported by the two inside forwards on the left and right, and echoed by the two wingers on the left and right. The five should have the same mindset and the same goal. When an opening appears, the nearest player should dribble the ball forward. If they encounter an obstacle, they should immediately pass to an unobstructed player and continue forward. When they reach a suitable position, they should shoot directly and quickly, without hesitation. The main points of the attack are steadiness and deception, the more 권威的, the better, and the faster, the better. When the ball is within the opponent's defensive zone, the forward should try to win it back. If they can win it back, they can continue the attack. Otherwise, while they are trying to win it back, the defense of the half-backs has already been set up, creating a second line of defense. If they are hovering in the back, the forward should choose a space to make it easier to pass. If the full-backs or center half-backs intercept the ball, they can easily pass it out. They should have a good understanding of their own and their opponents' abilities and skills after several contacts during the battle, so that they can choose the opponent's weaknesses and attack them. The position of the center line is at the center of the whole body, directly facing the goal. Because there are many obstacles, it is not suitable for dribbling. Therefore, the person who fills this position should first study the technique of passing. If a player is now standing in the best spot, they should pass the ball to them. The person himself can find a chance to shoot if they get the ball within the penalty area. When necessary, they can also switch positions with the inside forwards to achieve the effect of getting the ball in a different location. Those who fill the role of inside forwards should not only take the same action as the center forward's wings and attack the enemy, but also shoot quickly when they have the opportunity. At the beginning of their team's defense, they should monitor the opponent's movements. The two inside forwards who are moving forward should try their best to snatch the ball and increase the defensive power. When their team starts attacking, the two inside forwards should fall back slightly to form a triangular echo with the center forward and the two wings. Although the two wings are also forwards, because of their position, they cannot move around as much as the three center forwards, and there are obstacles on both the left and right. It is easier to dribble into the area. It is often seen that the two wings go straight along the edge, and when they reach within the enemy's rear line, they will pass to the Chinese three forwards to shoot. However, when the two wings are dribbling and sprinting, they should first pay attention to the place where the three forwards are going, so as to avoid the danger of mispassing. When necessary, because the enemy's rear defense is empty and their own reinforcements have not arrived, the right wing or the left wing with the ball should make a decisive decision and not wait for reinforcements to miss the opportunity. Immediately, from the angle of the penalty area, dribble into the opposite goal and shoot. There is also a kind of forward that should be noted again and again.

### Miscellaneous Writings from Western Hunan

— Cao Ming

The cold wind kept blowing, and I didn't know why, but I shuddered. The words of this old man who had been abandoned by the people made me extremely sad, but I still stood there calmly, explaining to the old man in a peaceful tone:

"Yes, many robbers have come from outside, but those robbers are not Chinese. They are Japanese, and they are very fierce. They have sharp cannons and airplanes. They kill our compatriots without batting an eye, rob us of much land, and destroy many of our houses with airplanes. They rape our female compatriots. They are truly guilty of heinous crimes! So now, some of us are fighting them on the front lines, and some of us are going to the rear to intensify training and work hard to produce, and we will definitely kill all the Japanese robbers!"

The old man listened blankly, as if waking up from a nightmare. The old woman was also attracted by my words and turned around to stare at me strangely.

I talked with them for a while before saying goodbye to the ancient temple and the abandoned old couple. I walked along the street, thinking painfully: "Intensifying propaganda to mobilize the masses" and "How to improve the lives of the Chinese people" are two questions.

Yes, let the past be the past. Our future work does not allow us to delay or engage in empty talk any longer.

(4) Difficulties and Problems

The bandits in Western Hunan are probably the most famous and the most numerous in China. They often gather in the mountains in groups of thousands or hundreds, store good firearms, and specialize in robbing all passing merchants and vehicles. Their strength and agility have made all previous suppressors helpless. As for small groups of bandits, most of them are extremely poor farmers. They are scattered in the wilderness, and when they are not robbing, you have no way of knowing whether they are ordinary people or robbers. The bandits near the border of Sichuan are even more numerous and widespread. Unless you are traveling in a large group, you dare not pass through. The bandits there are so poor that they cannot be described. They want everything from the passersby, even a slightly tidy straw mat. They lack too many things.

Before the War of Resistance, those bandits, whether large or small, made every traveler fearful and hesitant to move forward, which greatly hindered the transportation in Western Hunan. After the July 7th Incident, a small number were willing to be recruited by the government and reorganized into troops to protect local security. However, most of them were still engaged in their old tricks, and there were frequent incidents of intercepting and robbing military vehicles. It is said that in a certain place in Western Hunan, a large group of bandits have been exploited by Chinese traitors and Trotskyites, specializing in disrupting the security of the rear and spreading rumors. On the other hand, they are hoarding firearms, preparing to cooperate internally. Although this is a shameless delusion of the Chinese traitors, it is also a painful thing for us.

Those bandits are mostly farmers with a backward national consciousness, but their usual behavior is very about講究義氣. Once, a team of students from a certain university walked from Yuanling to Guiyang and were robbed by bandits on the way. The students were not flustered at all, but were very calm and immediately began to carry out propaganda work there. Later, the bandits saw that they were all patriotic youths and were very moved. So they returned their simple packages and gave them a certificate, instructing the brothers in front to give them some disturbance. If they can well promote the bandits' national consciousness, solve their livelihood problems, and give them good organization and training, then they will all become better and become brave people's armies in China.

Improving production and popularizing education are also urgent needs in Western Hunan. Although the land is barren, if artificial cultivation is added, the production rate can definitely be improved. For example, if old methods can be improved in industries such as papermaking and tung oil refining, can't the quality and quantity of the products be doubled?

Yes, the inability to improve production is of course closely related to the low level of culture. The lack of knowledge among the people will make the progress of the entire society very slow. In order to improve the production rate,

We must popularize mass education. In order to win the War of Resistance, we must popularize education on resistance production.

"The liberation of women must be completed in the national liberation," so the women's issues in Western Hunan are closely related to the entire War of Resistance. They are hardworking, enduring, strong, and brave, but they live such a miserable and vague life. If their strength is not guided to the War of Resistance, then it is a loss to the nation. From the perspective of the women of Western Hunan themselves, their pain will never have a chance to be relieved. They are suffering from the poison of feudal forces and the direct oppression of Japanese imperialism. From now on, they must struggle and strive under two kinds of persecution.

### "On Leadership" Supplement

— Mo Ye

Currently, there are many who aspire to be leaders, some even willing to sell out their country, their people, and their personal integrity, just to satisfy their craving for leadership. It is not surprising that treatises "On Leadership" are selling like hotcakes and are all the rage. However, after looking at the "On Leadership" books on the market, although the content is quite substantial, they do not seem suitable for general use, especially not for those who harbor malicious intentions, loudly chant "peace," and sacrifice everything for their own ambition to become a leader. Therefore, despite my lack of profound knowledge, I have written down a few points as a supplement to the "On Leadership" discourse.

Leaders need the support of their subordinates, so the key for a leader is how to secure the loyalty of their followers. In my opinion, the first essential is the ability to hold meetings. Eloquently express one's own propositions, and optimistically explain the universal happiness that will follow the realization of these propositions. Or, like a few individuals with ulterior motives, deliberately distort the facts, saying how foreign countries are bullying us, to arouse the patriotic anger of their subordinates; or say how foreign countries are foolish, dark, weak, and incompetent, to arouse the greed of their subordinates. In this way, you can lead them to avenge national hatred or "promote civilization," so they will die without regret.

The second essential is the ability to act. Wang Mang's humility and deference to subordinates won him the hearts of the people. Liu Bei's display of tears was always useful. In addition, things like "washing his hair three times per session, and spitting out food three times per meal," as well as "eating after sunrise and tending to affairs while fasting" should be done as much as possible to achieve great things.

The third essential is the ability to recruit. "Cow urine and horse dung, the skin of a broken drum" can all be used as medicine; therefore, even crowing roosters, thieving dogs, and even turtles and tortoises can be recruited and employed. The most effective way to recruit is with banknotes. As long as the banknotes are spent, those who wag their tails and fawn will naturally call friends and gather in gangs.

The fourth essential is the ability to provoke. This is a more advanced skill; however, it is also the most effective secret. Unity among subordinates is a good thing. However, a tail that wags too much is cause for concern, so one must provoke. To provoke is to disable; to disable is to make subordinates disunited, so they will all look to me for importance, and I can control them from the sidelines, doing everything I can to manipulate them and make them useful to me forever.

These four points are the most prominent ones. Of course, there are many other clever ways to secure the loyalty of one's subordinates and maintain one's leadership position. Due to space limitations, I will discuss them when I write a special book on the subject.

However, being a leader is not that simple. Securing the loyalty of subordinates is internal. There are people outside of the subordinates, so there is inevitably an external aspect. Therefore, to be a leader, there are these additional skills to master:

First, bluffing. This is similar to deception, but it is directed at outsiders and foreigners. The louder the fanfare, the better; the bigger the trumpet, the more wonderful. Let the sounds shake the heavens and the earth, startling ghosts and gods. Perhaps there will be ignorant people who sympathize with you and acknowledge your propositions as reasonable.

Second, intimidation. "Those who obey me will live, those who oppose me will die." One might as well adopt a posture of "comforting the people and punishing the guilty." Even if one does not have the strength, one might as well say that if one's demands are not met, we will all perish together. People will see that you are fierce and imposing, like someone falling into a pit, struggling to get ashore, and wanting to bite anyone they see, and will have three parts fear. Once people are afraid, your plan will succeed, and someone will buy your argument!

Third, rallying. Rally what? Rally allies. Those who share the same ideals and have similar morals can be rallied as "allies" to deal with external enemies, increase their prestige, and demonstrate their power. "At the Dragon Flower Assembly," there are people entering and exiting together, how wonderful!

Fourth, begging. This seems to be a tactic only used by leaders who lack ambition, like Shi Jingtang. However, this is also a tactic commonly used by some basic leaders. Isn't that so? Some people are begging: Please invade, overthrow the current leader, and establish me as the leader, and I can make you all satisfied. Secret begging, open begging, distant begging, close begging... Begging until the forehead bulges, perhaps the wooden puppet will actually be spiritually effective, and the robbers will indeed have good intentions, and will bless him to become a leader.

When I write a special book on the subject, I will certainly add many more external skills. I will not elaborate here for now.

A person who has not yet become a leader, but is equipped with these internal and external, civil and military skills, can become a leader; those who have already become leaders can sit firmly in their positions. Those who desire to be leaders today, why not come and try!

In addition to the three serious problems mentioned above, the refugee problem in western Hunan is probably the most significant. The population and agency staff moved from Wuhan and Changsha to Yuanling has increased more than tenfold compared to the original population. Other places like Taoyuan, Zhijiang, and Chao County have also seen a sudden increase in population. They cannot be dispersed, nor can they produce, and the local power supply, daily necessities, and housing are unable to meet the demand. The soaring prices, rice shortages, salt shortages, vegetable shortages, and housing shortages are gradually becoming apparent and serious.

As of this year's first month, as far as I know, there is a refugee children's home in Pushi that accommodates refugee children over the age of twelve, providing for them and teaching them to read and weave, so that children fleeing the war zone can have a home and acquire knowledge and skills. In addition, a "Women's Weaving Factory" has been established in Yuanling, which specializes in gathering women with machine sewing skills to engage in sewing military uniforms and necessities, with excellent results. Unfortunately, there are too few organizations like the "Refugee Children's Home" and the "Women's Weaving Factory." The government and enthusiastic people in society should earnestly help the refugees by establishing more production agencies and facilitating the circulation of goods and stabilizing prices, which would not only benefit the refugees but also the country!

### The Zhou Foot

— Qiao Xia Ke

Since the beginning of culture, the measurement system is an indispensable institution. According to archaeologists, Chinese writing originated in the Yin Dynasty. Thus, the Zhou Dynasty, with its eight hundred years, can be regarded as the adolescence of Chinese culture. Now, I want to discuss how long the foot of the Zhou Dynasty was, hence the title "The Zhou Foot." Various scholars have conducted research on the Zhou foot from different perspectives. As a medical practitioner, I can only approach it from a medical standpoint. However, one point must be considered: with eight hundred years of mandate, the time span is not short, and whether there were any reforms in the measurement system during that period is a question. Therefore, I believe that the quoted materials must be noted with approximately when they date from. Chinese medical books all originate from the Inner Canon, which is said to be from the time of the Yellow Emperor, but since writing began in the Yin Dynasty, it is hard to believe that there were any books before the Yin Dynasty. According to researchers, the Inner Canon was produced in the late Zhou Dynasty, so it seems that the foot mentioned in the Inner Canon can represent the foot of that time. However, when storytellers today tell the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, they will certainly say that Guan Yunchang was nine feet tall, but this foot is definitely not the commonly used construction foot or meter today. Therefore, whether the foot in the Inner Canon is the foot commonly used when studying the Inner Canon, or whether it is still a question, I am very sorry that although I use the Inner Canon as material, I still dare not determine that the foot in the Inner Canon is the foot of the late Zhou Dynasty. I can only vaguely call it the Zhou foot, that is to say, the foot of a certain period of the Zhou Dynasty.

In Volume 6 of the Inner Canon, Spiritual Pivot, there are the following dimensions of the intestines and stomach:

"The pharyngeal opening to the stomach is one foot and six inches long... The small intestine is attached to the spine on the left, circling and overlapping... It is three zhang and three feet long, and the ileum is attached to the navel on the left, circling and spiraling downwards... It is two zhang and one foot long, and the large intestine passes over the spine to receive the ileum, and is two feet and eight inches long..."

Regardless of what it says, let's add up the numbers, which equals fifty-eight feet and four inches. The pharyngeal opening to the stomach, the esophagus, is one foot and six inches long; the small intestine to the large intestine is the intestinal tract, which is fifty-six feet and eight inches long. From this, we can know that the ratio of the esophagus to the intestinal tract is one foot and six inches to fifty-six feet and eight inches, which is approximately equal to 1:36. What is the result of scientific dissection? The same ratio is 1:37! The ancients did indeed work in practice and did not fabricate things out of thin air. Even if the size of ancient and modern people is different, this ratio will not differ much, so we can easily calculate the Zhou foot. The length of the esophagus is about twenty-five centimeters according to the metric system. Then, one foot and six inches in the Zhou Dynasty is equal to twenty-five centimeters, and one foot is equal to fifteen and six-tenths centimeters, which is approximately equal to four and a half inches in the old system. In this way, we know that a "five-foot child" is only a two-foot and two-and-a-half-inch tall child, and a "six-foot orphan" is a two-foot and seven-inch long little baby. Otherwise, the ancients would truly have been terrifying in size. This reminds me of Cao Jiao in Mencius, the "big rice bucket who was nine feet and two inches tall and only ate millet." If he appeared among today's crowd, he would not only not be considered a tall person, but would simply be a midget.

People often have the prejudice that the present is not as good as the past. People often think that the human body is getting shorter and shorter, but the results of research cannot prove it. If the Zhou foot calculated above is consistent with the facts (I remember that a certain gentleman also calculated it, but not based on anatomy, which was slightly larger than the result obtained here, and the blood of the Yellow Emperor did not have the blood of other races mixed in), then the body length is obviously not as good as it used to be.
