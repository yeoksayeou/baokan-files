### The Japanese Militarists' Delusion Has Not Yet Awakened

Today, having read the approximate content of Mr. Hausser of New York's article, "The Awakening Japanese of the Delusion," the work describes the Japanese under the oppression of military fascism - in reality, it should be interpreted as the Japanese people - who have already become quite awakened. This point, deduced from the severe impact of the war of aggression suffered by the Japanese people, has considerable certainty. But on the other hand, the group of aggressors who are mad and arrogant are still immersed in the "sweet-seeming but actually bitter" illusory dream. This is a highly instructive contrast. This newspaper once wrote an article, "Understanding the Anti-War Movement of the Japanese Army," which analyzed the theories and facts of the higher-level development of the awakening of the Japanese people. Here, we will briefly describe the recent delusions of the Japanese rulers.

Japan's war of aggression against China is already on a downward path, as a certain military commander in our country said: The highest point of the Japanese army's victory was the occupation of Wuhan. The fact has indeed proved this. Although the Japanese army has occupied Yuehan for nearly half a year, its military has not made any progress, its strategy has been completely disrupted, it cannot attack the Northwest, it cannot take the Southwest, and it does not have enough strength to carry out the Xiangxi Great Battle. The financial resources, bordering on financial collapse, have no power to support expanded military operations. The military action hitting a wall has caused internal political disputes. It is rare to reorganize the wartime cabinet during foreign warfare. The new wartime cabinet, "most untrusted by the public," almost collapsed due to the Japanese army bombing the Luohu incident. The wartime Congress dared to openly criticize the failures of the war, and the issue of ending the war quickly was also put on the agenda of the parliament. The disordered state of the Japanese political situation caused by the war of aggression against China can be seen in its entirety.

However, the Japanese aggressors have not yet thoroughly awakened, and recently they are still attempting even greater risks in desperation. First, in terms of its war strategy in China, following the failure of its attempts to attack the Northwest and Southwest, as well as the frontal Xiangxi Great Battle, the current trend seems to be an attempt to encircle Xiangxi by bypassing western Hubei. A few days ago, they even wildly bombed Yichang, and Itagaki even raved: "Continue to attack Chiang's regime in Chongqing," which is naturally not accidental. However, the Japanese army's deep penetration is only seeking its own death. It goes without saying that the most taboo in the art of war is deep penetration, according to ancient military books. Just from a realistic perspective, the dangers of the area west of Yichang and north of Xiangxi are useless no matter how fierce the Japanese army's artillery fire may be. Moreover, our army, after half a year of reorganization and construction, is already sufficient to launch a large-scale counterattack against the Japanese army. The appropriate preparations in the Southwest are more than enough to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. At most, they can only disrupt the coast.

Secondly, the Japanese military clique has indeed taken the first step in attacking its hypothetical naval enemies, Britain, the United States, and France, by brazenly occupying Hainan Island. The Japanese clique once deceived Britain and France, saying that its occupation of Hainan Island was only a temporary military necessity. However, according to some sources, the Japanese army has recently added more than 10,000 people to Hainan Island, which, together with the previous six to seven thousand people, is already a considerable number, exceeding the extent of temporary military necessity. It is expected that the Japanese army will not only occupy Hainan Island, but also carry out complete military construction, not only to complete the military significance of Hainan Island, but also to develop its economic role. However, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island has posed a great threat to Britain, the United States, and France. Its blockade of Guangzhou Bay and Annam is very obvious, and there is no need to elaborate. What is particularly noteworthy is the possibility of cutting off the connection between the Philippines and Singapore and encircling the Philippines. The United States will ultimately decide the final victory or defeat in the Pacific War, but the Philippines, the base of the US Pacific naval warfare, is the first to be surrounded. The distance between the American base in Manila and the Japanese base is much closer than its distance from the American and British bases (see Mr. Xu Zhuoying's work in the sixth issue of "Wartime Japan" for details). The United States will definitely feel this threat. It is expected that the United States will definitely establish closer military ties with Britain and France on the one hand, and actively build giant warships to compensate on the other. The predicament that the Japanese navy will encounter will certainly not be less than that of the army today. The Japanese military clique's naval warfare, coupled with the difficulty of fighting against China and the Soviet Union at the same time, will lead to a more rapid overall predicament - although the "simultaneous warfare with China and the Soviet Union" is currently just a kind of intimidation and deception, it will definitely be realized when the Pacific War breaks out.

Thirdly, the Japanese army is actively promoting "localism" in the occupied areas, seeking to ensure the supplies needed for long-term war. However, the result of promoting "localism" and economic plunder will inevitably be an economic showdown with Britain, the United States, and France. Japan recently instigated the puppet organization in North China to implement foreign exchange controls and forcibly circulate Japanese currency, which has met with strong protests from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, denouncing "this measure as hindering the freedom of commerce, treating third countries differently, and violating the principle of equal opportunity" (see yesterday's Tokyo foreign dispatch). Although the Japanese government quibbled that the measure was the idea of the puppet "provisional government" itself and had nothing to do with Japan, Britain, the United States, and France are not three-year-old children and will never be deceived. It is expected that if the Japanese army does not change its methods, Britain, the United States, and France will definitely take further sanctions in economic relations with Japan. Internal diplomatic opinions in Japan are already very divided. Most of the elders, senior officials, financial circles, political parties, and the elder faction in the army advocate a cautious and steady approach to foreign countries, and do not want to have conflicts with Britain, the United States, and France, and also strongly advocate caution towards the Soviet Union. It is feared that the young and strong military officers who are accustomed to acting perversely will also find it difficult to break this internal and external difficult situation.

The Japanese military clique is indeed still obsessed, and the only effective way is the lesson of facts, and the united actions of Britain, the United States, and France bear a great responsibility.

### General Peng Dehuai Talks About Persisting in the War of Resistance in North China

The current national war situation is in the transitional period from the first stage (the enemy's strategic offensive, our strategic defense) to the second stage (the enemy's strategic conservation, our strategic preparation for counteroffensive, that is, the enemy and us are in a stalemate). When the enemy began to "mop up North China" and attempted to attack the Northwest, our insistence on the war of resistance in North China, stopping the enemy's offensive, and striving for the arrival of a new stage, became the current serious strategic task. The reporter recently visited General Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander of the Eighth Route Army, in a certain place on the front line, and asked about the various issues of supporting the war of resistance in North China. I was kindly and earnestly interviewed and given a detailed explanation. The contents of the discussion are now disclosed to the entire military, political, and civilian personnel who are persisting in the war of resistance in North China, and to the national people who are concerned about the war of resistance in North China.

A. Summary of the Seventeen-Month War of Resistance

In the seventeen months of the war of resistance, we have proven that the Sino-Japanese War is long-lasting, and victory belongs to us. China's long-term war strategy has broken the enemy's plan for a quick victory, forcing the enemy to fall into a long-term war. In the past war of resistance, the enemy's financial losses reached 700,000,000 yuan, and the loss of troops reached more than 400,000 people. In terms of other military aspects, nearly a thousand airplanes were consumed, and in terms of naval aspects, more than a dozen warships were bombed and destroyed. This huge consumption has caused serious panic in Japan's domestic economy and politics. Industry and commerce have been severely hit, exports have plummeted, imports have greatly increased, taxes have become heavier, and prices have soared, making people's lives extremely miserable. This situation has greatly increased the domestic political contradictions in Japan, making the class struggle in Japan increasingly sharp, and has widely launched anti-war and anti-fascist movements. At the same time, fundamentally, because the struggle of Japanese imperialism is reactionary, backward, and a war of aggression that violates the interests of the Japanese people, it cannot win the support of the people. On the contrary, because of the long-term and protracted nature of the war, the financial and economic difficulties in Japan have become even more severe, and this difficulty cannot be overcome. It can only increase with China's sustained war of resistance, until the fundamental destruction of Japanese imperialism.

In terms of international affairs, as the enemy increasingly penetrates China, the isolated situation of Japan's international status will become even more serious, making Japan history a source of profit. Because the enemy, due to domestic financial and economic difficulties, is forced to squeeze and exploit in the occupied areas, this will inevitably arouse the firm resistance of the Chinese people in the occupied areas. At the same time, because it excludes the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in China, it is now implementing economic control, foreign exchange control, and transportation control in North China and the Yangtze River basin, which will arouse the resentment of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and make the international relations of Japanese imperialism more isolated. On the contrary, it is more beneficial to China. In particular, the Soviet Union's assistance to China will not only continue, but may also increase.

Now we talk about China's side. In the seventeen months of the war of resistance, although we have lost some land and many cities and railway lines due to the disparity in strength, and sacrificed hundreds of thousands of soldiers, causing great disasters to the people of the whole country, we have gained multifaceted unprecedented progress. This progress is mainly manifested in three aspects: The first is the unprecedented unity of the whole country, the great unity of the entire Chinese people and all anti-Japanese parties in China. This is a major event. It has created the power that China's war of resistance can certainly win. Any fascist aggressor country that encounters this power will suffer serious blows and failures. The second is the great progress in politics. What we must first mention is the establishment of the National Political Consultative Conference. All political members, including representatives of various parties and factions, and national salvation leaders from all walks of life, can truly express the opinions of the people of the whole country, and they have repeatedly decided on the national policy of sustained war of resistance, and suggested that the government establish similar public opinion organs in all provinces and counties. At the same time, many important resolutions have been made in various aspects such as economy, politics, and mass movements to help the National Government and help Chairman Chiang Kai-shek implement the war of resistance and nation-building. The second is manifested in the considerable mobilization and organization of the masses to participate in the war of resistance: anti-Japanese speech has also gained considerable freedom, which is an example of China's gradual progress towards democratic politics. The second is now political unity. The parties that were opposed in the past are now united and working together. The troops that were not uniformly commanded in the past are now fighting together under a unified command structure. The opposition between the local and the central government in the past has now been eliminated. In short, everyone is now united to deal with a single enemy. This is the first major progress since the Republic of China, a progress that was not even made during the Northern Expedition.

We must see these progresses clearly, so that we can have confidence in the war of resistance and be optimistic about China's future. Otherwise, we will not be able to save the future of the war of resistance. The departure of Trotskyites and traitors, undermining unity, undermining the war of resistance, and working for the enemy, is what we should meticulously guard against and thoroughly clarify.

B. The Current National War Situation Is Approaching a New Stage

Since the successive loss of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the national war situation has approached a new stage. However, we should recognize that the loss of Wuhan and Guangzhou is neither a turning point in the victory or defeat of the war of resistance, nor does it equal the end of the old stage and the beginning of the new stage. Because the arrival of the new stage must be manifested in stopping the enemy's strategic offensive and turning it into defense, and in our transition from strategic mobile defense to confrontation with the enemy, creating a stalemate situation between the enemy and us. The current national war situation is in the transitional period from the first stage to the second stage, because the enemy has not yet stopped the offensive, and it is still attempting to occupy Xi'an, Lanzhou, Yichang, Wuzhou and other places, and we have not been able to stop its offensive, and have become a stalemate with the enemy. However, we must strive to stop the enemy's offensive and strive for a stalemate during the transitional period. This is the characteristic of the transitional period and also the goal we should strive for during this period.

Now the new stage is about to arrive. The so-called new stage is the second stage of the war of resistance, the stage of stalemate between the enemy and us. There are two characteristics of this stage: (1) More difficult, which is the same for both the enemy and us. The specific manifestations of the difficulties on the Chinese side are that many important cities in China have been occupied by the enemy, and many important transportation routes have disappeared. The enemy has divided Chinese territory into countless small pieces, the country's financial economy is facing difficulties, military supplies and ammunition are not easy to supply, the establishment of national puppet organizations is possible, and at the same time, pro-Japanese elements, traitors, Trotskyites, and pessimistic and desperate national defeatists will more actively engage in activities, using all means of provocation and alienation to undermine the country's war of resistance. However, the enemy's difficulties are also increasing, because China's seventeen months of war of resistance have greatly consumed Japan's military and financial resources, domestic economic panic has increased, and people's lives have become increasingly painful. Recently, the government of the enemy country has also passed and implemented the National Mobilization Law, which will make the Japanese people's war-weariness and anti-war emotions and the tide of social revolution more widely spread. At the same time, Japanese imperialism will also become increasingly isolated in the international arena. Due to the anti-war revolutionary movement throughout Japan and the deep penetration of Japanese soldiers into the Chinese mainland, the extension of the front line will make it more difficult for Japan in terms of combat, transportation, and replenishment. China is a country with vast land and abundant resources, and a large population. Japan is the opposite, with a small land and a small population, especially with insufficient troop distribution. Therefore, although it has occupied many lands in China, most of them are in the hands of the Chinese army and the Chinese government. Therefore, the consumption and difficulties of the enemy during this period will be even greater. Although China has many shortcomings, because China's war of resistance is a gradual war of liberation, it has the support of the people of the whole country and international assistance. As long as we are determined, united, and fight together, it is not difficult to overcome them. At the same time, Japan's war against China is a regressive war of aggression, which is not only encountering the unanimous and firm resistance of the Chinese people, but also inevitably encountering the fierce opposition of the working masses throughout Japan and international isolation. Therefore, difficulties will not be reduced, but will only increase.

The second characteristic of the second stage of the war of resistance is that China is making more progress, because China's war of resistance is a self-defense war to fight for national liberation. It is a progressive war. All anti-Japanese parties, all anti-Japanese troops, and the people of the whole country who do not want to be slaves will continue to fight against Japan. Only a few stubborn elements lack confidence in the long-term war of resistance and do not recognize the united front, thus stubbornly obstructing the long-term war of resistance objectively. However, these people will be attacked by progressive people and the people of the whole country. The war requires the progress of all parties and factions, and all aspects of China are making progress. Therefore, in the first stage, all parties and factions should closely unite and promote China's greater progress on the premise of mutual respect, mutual concession, common progress, common development, sharing life and death, and working together, more widely organize the masses, arm the masses, better improve politics, establish a new national defense army, improve people's livelihood, establish a national defense industry, establish anti-Japanese base areas behind the enemy, systematically mobilize the people's armed forces, widely launch guerrilla warfare, strengthen international propaganda, and strive for more foreign aid to stop the enemy's offensive, strive for a stalemate, overcome difficulties, prepare for a counteroffensive, and finally drive out the enemy. Therefore, the first stage is actually the pivot of victory or defeat in the Sino-Japanese War. We must grit our teeth and use our best efforts to strive for a stalemate stage.

C. The Strategic Task of Persisting in the War of Resistance in North China

Persisting in the war of resistance in North China is an important strategic task. First, after the enemy captured Guangzhou and Wuhan, its attempt was to capture Changsha, open the Yuehan Railway, attack Zhengzhou, open the Pinghan Railway, and then "mop up" North China. Therefore, one of our current strategic policies is to first actively take action in North China, attract the enemy to attack North China, and disperse the enemy, so that our troops in the Yangtze River basin can get rest and recuperation and prepare for a counteroffensive. Second, the strategic task of our persisting in the war of resistance in North China is to defend the Northwest, strive for a stalemate stage, and then achieve the third stage of counteroffensive. This also requires us to actively take action in North China, attack the enemy, disperse the enemy, and contain the enemy, so that the enemy cannot easily cross the river to attack Xi'an. Third, persisting in the war of resistance in North China can enhance the national people's belief in the war of resistance, and can also apply the experience of the war of resistance in North China to all areas of the country, especially in the occupied areas, enhance China's international status, and at the same time increase the confidence of the world's proletariat and peace-loving people in anti-fascism, and can also provide a model experience for anti-Japanese in various countries in the enemy's rear.

In the past, we have already created many indelible heroic deeds in North China, so that the enemy has to guard the transportation lines, contain a large number of enemy troops, and prevent the enemy from widely organizing puppet troops and establishing puppet governments in North China, and using North China's manpower to attack China, but we must continue to intensify our efforts in order to complete this major strategic task!

D. Estimation of the Future War Situation in North China

After the national war of resistance enters a new stage, North China will enter a more serious situation. Our estimate is as follows: (1) After the enemy stops the overall offensive, it will inevitably "mop up" North China in order to consolidate its rear. Therefore, in the second stage, the enemy must take frequent and serious offensives against our anti-Japanese base areas in the rear. However, our base areas will be strengthened under the enemy's repeated offensives, and the masses will also accept the lessons of blood and organize and strengthen themselves. (2) In the second stage, the enemy will take a divided offensive and a combined attack to attack North China. However, under our flexible application of strategy and tactics, this type of offensive will cause the enemy to suffer serious blows and retreat. However, it will not retreat completely, and it will also establish many strongholds in the offensive in order to continue the offensive in the future. (3) In the future "mopping up" war in North China, the enemy will inevitably use a more brutal policy of burning and killing. At the same time, it will also use deceptive and appeasement policies, robbing the east and comforting the west, organizing royal and cooperative troops, using traitors and Trotskyites, wantonly carrying out activities, provoking alienation, and carrying out disturbances. In short, the enemy's means and policies will be more vicious and cruel after we hit the enemy once. Therefore, we must use hard and in-depth mass work, organize the masses, educate the masses, strengthen confidence, consolidate unity, and work hard, and not be deceived by the enemy's traitors and Trotskyites. (4) In these enemy offensives, the enemy will use economic and military blockade policies, such as destroying our finances and building bunkers. However, as long as we have sound and strong leadership, thorough preparation, and in-depth mass work, it can also be shattered. (5) As long as the national situation improves, the situation in North China will definitely enter a more difficult one, but the enemy will also have difficulties. We must surround the big cities, clamp down on the enemy's troops, eliminate the enemy in the movement, seize the enemy's new-style weapons, and replenish our own strength.

E. Favorable Conditions for Persisting in the War of Resistance in North China

(1) The war of resistance in North China is not isolated, it is coordinated with the national war of resistance. (2) North China has progressive schools of thought, such as the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the Sacrifice League, and powerful and combat-experienced anti-Japanese troops, such as the Central Army, the Eighth Route Army, the Jin Sui Army, and other anti-Japanese troops. (3) North China has 100 million people. In the past seventeen months of the war of resistance, the people of North China have suffered the killings and ravages of the Japanese, so that the people of North China know that "there is only a way out by resisting Japan!" This firm determination to persist in the war of resistance in North China has become an invincible force, and they have already had weapons, political power, and work experience in the war of resistance. (4) North China has a vast area, and the enemy's troops are not enough to allocate, so it will not encircle North China entirely. It can only take a divided encirclement, and a divided encirclement can definitely be shattered by us. (5) North China has anti-Japanese political power and anti-Japanese mass organizations, which have laid the foundation for protracted war and persisting in the war of resistance in North China. Although there are still some frictions between them, under the vast mass base and the enemy's continuous offensives, they will definitely be able to overcome them. (6) The confidence in the war of resistance has been improved among the people in the whole country and in North China. The people in the whole country, especially in North China, are united in the scope of the Central Army, the Eighth Route Army, the Jin Sui Army, and other anti-Japanese troops, and believe in the determination of the troops to persist in the war of resistance in North China. Because the prestige of the troops among the masses has been improved, although puppet troops have been established, they have been continuously attacked and disintegrated by us. The same is true for the puppet regime. In the seventeen months, the heroic operations of the troops have made it impossible for the puppet troops and the puppet regime to stabilize. Therefore, we can say that the enemy's deceptive activities in North China have failed. (7) North China has a large population and abundant resources that can be used to replenish our strength. Therefore, as long as we have a long-term vision and make correct estimates, rather than being short-sighted, we will definitely believe that persisting in the war of resistance in North China has the possibility of absolute victory.

F. Necessary Conditions for Persisting in the War of Resistance in North China

Since persisting in the war of resistance in North China has the possibility of absolute victory, the question now is how to make this possibility a reality. This also has certain conditions: (1) Apply flexible and correct strategies, tactics, and policies; (2) Improve political institutions and form a trinity of military, government, and people; (3) Widely organize the masses, arm the masses, and win the war. This is our primary goal today. Improving politics, organizing the masses, and improving the relationship between the military, government, and people are all for the purpose of defeating the enemy. What North China urgently needs to achieve at present is, first, to widely carry out democratic movements, so that the people of North China can participate in politics, organize provincial and county people's political consultation conferences, and have the people elect political consultation members. Second, it is necessary to more widely mobilize the masses to participate in the anti-Japanese army and strictly implement preferential treatment for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. Third, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to participate in military and economic construction. Now that the important transportation routes have been lost, we demand that we be able to be self-sufficient, and that financial and economic matters be properly prepared. We must maintain the currency of North China, organize local banks, and issue local banknotes, and not allow legal tender to fall into the hands of the enemy to disrupt our financial economy. On the one hand, it is necessary to organize small-scale production in villages and develop handicrafts, and resolutely resist the enemy. Because war cannot be won only by the army, the economy is also very important. Fourth, it is necessary to appropriately improve the people's lives, implement rent and interest reduction, and launch a thrift movement, so that not a penny will be wasted, and every penny must be handed over to the war of resistance. Concentrate material resources and financial resources to deal with the enemy. Fifth, it is necessary to widely launch guerrilla warfare, and the principle of democracy must be adopted in the guerrillas, with open economy and open consultation on important matters. Sixth is the importance of women's work, because women account for half of all human beings. Without the development of the women's movement, it will be more difficult to resist Japan. Liberating women under feudal oppression to participate in the war of resistance is one of the main conditions for holding up the war of resistance in North China. The last point is: Seventh, the military, government, and people must be united as a trinity. The military must protect the government, the government must help the military, the military must protect the people, love the people, and organize industries. The people must protect the military, help the military, and the government must be responsible for protecting the people's freedom, improving the people's lives, and leading the people to participate in politics. The people and soldiers must also support the government and urge the government.

These are all the important points for us to prepare to meet the new stage and prepare to enter the next stage. As long as people work hard to do it, we believe that we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy. (Reporter Zhang Yu of the Minge News Agency)

### The Ebei (Hubei) Bandits Fail to Attack Xiangfan; Xiang River East Side Surrounded on Two Sides; Over 3,000 Troops of the Puppet Regime in Southern Shandong Revolt; Our Army's Counter-Offensive in Su-Ji (Jiangsu-Hebei) Proceeds Smoothly

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shashi, 14th] (1) Our artillery fire across the river from Shayang is very intense. (2) In the Jiukou to Zhengjiaji area, there are approximately 200 enemy infantry, 2 artillery pieces, and over 30 machine guns. Enemy cavalry, numbering between 100 and 200, frequently travel back and forth around Zhongxiang, but there are no stationed troops. The main enemy force is located in the Minglong Lake area, 90 li north of Zhenxiang. (3) Over 3,000 enemy infantry, over 600 cavalry, and 4 heavy artillery pieces have moved south from Zhongxiang to locations such as Shagang and Jiukou. According to people fleeing from the enemy side, the enemy is claiming to attack Shayang. (4) The enemy has transported 4 bundles of boats to the opposite bank of Shayang and 2 bundles of canvas boats to Fenkou, and is also preparing bridge-building materials, apparently attempting to take the opportunity to cross the river.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changde, 14th] Frontline reports indicate that the enemy troops in Yueyang, Chenglingji, Bailuoji, and other places have not taken any action recently. Enemy warships and vessels have also been anchored in the river and do not frequently move.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Location, 15th] Our large army in northern Jiangsu is attacking Huaishulang in separate columns and has made contact with a certain unit advancing south from a certain location. Fierce battles are continuing on the sailing area. The enemy is currently entrenched in a certain area, but all lines have been cut off, and they no longer have the ability to operate.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Location, 15th] The vanguard of our troops has reached the border of a certain area. The majority of the troops are continuing to advance and will make contact with the troops remaining in the area and begin a counter-offensive towards Huaiyin. The enemy in Lianghuai has had their escape route cut off. The troops in each area are also launching counter-offensives, and the war situation in northern Jiangsu will soon improve.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Luoyang, 13th] The enemy has recently launched another invasion from Dongguang, Lianzhen, Deping, Huimin, Yangxin, Qingyun, and Yanshan, dividing into eight routes to attack Ningjin. Our troops, led by Shi and Gao, engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in Ningjin for three days and nights. At the same time, a certain regiment of our forces pursued the enemy on the northeast and both sides, breaking through the encirclement and killing over 400 enemy troops, including a company commander named Mori. They captured over 2,000 rounds of ammunition and over 50 artillery shells. Due to our effective deployment, we only suffered 30 to 40 soldiers wounded or killed.

[Associated Press Dispatch from Shanghai, 15th] A Japanese military spokesperson here stated that several Japanese bombers bombed military installations and ammunition depots in Yichang today.

### The Missing Eurasia Aircraft No. 23 Has Been Found in Western Guizhou; Four Passengers on Board, Tan Guang Not Among Them; Forced Landing Due to Weather Conditions, Pilot Injured

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 15th] The missing Eurasia aircraft has been found in the territory of Qingning County, western Guizhou, after efforts by Eurasia Company. The pilot was injured and is currently receiving treatment. In addition to the four crew members on board, there were only four passengers. It is reported that the main reason for the crash was due to weather conditions. Details of the accident and losses will be fully clarified after receiving the pilot's report.

[Special Dispatch from Hong Kong] Yesterday, a Reuters report stated that Mr. Tan Guang, secretary of the Central Bank, was among the passengers of the crashed Eurasia aircraft. Yesterday, banking circles confirmed that Mr. Tan arrived safely at a certain location on the 13th. The Reuters report is completely inaccurate.

[This Newspaper’s Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 14th] (Delayed) Eurasia Company's large aircraft No. 23 went missing on the 12th while flying from Chongqing to Yunnan. There has been no news so far. On the 14th, the company sent another aircraft carrying food to search and rescue along the route. It is reported that it has been found near Wei. The right leg of the pilot was injured. He still walked to the nearby telegraph office and sent a telegram to Chongqing to report. As of now, there are no reports of deaths among the people on board.

[Reuters Dispatch from Chongqing, 15th] After the Eurasia aircraft went missing, Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang dispatched aircraft to search, but as of this morning, it has still not been found. According to current information, there are 4 crew members and 4 passengers on board. The crew members include the pilot, co-pilot, radio operator, and mechanic, all of whom are Chinese. Of the four passengers, two boarded in Chengdu, and the other two boarded in Chongqing. The time the aircraft went missing was approximately 4:07 PM on the 12th, as that was when the last telegram was received. It is now generally believed that the aircraft was forced to land in the mountains at the border of Sichuan. It may take three to five days to reach the nearest telegraph office from the location of the accident.

### Orders from the National Government

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 14th] (1) Yang Wei, deputy director of the Henan Provincial Security Office, will be assigned to another position.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 14th] The National Government, on the 14th, ordered the Judicial Yuan to submit a report from the Hunan High Court's Chief Prosecutor regarding the case of the prisoner Huang Pengshi, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder in January of the 24th year of the Republic. However, it was found that the prisoner's age at the time of the crime was not yet 18 years old. According to Article 5 of the Enforcement Law of the Criminal Law, a request was made to reduce the sentence. Now, in accordance with Article 68 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the Political Tutelage Period, an official announcement is made to reduce the original life imprisonment sentence of the prisoner Huang Pengshi to a fixed-term imprisonment of ten years, in order to show leniency. This order.

### Eliminating Corruption and Striving for People's Welfare: Supervisory Yuan Explains Complaint Procedures; Must Follow Legal Procedures; Restricting Malicious Complaints

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 14th] In order to eliminate corruption and strive for people's welfare, the Supervisory Yuan has never restricted the acceptance of petitions from the people. The subjects of the petitions should be related to the facilities of government offices and public institutions at all levels, the actions of civil servants, the suffering of the people, and grievances. The people, not understanding this, often abuse the unlimited opportunity by filing complaints about matters that are not within the jurisdiction of this Yuan or are purely within the scope of the judiciary, requesting replies. Some even hold grudges, make unfounded accusations, and submit anonymous complaints without proper form. This not only overwhelms the Yuan with the burden of receiving the petitions, but also keeps the Supervisory Committee members who review the petitions busy, which affects the handling of legitimate petitions. In the future, it is decided to impose appropriate restrictions. All petitions must be copied into an original and a duplicate, with the true name, detailed address, and guarantor, in order to comply with legal procedures. In order to expedite matters, the Yuan will accept requests made by letter, telegram, or oral statement as much as possible and will absolutely protect the names of individuals or groups who report or complain. Other printed materials such as leaflets, declarations, and posters will be ignored. Even if there is evidence in them, they will not have the same effect as formal petitions. If false accusations or conspiracies are discovered, they will be handed over to the competent authorities for appropriate punishment in order to remove obstacles to reviewing the petitions and to maintain the dignity of the Supervisory powers. In addition, personnel of this Yuan, except for the President, Supervisors, or Supervisory Committee members, are not allowed to directly accept petitions in accordance with the law. It is hoped that people with complaints will send them directly to the Yuan to avoid delays.

### Scorched Earth Policy (Part Two): Valuable Experiences and Lessons in the Guerrilla War in the Northern Front

— By Baiyun, Reporter Stationed in Xi'an for This Newspaper

Not long ago, when the enemy attacked Hongzidian northeast of Ying, the civilians not only moved all the belongings from their homes but even locked the courtyard doors from the outside. When the enemy arrived, they saw the streets and alleys were quiet, and the courtyard doors were locked. Suspecting that there were explosives buried, they dared not enter. They had to pour a lot of kerosene on the door of a house and burn it. As a result, only the door was burned, and we even protected a lot of unused matches discarded by the enemy.

V. Methods Still Need Improvement

In some places, it was done too much, which affected military affairs.

For example, the last time the enemy attacked Bailantie in the third district of Wutai, when the enemy was still facing Niudaoling, there was still a considerable distance. We were deploying reinforcements to stop the enemy from advancing. Bailan was not yet in danger, but the civilians had already moved all the belongings from the east four. When our reinforcements arrived, not a single civilian could be found, and no food or supplies could be found, so the soldiers were hungry for two days. Although the enemy had been surrounded, they were unable to resolve the battle due to hunger and cold, and therefore suffered losses.

For example, when the civilians in Fuping implemented the scorched earth policy, they did not even prepare the seasonal clothes they needed to wear temporarily and the food stored in hidden places. After the enemy occupied the county seat and stayed for a while, the clothing and food they needed became a problem. Some civilians secretly wanted to go back to transport it, but when they walked to the mountains outside the city, they were discovered and killed by the enemy.

The preparation work in some places is insufficient, and there is often panic on the spot.

Not only is there no order in the concealment of the civilians, running from large mountain valleys to small mountain valleys, from the mountains to the foothills, just running around randomly, lacking leadership, but even the cadres of the work units are showing panic.

The people of Fuping now have experience. They first hide in a mountain a few miles nearby. When the enemy comes to this mountain, they calmly turn to another mountain, making it impossible for the enemy to do anything. The merchants of Hongzidian are the same. When the enemy comes, they all leave. When the enemy leaves, they immediately go back to open the market, and they are always prepared. The scorched earth policy work of the general public in Hongzidian is even more orderly. They first send away the old, weak, women, and children and cumbersome things, while the young and strong men are still cooking and delivering food for the soldiers and transporting stretchers. When the enemy is five miles away from Hongzidian, the Zou team decides to retreat, and the people move the scattered things out before quietly retreating. The county magistrate and working cadres did not suffer any danger. This can be called an exemplary example of scorched earth policy.

The scorched earth policy work in the fourth district of Wutai is too poor. The civilians have a strong sense of peace, often showing a mentality of seeking temporary security, often treating illusions as facts. After the enemy advanced from Yuxian and occupied Bailan, they already had a look of attacking west along the Tuo River. At this time, the people of Dongye Town and Hebian Village became panicked. When the enemy was mobilized from Guoxian to attack west, the people in Hebian Village even thought that it was the troops of Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengzhao coming to defend and even prepared to welcome them. Only after the enemy's artillery shells came did they panic and flee, allowing the enemy to make a fortune. This is because our propaganda work was not done well in peacetime.

Chairman Chiang has pointed out: In the Second War of Resistance, "Guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare." In the future, we must develop guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines, but we cannot just talk about the strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare. At the same time, we must continue to learn methods such as the scorched earth policy to help guerrilla warfare achieve victory. (March 4th in Xi'an)

### The Sino-Soviet Highway is Being Expedited; 700,000 People Mobilized; Can be Completed in a Short Time

[Correspondence from Shaoguan] A certain senior officer here told reporters yesterday that after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, we had already anticipated that the coastal transportation lines would be blocked by the enemy. In order to supplement this, we planned to open up three international transportation lines: (1) The southwest Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma highways; (2) The northwest China-Soviet highway. The Yunnan-Burma highway has been completed and opened to traffic, and our southwest international trade can be increased. The northwest China-Soviet highway is also very important. Our central authorities had dispatched personnel to the Soviet Union two years ago to sign an agreement with the Soviet government to build the highway and had already mobilized 200,000 people to build it. This section runs from Sichuan through Xinjiang, bypassing several provinces, and reaching the Soviet border. This section is being built by our country, and the Soviet section is being built by the Soviet government, with a deadline of two years. At present, a large part of the road has not been completed. Our authorities believe that since the Soviet Union is actively sympathetic to us, we should further strengthen the exchanges between the two countries in the future, and the completion of the highway is imperative. Now, we are actively expediting the work, mobilizing 700,000 workers to speed up the construction, and striving to complete it in the shortest possible time in order to facilitate transportation.

### Factories Established in Yunnan Province to Manufacture Aircraft; Expected to Produce One Aircraft Per Day

[Correspondence from Kunming] According to official news from the official, our supreme commander believes that the best position for military affairs in the second phase of the War of Resistance depends on the help of the soldiers in the war. Therefore, we are actively planning to open three major aircraft manufacturing plants in the new plan to develop our country's air force, which was formulated some time ago. It has been decided to start the first manufacturing plant first. The factory site has been selected somewhere in Yunnan Province. According to the pre-determined plan and order, personnel have been sent to contact aircraft manufacturers in a certain country. This method has been discussed and settled. What is currently underway is the purchase of machinery and the establishment of the second and third factories. The establishment of the first manufacturing plant has been decided to be realized within a short period of time. It is expected that each factory will produce one aircraft per day in the future.

### The Puppet Ministry of Transportation Terminates the Issuance of Puppet Stamps

### British House of Commons Discusses the Situation in North China; Foreign Secretary Submits a Written Reply

[Reuters Dispatch from London, 14th] Foreign Secretary Butler submitted a written reply in the House of Commons today, saying that the questions raised by the British Consul General in Tianjin to the Japanese side, regarding the steps taken by the Japanese side against the Tianjin British Concession, have not yet been answered. However, the British Acting Consul General met with the Japanese military commander on March 6, and the whole issue was discussed. The Japanese military commander then discussed the matter with the Japanese Consul General in order to obtain an answer. The governments of the United States and France have also protested to Japan. When asked about Britain's reaction to the Japanese military's implementation of a new currency system in North China, Butler said that an appropriate protest had been lodged with the Japanese government, but he was currently unable to know the details. According to Reuters, the protests made by Britain, France, and the United States regarding Japan's implementation of the "new currency system" and other commercial restrictions were very strong. On the first day of implementing the "new currency system," business almost completely stopped. Even the Japanese found it extremely inconvenient and difficult. As for the results, there is no official report yet, but it is believed that the Japanese military, who are forcing the implementation of this restriction, will sooner or later be forced to abandon this plan.

[Reuters Dispatch from London, 15th] The British Committee for Relief of Chinese Refugees met yesterday. Lord Noel-Buxton presided. He reported that the fund had received donations of £170,338 since it began soliciting donations on October 1, 1937. In the past six weeks, the average weekly donations received have been £1,300. The administrative expenses of raising the fund in the United Kingdom account for just over two percent of the fund. Dr. Thomson, Secretary of the Fund Committee, reported that in addition to donations, other important gifts have been received, including tons of alcohol and anesthetics, surgical instruments worth £1,000 donated by the Sheffield factory, and 2,000 packages of clothing, which have been shipped to China, and the shipping companies have provided free transport, otherwise the shipping costs would be huge and a large sum would have to be spent from the fund.

### 沙市在憂患中健壯起來

— 本報特派記者賡雅

When I, a special reporter from this newspaper, arrived at the south bank of the Yangtze River from western Hunan and was about to cross by ferry near Shashi, I was greeted by several cars speeding towards me. In one of them was a high-ranking military officer, seemingly Minister X. When I inquired with an attendant who was about to drive, he replied: "Indeed, it is Minister X." Later, in Shashi, I heard that when Wuhan was retreating and the situation in Shashi was tense, Minister X, traveling light, had already come once. Of course, a high-ranking military officer traveling back and forth in a war zone might not constitute valuable news, but the fact that Minister X was once writing on the solitary and quiet ferry deeply aroused my attention. I remember when the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out, Shanghai had once spread rumors that Minister X was in Beijing, arguing vehemently against escalating the situation, which aroused fierce resentment among listeners. Since the outbreak of the war, the newspapers have been silent on this matter, and it is extremely rare to find any of his statements on the war of resistance. It can even be said that he has been completely absent. After the retreat from Wuhan, the war situation changed drastically. The Japanese spies have been trying to sow discord. The rumors of "peace" and a quick settlement, allegedly listing Minister X's name at the forefront of the "pro-Japanese" faction, now pale in comparison to the fact that Minister X is rushing to the battlefield. It turns out that the Japanese spies are playing their old trick of sowing discord and spreading rumors!

This Yangtze River ferry on the Hunan-Hubei Highway is made of several wooden boats fastened together. Although it does not have the splendor of the Pukou Ferry in those years, its convenience and speed of operation are in no way inferior. If an air raid alarm is heard, don't laugh at its wooden clumsiness; it actually uses the 20th-century method of disappearing and hides without a trace. To the east of the ferry, traffic is cut off; to the west of the ferry, there are still ships from Shashi sailing to Yichang and Chongqing, but they are not regular, and passengers must register in advance.

Recalling my journey along the Yangtze River, I traveled northwest through the area surrounding Dongting Lake, crossing the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers. Admiring their clear and crystalline waves, their slow and gentle flow, felt like encountering Wang Zhaojun, unwilling to submit to the barbarian, but forced to leave the border with her pipa. It truly makes you feel that "there is a special flavor in your heart!" But now, seeing the grand and magnificent Yangtze River, coming from the base province of our national rejuvenation, shaking mountains and swallowing the earth, surging and rushing towards the sea, it will invigorate your spirit and inspire your ambition. Like taking an oath of office, you solemnly accept its inspiration: let us hurry up and work hard, actively strive for a victorious counterattack, and, like the Yangtze River, sweep downstream to recover our Wuhan, Shanghai, and all other lost territories, to save the more than 150 million compatriots in the occupied areas trampled under the iron heel!

After disembarking from the ferry on the north bank of the Yangtze River, turning slightly west along the river, you arrive at Shashi, a commercial hub, a gathering place for ships, and known as "Little Hankou." In the four or five days after the retreat from Wuhan, rumors were rife here, causing widespread panic. When Commander X of the X team was ordered to come here to serve as the garrison commander during this crisis, he patrolled the streets in disguise. A thief, "not recognizing Mount Tai with his eyes," dared to snatch the woolen coat he was wearing, and was immediately captured and executed as a warning to the public. At the same time, the Jingmen-Shashi Anti-Japanese Support Association newly organized a Youth Battlefield Service Corps, recruiting young refugees with a high school education or above to serve as members, with Mr. Liu Longchao, the head of the Philosophy Department of Sun Yat-sen University, as the leader. They launched the work of "stabilizing people's hearts" and cracked five cases of traitors, eliminating the source of rumors. As a result, social order was restored, and the market gradually prospered. Moreover, during the anniversary commemoration, Shashi held a donation campaign. Statistics showed that the amount of donations in two days reached more than 109,000 yuan, which was more than 25 times higher than the 4,000 yuan donated during the July 7th Incident in Shashi's heyday last year. The theater troupes that had once stagnated have now resumed operations with five regularly performing (two each of Chu opera and Han opera, and one of Ping opera). In addition, various mobile drama troupes, singing troupes, and magic troupes from the north and south constantly pass through, performing propaganda, which adds a lot to Shashi's prosperity and color.

The general poor people of Shashi, such as peddlers, rickshaw pullers, dock workers, etc., have a very low level of knowledge and have been very vague about their understanding of the war of resistance in the past. For example, the X aircraft has passed through Shashi many times in the past year, bombing and wreaking havoc in nearby Jingzhou, as well as western Yichang, southern Changde, and northern Xiangfan, but has never committed any offense against Shashi, which has caused them many misunderstandings: some say that Lord Guan secretly resolved it, and some say that a certain traitor provided protection. Although "there is a cause but no evidence," the ignorance and superstition of the foolish people made it so deep that the propaganda teams had to explain in many ways, wearing their tongues out, but rarely achieved the "breaking" effect. Later, with the help of many street storytellers and open-air stage performers, who unintentionally propagated the truth of the war of resistance to them, they gradually changed their minds and even were willing to move the money they used to worship gods to be used for donations. Especially in February of this year, the X aircraft suddenly came to Shashi for the first bombing, which ignited the anti-war sentiment of the people of all classes in Shashi! Any old superstitions were burned to ashes by this bombing!

Many of the famous old opera performers on the streets of Shashi are refugees who have fled from the north and Hankou. They have personally experienced the painful reality of their families being destroyed and their homes ruined, and they have also received short-term training and guidance from relevant agencies, so their propaganda work is still satisfactory. In the crowd at the dockside civilian club, I saw one person standing and one person singing such a Ping opera: "The Cook Scolds Wang Jingwei." The singer made a grimace when announcing the title of the play, causing the audience to laugh:

"I, Old Wang, am a cook in the Da Zhonghua Restaurant in this city." He said with gestures, "I have nothing to do today, so I stroll on the street... Thinking of Wang Jingwei, he is an important person in the party and the country. He once assassinated the regent of the Qing Dynasty and served as the president of the Executive Yuan... Now that the war of resistance has reached a critical juncture, he pretends to be sick and flees abroad, telegraphing his advocacy for peace... I cannot help but take this opportunity to tell everyone about it, and take this opportunity to scold XXXXX him and vent my hatred!"

"Before I speak, I can't help but gnash my teeth and curse Wang Jingwei - XXX!" He began to sing vividly: "As Vice President, you should love the party. Why did you collude with XXXXX and betray your conscience? Today, even if you chew on words, your XXXX name will never be removed. Like this, you XXXX, you will eventually XXXX. As the saying goes: seeking peace to betray the country is obvious to everyone, thousands of times, you XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. I can only curse until I gnash my teeth. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX!" He slapped the hat of the huqin player and knocked it to the ground, causing another burst of laughter from the audience. But Wang Jingwei's great disconnect from the war of resistance made everyone clearly recognize what kind of hateful character he would become amidst the laughter.

Finally, to sum up: Shashi, which had once been frightened, has now returned to its original state. The market is prosperous, people's hearts are stable, the enthusiasm for the war of resistance is high, and everything is gradually becoming stronger, in order to shoulder the important task of being a base for the recovery of Wuhan!

Suddenly, the Czech national anthem was sung from the crowd, and boos were directed at the German army. When the German army performed the Nazi salute, many people responded with the clenched-fist salute of the Communist Party. There were fights throughout the day, but they were quickly stopped by the police. At 6 p.m., Czech police officers drove through the streets, shouting that the German army was invading the country, and that they could defend their country in a calm manner and refrain from any outrageous behavior.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 15th] After Hitler ordered the troops to enter Czechoslovakia, he issued a letter to the soldiers through the official news agency. The content roughly states: "Czechoslovakia is now on the verge of disintegration. Anyone who goes to Bohemia and Moravia will see that the people are full of abuse. Therefore, the German army entered Czechoslovakia on March 15 to be responsible for protecting the lives and property of all people. I hope that German soldiers will not regard themselves as invaders and occupiers of enemy territory, but will assume the responsibility of the German Empire, with the sole purpose of establishing order. However, in the course of the march, if there is any obstruction, no matter how small, it should be resolved quickly by extraordinary means. You must know that your entry into Czechoslovakia represents the Great German Empire."

[Central News Agency, Prague, 15th] The sudden entry of the German army into Czech territory today caused great chaos, and the general population fled in all directions. Yesterday, there was no one walking on the roads, but this morning they were filled with crowds of people moving and migrating. During the incident in September last year, the Czech people were able to deal with it calmly, but this time the incident has completely disintegrated people's hearts.

Hitler left here by train at 7 a.m. this morning. Officials refused to announce his destination. Czech President Hacha and his party also left here this morning for Prague. It is learned that the order to occupy Czechoslovakia was issued before the Czech President arrived in Berlin. While the Czech President was negotiating with Hitler, the German army had invaded within twelve miles of Czech territory. Bohemia and Moravia are now prohibited areas, and tourists are forbidden to enter. It is probable that Ruthenia will be under the protection of Hungary, just as Germany took Czechoslovakia, which will almost certainly become a reality. This indicates that Hungary's actions have been approved and promised by Hitler.

### Czechoslovakia Accepts Hungarian Demands; Retreats Troops from Ruthenia; Baltic States Strengthen Border Security

[Reuters, Hungary, 14th] Hungary presented Czechoslovakia with an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Czech troops from Ruthenia and the release of Hungarian prisoners held in Czechoslovakia. The ultimatum expires at 2:00 AM tomorrow (standard time) [according to Hong Kong time, this morning at 9:00 AM]. Reportedly, "If Czechoslovakia refuses these demands, Hungary will not be responsible for any resulting incidents." The ultimatum lists five demands: (1) Immediate release of Hungarian prisoners; (2) Immediate cessation of maltreatment of Hungarians and granting them the right to organize freely; (3) Supplying Hungarian self-defense organizations with standard weapons; (4) Withdrawal of Czech troops from Ruthenia to begin within 14 hours; (5) Absolute respect for Hungarian property.

[Reuters, Prague, 14th] According to reliable sources, the government has complied with Hungary's demands and ordered the withdrawal of Czech troops from the Carpathian Ruthenia region.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] German radio reports that Hungarian troops have begun entering Carpathian Ukraine (i.e., Ruthenia) and have already occupied Svalava (north of Mukachevo), the location of the recent border clashes.

[Associated Press, Hungary, 14th] A Hungarian government Foreign Ministry spokesperson has solemnly denied reports that Hungarian troops have invaded 35 kilometers into Carpathian Ukraine.

[Reuters, Hungary, 14th] Reports received here indicate that border and Ruthenian regions have experienced numerous incidents of conflict, some involving Czech troops, and Hungarians have been maltreated.

[Haitong News Agency, Hungary, 14th] According to authoritative sources here, Hungary is attempting to annex Ruthenia. This intention is evident in the Hungarian government's official statement, which reads: "It is now abundantly clear that the Czech government is delaying the implementation of the Munich Agreement. As a result, the various provisions of the Munich Agreement have not been realized, and the redrawing of borders stipulated in the agreement has been violated. Since Slovakia's declaration of independence, the issue of Carpathian Ukraine must be resolved promptly. Hungary has consistently advocated for national self-determination. Based on this principle, Hungary has repeatedly demanded the return of Carpathian Ukraine, and the people of that region also yearn to return to Hungary. The Hungarian government has received no fewer than a thousand requests to merge with the region. At the same time, Hungary is determined to acquire Carpathian Ukraine, as much of Hungary's security hinges on the region. The security we refer to is not limited to military or geographical aspects, but primarily concerns the region's forests, which are relied upon by Hungary's water sources and wetlands. Hungary cannot stand idly by while a group representing a tiny minority exploits the country's only resource. These forests have resisted foreign invasion and protected the Hungarian plains for centuries. The Carpathian forest region is the guarantor of the survival of ten million Hungarians. Therefore, Hungary must firmly grasp this guarantee and provide it with new protection."

[Reuters, Warsaw, 14th] Official reports indicate that Polish troops stationed on the border with Carpathian Ukraine have been significantly strengthened.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 14th] It is rumored that the Polish and Hungarian armies have agreed on a plan for tomorrow morning to meet at Narozna in the Lwów Voivodeship of Poland (on the Ruthenian border) and at Wysocko and Skole.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 15th] Yesterday afternoon, King Carol of Romania met with Prime Minister Călinescu for a long time and decided not to adopt special military precautions. The general attitude throughout the country is quite reserved. It is said that Romania will not interfere when Hungary and Poland establish a common border. However, the Romanian Foreign Minister is still in constant contact with the Polish capital.

[Associated Press, Hungary, 15th] It is reported that the Romanian government has ordered a major increase in troops stationed near the border with Carpathian Ukraine to prevent the intrusion of separatist forces.

### US Builds Naval and Air Bases; Seeks Ten Strategic Locations; Improves Guam's Defenses

Short Commentary

### The Fall of Czechoslovakia!

Berlin Radio reported on the 15th that, following a meeting between German leader Hitler and Czech President Hácha, a joint declaration was issued stating that, effective March 15th, the Czech people would be under the protection of Germany. The declaration was signed by Hitler, Hácha, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and Czech Foreign Minister Chvalkovský.

Czechoslovakia has fallen!

The fall of Czechoslovakia is primarily due to the disguised warfare and aggression of German fascists, who exploited domestic traitors in Czechoslovakia by using the false slogan of autonomy to implement division, and then further engaged in actual occupation. Secondly, it is due to the appeasement foreign policy of the democratic and peaceful countries of Britain and France, which attempted to exchange the survival of Czechoslovakia for Germany's guarantee of peace in Europe. The result is that Czechoslovakia has fallen, and the European situation is becoming increasingly critical. Thirdly, it is due to the lack of firm confidence among Czech national capitalists in defending their homeland, and the government's adoption of a policy of humiliation and concession in an attempt to secure temporary peace. Now, the result of compromise is that peace cannot be secured, and the entire nation has fallen, with the people and capitalists alike becoming slaves of the German aggressors!

What major lessons do we learn from the painful experience of the fall of Czechoslovakia? First, it is possible to recognize that fascist aggressors have no international credibility whatsoever. Remember that when Czechoslovakia painfully compromised last September, Germany guaranteed the survival of the Czech state. Now, half a year later, this guarantee is worthless! Second, it can also be recognized that the policy of appeasement of democratic and peaceful countries can only increase the arrogance of aggressive robbers. Recently, if there had been no compromise and concession by Britain and France on the Spanish issue, the fall of Czechoslovakia would not have happened so quickly! Third, it is even more possible to recognize that any country that wants to survive must have the spirit to shed its last drop of blood to fight for survival. All words and actions of compromise, peace seeking, and temporary security will ultimately lead to self-destruction!

### Drastic Changes in the European Situation!

Czechoslovakia has fallen, and the situation in Central Europe has also entered a very chaotic stage. In addition to mourning the tragic sacrifice of Czechoslovakia, we must also be vigilant about the future European situation and even the crisis of a world war!

According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 14th, Germany may take action tonight, and the map of Europe will change. Currently, Germany is filled with the sound of troop movements. It is said that 40 divisions have been mobilized, and 14 more divisions are preparing to move. In addition, two mechanized divisions have already set off for the border of southern Silesia! We certainly cannot say with certainty that Germany has an immediate intention to launch a European war, but it has become almost certain that the European situation will become increasingly chaotic and dangerous.

Currently, the important factors preventing the deterioration of the European situation are: first, the growth of the revolutionary crisis within the aggressive countries' internal people's fronts. This is a fact, but it has not yet reached the extent of immediately launching a large-scale revolution sufficient to stop aggressive wars; second, the progress of the anti-fascist struggle of the sacrificed and invaded countries, but currently and in the future, they will encounter more serious persecution; third, the development of the united front against fascism and aggression by democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain and France. Recently, the friendly relations between Britain and France, Britain and the United States, and Britain and the Soviet Union have indeed made unprecedented progress, but they are still not sufficient to stop the disaster of war; fourth, the growth of the strength behind the Soviet Union's peace policy, but there are also various obstacles ahead. The urgent task now is the unification, solidarity, and development of all these anti-fascist and anti-aggression forces. Otherwise, not only is the disaster in Central Europe imminent, but the world's future will also become more urgent and dangerous. Our country, which is bravely resisting Japan, must also recognize that Japan will also seize the opportunity to launch more violent military and political offensives. We must especially eliminate all words and actions of peace and compromise, and strengthen the power of long-term unity and protracted resistance.

### After German Troops Invaded Czechoslovakia, Britain Issued a Note; Cabinet Held Weekly Meeting to Discuss Expansion; Commercial Representatives Will Suspend Trip to Berlin

[Reuters, London, 15th] Britain has sent a note to Berlin regarding the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. It is expected that the French government will also take a similar step. It is reported that in the recent Central European events, the British ambassador to Czechoslovakia maintained close contact with Czech officials. Czechoslovakia has not requested any advice from the government. The trip to Germany by British Trade Minister Stanley and Hudson is likely to be cancelled.

[Reuters, London, 14th] A diplomatic observer wrote, "When the British Cabinet holds its weekly meeting tomorrow, in view of the importance of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia after twelve years and Dr. Hacha's meeting with Hitler in Berlin, as well as Hungary's ultimatum to Czechoslovakia, which will expire at 2:00 AM tomorrow, the European situation will undergo major changes. It is expected that this matter will be discussed. The current situation is changing rapidly, leaving European opinions no time for generalization. Tonight, British sources said that Chamberlain's report in the House of Commons this afternoon indicated that Britain's attitude towards this matter would be completely neutral.

[Reuters, London, 14th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to questions from Labour Party leader Attlee in the House of Commons today, issued a statement on the Czech issue. The Prime Minister first presented a summary report of the events that had occurred up to this morning, and incidentally stated that the news of the resignation of the Czech government and the independence of Slovakia had not yet been officially confirmed. Attlee asked what action the government intended to take to guarantee the integrity of Czech territory, or whether it intended to consult with other guarantor countries and Czechoslovakia to resolve the current situation. Chamberlain replied that no action was currently being considered. At this point, Liberal Party leader Sinclair asked the government whether it still felt a moral responsibility to guarantee the territory of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain replied that there had been no change in this position from beginning to end. Labour MP Benn suddenly asked who would be responsible for repaying the six million pounds given to Czechoslovakia by the Prime Minister without parliamentary discussion, but the Prime Minister did not answer and answered another question from Attlee. The guarantee undertaken by Britain was for the fact of unprovoked aggression, but there was no such aggression at present.

US Believes War Will Erupt Soon

[Reuters, London, 14th] The current Central European events and the promise of joint British and French protection of Czech territorial integrity have become the focus of commentary in London's morning newspapers today. However, they all believe that the current situation is not enough to trigger the actual responsibilities of Britain and France. Some argue that the British and French guarantees are for foreign aggression against Czechoslovakia. As for the editorial in The Times, it said that the issue of fulfilling the guarantee is not a matter for one country alone, but a joint guarantee issue, and that Germany and Italy are also guarantor countries. At the same time, this guarantee cannot be considered to be related to military obligations. However, all newspapers expressed sympathy for the situation of Czechoslovakia, rather than criticizing Germany. The Daily Mail said that Hitler still has the responsibility to guarantee the borders of Czechoslovakia, and although his ambitions are unknowable, "it cannot be considered that the internal affairs of an independent Czech state are free from outside interference." Some believe that the greatest goal of agitating for the independence of Ruthenia is Germany's, because Hungary and Poland once suggested that Ruthenia be designated as a place connecting the borders of Poland and Hungary, but it was ultimately rejected by Germany.

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The "Star" newspaper here stated that the partition of Czechoslovakia gave people here a bad impression. This new crisis is a prelude to an even greater crisis. According to reports from American diplomats in Central Europe, German and Italian governments are preparing to truly mobilize. Many are warning government authorities that a major crisis will erupt within ten days. Washington political figures believe that today's developments clearly indicate that autocratic countries want to force small democratic countries to submit in order to compete with Britain and France.

French People Calm But Unhappy

[Reuters, London, 14th] According to reports received by Reuters from Paris, French opinions seem to be completely consistent with British opinions. The opinion of people in Paris is "calm but unhappy," viewing the recent events in Slovakia as an unfavorable consequence of Munich. In general, in view of Hitler's repeated declarations that he does not want foreigners within Germany's borders, people believe that Hitler may not partition Czechoslovakia. An official spokesperson in Hungary told Reuters that a well-organized government in Ruthenia is Hungary's "life insurance." It is generally believed that Hungarians believe that after Czech troops withdraw from Ruthenia, the residents there will tend towards Hungary without a referendum.

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The press here believes that the current events in Slovakia indicate that Germany is about to create another September event. "Le Petit Parisien" wrote, "Hitler is taking rapid steps, disregarding legal principles, to control Central Europe. Soon Europe will witness the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.

### Hong Kong's Defense Arrangements Are Tightened Amid Treacherous European Situation; All Forts and Batteries Have Completed Consolidation Works; British and Indian Troops Are Increased Along All Coastal Defense Lines

As the flames of aggression rise daily, the situation in Asia and Europe becomes increasingly tense. All countries are mobilizing their forces and preparing to cope with future events. Under the promotion of the British Empire's national defense plan, Hong Kong has taken action over the past two or three years. Evolving to the present day, the entire security and defense measures have been appropriately completed, and are tending towards a state of full consolidation and strength. Even if an incident suddenly occurs, it will be sufficient to cope with everything. Currently, the European situation has fallen into a very treacherous state due to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. The general public in Hong Kong, stimulated by the fluctuations of the situation in recent days, has some unease about Hong Kong's security and defense, and urgently wants to gain a clear understanding and eliminate doubts. Therefore, the reporter made a special investigation with various relevant parties yesterday, and now records what was obtained to comfort the general public.

Renovation and Consolidation of Forts and Batteries

According to military authorities, the renovation of Hong Kong's port forts and batteries began in 1936 and has been modernized. After several years, all ongoing work has been completed. The forts and batteries themselves have become unparalleled in strength, and no air raid or bombing can cause any damage. The area of each fort and battery has also been completely arranged, and all defense preparations are meticulous and safe. The cannons in each fort are all the latest inventions and manufactures of the United Kingdom, with extremely strong destructive power, and a long and accurate range. Foreign fleets cannot easily approach. The results of defense exercises conducted at the Lei Yue Mun and eastern batteries have been very satisfactory. The western and Stonecutters Island batteries are scheduled to conduct similar gunnery exercises from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM today, and the originally scheduled gunnery exercise at the Silver Jubilee Battery has been temporarily cancelled.

Coastal Defense Arrangements Completed

As for the defense arrangements along the southern coast of Hong Kong and the various coastal lines of the peninsula, they have now been completed and reached a state of full solidity, with no loopholes to be attacked from outside, enough to smash all external sneak attacks. The Sino-British border has also been similarly arranged. The details of the joint sea, land, and air defense exercises held last year were recorded in the newspapers at the time. At that time, the safety and defense of the coastline showed its great strength. After the exercise, everything that was considered weak has now been rearranged. Currently, the coastal stations between Hong Kong and the peninsula are guarded by the British and Indian defense forces stationed in Hong Kong, and strict precautions are taken at all times. Regarding the strengthening of air force strength, the authorities are now stepping up promotion due to the urgent needs of the current situation. All air defense preparations have generally been meticulous. According to the current sea, land, and air defense forces and measures in Hong Kong, it can be said that it has reached a safe state, enough to resist any external aggression, and has close links with Singapore and Australia. Even if an extraordinary period suddenly descends, Hong Kong can be safe and worry-free.

Meticulous Planning for Food Storage

In addition to making full preparations for security and defense forces, the authorities are now making meticulous plans for the equally important issue of wartime food supply, taking two steps: storage and production. In terms of storage, up to now, the government's wholesale stock of various foods is roughly sufficient to supply Hong Kong residents for more than half a year. According to a statistical survey, the number of goods stored in the market and stores for sale at any time can also meet the needs of residents for half a year. Therefore, there is always a preparation in Hong Kong for more than one year. In the event of an extraordinary period, there is no need to worry about food shortages and panic in Hong Kong. At the same time, the authorities are paying special attention to agricultural production in the New Territories, improving seeds, and reclaiming barren fields.

In recent years, under the guidance of the New Territories Farmers' Association, which has a semi-official nature, there have been considerable results. At present, various products have a considerable contribution to Hong Kong's food supply. It is expected that further active development will increase the harvest day by day, which will help the food supply of Hong Kong residents, which is certainly not insignificant.

### Chiang Kai-shek Approves Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce; Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice Not Approved; Difficulties in Foreign Exchange and Import Should Be Resolved by Transporting Domestic Rice; Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Sent Another Telegram Yesterday Pleading Earnestly

The rice shortage in the Chaozhou and Huiyang areas is becoming increasingly serious. The Hong Kong Chaozhou Eight Districts Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Minister Kong, requesting that the Chaozhou Customs be quickly ordered to exempt import duties on foreign rice to provide relief. Yesterday, the Chamber received a reply from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stating that the telegram had been received. After investigation, the Commander of the Expansion Headquarters had telegraphed to the Association about this matter. After review, the purchase of foreign rice required foreign exchange, and the ports of Guangdong Province were all blockaded by the Japanese, making imports extremely difficult. It was still advisable to find a way to purchase and transport domestic rice. A reply had been sent to await the Association's handling. The request in the telegram to order the Chaozhou Customs to exempt import duties on foreign rice should not be discussed. Please inform accordingly. In view of the extremely serious rice shortage in Chaozhou and Meizhou, the Chamber of Commerce sent another earnest request to Chairman Chiang and Minister Kong yesterday in order to achieve the goal of relief.

### A Tragic Murder and Suicide Occurs at the Zhonghe Company on Man Hong East Street: Chen Huihai Chops Companion with Knife, Then Jumps from Building to Commit Suicide; One Dead, Two Seriously Injured; Cause Still Unknown

At 2:15 AM yesterday morning, a tragic murder-suicide occurred at the Zhonghe Company, a Yunnan firm located on the third floor of 99 Man Hong East Street. The perpetrator of this case was identified as Chen Huihai (30 years old), a refugee who had fled from Foshan to Hong Kong. Due to a fraternal relationship with the manager of the company, he had been residing there. Since his arrival, there had been no issues. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, he got up, took two kitchen knives from the tea table in the hall, turned off the main switch for the electricity, and then carried out the attack. Two people were seriously injured as a result of being chopped. Realizing the consequences of his actions, he jumped from the building out of fear of being punished, falling to his death. It seems the perpetrator had a premeditated plan for his actions, not resembling a person with mental illness. However, with the actual perpetrator now deceased, police detectives are currently working diligently to investigate the motive behind his actions. The details of how this tragic incident unfolded are as follows:

The Perpetrator, Surname Chen, Comes to Hong Kong from Foshan

The owner of 99 Man Hong East Street is the Jiehe Chinese medicine shop located on the ground floor. The building has four floors. The third floor is rented to the Zhonghe Company, which traditionally deals with importing foreign goods and textiles to Yunnan, and then transporting local produce and medicinal materials from Yunnan to Hong Kong. The company has been in operation for several years. The manager is Chen Dequan (40 years old). The entire shop has only two partners: a cook, Chen Xiuxiu (28 years old), and a servant, Zheng Xingchang (17 years old). In addition, there are two lodgers: Zhang Zongsheng, a friend of the manager Chen Dequan (35 years old), who has been lodging at the Zhonghe Company for several years; and Chen Huihai (30 years old, the perpetrator), a brother of Chen Dequan with the same surname. Chen is from Jianchi Village in Nanhai County. Three months ago, Foshan fell, and Chen fled to Hong Kong to take refuge. He has been lodging here for several months and has not yet found a job. He usually helps with the affairs of the shop.

Returning from Macau, Savage Nature Suddenly Erupts

In the middle of this month, Chen Huihai said he was going to Macau to look for a job. He left for ten days and returned to Hong Kong late the night before last (the day of the blood case). Chen Dequan, the manager, had a brief chat with Chen, who had just returned from Macau, and then everyone went to bed. Chen Dequan stayed in the manager's room. Chen Huihai set up a canvas bed in the hall, located between Zhang Zongsheng and Chen Dexiu. There was a tea table in the hall, on which were placed two kitchen knives. At 1:15 AM yesterday morning, Chen Huihai suddenly erupted in a savage fury. He got up, grabbed the two kitchen knives from the tea table, turned off the main switch for the electricity, and then raised the knife to indiscriminately chop at Chen Dexiu's head. One knife struck his left eye, causing the eyeball to explode. Another knife struck his face, and four knives struck his head. Chen Dexiu, in extreme pain, woke up from his dream. Seeing Chen Huihai standing in front of his bed holding a kitchen knife, about to chop again, Chen quickly blocked the knife with his hand, causing his fingers to be chopped off as well. Chen Dexiu, seeing how vicious the perpetrator was, feared being chopped again, so he got up, tried to get away and cried out for help. At this time, the perpetrator, seeing that his goal of killing Chen had been achieved, turned around and raised the knife to chop Zhang Zongsheng. Zhang suffered a total of four knife wounds to his head, hands, and other parts. Zhang also woke up in pain and tried to escape. At this time, Chen Dequan and Zheng Xingchang were both awakened by the fright. Seeing Zheng getting up, the perpetrator raised his knife to chase and chop Zheng. Fortunately, Zheng ran away quickly and hid under the bed, thus escaping the danger. Chen Dequan, in the manager's room, seeing how savage the perpetrator was, was extremely frightened and simply curled up in the manager's room and cried out for help.

Chopping Two People, Jumping from Building to Commit Suicide

The sound of shouting for help reached the outdoors. Wu Ping, the owner of the Chenghe Chinese medicine shop on the fourth floor, woke up in alarm upon hearing the sound and went downstairs to investigate. When he arrived at the third floor, he saw that the lights on the third floor were off, and it was unusually dark. He also heard the sound of shouting for help coming from inside the building, so he knew something was wrong. He knocked on the door and asked what was happening. Chen Dequan, hearing the voice of Wu Ping, dared to come out and open the door. At this time, the perpetrator, having already committed assault and injured people, knew that things would not end well. Also, seeing Wu Ping coming downstairs, he feared being arrested. A sense of guilt suddenly arose in his heart, so he leaped out of the building from the veranda, falling to the street. He fell next to the ditch in front of the building, his head resting on the stone of the ditch, his feet facing the road. His head had already been smashed open, and his brains were flowing out. His hand was broken, and he suffered severe internal injuries. He died on the spot. Fresh blood overflowed into the ditch. The horror of his death was unbearable to witness.

Tragic Incident Occurs, Police Detectives Investigate

Wu and Chen, seeing the perpetrator jumping from the building out of fear of punishment, immediately blew their whistles to alert the police. Two Indian policemen who were stationed there heard the sound and rushed over. After learning the details, they immediately telegraphed the Central Police Station to report. The duty officer, upon receiving the report, realizing that the case involved a major homicide, immediately dispatched Deputy Chief Detective Xiu Futon, Chief Detective Ma Fei, Detective Banban XX Shi, Homicide Detective XX Shi, Banban Zhu Xiang, Chinese Detective Huang Liu, Chinese Detective Huang Qiang, Yin Wen, and others to investigate. They also telegraphed the St. John Ambulance Brigade to the scene to first send the two injured people to the Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. Then, the photography Banban took photos of the situation inside the building and the location where the perpetrator jumped from the building, all for future reference in court hearings. The manager and partners of the Zhonghe Company were summoned to the police station for questioning, and their statements were recorded. The deceased's remains were taken to the mortuary in a hearse for autopsy. The police detectives, with the actual perpetrator now deceased, but wanting to understand the truth, are currently working diligently to investigate all relevant parties in order to conduct an inquiry, it is said.

### In Order to Maintain Social Reputation, the Zhong Sheng Society Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss the Matter of the Xiangdao Using the Society Address to Hold a Meeting; Great Dissatisfaction with Xie Feilie's Borrowing of the Name; Decided to Publish a Statement in the Newspaper to Clarify the Truth

Regarding the matter of Xie Feilie of the Hong Kong and Kowloon education sector using the name of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Corps to request borrowing the Zhong Sheng Charitable Society's address to hold a meeting for the Xiangdao industry, which aroused controversy among the Zhong Sheng Society members, the Zhong Sheng Society held a special emergency meeting at 8:00 PM last night. More than 20 people attended that evening, including Chairman Chen Lanfang, Zhou Xingchi, Lu Guomian, Zhang Lanzhou, Lu Shaoxian, and Liu Yuyun. First, Liu Yuyun, the General Secretary of the Society, reported on the establishment of the meeting for Xie Feilie to borrow the Society's address, stating briefly that on the morning of the 13th of this month, Xie Feilie, who claimed to be a director of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Corps, visited Yuyun but did not meet him. Later, it was learned that Mr. Xie's intention was to borrow the Society's address as a meeting place for the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Corps. A message was conveyed to Mr. Xie, requesting him to formally or officially write to the Society to borrow the address. Unexpectedly, an official letter did not arrive, but people who were summoned to the meeting came one after another. It was not until 2:30 PM that an official letter from the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Corps was received. It was then learned that the Xiangdao industry was holding a meeting. Yuyun was shocked and immediately went to the Society to inspect and wanted to stop the meeting, but it was too late to execute. This was the truth about Mr. Xie Feilie's borrowing of the name of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Corps for a meeting for the Xiangdao industry. This was revealed in the newspaper the next day, causing concern among the Society members. Moreover, XX Tuanzhang Zhang Tianxx Jun came to see XX and stated that there was no meeting called that day. This was Mr. Xie's personal matter and had absolutely nothing to do with the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Corps, he said. After Mr. Liu's report, Chairman Chen Lanfang stood up and said that the outside world was rumored that the Society had dealings with the Xiangdao industry. Xie used the name of the Relief Corps to hold a meeting for the Xiangdao industry, causing many criticisms from the outside world. Please take note. Finally, Chen Shaotang and Lei Yinxx said that Xie Feilie clearly participated in the meeting but issued a correction letter to various newspapers to correct, saying that there was no such thing. Moreover, during the meeting that day, the Xiangdao meeting elected Xie as "Commercial Advisor of the Xiangdao Industry Advancement Society," but the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Corps sent a letter denying that they had borrowed the meeting place from the Zhong Sheng Society. In view of the above, Xie dared to use the name of the Relief Corps to hold the Xiangdao meeting. Based on the above reasons, Xie's actions were contradictory, they said. Finally, it was resolved to publish the letters from Xie Feilie and Zhang Tianlong in the newspaper, severely criticizing Xie's contradictions, so that the public can understand the truth, it was said.

### West River—The Tomb of the XX

—Luo Xia

A Conversation with Zheng Qingguang, Head of the Military Service Corps, Upon His Return to Hong Kong

West River—The tomb of the XX. They want to invade further, but they have to pay a great price. Our war is absolutely optimistic!" A firm youth, Zheng Qingguang, head of the Boy Scout Military Service Corps, told the reporter this in one sentence. He continued, in a firm tone, to tell us the reasons why we should be optimistic.

Guangzhou has fallen, and the Battle of Wuhan has also come to an end. A group of XX shining brightly on the Jiangxi battle lines have all returned to Guangdong to fight to protect their hometown. In order to prevent the XX from advancing westward, the entire West River line has long been planned and constructed with solid defensive works. How diligently the soldiers are doing this important work! From 6:00 in the morning, they started digging until 8:00 in the evening. Even when they are exhausted, you will never hear them complain about their hard work. Although the enjoyment is so bitter, they eat salted soybeans with rice. In fact, it is helpless, because rice is too expensive. The commander also adds a few pounds of green vegetables, which is the only luxury.

Under the wise leadership and supervision of Commander Deng Longguang, the soldiers are so excited to complete this arduous defense project so quickly. The deep trenches were completed, luring in our XX. However, in fact, the XX are a bit weak, and there is no such great strength to test the effectiveness of our solid works, so there are often only small contacts, and no major battles. When our soldiers are mentioned fighting the XX, everyone is energetic, especially when attacking the XX at night, which makes them even more excited, because every time they go out, they will never return empty-handed, not to mention that there are rewards to be given upon return.

"Soldiers disturb the people, and the people fear the army." This is only a historical relic. They marched from Nanchang to the West River, passing through dozens of days of journey. This obstruction and some estrangement are not encountered. On the contrary, in the large and small villages and towns along the way, the people warmly welcome the soldiers wherever they go. Some cities and towns even prepare tea in advance and cook porridge for the hardworking soldiers to eat, adding the words "comfort" to these porridge and tea. The XX image of eating pots of syrup seems to be seen again today. What an exciting story!

The large team marched to a certain place upstream of Qingyuan. The local people warmly welcomed them. In the evening, they also held a military-civilian campfire party in the open-air area. In the blazing fire, the army and the people talked affectionately, enjoying the beauty, singing to their heart's content, and being as close as a family. The large team arrived at the West River, and the feelings of the army and the people were the same. The common people often talk about helping the army. What is particularly gratifying is that the people are enthusiastically participating in the work of clearing out the traitors, making the ugly types who betray the nation nowhere to hide.

The formation of this good phenomenon of military-civilian unity, on the one hand, is of course the effect of propaganda and strict discipline, which has won the love of the masses, but on the other hand, it is also due to the XX. It is said that in the area occupied by the XX, there is a place called Jinli Xu. When the XX first arrived, the locals traded with him in the same way, but as the days passed, the original XX gradually revealed itself. Therefore, XX, XX, and everything was done. After this, it was a bit difficult for him to buy things, and he was often attacked by the villagers. Naturally, the XX's cruel methods would make everyone wake up.

Looking at the army and the common people in the war zone, they are so enthusiastic, how can the XX find it difficult to invade half a step more? Undoubtedly, our loyal and brave soldiers are all "sharpening their swords" and preparing to give the XX a fatal counterattack. However, can the people in our rear, especially the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, who are in a comfortable nest, stand idly by? Spring rain is continuous, the road is muddy, and the heavy soldiers are walking in the rain wearing only tattered clothes. How urgently do they need rain gear and socks!

He—Zheng Qingguang, this time to Hong Kong, is to collect these items! Finally, he talked about his feelings about working in the war zone. He said: "The soldiers at the front are desperately resisting the war. He is very eager to know whether the people in the rear are also working as enthusiastically as they are. Comfort items and comfort teams going to the war zone show the people's concern for the soldiers. The soldiers get this kind of spiritual comfort, which further strengthens their determination to fight to the death. I hope 'people in the city. Go to the war zone!'" He ended his conversation like this.

In order to respond to his call, the Four Women's Joint Association, Lingnan Branch, and other groups are preparing to donate a large amount of comfort items, medicines, and rain gear to these loyal men. Moreover, the Girl Scout Corps of the Young Women's Christian Association is preparing to organize a comfort team to the West River front during the holidays. It is hoped that the Chinese overseas in Hong Kong will enthusiastically contribute money and effort!

### The Prospects for Sino-British Cultural Cooperation: HKU Cooperates with Our Universities

—Qi Zhuo

Hang Liwu, Secretary of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, Will Arrive in Hong Kong Tomorrow to Discuss Everything

"Self-reliance" is the "unquestionable truth" that we should follow. However, in response to the needs of objective circumstances, striving for the understanding, sympathy, and assistance of friends—especially Britain—is also an urgent task at this time and place.

Reading that the University of Hong Kong, the highest institution of learning in Hong Kong, will cooperate with universities in our country, and that the Governor of Hong Kong will appoint many important Chinese and British officials to form a committee to be responsible for this matter, we are happy on the one hand and skeptical on the other. The joy is the joy of the hand-in-hand of Sino-British culture, which is urgently needed in Hong Kong; the suspicion is how it will be done in the end.

In order to get the answer to the mystery of suspicion, the reporter went to the Chinese Academy of the University of Hong Kong yesterday to interview Mr. Xu Dishan.

Mr. Xu is a well-known scholar and an amiable elder. In his conversation, it can be known that his situation and a piece of hard work can't help but make people deeply admire him.

What exactly is the way that HKU cooperates with our country's universities? The following are Mr. Xu Dishan's answers to reporters:

"The University of Hong Kong originally had a hospital, an engineering college, and a faculty of arts and sciences, a total of three faculties. Now, it is planned to take out the science department of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and merge it with the Engineering College to expand its scale into a Polytechnic College. The source of funding for this newly born Polytechnic College is to withdraw funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund. This is the economic foundation laid by cooperation.

"Regarding the method of cooperation, in principle, it is planned to establish a number of scholarships to recruit outstanding students from well-known universities in the country.

Mr. Xu also said with great concern:

"If you want to know the detailed and specific methods, you can ask Hang Liwu, the secretary of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee. Because he is responsible for contacting the HKU authorities."

Upon hearing the news, the reporter said goodbye to Mr. Xu and immediately went to the HKU office to inquire about Mr. Hang. According to the HKU school authorities, Mr. Hang Liwu has already replied by telegram that he will be able to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow (the 17th). In this way, the specific method will have to wait until Mr. Hang comes to hold a meeting before it can be decided. We deeply express our infinite hopes for Mr. Hang's mission on this trip.

For the sake of the urgent need in fact, we are willing to provide XX hope as a gift to welcome Mr. Hang tomorrow:

1. There are more than 500 students in the current University of Hong Kong. Foreign students—including Annamites and Siamese from Southeast Asia—only account for fifty to sixty people. Purely British citizens account for only four or five people. However, among the students studying Chinese, only four or five out of one hundred people are studying Chinese, which is a disheartening number. It is really inappropriate for Chinese people not to understand Chinese and not to understand Chinese characters. In the past, many HKU graduates have returned to their motherland, but there are facts that there is no way to serve their motherland. Therefore, we hope to make Chinese a compulsory subject, this is one.

2. There is only one Chinese professor at the University of Hong Kong, Mr. Xu Dishan. In addition, there are two lecturers who are also Chinese. Therefore, we hope to add and employ Chinese scholars who have confidence in strengthening Sino-British relations to serve as professors, so that they can be matched with the national conditions, this is two.

3. Establishing scholarships is indeed one of the good ways, but at most, it is only four or five, or seven or eight. In order to make the young people of our country who are ambitious get the opportunity to study more universally, we hope to reduce the tuition fees to reduce the burden on poor children, this is three.

The above three points are also what many people who care about overseas Chinese education want to say. It is hoped that Mr. Hang and the members Wei Xuhe and Li Zifang will sincerely discuss with the HKU authorities and make them conditions for negotiation and cooperation. With Britain's consistent sympathy and help to China. Judging from the tasks of the committee announced in the March 4 Gazette, I believe that this super-code request will definitely be possible. I deeply hope that Sino-British culture will join hands!

### Guangdong XX Becomes Noisy to the North, Our Army Repeatedly Smashes Against the XX, the Divine Eagle Team Launches and Bravely Bombs the XX Array in the Rain, Releases Leaflets to Persuade XX to Wake Up and Realize

[Northern Guangdong Quick News] For days on the front line of northern Guangdong, there have been occasional overcast skies and rain. Apart from occasional minor skirmishes between the two sides, the war situation is still silent. However, the XX army continues to reinforce, setting up outposts between the Zengcheng, Conghua, and Huaxian strongholds, and occasionally sending out small detachments to harass and probe the reality of the defenses, all of which have been repelled by our individual attacks. According to intelligence, the XX's conspiracy to commit crimes in the north is gradually becoming apparent. In recent days, large quantities of military equipment and grain have been stored at Huangsha Station and Shijing Longyan XX, along the Yue Han Railway, waiting to be transported. For days, the XX army has been busy transporting goods on the Yue Han Railway and the Guanghua, Guangyun, and Guangzeng highways. Because they fear being attacked by our new air force, they mostly transport at night. After Commander Zhang, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, learned of the XX's conspiracy to peep north, he telegraphed to the defending troops on the front line to closely monitor and block it, waiting for the XX to attack. Currently, the Liang, Kong, Peng, and Chen divisions of a certain group army on the Huaxian front have taken advantage of the XX's busyness in setting up outposts to launch a surprise attack on the XX. The attacking troops of our Peng and Chen divisions have launched surprise attacks on the XX troops stationed in Xinjie Heng, Longkou, and other places in recent days, and have all gained something. On the 12th, our Divine Eagle Team of six aircraft attacked the Huaxian XX array and the Lingkong area of Shijiao, Xiangshan, and Longtan in the rain. They soared for a long time, reconnoitering the XX army's persuasion. The XX soldiers, fearing that our aircraft would drop bombs, fled in embarrassment to the suburbs. Our aircraft calmly dropped more than a dozen bombs on the XX positions and released a large number of propaganda materials, persuading the XX pseudo to quickly wake up, defect and return to the right, and not be fooled by the XX warlords to make unnecessary sacrifices. Our people were extremely excited when they saw this scene, it is said.

### After the Fall of Daliang, Raiders Harass Nearby Villages; Frightened Residents are Coerced into Joining Guerrilla Forces; Observing Enemy Movements, They Appear to be Eyeing Rongqi and Guizhou

[Shun News Flash] The bandits entrenched in Jiujiang and Longjiang are constantly dispatching troops to various villages to implement their so-called "mopping up" policy in order to eliminate our guerrilla forces and consolidate their lines. From the 9th to the 11th of this month, for three consecutive days, troops harassed dozens of villages near Lu, Shuiteng, Daliang Village, Xiaoliang Village, and Lelou and Xianting. However, their tactics have changed compared to before, and they have adopted a more appeasing policy. Every time they arrive in a village, they convene a so-called "pro-bandit" meeting of villagers. The bandit leader puts on a show of amiability, and instructs Chinese traitors to use their silver tongues to tout "benevolent rule". They then order the villagers to persuade their sons and nephews not to join the guerrilla forces, otherwise the entire village will be burned down. They use this kind of toxic propaganda to alienate our people and weaken our resistance forces, and order each village to organize a local puppet maintenance society, elect a village head, number houses, investigate household registrations, and issue "good citizen certificates" to each household. According to their propaganda, this is for protection, but in reality it is to monitor our people and prevent our troops from operating. However, our people are aware of their treachery and few are deceived by their tricks, and they unanimously refuse to cooperate. Furthermore, since Lelou Market was ravaged again by the bandits, most of the businesses have closed down, the residents have scattered, and it has become a ghost town.

Another report states that the bandits entrenched in the two Longs divided into three routes on the morning of the 12th and reoccupied Daliang. The news has already been reported in newspapers. According to a Mr. X, a Shun county government official who just escaped from Daliang, in addition to what was reported earlier about the circumstances before and after the bandit attack on Daliang, there is one thing that should be recorded. After the bandits entered Daliang, they discovered announcements with the names of the bandit headquarters and the Nanhai puppet administrative commissioner Li XX, the wording of which was extremely bizarre and absurd, and unbearable to look at. The announcement was printed with type, which shows that they had made considerable preparations before their re-invasion of Daliang. It is said that the Nanhai puppet administrative commissioner Li XX has recently been appointed by the bandits to concurrently serve as the puppet commissioner of Shunde. In addition to stationing troops in the county government, the county's First Elementary School, the Sericulture Improvement Bureau, and various places in the suburbs of Daliang, on the 13th a unit of about 200 men also arrived at Shatou and were stationed there to guard the Rongliang Highway and cut off traffic. Observing the bandits' movements in this attack on Daliang, it seems that they intend to occupy it for a long time and are eyeing Rongqi and Guizhou.

### Southern Defense Becomes More Consolidated; Qu Shounian's Troops Head to Maoming; The Defense of Qinlian is Tight and Impregnable; Bandits Plan to Change Tactics and Target Maoming and Xinyi

[Southern News Flash] After a part of Guangdong Province was occupied, the bandits urgently wanted to capture Guangxi. However, with our troops gathering in the upper reaches of the Xijiang River, relying on the natural barriers and vowing to defend it to the death, the bandits have not been able to cross Sanshui since May. Therefore, they changed their strategy and tried to invade southern Guangxi by detouring through the south. Our military authorities saw through their plot and dispatched more troops to station in the south, while stepping up the organization and training of the people. After months of deployment, the south is now as solid as a rock. The bandits have been spying in every way, but there is no weakness to exploit. The military deployment of the bandits on Zhou Island, which was originally intended to attack Hepu, has now been shifted to conquering Qiongya. Later, the bandit ships also planned to harass Xuwen, but retreated due to our strict precautions. In recent days, the bandits have come up with a cunning new plan, thinking of taking advantage of our unpreparedness to advance towards Maoming and Xinyi, directly threatening Guangxi Province. The Bai coastal ports are numerous and scattered, and places like Shuidong and its nearby Meilu are easily threatened by bandit ships. The inland roads are crisscrossing and difficult to defend, so the bandits plan to exploit this weakness and launch a large-scale invasion. According to news received in recent days, more than 20 bandit ships have successively arrived at the Dianbai waters from the Qiongzhou Strait, and their intentions are becoming increasingly clear. In order to make the defense of the south more solid, the Southwest Headquarters has specially sent Qu Shounian's troops to the south to prepare for any eventuality. At the moment, the troops have arrived at a certain location and are deploying separately. The newly formed 19th Division, led by Huang, currently stationed in the south, is Qu's old unit, and the Guangxi army led by Wei Yunsong also has a close relationship with Qu. Now, working together, they are responsible for consolidating southern Guangdong and will surely secure the south forever.

### Dongbao Remains Peaceful as Usual; Our Troops Surround Wancheng and Shilong; Our Strength is Formidable and the Bandits Dare Not Act Rashly; Many Rumors are Deliberately Spread by the Bandits

[Shenzhen News Flash] The bandits entrenched in Dongguan, Youlong, Taiping, are under the threat of attacks by our guerrilla forces and are constantly planning to move rashly, hoping to eliminate our troops. However, our strength is formidable, and they have not dared to act rashly. In recent days, there have been many rumors in Dongbao, but they are all deliberately spread by the bandits as a scare tactic. Therefore, Dongbao remains peaceful as usual. Although there are occasional traces of bandits, they are only harassment in nature. The various situations obtained in the past few days are recorded as follows:

Our Troops Surround Wancheng and Shilong

Zhang Wodong, deputy commander of the Fourth Guerrilla Column and concurrently county magistrate of Dongguan, seeing that the bandits in Dongguan were蠢蠢欲动, took decisive action and took the initiative. He is now personally leading more than a thousand troops to the front lines of Dongguan, advancing on Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping, surrounding the bandits and maintaining strict control. At the same time, he also dispatched a unit of basic elite troops to the villages along the Wanzhang Highway to eliminate the bandits who come out to harass. Therefore, our troops have been very active in various parts of Dongguan in recent days. It was found that the assassination squad organized by our guerrillas learned that bandits was in 企步, recruiting Chinese traitors and organizing a puppet maintenance association. Our assassination squad disguised themselves as farmers and broke into the puppet maintenance association. At that time, the bandits were 正在坐高谈. Our assassination squad members, with敏锐action, killed the puppet chairman and captured four puppet committee members alive, and 解回 to the headquarters for punishment. Now, the puppet organizations in various villages, impressed by the神勇 of our troops, are extremely frightened and have纷纷解体, making作鸟兽逃散. The other villages are mostly unexploited by Chinese traitors and do not organize puppet maintenance associations.

Zhang XX Succeeds to Puppet Position in Dongguan

Since the bandits captured Dongguan, they appointed the traitor Zhang XX as the puppet county magistrate. After Zhang逆 took office, 狐假虎威, relying on bandit power, theycolluded狼狈为奸, forcibly徴暴敛,肆意残害民众. The people have been榨取之剩骨. He had already 已经被 our guerrillas 炸之击毙. At that time, a bunch of 凉血奸奸 were taking advantage of the opportune time逐鹿, not hesitating to 獻媚 to the bandits by every possible means. The bandit Zhang訓夺得, and he was already 袍笏登场, accepting the puppet's orders yesterday. However, the bandits still harbor doubts and vigilance towards Zhang逆 and are unwilling to trust him deeply. They imitated the methods of various counties in Nanhai and sent Li Liren as an行政专员 in Dongguan, ostensibly to assist and guide administration, but in reality to secretly create具一位,互相监督. The bandits'计用心, it can also be said奸险已极矣.

Taiping Bandits Harass Xiaobian Again

The bandits stationed in Taiping have continuously dispatched数十名troops to harass上下山门,南北一带滋慢. They have 收买 many Chinese traitors. On the 14th, they also sent over a hundred troops to harass border areas of and organized a伪. They sent Chinese traitors to Bao'an territory of Huangsonggang, Niaoshizhang and Shajing. Forced鄉民到萧边 receive citizens certificate、繳納×餉、否则派队搜捕, 焚杀勿论、以为威吓. Now the鄉民 have联呈 the fourth Guerrilla Column headquarters and sent troops to protection, 免被污辱云.

### A Tour of New Danshui (Continued)

— Furan

(II) New Posture of the National Salvation Movement

Expanding the organization of the People's Anti-Enemy Support Association and stepping up anti-traitor work are the two major events at present. Danshui fell 得so quickly, the reason is: on the one hand, due to the防车的, on the other hand, the work of mobilizing the people was not done enough. The Anti-Support Association is Danshui's highest national salvation organization, and it naturally pays more attention to the future work of the people. Due to the lessons of past experience, it is impossible not to make a new adjustment at this time: it was decided to reorganize the internal organization, in addition to the original propaganda, organization, education, and general affairs departments, a Anti-Traitor Public Member Committee (organized jointly by local party, government, military, and national salvation organizations) and Danshui News Agency were established.

After the fall of Danshui, the bandits organized a Danshui Security Maintenance Association, with a total of more than thirty people. After the recovery of Danshui, most of this group of traitors had already run away. A few who were not very clever were killed by the guerrillas at that time.

The issue of traitors is one link in the political issue. The work of punishing traitors must not be乱来 in accordance with the Military Commission's Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, especially in special circumstances. If it is handled improperly, not only will it fail to prevent the rebirth of traitors, but it will also make it easier for the bandits in politics! Therefore, the Anti-Support Association authorities are particularly cautious and thorough in this work. They have conducted many investigations into a group of pseudo-characters in the Danshui Security Maintenance Association. Most of them went down the road of traitors in order to preserve their own property or were forced to do so. Therefore, the Anti-Traitor Committee immediately weighed the local environment and decided on several principles for punishing traitors:

1. Those who voluntarily become traitors and甘为the bandits to act as lackeys will be sentenced to death, and all their property will be confiscated to be used as funds for the War of Resistance or to relieve refugees.

2. Those who joined the pseudo-organization and did not do bad things but only sought to preserve their wealth will be exempted from the death penalty and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment or fined.

3. Those who were forced to do good things and are willing to surrender will be allowed to rehabilitate themselves.

4. Those who were traitors before and then carried bandit weapons,俘护 the bandits' officers and soldiers, carried the bandits' maps, and other intelligence beneficial to our side to surrender will be exempt from punishment and given a heavy reward.

After these principles were promulgated, a group of figures from the Security Maintenance Association returned to surrender one after another. In addition to dealing with them in accordance with these principles, the association was also afraid of the abuse of "doing favors" or "having private interests" that might easily let a traitor go, so it established a search network that was distributed in various townships and secretly investigated traitor suspects who had surrendered or had not surrendered, to launch a surprise attack on traitors and prevent them from escaping.

(III) Amazing Development of the Anti-日Comrades Association

The People's Anti-日Support Association is active in the Danshui town after the catastrophe with a new posture. It is adopting a new style in the work of broadly mobilizing the masses of members, launching the organization of Anti-日Comrades Associations in various townships. "All people who are unwilling to be subjugated people can join the Anti-日Comrades Association." Under this slogan like an alarm bell, people of all ages, men and women, who have been devastated by the bandits in various towns have very enthusiastically joined the organization of the Comrades Association. With the support of national salvation workers from all over the country, seven or eight towns have established township branches of the Anti-日Comrades Association in one month. For example, Xinxu township, with a population of only more than 9,000, has more than 2,500 members, including about 400 armed strong men. The development of the Anti-日Comrades Association in other townships such as Qintan, Qiuxi, Pingshan, Shengtang, Hangzi, Guigang, and Yinan is also in full swing. The total number of members in Danshui has reached more than 10,000.

Thorns, Thorns

(I) Activity of Traitors and Chaos in Social Order

Due to the bandits' conspiracy to launch another attack on Dongjiang, the number of traitors who have recently sneaked into Danshui is quite active, often spreading rumors and creating disturbances. Even in Danshui City, which is heavily guarded by the military and police, there are several scares a day. False rumors such as "The bandits have landed in Aotou," "The bandits are attacking Xinxu from Zhangmutou," and "The bandits are going to bomb Danshui on a certain day" are heard in every false alarm at all times. The order in Danshui has been disrupted by these rumors.

Secondly, sabotage of telecommunications is also very serious. The telegraph lines on the Danhui and Tan'ao roads are often inexplicably unable to get through. In Xinxu, the telegraph lines and poles have been destroyed for several consecutive days. Although the authorities are trying their best to investigate and prevent it, it is still quite serious.

Also, because the number of unemployed people has suddenly increased after the disaster, and those who have suffered are displaced and unable to make a living, they have taken risks in an attempt to get rich and rebuild their families by chance. All of this has created a source of robbery and gambling. Since the recapture of Danshui, the trend of robbery and gambling has indeed become the biggest problem in public security. Although all parties have used all their strength to put it out, it is still quite serious.

### The Unknown Husbands of Several Famous Actresses

— Continued

When they decided to marry, Qin was also performing on stage in New York. After the marriage, she returned to Hollywood, and they felt that the life of being separated in two places was too bitter. Frank resolutely gave up his career interests and followed her.

Whenever Qin had any problems, whether in movies or in private, Frank was her most trusted consultant. However, friends familiar with her temperament said that although she could follow her guidance, the final decision was always made according to her own wishes.

Irene Dunne's "invisible" husband is Dr. Frank Griffin, a famous dentist. She has always been secretive about this matter. Needless to say, she wanted to see his photo. From the time Irene stepped into Hollywood until she became famous, she never admitted that she knew a name like Frank Griffin. Finally, the truth was revealed, along with a joke.

Irene is not very talkative, and someone interviewed her once for several hours and did not get any interesting material. The interviewer used the激将法, telling her that she—the interviewer was a woman—would write the real situation of this interview as it was and write Irene as a very good! But very boring person.

These words made Irene jump up.

"Don't do that," she pleaded. "I'll tell you something, something that no one in Hollywood knows."

So her Dr. Griffin finally appeared.

She met Griffin when she was dancing somewhere with another boyfriend. After meeting, they danced together a few times and were attracted to each other. When Dr. Griffin asked her for her phone number, she quickly told him, but his first call didn't come until six months later, inviting her out to dinner.

Later, she learned that he had been deeply in love with her from the beginning, but he had been struggling with this love. He was from Northampton, Massachusetts, the most conservative state in Zhou, and he still believed that a good person should not marry an actress. He even had an additional requirement when he proposed to her, that she no longer continue her previous career.

Irene was very angry at first and refused, but then she completely agreed, gave up the film industry, and she did this when she got married. However, the honeymoon had just passed, and she had completely changed Griffin's old-fashioned thinking. She got the female lead of缘.

Now, they have a home in California. Although Griffin has to leave her for New York sometimes due to his job, he still stays with her as much as possible. She still refuses to talk about his affairs, except for his affairs, she is willing to talk about everything else, but those are already known outside. About Dr. Griffin, very little is known to the public.

佛琴尼尼勃鲁 is very different. She talks about her husband without any concealment. However, at the same time, we must also know that her husband is a Hollywood celebrity in his own right. He can't hide it. His is华尔脱卢平——director and producer——his reputation does not rely on the power of his wife at all.

Lu Shengping was born in New York City, his father was the import merchant Marx Lu Ping, and his mother was Ruth Walters, an actress. He was educated at Columbia University, and after graduating, he decided to write novels. He achieved some success, so he got the opportunity to be a screenwriter, and then turned to directing. It was when he was directing 佛琴尼勃鲁丝's鲁Bad　Man　of　Brfmstone that the two fell in love.

佛琴尼 strives to prevent the heartbreaking events between her and John Gilbert from happening again. Now her heart is focused on her husband and her little daughter Susan. She picked a house herself and recently moved in. She and her husband watch movies three or four times a week and often talk about film production.

Because of his career, he often has to meet with colleagues in the library to talk in the evening. At these times,佛琴尼 stays in the living room.

玛特莲嘉珞儿 also does not hesitate to talk about her husband. Only a few people in Hollywood have seen her 良人, who is far away. He is Captain Phillip Astor莱, far away in London. They can only meet when one of them gets a vacation. He is a six-foot-two-inch hero from the last war, and now runs a real estate business in England. Eight years ago, they met at a masquerade ball. At that time, she was just a promising actress, and he was the captain of the Household卫队. This type of guard is the best soldier in all of England. Phillip had also received the best military education at Sand Hurst 斯脱, similar to West Point in America. A typical 英武 soldier, living life with an optimistic attitude.

They got married six months after meeting. Although the two are重洋 apart, they communicate with each other from time to time by correspondence, telegrams, or long-distance telephone.

"He often gives me advice on my work," she said. "Every one of my films for him, and when I'm not by his side, he always calls. I'm so happy to be married to someone who is much more talented than me and doesn't like to exaggerate me."

These combinations are relatively happy. But look at桃乐赛拉靡, when she and赫倍凯伊 got married, she was just a female singer in his band. Today their位完全have been reversed,桃乐赛 has become a star, and the name of赫倍凯伊 is not as attractive as one-tenth of her. When she was still an unknown singer, marriage was happy, but now it is obviously different. The rumors of divorce are震天价响, so these movie star husbands often use a famous saying from General Sherman to represent their lives after marrying actresses, "It's just like a prison."

There are also many husbands who love their wives warmly. Maybe you think it would be great to marry Claudette Colbert,琴亚瑟, or Irene Dunne. It's not true. Marrying a movie star is indeed difficult, and they love their wives not because they are movie stars.

### Silver Flower

— Xiang

It couldn't be more巧. Boris Karloff—Frankenstein—had a daughter, just when hewas filming his new film "Son of Frankenstein". While he was working, he received a call from the hospital. Without taking off his makeup or washing his face, he jumped into the car of the filming site and left. Fortunately, a makeup artist also got in the car with him and hurriedly washed his face and removed his makeup in the army, so that he did not make the joke of Frankenstein appearing in broad daylight when he arrived at the hospital.

There are other coincidences. First, this day was Karloff's fifty-first birthday, father and daughter on the same day, is属难得, and that day he was preparing to shoot the scene of the汤饼宴 that had been delayed for a long time.

After the film The Castle was completed, Fred Astaire 雷书华's contract also expired. Fred has not yet decided whether to continue or not, because there are several companies that are willing to pay high prices to 罗 him (if he leaves雷书华, then he will no longer have the opportunity to cooperate with琴逑罗吉丝, and the films they cooperate on are always very popular). However, which company he will join will not be known until four months later. After the completion of this film, Fred will take a four-month trip around the world, and he will not sign a film contract with anyone before returning to the United States. Remember, he has been with雷书华 for four years.

### International Football Semi-Final: Chinese Team Selected Yesterday; Tam Kwan-hong and Lee Wai-tong Team Up Again

(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) The International Football Semi-Final has been set for a good day to be held. Fans who have money in their pockets are quietly waiting for the "God of War" to arrive.

The Great China Team was last year's champion. This time, they are competing with the England team for the final spot. Everyone in the country is paying great attention.

The English team has many "national players," but the navy's best players are performing exercises in Singapore and cannot contribute. The roster was announced the other day, and there are as many as four players from the second division on the starting lineup. As such, their strength is somewhat lacking.

The representatives of the Chinese team were also selected yesterday. The entire lineup is in line with expectations. It is especially noteworthy that Hou Rong-sheng was selected as the left inside defender. This newcomer is indeed good.

Goalkeeper Tam Kwan-hong and center-forward Lee Wai-tong, this old team, have a remarkable history in the past. Because they are together, they have never failed in any competition they have participated in. This time they are teaming up again, and it is believed that they will still maintain that undefeated record.

The match is scheduled for the 19th of this month at Caroline Hill, starting at 4 pm. The lineups of both sides are as follows (Football God).

(Great China Team)

Sing (Eastern) Hou Chengtao (Eastern)

Li Tiansheng (South China South) Li Zhaorong (South China South)

### South China Brothers Clash Like Mountains Today

South China South and Eastern will have another battle next Wednesday

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The football league is being rushed to completion. Starting last week, the competition is being held on Wednesdays. According to inquiries, there will be two Division A matches next Wednesday (the 22nd): one between South China South and St. Joseph's at Caroline Hill, and one between Eastern and Scotland at the Hong Kong Football Club, starting at 5 pm.

South China previously went on an expedition, changing several league matches. Now, in order to rush to completion, the competition is intense. However, South China South has the highest call for winning the championship. At this critical juncture, its players will play at least two games per week (referring only to the league, excluding special competitions). Although this is not too tiring, the issue of burden is greatly related to the overall situation. Therefore, during this busy time for football matters, it is hoped that the players of South China South will work harder to achieve complete success.

Also, the second round match between South China South and South China, originally scheduled to be held on the day, has been agreed by the General Association to be held today. Both teams are from the same family, so there is no reason to compete. So, who will be victorious is obvious. Since South China has already defeated the Navy last week, indirectly helping South China City, today it will definitely give up two points to further enhance the status of South China South. Or, in terms of strength, South China is also not a weak enemy.

This match is a meeting between brothers. It is heard that both sides will still use the original lineup to prevent the competition from becoming cold. Therefore, if spectators want to be happy, they may as well come to the stadium for a look, and it is guaranteed that there will be many laughs. The recent competition schedule is as follows:

16th (Thursday)

Division A 5:00 PM

South China South vs. South China Caroline Hill

### Last Night's Basketball Game: Pui Ying Wins; One Point More Defeats the Police; Pui Ying Celebrates Victory in Division B

In the Men's Open Basketball Tournament, there were three games held last night. In the first game, Qingzhi of Division B played against Pui Ying. Qingzhi had a fierce momentum, pressing Pui Ying at the start. However, Pui Ying's strength was quite strong, and they were able to make good use of both long and short passes. In the first half, they took the lead with a score of 15 to 12. Later, Qingzhi tried to counterattack and made some progress. However, the five players of Pui Ying rose together, shooting one after another. By the end of the game, Pui Ying won 52 to 32. In the second game, the police in Division A played against Pui Ying. After the game started, Pui Ying launched an immediate attack. Lin Wanli, Qiu Guangbian, and Chen Zetang successively scored like machine-gun fire, repeatedly making contributions. The police were not willing to be outdone. Chen Zhaokui raised his arm and went all out, making several close shots, all of which hit the mark. Kwan Linxing also reported in. Pui Ying knew that the situation was not good and responded seriously. In the first half, Pui Ying took the lead with a score of 19 to 11. After switching sides, the police's prestige greatly increased, and Pui Ying resisted with all their might, falling into a difficult situation. When the score reached 31 to 32, it entered a dramatic stage. Pui Ying relied on their efforts in the end and defeated the police with a score of 36 to 35. In the last game, Overseas Chinese played against Chunfeng. After the start, Overseas Chinese's prestige was quite high, and Chunfeng also pressed closely. In the first half, the score was 12 to 11. After switching sides, Chunfeng tried hard to surround and suppress them, and Overseas Chinese's formation became lax. Li Jiayu and Mao Huai shot from left and right, and the score rose sharply. By the end of the game, they defeated Overseas Chinese with a score of 34 to 19.

### Eastern Didn't Play Their Best; Forced to a Draw by Kwong Wah; Zero to Zero, No Gains

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Eastern's dream of becoming the runner-up in the Division A football team was shattered yesterday when Kwong Wah snatched a point.

Yesterday, Eastern should have won but didn't, which is a pity. The reason for not winning was that the front line was not connected, and Li Deqi missed a great opportunity. Not playing their best also greatly affected both offense and defense.

The performance in this game was a competition for points, not for winning or drawing. Back and forth, it was still pleasing to the eye, but there were not many highlights.

In the first half, Eastern's offense and defense were not well-coordinated, so there is nothing worth mentioning. In the second half, Xu Jingcheng was reassigned as the right inside forward, which slightly improved the situation, but it was easier for the forwards to find a way out than to find opportunities. This is because the control of the ball was not yet mastered. In terms of defense, Zeng Zhongyun initially performed well.

Kwong Wah's goalkeeper, Li Guoqi, performed sometimes very poorly and sometimes very well. His skills really have different prices at different times. The midfielders, Yang Zixiang and Zhang Shuhui, provided good passes, but their movements were a bit slow, and the force of the passes was also often lacking, making it easy for the opponent to intercept them.

The forwards are good at short passes, but they are often not well-coordinated, resulting in the two wings breaking through while the three forwards are still lagging behind, so they cannot find the final successful strike.

After the start of the game, Kwong Wah's forwards attacked in one go, surrounding Eastern's city. Zeng and Xu's forceful block prevented them from making any progress. Later, Eastern counterattacked, and Bingjin got the ball and dribbled it along the side, passing it to Qi, but it was robbed by Rong Sheng. Ji continued to get the ball and passed it to Yongju, but it was also blocked by Jingcheng. Once, Bingjin shot at the goal from the right, and Xianhan missed a shot, and the ball fell in front of Shijin. Weiquan rushed over in time and kicked it out. Then, Dongli took the opportunity to counterattack, and Deqi's shot missed the target. Not long after, Chifen got the ball, was blocked by Buyun, and passed it to Bingjin, who passed Weiquan and Zhongyun and made a wonderful cross, but Shijin missed the opportunity in front of the goal and shot over the net. The first half ended in a draw.

In the second half, Eastern put Xu Jiucheng up as a forward in an attempt to win, but he missed several opportunities and ultimately achieved nothing. Kwong Wah's attack was also fierce, but because they were eager to succeed, they often failed. Once, Eastern attacked forcefully, and Kwong Wah's goal was in danger. The ball was sent forward by Jingcheng, and Deqi actually missed a shot at a distance of only a foot from the goal, losing a great opportunity. Therefore, as a result of the fierce battle, the internal war ended with 0-0.

The lineups of the two teams yesterday were as follows:

(Eastern)

Liu Po-han

Zeng Cu-yun Xu Bu-yun

Wei Wei Xu Chong Liu Shi

Li Bing-tang Yu Zhi Li Deqi Qi Xiang Chen Bingtu

(Kwong Wah)

Li Guoqi

Zhong Hui-lin Hou Rong-sheng

Huang Hua Yang Zixiang Zhang Shuhui

### Yesterday's Open Tennis Tournament: Lin Tiande's Skills Were Quite High; Li Rurong, Although Resilient, Ultimately Lost; Finzha Won Two Straight Against Jiang Daozhang

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Yesterday's open tennis tournament had four matches, all singles. The match between Lin Tiande, a famous Nanyang player, and Li Rurong was a good show, attracting a large audience. Li is a good player from the Chinese Recreation Club and is known for his resilience. Although he lost two straight sets with scores of 3-6 and 3-6, his tenacity and strategy made it difficult for Lin to win. At first, Lin had not yet understood his opponent's style of play. Later, he felt threatened and knew that he had to come to the net. He switched from defense to offense and tried his best to smash the ball. Sure enough, it was a success, and he won the victory. The match between Cai Shuishan and Jian Shi was not very interesting. Zi's movements were agile, and his smashes were strong. He won two consecutive sets with ease. Finji and Jiang Daozhang are both advanced tennis players. Yesterday, these two veterans met on the battlefield, competing for strengths and weaknesses, each not giving way. After two rounds of hard fighting, Zha eventually won.

### Understanding Fire Through Fire

— Zhuang Ruiyuan

We have arrived at an era where we must harbor a different kind of view regarding fire. In our past notions, we associated fire with intense heat and bright light, with hatred or love. There is no need to engage in textual research on these ideas now. It is just that, in our emotions and imagination, the impressions fire gives us are fleeting and unreliable, just as the flames themselves flicker. Under certain circumstances, we once adored fire, while in other circumstances, we showed utter disgust for it.

Therefore, in the civilized world, after people learned methods of controlling kerosene or other fuels, for the sake of peaceful living and to make the days pass by quietly, they then invented fire extinguishers, using mechanically ejected water and carbon dioxide from the mouth. A burst of blowing can extinguish fire if it is only a small flame.

But now in our time, fire is practically burning our clothes, our hair, even scorching our bodies. Artillery fire ceaselessly bombards our rooftops, destroying peaceful homes, and thus we understand what fire in this new world cares about us. We are indignant; without a home, we flee far away, into exile. We are homeless everywhere, exiles residing in all directions. However, from then on, fire has been more extensively used for killing and destruction. Artillery fire is unlikely to occur in this remote mountain city. We have left the great fire of Zhabei and the beacon smoke of the east for too long; we let a fire burn the past, that past which was so blissful in the wheat fields; and we ourselves came far away to this pure land.

However, in this era of youth, fire is used and has become overused and unrestrained. Airplanes in the sky can also inflict great damage on ground houses and lives. This fire forces us to have a different view from the past.

We have already arrived in this era of much killing and much destruction, still carrying fragile lives. With just one incendiary bomb, the place where we live can be turned into ruins, filled with the scorched smell of burned organic matter. When our firefighters rush over from all corners, they discover that not just one house, or even just one street, has been swallowed up by the greedy flames. For the sake of righteousness and love of humanity, they are still prepared to plunge into the pit of fire, prepared to rescue as many lives as possible from the narrow gate of fire. But as they prop up the ladder and ascend, only a cloud of white smoke, a cloud of white smoke, and they all fall down one by one. At the edge of the flames, everything is burning, emitting the scorched smell of burned organic matter.

Because fire is used and transformed by arsenals, it becomes a bomb, exploding on the land, releasing an intense heat that we never believed possible. At the same time, those countless bombs explode on the ground, releasing countless intense forces that we never believed possible. These streams of heat converge, and so we are victims born in the fire of disaster.

We know of several major fires in history, or these disasters that have significant meaning in the cultural history of mankind, representing the destruction of an old world and the creation of a new life. However, the several major fires included in this war of ours will, in the distant future, also become major fires recorded in history. Many of our cities have already been burned by the fierce fire, and many cities are still burning. And we also know that many cities that have not yet been burned will also suffer great devouring in the days to come, turning into ruins, becoming scorched earth. We have already let the first city fall into the raging flames of war. We are continuing to steadfastly defend other cities; we want to compare every city in the rear to a soldier fighting, one falls down, we will send up a second, a third... Yes, it is because we must stand on the side of victory.

The fire is spreading, the fire is leaping wildly. A golden brass cymbal has just appeared in front of the misty window, and then it falls. The house is burning, the ladder is broken, and the person who wants to break out of the door faints on the threshold. The flames burn away the hair, the clothes, even scorching the body. The person is an organic body, and in the thick smoke, the scorched smell of burned organic matter pervades.

This is the poisonous fire of hatred. Today, I see a person being burned to death, and tomorrow perhaps we too will be buried in this fire of hatred.

Therefore, we have already arrived at an era where we must harbor another kind of view regarding fire. In the past, we had private loves and hates for fire, but now, there is no need to evoke any traces of that. Let the poisonous fire of hatred burn away everything we have, even our fragile lives! But what we cannot ignore is a new view of fire.

Fire itself is simple. Those who suffer from the disasters of fire and those who are burned to death alive can only respond to the burning of fire with the attack of fire.

### Remembering Mr. Cao Juren (Part 2)

— Wu Zijin

Three. Essayist

Let me first quote a passage from Mr. Lu Xun’s self-description:

"I believe that there is no such thing as 'writing for the sake of writing' in this world. Bai Juyi said: 'Articles are written for the times, and poems are composed for the affairs.' At least my writing is always for a purpose... In the great tide, I have also floated on the waves like a bubble; before and after, I have written nearly a million words of essays. I will never criticize myself, and I will never shirk a bit of laziness for promoting progress." (Random Notes on Writing: Preface.)

Romain Rolland said: "There is only one kind of true courage in the world, and that is to face reality squarely and love it." Mr. Cao, who never shirks a bit of laziness, stands tall in reality, pushing forward the wheels of the times, always maintaining strong resilience, unyielding and indomitable. This attitude of striving and shouting can be seen everywhere in his essays. He said, "My essays have fulfilled the responsibility of being written for the times." This is not an exaggeration at all.

He used his pen to whip himself and to satirize the unreasonable society.

What he practiced was the doctrine of effort. His view of life was: life is a battle—a desperate battle. He most despised those who evade, those who fear, those who dare not face life head-on, those optimists and reclusive masters. He calmly said:

"All kinds of methods of self-anesthesia and evasion... can only be like an ostrich, burying its head in the woods, thinking that it has hidden itself, and then being caught and slaughtered by the hunter." (On the Lives of Literati in the Wei and Jin Dynasties)

Four. Old Warrior

Gogol wrote to Zhukovsky in 1847:

"Writer, you must first cultivate yourself like a human being and like a compatriot of your own country, and then you can pick up a pen; otherwise, everything will end in failure."

We do not need writers of the Rostand type—those empty talkers with grand words. In this age, writers should cultivate themselves arduously.

Mr. Cao's consistent life is one of firm advance. He is one of the writers who knows how to cultivate himself best. When the battle of "August 13th" began, he resolutely took off his blue cotton gown, abandoned his comfortable life as a university professor, took up a pen and joined the army, braving the rain of bullets, galloping east, west, north, and south.

Twenty years ago, he once expressed the view that "scholars are useless," which was often criticized at the time. In fact, I think that although Mr. Cao sighed in the same way as Huang Zhongze, their views are absolutely different. Huang Zhongze lived a life of poverty and hardship, never achieving fame, and filled with sorrow. All he had was the sigh of a declining scholar-official class. But Mr. Cao? I am afraid that he himself felt that in this great era, a weak scholar was very ashamed, paper talk was useless, and the power he could bring out was so small that he angrily said: "Scholars are such useless things!"

He hoped that he could be tempered stronger and more powerful in the furnace of reality.

Now, Mr. Cao is bravely moving forward. Please bless the "blue cotton gown" professor, bless the "old warrior" in military uniform.

### Horse Stable Trip

— Dun Sheng

—Two from the Front Line's Grass Supply

Stepping out of the ancient city of Zhaoqing, I felt a little uncomfortable. It wasn't just from breathing in the fresh air of the countryside, but also from a subjective and deep dislike of the neat and tidy sounds of the city. It was like a village girl with bound feet suddenly getting her hair permed—unharmonious. Looking at the muddy streets and then the stylish streamlined sedans, I felt a tightness in my chest, a feeling of unease.

On the way, we slowly moved forward, the iron line stretching across the deep yellow earth. My companions excitedly sang songs, and the white triangular flag stubbornly fluttered in the north wind, symbolizing our will, bravely advancing forward!

"Goodbye! Zhaoqing."

The biting north wind turned the faces of the female comrades purple, scattering their long hair and lifting the corners of their clothes. Yet they walked at the forefront with energetic agility. This brave posture and their families, their pasts, were completely divided into two eras… In order to save the precarious nation, we arrange ourselves in this arduous life, and we must use our voices to awaken the hundreds of millions of sleeping masses. Who can believe that great ideals and arduous work are now being created and realized by fifteen young men and women!

At the bottom of the earthen hill, we bid farewell to Zhaoqing, shrouded in the morning glow. From then on, we left this city that had prospered because of the war. In front of us were towering peaks and rugged mountain roads.

Although this section of the road exhausted everyone, the beautiful scenery along the way provided great comfort. Fatigue was naturally lessened a lot. Lush green clouds, inlaid with golden wildflowers, kissed by gentle breezes, peaks stacked at angles, boldly and resolutely cleaved deep valleys, vast green grass, and lush trees embellished this warm Jiangnan scene.

After a hundred and twenty li, we arrived at the horse stable in eight hours at night. The darkness was vast.

In front of the horse stable is a tributary of the North River. On the other side of the river is a village, with fields, woods, and mud, looking from the horse stable. There are quiet and majestic mountains, with mountains connecting to each other, just like the village's screen.

But that village with beautiful scenery, under the cruel actions of the × people, was completely destroyed and razed to the ground. The people who once lived and worked there in peace, from now on, they no longer have a lovely home, they can no longer enjoy the rich fields, the morning mists of the mountains, and the sunset glow of the rivers. Please remember this bloody debt, destroyed by the brutal shells of the × people. Today, only the charred woods and the broken walls of mud houses remain, as companions to the mountains and rivers.

In the darkness, weaving through the village of broken tiles and rubble, under the big umbrella, we met many refugees coming down from the war zone, with worried expressions on their faces. As soon as they saw the car coming, they eagerly asked: "Is this a car for carrying refugees?" When the answer disappointed them, melancholy locked their brows even more deeply.

We passed that long floating bridge made of various iron doors, then set foot on a yellow earth road, where every step was very difficult. Along the river, oil lamps were sparsely placed, and engineers were working nervously. I heard that they were ordered to build a bridge for crossing the river here within three days. Standing on the yellow earth road, with those lights floating, I couldn't help but observe the high mountains again. The darkness of the mountains seemed to hang in the long sky of the night. From the mountains, you could look down on the vast West River, the wide plains, the fields...

However, those large evenings hurried forward so earnestly, now, I fear, have long been destroyed; the villages, have already endured the enemy's iron hooves, but ah, those majestic mountains! Are now ambushing the warriors who protect their homeland, ready to spill their hot blood all over the mountains.

### Song and Sword

— Huang Lu

Put down the harp

Put down the magnificent fantasies

We want to sing out all the repressions and passions in our chests

Roar

The world has no more peaceful days

Go to that bloody prairie

Go to that fascinating forest

And wield—

Our—

Long sword, oh.

### Japanese Faith in Clogs

— Hasegawa Nyozekan, Translated by Zhen Han

In everything, the Japanese tend to go against the direction of human progress and preserve primitive forms. For example, footwear is also like this. The typical development of something worn on the feet is the sandal. What is constructed as a Sandal is something like Japanese straw sandals, which gradually develops to wrap up the feet, and becomes today's shoes. This is a development sequence in the West and the East, but only Japan does not follow this sequence, and still wears the primitive footwear type, the clog.

There is an interesting story about footwear. Initially, it imitated the way monkeys used their feet, using their toes between the thumb and middle finger to clamp something so that the footwear would go on the foot. But later, they abandoned this and changed to a style that wrapped the foot. Egyptian Sandals and Japanese leather shoes are exactly the same. The strap used for the nose rope is held between the thumb and middle finger, and that end is passed through the two ears on both sides, and tied on the heel. The appearance is exactly the same as straw sandals, but by the time of Greek Sandals, toes were no longer used, but the ends were wrapped with straps to allow the feet to put them on. In Roman Sandals, the front end of the leather was folded over the instep, becoming the beginning of today's shoes. The only one who does not follow this development process from Sandal to shoe, but still retains the original Egyptian Sandal, is Japan. As for straw sandals, they have not changed their original form at all, and clogs are also Japanese-style toe shoes. This is an extremely primitive form of continuing to imitate the methods of monkeys even in an era when the shape of the feet is already different from that of apes. However, the cultural development of this clog is above (?) the shoes of Westerners and Easterners, and its interest lies in the raw wood and grass materials, without changing their nature: it is the opposite of the vulgar taste of applying colors and polishing them brightly. That is the same interest as Japanese houses. The Japanese can be said to be wearing Japanese houses, and it can also be said that the Japanese live in clogs. (Japanese Review, March issue)

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

The piano music stopped, and no one entered the room. Therefore, he immediately thought:

"The one playing the piano is not her. So, where did she go?"

Suddenly, a sensitive thought came for no reason, warning him:

"You've gone to the wrong room."

"Yes, yes!"

This was his reply to himself. He began to be critical of himself, and at that time, he also felt lucky. This careless mistake did not cause any misfortune, and he still had room to salvage it. However, when he saw the small photo of a staff member on the table, he shook his head again, because the face shape in that small photo was that of the owner of the room that he had seen twice—the young girl he was looking forward to seeing.

"So, is she hiding?"

At this time, he suspected that his secret had been leaked. The room had been prepared long ago, and informants had been placed everywhere. He had fallen into a huge web of conspiracy without knowing it; it seemed as if he heard someone laughing at him:

"Stupid thing!"

Just at this moment, someone opened the door and came in.

He did not hear the footsteps or the knocking of the person coming; could he escape? No. For any encounter, he could only deal with it at any time; so he prepared the pistol in his pocket. When he recognized that the person coming was a maid, his contracted muscles immediately relaxed again. Moreover, he showed the dignity that guests should not have towards servants, casually looking at places he did not know where to look.

The maid had come to prepare for her young mistress's sleep, and upon seeing this dignified guest, she stopped her work. She quickly walked over to greet him and unbutton his coat:

"Sir, you must be very hot!"

"No, I'm leaving soon." Then, he said: 'No, I wouldn't be hot. If I take off my coat and my shirt, it will scare you to death!' (8)
