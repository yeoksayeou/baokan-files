### New Pacific Situation Amidst Japan's Southern Advance

— Hu Yuzhi

The storms in the Pacific did not begin today. In the past seven or eight years, China was first the lamb of the Far Eastern aggressors, transforming from a lamb to a tiger during the War of Resistance. However, the great powers of the Far East—Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands—consistently sought temporary ease and made concessions. As a result, the power of the aggressors expanded day by day, and the crisis in the Pacific deepened day by day.

Now, the aggressors' blades are not only aimed at China but are also directly pointed at all peaceful nations in the Pacific. Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands can no longer find temporary ease; to make further concessions to the aggressors would be suicidal.

This is easy to understand: the only way out for Japanese imperialism today is to advance southward. Advancing southward can stimulate domestic morale, cover up failures in the war against China, threaten Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, seize the colonies of white nations in the Far East, coordinate with successful intimidation tactics, realize the common goals of anti-communist groups, and, most importantly, cut off China's access to the sea, weaken China's resistance, and thus fulfill the dream of conquering all of China.

What other path is there besides advancing southward? Although Japan still proclaims that it is conducting a "holy war" against communism, the blow it received at Zhanggufeng has already taught it a lesson, deterring it from stirring up trouble in the direction of Taishan. As for dealing with the "China Incident," it has already suffered greatly due to "underestimation." The result of twenty months of bitter fighting has been the loss of 500,000 troops. Now, nearly a million troops are besieged, cut off, blocked, and bombarded everywhere in the heartland of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins by our regular and guerrilla forces. Needless to say, the war situation will not end in the short term, and it is not even possible to safely withdraw the current troops in China.

Because the war against China has reached a dead end, Japan has no choice but to change its political and military strategy from defending the south and attacking the north to defending the north and attacking the south, from being pro-British and anti-Soviet to being anti-British, anti-French, and anti-Soviet at the same time. In other words, it is shifting from a continental offensive to a dual approach involving both the continent and the sea. Before this new policy was decided, it underwent several probes. The landing in Xiamen in May of last year and the occupation of Guangzhou in October were both aimed at testing the reactions of Great Britain and France. The result was the opposite of Zhanggufeng; Great Britain and France softened their attitudes, and the probes were completely successful. Then, on November 3 of last year, Konoe announced the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," and the navy successively concentrated in South China. Recently, the landing on Hainan Island has been a factual proof that the policy of advancing southward has become active.

After landing on Hainan Island, Japan immediately proceeded to establish naval and air bases on Qiongyai Island (Hainan Island) and sent experts from Japan to inspect Hainan, proving that Japan intends to occupy it permanently. At the same time, Japan used its air force to bomb British territory in Kowloon and the New Territories. It also exerted threats on the Shanghai Municipal Council. Japanese Naval Minister Yonai announced that in addition to continuing the shipbuilding plan of 800 million yen that began the year before, he would request an additional naval shipbuilding budget from the parliament at the end of February to compete with Great Britain and the United States.

Closely related to this southern advance policy are the military negotiations that have been secretly conducted between Germany and Japan for several months. It is very clear that Hitler needs Japan to pin down Great Britain and France in the Far East, just as he needs Fascist Italy to hold down Great Britain and France in the Mediterranean. Only in this way can Germany extract a large sum from Great Britain and France, an even greater sum than it extracted in Munich. However, what tricks the two fascist countries of Germany and Japan are playing is currently kept secret. Only the French weekly "Vu" revealed a bit of information on January 25. According to reports, Germany and Japan signed a secret agreement in Tokyo on November 20 of last year, which stipulated: (1) If Japan is drawn into a new war due to the China Incident, Germany will provide full assistance to Japan with its army, navy, and air force. (2) Germany will enjoy the same economic privileges as Japan in Chinese territory. Germany also has the right to send technical and military advisors to the "New China" government. (3) If Sakhalin Island and the Soviet Far East territory are placed under Japanese jurisdiction, Germany should be granted transfer rights. (4) Germany may restore its pre-war colonies in the Pacific, provided that it does not harm Japan's strategic security. This is the first part of the secret agreement. The second part stipulates the division of the Malay colonies. Germany would occupy Dutch New Guinea, Madura Island (Mndera) west, the southern part of Celebes, Dutch West Indies Surinam, and British Borneo. However, the British Malay Peninsula up to Singapore, Siam, the rest of the Dutch East Indies, and Burma would be in Japan's sphere of influence. The secret agreement did not mention the division of the Philippines, Hawaii, Vietnam, India, and Burma, supposedly because they were being reserved for when Italy joined the German-Japanese secret agreement, so that they could be newly allocated.

Although this is an unconfirmed report, the fact that Foreign Minister Arita has repeatedly advocated strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact in the 74th session of the Diet, the fact that Germany is preparing to make a new threat to Great Britain and France in March regarding colonies, and the fact that Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands are actively expanding their military power in the Far East all suggest that this news of Germany and Japan dividing up the Pacific colonies is not entirely groundless.

Naturally, these provocative acts by the fascist countries are mostly motivated by intimidation at the moment, because Germany is absolutely unwilling to easily launch a war before it is confident of victory. Japan's main aim at present is still to conquer China, and it has no intention of immediately attacking Great Britain and the United States. However, when one is confronted by a robber with a loaded pistol, who can guarantee that danger will not arise? Today it is intimidation, tomorrow it may be war. In short, the raging waves in the Pacific have already been stirred up.

These raging waves that have already been stirred up cannot be calmed down by any human power. Although some people are still fantasizing about using international conferences to restore peace in the Far East, this is even harder than a black dog turning into a white dog. First, the Pacific problem is now linked to the European problem. If the European problem cannot be resolved, there is naturally even less hope for the Pacific problem. Second, Great Britain and the United States have reached the final limit in their concessions to the aggressor nations. If the British Empire is unwilling to collapse immediately and the United States still wants to maintain its investments and trade markets in the Far East, it is impossible to make further concessions to the aggressor nations. Third, the fascist countries are eagerly trying to seize hegemony in the Pacific. They can use both hard bargaining and soft deception, but they will never easily let go. Fourth, China, the most important country in the Far East, has embarked on the path of independence, liberation, and revival in the War of Resistance. With the principle of "either them or us," there is no room for compromise between us. The China problem cannot be solved until the final victory of the War of Resistance. The entire Pacific problem is naturally even more so.

Naturally, if all the peaceful countries in the Pacific unite and impose military, economic, and moral sanctions on the aggressor nations, there may still be a glimmer of hope for saving peace in the Far East. However, such sanctions are unlikely to be implemented before a major war breaks out in the Pacific. The rulers of the Pacific nations are now thinking about how to launch or how to cope with the future Pacific War, rather than how to promote collective security and peace in the Pacific.

As mentioned above, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, who have joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, are planning to divide up the colonies of the white countries in the Pacific. Among them, Japan is naturally the vanguard of the Far Eastern aggression forces. After the landing on Hainan Island, the greatest threat on the surface is to French Vietnam. However, this is only because of political and strategic needs. Japan is only provoking France, as France is the weakest link in the Far Eastern colonial empires. Vietnam borders China's southwest resistance base. Directly threatening Vietnam is equivalent to tightening the blockade of China and indirectly threatening Great Britain. However, Japan's real purpose of aggression is not French, but British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia. The rubber and oil needed by Japanese industry and its ideal population migration destination are all in Southeast Asia. The iron of the Philippines, the abundant mineral resources and wool of Australia are the main targets of Japan's aggression. Therefore, there are probably three routes for Japan's southern advance: the first is to occupy the Philippines and then advance to New Guinea and Australia; the second is to seize Singapore and Borneo and then encompass the Malay Federation and the Dutch East Indies; and the third is to invade Vietnam from Hainan Island, then annex Burma and India from Vietnam, and place Siam under Japanese protection. However, at the beginning of a future war, Japan must strive for the neutrality of the United States; or temporarily not take the first route, but first take the second and third routes. At that time, taking Hong Kong would be like taking something out of a pocket. Vietnam may be invaded, but the main battle will be in Singapore. If the United States does not participate in the war, Japan will have to overcome the strong resistance of the British-Dutch Allied forces at the very least to achieve its goal.

Here, Japan will rely on the help of Western fascist countries. Although, in addition to air force participation and economic aid, Germany and Italy will not give their Far Eastern accomplices any strong assistance, if the navies and air forces of Germany and Italy in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Red Sea can play a significant role in containing Great Britain and France, then Japan will be more confident of victory. The reason why Japan urgently needs to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact at present lies here.

In addition, the fascist aggressors also plan to use Siam, a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, as an important base for attacking British and French territories. The Siamese government is currently under the influence of Fascism. The Siamese Prime Minister Luang Pibul openly declared his worship of Hitler and Mussolini in a radio speech last year. Recently, the German Defense Force newspaper Deutsche Wehr also said, "If Siam concludes an alliance with Japan, the security of French Vietnam will be completely destroyed." Japan's intelligence agencies have played many tricks in Siam in recent years, and Siam's pro-Japanese stance is very obvious. Therefore, the great power political and diplomatic struggle for this small Eastern country is very important. If Siam becomes the Hungary of Asia, not only will Vietnam not be safe, but Burma and Singapore will also be in danger of being invaded at any time.

Under the southern advance policy of Japan and the encirclement and attack of the fascist group's aggressive conspiracies, the colonies of Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands are already under the blades of strong enemies. What policy will Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands take to ensure the security of their territories in the Pacific?

Although Chamberlain's diplomacy only knows how to make concessions to the aggressors, both in the West and in the East, he has recently begun to realize that peace must be maintained by force. If Great Britain maintains peace by force and does not maintain peace by sacrificing small countries, peace can still be maintained. In order to jointly deal with international murderers, Great Britain will definitely get the cooperation of the United States and the Soviet Union. In particular, China, which is fighting in the War of Resistance, is the greatest pillar of peace in the Far East. The British government must understand this sooner or later: only by using all its strength to support China's War of Resistance and sanctioning Japanese aggression can it preserve its vast colonies in the Far East. Even if it does not understand it at present, facts will teach Chamberlain to understand it. As for France's Far Eastern policy, it is making the same mistake as its Spanish policy: trying to hide from the wind and rain under the broken umbrella of "neutrality," which only benefits the aggressors. Now Vietnam is surrounded on three sides by aggressors. France is actively strengthening its land, sea, and air defenses in the Far East. The Bay of Cam Ranh opposite Hainan Island is being built into a first-class naval port. Undoubtedly, France's Far Eastern policy will be strengthened following Great Britain. As for the Netherlands, it also cannot but rely on Great Britain militarily. The Hague has only recently passed a large-scale shipbuilding plan, which is a bit late, but it is still not too late.

Roosevelt's Far Eastern policy is completely correct. In recent months, he has delivered many anti-aggression speeches, established the foundation of the Pan-American anti-aggression front in Lima, and submitted to Congress the Guam fortification plan and the four-year military expansion budget. Roosevelt has seen that the fascist aggressors are the only enemy of the United States. Although the Guam fortification plan has not yet been passed by Congress, this is because the aggressors' swords have not yet touched the United States, so the isolationists controlled by the financial groups still retain some power. However, it can be determined that the United States' Pacific policy will eventually abandon isolationism and adopt a more ambitious anti-aggression line.

Today, as Japan's aggression shifts from advancing northward to advancing southward, the Soviet Union's position in the Far East is becoming stronger day by day. In the raging waves of the Pacific, only the Soviet Union has become the mainstay of peace. This is undeniable. The strength and progress of the Soviet Union is a major factor in determining the collapse of the fascist aggression forces and the final victory of the forces of peace.

But at present, the lever of the Pacific problem is China's War of Resistance. Precisely because China insists on fighting the War of Resistance to the end and relying on its own efforts, all the aggressors' soft deception and hard bargaining will inevitably fail completely. Precisely because China is fighting for democracy and peace, the people of the Pacific will enjoy democracy and peace due to the victory of China's War of Resistance. The Pacific problem was directly caused by Japan's destruction of China's territorial integrity and will inevitably be resolved in a lasting and rational manner only after China defeats Japan and recovers its lost territories.

### A Memorial Meeting of Blood and Tears

— (Special Dispatch from Dongjiang) Lin Heng

I. Running Up Flying Goose Ridge

Today's sun has been half-covered by dark clouds; however, its remaining power still shines from the east to the southwest, illuminating the West Lake of Huizhou City. The solemn and elegant Huizhou Middle School is beautifully reflected on the surface of the West Lake. Across the lake is a small Chinese-style garden. Plum blossoms have withered, bowing their heads, hinting to the little birds and bees to intensify their activities. In the middle of the garden stand two small Western-style buildings. To the left of the buildings is a red clay road. The leaves beside the road are not newly covered with mud, clearly indicating that the road has not been used by vehicles for a long time.

In the larger of the two Western-style buildings, there is a large hall in the middle. On the front is pasted "Resistance Against Japan Above All Else" written in red ink, with "Work Actively and Study Hard" and "Tense, Serious, Lively, and United" pasted on both sides. The bulletin board has a daily schedule, and opposite it is activity; to the right are the tenets of the new style, and to the left hang many anti-Japanese war songs. "What a solemn work hall!" the reporter said excitedly.

The clock had just struck eleven, and the hall was, as usual, crowded with dozens of young and lively youths. "It's time, let's go!" a child who looked only thirteen years old suggested to the others. "Okay! Let's go immediately!" someone responded to the call. Then, the crowd began to move.

In groups of three or five, some laughing, some jumping, the crowd flowed south along the Huizhou-Zhangzhou Highway. Some were talking and laughing, others climbing onto a 'Ma Liu Zai' [a slang term for a disabled vehicle] that had been destroyed beside the road, pretending to be the driver of a car that couldn't move. At the same time, some were behaving very solemnly, thinking about the revolutionary facts of the 'January 28th' Incident. Looking at the cars overturned into the lake, several ducks swimming freely appeared in the middle of the lake, as if demonstrating to the slaves, or telling the oppressed: "How precious freedom and liberation are!"

The highway separates the West Lake, and the bridge in the middle has been blown up by ××. There are countless bloodstains beside the road, and military caps and torn clothes float on the lake. Walking, walking, and walking again, suddenly Flying Goose Ridge appeared before them. Several pioneering 'little devils' were already singing on the top of the ridge. This group of young people, in a competitive manner, not wanting to be tortoises, ran to the top of the mountain together.

II. In Front of the Bunker

After inspecting the battle achievements of the bunker, the memorial meeting began.

The sky was still unclear as before, and the sun's power was very weak, unable to lift the dark clouds, making the land under the sun entirely gloomy. A gentle breeze blew from the northwest, making people on the land feel cold.

The meeting began with the singing of the party song, and the whole atmosphere became solemn. Then, the chairman announced the significance of the memorial meeting, reporting the historical facts of the 'January 28th' Anti-Japanese War. The audience became excited and tense following the tragedy of the historical facts.

Just as the chairman was giving the most indignant report, everyone suddenly saw He Jun advancing towards the meeting place with heavy steps, step by step. As he walked closer and closer, everyone could clearly see his face. He was too grief-stricken. His face had already silently told the audience that he was sad, troubled, and at the same time indignant. Everyone's eyes were focused on He Jun. The reporter began to doubt his memory, "Didn't He Jun say in front of the National Assembly that he couldn't attend the memorial meeting because he was too busy with work? Why is he rushing here now?" Many people looked at him with strange eyes, knowing that he had received a great shock, and eager for him to speak.

"Comrades," He Jun began to speak knowingly, "I am too excited. I have a lot of work to go back and do. But when I came down the mountain, I saw the entire Huizhou City, surrounded by the East River and the West Lake. Huizhou City is too beautiful, too lovely. The beautiful scenery of mountains and clear waters attracted me to stop." Following his impatient personality, he did not continue to describe the beautiful rivers and mountains. He went on to say what he wanted to say. "Suddenly I recalled the bloodstains and torn clothes I had just seen, the broken badges and tattered military flags of the soldiers in the bunker, the emotions..." When he said this, his vocal cords began to tremble, and the speed of his heartbeat also increased. Everyone else was moved. "Emo...tions... made me turn back... I had to attend today's memorial meeting." Tears had filled He Jun's eyes, and his voice was full of tragic indignation. Yang "Little Devil" began to cry, and most people's eyes were red. "Comrades, the fallen soldiers were too heroic, heroically sacrificing themselves. We must swear to be national warriors: revenge..." After a short pause, He Jun continued, "Comrades, I call on everyone to take another look at the bunker, to enter the bunker... to see the belts and vests left by the soldiers... After seeing them, come out and stand in front of the bunker to pay our respects... a long... long time of respect..." He Jun stopped speaking, and the meeting place fell silent. Li Jun, Wang Jun, and Chen Jun all cried. After a while, Tan Jun was the first to break the silence, "Comrades, we should respond to He Jun's call and go to the bunker together." Everyone quietly turned around and walked away, no one making a sound, only the faint sound of shoes rubbing against the grass.

"Look, this is the soldiers' leftover clothing..." He Jun said, pointing with his "shi de," [likely a misprinted "zhi de" meaning "finger"]. No one answered, and the atmosphere was still deathly silent.

Wu Jun walked alone, suddenly feeling strange, "Where have the comrades gone? Why is there no sound at all?" Regardless, Wu Jun lowered his head and bent his body, stepping into the bunker from the steel entrance. To his surprise, almost everyone who had attended the meeting was crowded here, yet still no one made a sound.

"This is poison antidote!" "This is gunpowder!" After a long time, someone spoke in a low voice.

"Look! This is the soldiers' notebook... pierced by cruel shrapnel, but many words can still be seen..."

"Chapter One – General Dynamics of Secret Communications (The following is recorded without modification to maintain authenticity – Reporter)

"The most active preparation in the struggles between countries is the work of spying on enemy information... On the surface, various terms are used... also musical (the following words were blown off by shrapnel – Reporter)... or botanical names as various substitutions... written with chemical reagents... the reagents must be washed off before they can be... clever ones are hidden in specially made rubber bullets, which can be swallowed into the abdomen in an emergency, and then spat out again after eating a kind of reagent after the matter is over..."

"Japan's spy network has not only controlled all of China but also threatened the whole world... Starlight Alliance, Blood Pledge... Dragon Society are all names of Japanese secret organizations... Japanese foreign espionage work is directly under the control of the Second Section of the Army General Staff, while the Navy is managed by the Navy General Staff..."

After wiping the bunker, everyone walked out. He Jun pointed at the bunker again with his "shi de" and said, "Look, this is a good lesson. You can't put mud on the slope of the fortress. If the mud is shot down by a gun, it will block the muzzle and the machine will not work..."

"Okay! Now let's all stand at attention in front of the bunker and pay our respects!"

"When we pay our respects, we must! ! Think! How heroically the soldiers sacrificed themselves! We must! Think! Think! How to train ourselves to avenge the soldiers!" (The voice trembled) Following Jun-Jun's made such a supplement.

III. Paying Respects – Heroic Anti-Japanese War Soldiers

Pay respects, heroic anti-Japanese war soldiers, the salute begins.

The sky was still unclear as before, and the air was even more silent and gloomy. The shouts of children came from afar, corresponding to the sound of the young people's hot tears hitting the ground and the sound of urgent breathing. The atmosphere became even more tragic. Peng Jun's desire for curiosity was great, so he raised his head and looked into the distance. On another ridge, there were two pine trees moving with the wind, as if nodding to the soldiers in salute. Retracting his gaze, Peng Jun saw that Comrade Dun was crying the most miserably. Everyone was crying, filled with sadness, resentment, and excitement. This scene is difficult to describe; even the world's greatest artist could only describe a fraction of it. Turning his gaze again, Peng Jun saw that Comrade Tan was holding a soldier's steel helmet, his gaze focused inside the helmet, as if trying to find something inside.

Saluting in the silent air, the salute finished in the silent air, He Jun couldn't help but utter a tragic tone:

"...I cried, why did I cry? The bravery of the soldiers moved me. I think my work attitude is not as... brave... as the fallen soldiers... I want to swear to follow in the footsteps of the soldiers, to avenge the nation!" (The voice was loud and strong)

"Dear comrades," Ms. Ruan interjected, "...It is not enough for us to cry... We must make the × people repay their blood debts with blood!... We must intensify our study of all fighting techniques, this is the condition for us to kill the enemy!" Ms. Ruan was almost truly mad, and everyone's angry emotions increased even more!

After a while, everyone was silent. He Jun called on everyone again to inspect the bunker on the opposite mountain. No one responded, but the crowd began to move with He Jun. Suddenly, someone said in a low voice, "I think we should inspect the bunker on the opposite side another day. Today we should continue the meeting." Still no one answered. After a moment of silence, He Jun withdrew the proposal, and everyone sat down, and the memorial meeting continued.

First, Chen reported on the historical events of the "January 28th" Incident, and the lessons learned from the "January 28th". Then, he asked everyone to express their opinions and feelings to enrich the content of the meeting.

It was extremely strange, and there was another silence. The first to break the silent atmosphere were still two young comrades, followed by Comrade Dun standing up, "I felt very uncomfortable today with a headache, but after arriving at the bunker, it was completely better... I... my heart beat and I shed tears... but I will use this angry mood to swear to drive away the Japanese devils, and use a big laugh to repay today's suffering." Following Lai Jun was Li Qingying's speech, and then Li Jiezhen's speech...

Holding a steel helmet, Tan Jun stood up, and said very solemnly, "I have never been so moved in my life as I am today. My heart is beating, beating so much that it can't beat anymore. If it beats anymore, it will suffocate... We must cherish this steel helmet. There are soldiers' bloodstains on it." Pointing to the helmet, Tan Jun suddenly showed a painful expression, and he continued his speech with a trembling voice. "We must add our blood to the helmet and fight together with the blood inside to win the victory of national liberation... We must use our greatest efforts to strike at those traitors Wang Jingwei and all the Chinese traitors who have not yet accepted the lesson of blood in order to repay the dead soldiers... What I said only expresses one percent of what I wanted to say." (To be continued)

### Chongqing's "Gu Gu Yuan"

— Know Me

The Historical Facts of "Chef Old Master"

(Continued from Yesterday's Chongqing Airmail)

Old Master's law, no matter who it is, when dining at Gu Gu Yuan, their status cannot be higher than his, nor can they look down on him, especially not treating him as an ordinary chef. "Bachelor as tall as a pagoda", "Official with high position", before taking a seat, you must greet the Old Master, at least saying: "Old Master, have a drink, this seat is reserved for you!" Old Master usually replies: "No, I'm still busy! You eat first!" Having done this, the Old Master stands aside. Every time a dish comes, he must call the guest by name, without any honorifics like Mr., Master, Ms., or Madam, just like the "Old Master" instructing his children. He asks you, "Do you understand this dish? Do you know how to make it? Do you like it?" At this time, you must also stand up and answer: "Yes, Old Master, we like it very much, but we don't know how to cook it?" When the Old Master hears your answer, he will, as usual, instruct the younger generation like an elder, explaining it in detail. You eat, listen, and praise endlessly, indicating that you truly understand how the dish is made, having eaten it for the first time. If this is the case, the Old Master is happy, and you are also considered a close guest. Otherwise, the Old Master will not be pleased with you, and you will naturally be refused next time, no matter how troublesome this early preparation is, curious people, those who like to try new things, still flock to it, trying every possible way to get a meal.

The cost of the ingredients is usually paid in advance. You cannot complain about the combination of the dishes. If the bill is 100, you cannot give 99. If you are hosting guests today, you must go to discuss with "Old Master" three or four days in advance. If "Old Master" says he doesn't have time, that means he refuses. You must "not open your mouth". If you are good at rhetoric, when you meet the Old Master on the road, greet him with a smiling face from afar, bowing deeply, and ask, "Old Master, do you have time? Please help me, I plan to entertain some distinguished guests at your place." When the Old Master hears that you want to entertain distinguished guests, he will definitely stop and ask the names of the guests you are inviting. If he thinks it's okay, he will say: "Okay, you come tomorrow!"

In addition to "eating", you must appreciate the "Yellow Court Scripture" written by the Old Master and the calligraphy and paintings hanging all over the walls at "Gu Gu Yuan". When appreciating, making a "tsk tsk" sound of praise is very appropriate, otherwise, the Old Master will consider you "vulgar".

Sometimes the "Chef Old Master" is also invited to cook at your home, which depends on your status and position. If he agrees to your invitation, the procedure is like this: the host must prepare an invitation card, "Please Old Master to honor us with your presence at a certain place on a certain day to enjoy a simple meal." The words "honor us with your presence" are indispensable, because when the Old Master goes, he is accompanied by the master's concubine, eldest daughter, nanny, servants, and so on. Inviting only the "Old Master" without mentioning the whole family is considered disrespectful and insincere by the Old Master. It is said that the name "Gu Gu Yuan" of the "Old Master" is because, in addition to the "Old Master", the concubine, eldest daughter, nanny, and servants also have to help with cooking. "The Old Master" is respected, "when one attains the Dao, even one's chickens and dogs ascend to heaven". Following this definition, the concubine and eldest daughter may as well call themselves "Gu Gu" (aunt). People who eat there cannot pick on this word, if they don't consider them "Gu Gu", they have to force themselves to consider them "Gu Gu". For the sake of eating famous dishes, they have to become one generation younger. There is a special event: when "Old Master" leads his whole family to your mansion, they must be picked up and dropped off by car. Without a car, even if everything else is prepared, they will not go.

How is the food cooked? Some people criticize it as "light and refreshing", some criticize it as "incomprehensible", and some criticize it as "nothing special". Anyway, God knows that it is cooked by "Chef Old Master", the taste is hard to say, but the Old Master, a "Magistrate Old Master", is willing to cook in the kitchen, this alone makes many people think it is worth eating as an honor. Someone once asked indiscreetly, "Old Master, why is your food so expensive?" It is said that "Old Master" is most unhappy with this sentence. His answer is only "Cooking is a pastime, the ingredients are different from the public, and must be prepared two or three days in advance. For a table of dishes, at least five or six chickens have to be slaughtered. Just the chicken soup alone has to be cooked for two days, let alone anything else."

When the national government moved to Chongqing, many government officials were fascinated by the "Old Master's" great name, sparing no expense to have a feast at "Gu Gu Yuan". The "Old Master" raised his status, accepting only one table a day, no more. Therefore, it often took a long time to ask someone to introduce you, and you couldn't get a seat. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Chongqing a few years ago, he heard of this trend and personally instructed the ministers of the various departments not to have such extravagant acts of eating at "Gu Gu Yuan" again. Several minor characters were even punished for eating a meal there. But no matter how much Chairman Chiang Kai-shek forbade it, some people still secretly went to eat, and the "Chef Old Master's" status did not decrease in the slightest.

On January 15, × planes came to bomb Chongqing. The "Old Master" was unable to suppress his fear. After being frightened once, his heart paralysis recurred. He only lay in bed for two days and died, and the "Gu Gu Yuan" that was on everyone's lips also closed down.

In Chengdu, there is a younger brother of the "Chef Old Master" who opened a "Gu Nu Cai" (Ancient Woman's Cuisine) tavern. There is also a second young master of the "Old Master" who opened a "Bu Zui Wu Gui" (Not Drunk, No Return) small restaurant. These are all inherited from the "Chef Old Master's" legacy, and are calling for the special elegant Sichuan cuisine of "Gu Gu Yuan". But in the end, they are not as magnificent and imposing as the Old Master's style. (24th, Chongqing)

### The War Situation in Central Hubei Improves; Sanyangdian and Yanmenkou are Under Siege; Fierce Fighting Unfolds Along the Yangtze River in Northern Jiangsu

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] Except for Central Hubei, the war situation is generally calm. The battles on Hainan Island are still in the Jiaji and Xinxing areas, where we have a significant advantage. In Central Hubei, the major part of × is the 16th Division, which has been fighting a bloody battle with us for a week, suffering casualties of four to five thousand. We have also suffered some losses. We have launched counterattacks in recent days, annihilating a significant number of × troops in various locations, including Yanmenkou, Sanyangdian, Yiheji, Yangjiahe, Yonglong, Shui Sigang, and Shili Pu. The overall situation has improved. Yanmenkou and Sanyangdian are both surrounded by us, and × is also sending reinforcements, so the battles will become more intense. The × troops in Henan are also active. Most of the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou is occupied by the × 31st Division. There are about ten thousand × troops along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway in northern Henan up to the banks of the Yellow River. × has increased its forces in Zhan Dian and Yuan Wu. We have strengthened our forces at various points in central Henan, and any × invasion will suffer a heavy blow. Jin Sui is quiet. There is still artillery fire along the banks of the Yellow River in southwestern Shanxi.

Kong Xiangxi and Sun Ke each donated 10,000 yuan, and Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui donated 5,000 yuan.

[Local News] Since the start of our full-scale war of resistance, overseas Chinese, in addition to enthusiastically donating and assisting the government in the war effort, are also striving to raise funds to purchase medicine for use by the soldiers at the front. According to a reporter, the Chinese community in New York, America, recently took advantage of the New Year to raise 400,000 US dollars to purchase one hundred of the latest ambulances for use by the soldiers at the front. These vehicles will be shipped back to the country in succession and transferred to the front lines.

After the Enemy Infiltration of Hainan Island, Vietnam Strengthens Military Preparations. Ordnance Factories and Aircraft Factories Begin Construction. Indigenous Troop Numbers Double. The French Colonial Minister Reports to the Assembly. [Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] Colonial Minister Moutet recently attended the Colonial Committee of the Senate this afternoon and presented a detailed report on the situation caused by the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. He stated that Vietnam's air power has been strengthened, and ordnance factories and aircraft factories have begun construction (currently manufacturing 150 military aircraft and 400 engines per year). In short, Vietnam already enjoys autonomous rights in its military organization. The number of indigenous troops in other colonies has doubled compared to a year ago, and will continue to be increased in the future. He compared the troop levels of the French-owned Somaliland in East Africa and Italian-owned East Africa, and concluded that the French colonies are under alert and prepared for any eventuality.

The Enemy Attempts to Seize Administrative Power in the Shanghai Concessions. Using the Pretext of Suppressing Terrorist Activities to Force the Signing of Agreements and Compel "Cooperation". [Reuters, Shanghai, 4th] A Japanese military spokesman here told reporters today that senior Japanese army and navy officers visited the commanders of the British, American, and Italian forces stationed in Shanghai today to request cooperation. They requested that the foreign military commanders agree to jointly eliminate terrorist activities in the Public Concession, in accordance with the steps agreed upon yesterday by the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council. The spokesman said in response to a question that there was no so-called cooperation problem in the past, but that future cooperation will be closer after discussions with the foreign military authorities.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 4th] Regarding the Japanese side's repeated protests about the Shanghai concession's suppression of terrorist activities, the Public Concession's Municipal Council reached an agreement with the Japanese military authorities yesterday. According to a public announcement issued by the Japanese Consulate General, the main points of its content include: (1) Strictly implementing the emergency decrees issued by the Municipal Council; (2) Handing over armed terrorists to the relevant parties; (3) Cooperation between concession police and Japanese military and consular police; (4) Protecting Japanese residents and prohibiting everything. The agreement also contains measures to prevent disruptive elements from entering the concession, searching Chinese people entering and leaving the concession at certain key points, and increasing the number of Japanese police in the Municipal Council. The announcement stated that the most important point is the cooperation between officials of various countries and the residents of the colony.

Kong Xiangxi Reports at the Political Council on Developing the Rich Resources of the West (Continued) --- Part Five of the March Political Report ---

Third, even before the war of resistance, the people of the country had already attached importance to the promotion and relief of the rural economy. Therefore, at that time, in addition to rural cooperation and agricultural experiments, the government specially established the Agricultural Bank to specifically regulate rural finance. This kind of work must be done even if there is no war of resistance, and it must be done even more during the war of resistance. However, before the war of resistance, the work of the Agricultural Bank focused on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Since the war of resistance, it has changed to focusing on the southwestern provinces. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Agricultural Bank established 76 county cooperative treasuries in the southwestern provinces, recognizing a share capital of more than 7 million yuan, and established 49 agricultural warehouses, which can accommodate more than 1 million dan of grain. It invested a total of 8.7 million yuan in farmland irrigation, which can irrigate more than 2.3 million mu of paddy fields. It purchased cotton yarn, cloth, and food and transported it to the rear to meet the urgent needs of the military and civilians, worth more than 11 million yuan. Although the business of the Agricultural Bank has reached a considerable scale, we still need to continue to work hard and expand it. However, rural work is extremely difficult. Not only is the level of knowledge of farmers very low, but there are no financial institutions in the countryside that can be used. Therefore, the speed of rural undertakings cannot be as great as that of cities.

Two Major Advances in Transportation As for transportation, there have been two major advances in the past three months. First, in the past, there were several agencies managing transportation, and cooperation was quite difficult, and waste was unavoidable. In order to correct this malpractice, the Executive Yuan specially established a Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee at the beginning of this year, in order to centralize transportation tools and rationalize the transportation of goods. After the success of British and American loans, we can probably double the number of vehicles on our highways. Second, we have determined the railway network in the southwest. In addition to the Yunnan-Burma Railway, we plan to build the Kunming-Yibin Road, and then connect Weining on the Kunming-Yibin Line to Guiyang, and from Guiyang to Liuzhou. In this way, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi can all be integrated. The railway in the northwest is currently being actively negotiated with friendly countries, and there are no concrete results that can be reported. In addition, the air link between China and Britain also deserves our attention. According to the agreement, our planes can fly to Rangoon, and British planes can fly from Rangoon to Kunming. Once we get to Rangoon, we are on the main road for flights between Europe and Asia. In the future, mail and passengers between Europe and Asia can be much faster. There will be detailed reports on military and political affairs. There will also be opportunities in the future to report to you in detail on financial work. In order to save time today, I will not mention them.

Belief in Inevitable Victory in the War of Resistance Due to the above-mentioned manifestations of various facts, it can be seen that my country's wartime organization has reached perfection. In terms of human, financial, and material resources, total mobilization has long been implemented. Compared with the Japanese, who daily chant national total mobilization but actually have constant disputes, it is even more effective. This is all because the various competent authorities, under the leadership of the Supreme Commander, can plan and proceed in response to environmental needs, and can concentrate their efforts to engage in the work of resistance. External warfare is a touchstone of a nation. The shortcomings revealed by our nation this time are, generally speaking, nothing more than that our degree of modernization is not enough. The enemy chose to attack us at the beginning of our country's modernization, believing that our strength was not enough to resist their aggression and that they would be able to achieve a quick victory. But their estimate was wrong. The Chinese nation, in the midst of hardship and difficulty, has shown the great spirit that has been cultivated for thousands of years. Therefore, we believe that the future of the nation is bright. The war of resistance has increased our self-confidence. We should reform quickly when we find shortcomings in our work. At the same time, we should not only preserve the advantages shown by the nation, but also carry them forward. When the Political Council meets, it is time for us to review the past and plan for the future. The government is willing to discuss national affairs with you with full sincerity. Whether things are related to the current war of resistance or to the grand plan of building the country for a hundred years, we should all plan carefully and work together for complete success. You are all well-known celebrities and scholars in the country, and your knowledge is extremely rich. We hope that you will express your opinions and contribute to the country. We are full of expectations. (End)

The special budget for the army for the next year to deal with the war in China will be roughly the same as this year's. Only a part of the troops in China must be transferred back and replaced by new troops. At the same time, another sum of money must be allocated for the construction of military defense works." Navy Minister Yonai said, "The navy's special budget of 81.2 million yen will supply the activities of the naval forces in China, including warships, aircraft, military supplies, and the construction of defensive structures and the establishment of hospitals." During the War of Resistance, the Chinese Press Strives to Produce "Paper Bullets" in the Enemy's Rear Area; A Vigorous Atmosphere Despite Hardships 【Associated Press, Chongqing, 4th】 Local Chinese newspapers said that 58 Chinese newspapers have been closed in the occupied areas of Beiping, 15 in Qingdao, 18 in Nanjing, 27 in Tianjin, and 21 in Guangzhou.

Newspapers that have moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong include Shen Bao, Lih Pao, and Ta Kung Pao. There are a total of 20 Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong. Chinese newspapers unanimously use the slogan "The enemy's rear is our front line" and strive to produce "paper bullets." The Shanxi Chinese Army and the Eighth Route Army publish 45 kinds of newspapers. Guerrilla teams also run some newspapers in the occupied areas to supply spiritual food.

The Urgent Need to Excise the Carbuncle of Western Hunan - Special Correspondent Keng Ya

The serious problems that are fully displayed in western Hunan today, based on the reasons mentioned in the previous dispatch, are not only due to how the enemy threatens, but also to several internal problems that are growing secretly; they are described as follows:

1. The Refugee Problem. I remember Mr. Xu Shiying calling refugees righteous people, truly because their aspirations and actions are commendable. Currently, the refugees gathered in western Hunan are mostly people from the Jiangzhe and Jinghu areas, and the families of small civil servants from various institutions. They painfully feel the fall of their homelands, are unwilling to submit, and first fled to Wuhan, where they could barely make a living for a limited time. The second step was to flee to western Hunan. The travel expenses they brought with them were like "dead water that cannot be stirred by a gourd," and they fell into difficult straits. They pawned clothes, sold antiques, borrowed from relatives and friends, and telegraphed for remittances (the telegraph office sends the most telegrams every day with urgent requests for money, such as "urgent need for money" and "hoping for money as hoping for life"). All avenues of hope have been exhausted, and their lives of wandering and displacement due to national disasters have since fallen into an unimaginably bitter sea!

2. The Wounded Soldier Problem can be divided into two parts: one part consists of wounded soldiers who have just been transferred from the front line. Because they have suffered from artillery fire on the front line, and the transportation on this route is inconvenient, they often have to walk with their injuries. A few, believing that they have made great contributions and should enjoy special treatment in the rear, are inevitably disappointed by their experiences along the way. In addition, the inadequate hospital facilities can further arouse their anger, and even the slightest dissatisfaction can cause unnecessary conflicts. Another part consists of those who have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, and who have reorganized into honorary regiments and still bravely stepped onto the front line; but there are also those who have deserted and become scattered soldiers, or have become disabled and are unwilling to be transferred further to Sichuan and Guizhou (wounded soldiers who are discharged from the hospital and are found to be disabled in various grades should be concentrated in designated disability hospitals in the rear). Although the number is small each time, if they accumulate several times, they can become a mountain, becoming an underwater reef in the quiet stream of society. This phenomenon is inevitable in places where wounded soldiers are received and concentrated, but western Hunan, due to its special location and transportation, seems to experience it more severely. For example, Changde was originally an important town in western Hunan and is also one of the ends of the confluence of wounded soldiers and refugees from various places. Although it is known as a rice-producing region, its excessive population increase has affected the procurement of food and salt, and it is gradually feeling the frustration of still water not quenching immediate thirst.

3. The Bandit Problem is the core problem of security in western Hunan. There have been many bandits in western Hunan for a long time. In the past, poor politics, lack of public awareness, inconvenient transportation, and the suffering of the people's livelihood have combined to create the phenomenon of today. It is said that the bandits spreading in the mountainous areas of western Hunan and the border between Hunan and Guizhou number no fewer than several gangs, with hundreds of people in each group. However, "there is also a way for thieves." They do not rob soldiers who are going to the front line to resist the war, wandering young students, refugees, or mail. However, wealthy merchants and, around the time of the withdrawal from Wuhan, the vehicles carrying valuables belonging to many senior civil servants who were driving from western Hunan to Sichuan and Yunnan were invariably "borrowed" by them. General Xue Yue was appointed to preside over the political affairs of Hunan in early February, and the first chapter of his manifesto was to strictly order the security zones to eliminate bandits within a time limit, which is indeed a crucial and timely measure.

The above three major problems in western Hunan: how should refugees be actively organized and trained? How should wounded soldiers be properly managed? Responsible agencies and social figures have discussed them extensively. If the government is determined to solve them, it is not difficult to achieve success. As for the bandit problem, it is certainly very serious. However, in the current era of the sacred war of resistance and rapid progress, it is possible to take advantage of the situation and completely resolve it. We know that bandits are not unchangeable people, and they are not completely unusable people. In a certain sense, they are certainly bad, but in another sense, they are also suitable for use in a national war. In the past and present, many of the most active guerrilla teams in the areas between the White Mountains and Black Waters outside the pass, the land of generous songs in Yan and Zhao, and the Taihu Lake basin in the north and south of the Yangtze River are incarnations of these heroes of the green forest, bravely participating in battles to establish extraordinary meritorious service. To go further, Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past used various secret societies as revolutionary forces, and the sage of Hunan, Zuo Zongtang, used secret societies to quell Xinjiang. Wasn't his approach to find a way to transform the existing potential undercurrent in society into a useful mainstream in the great era?

In the past, the local government had partially adopted the method of appeasing the bandits in western Hunan, but neglected political education work. As a result, not only did it fail to subtly change their nature, but it also allowed them to secretly engage in illegal activities under a protective talisman. The method of prescribing the right medicine for the future is good, as they already have the good intention of "not robbing soldiers resisting the war." We should urgently use political means to focus on this valuable motive, and use it to persuade, appease, and recruit them, expanding their motive of "not robbing soldiers resisting the war" to not robbing the entire people and the entire country, and further adopt a positive attitude to jointly participate in actual resistance actions. I think that we are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and they have many brave men. As long as the measures of appeasement are appropriate, the problem is indeed not difficult to solve.

In addition, there is a more practical and fundamental method. This is a specific suggestion from a certain gentleman from Hunan: "Find ways to dredge river channels, regulate the supply and demand of food (food prices vary in each county. For example, the selling price of top-quality white rice in Changde is 12 or 13 yuan per picul, while it is only worth 4 or 5 yuan in Yuanling, 300 or 400 miles upstream, and further upstream it drops to 2 or 3 yuan. On the one hand, low prices hurt farmers, and on the other hand, rice shortages are gradually felt, all due to inconvenient transportation and inability to regulate). Give the people the greatest democracy and freedom, and universally mobilize the people to organize; more importantly, strengthen political work, especially the political work of the self-defense regiments, which is even more urgent!" It can be seen that the key to solving the problem is that all factions return to their origins and still mobilize politically. I believe that the government should make the greatest determination to do so!

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 4th] According to the verdict issued yesterday by the Ceret Court, the silver bars transported to France last month by the fifteen trucks of the Spanish Republican government must be temporarily retained in France. The batch of silver bars is worth approximately 20 million francs. The Spanish Franco government requested to take it back, and pointed out that the Republican government had no right to transport it to France. However, the Spanish Republican authorities said that the silver bars belonged to private individuals. In response to their request, they decided to deposit them abroad. It is heard that the French court's opinion is that the batch of silver bars must remain in France as long as the Spanish Republican government exists, pending legal resolution.

(Reuters, Madrid, 3rd) Officials recently announced that the President of the Madrid High Court will begin an investigation into the treatment of political prisoners and prisoners of war transferred from Catalonia to France.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] According to the Burgos special interview of the "Daily Telegraph", British trade representatives are expected to arrive in Spain in the near future to begin economic and financial negotiations with the Franco government. The British side believes that Spain is a large market for British cotton weaving machines, railway wheels, locomotives, motorcycles, raw materials, and all manufactured products. The greatest wish of the British representatives this time is to make the Franco government change its current import and export trade control methods to a more moderate policy.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 4th] Since the news of General Goering's visit to Italy spread, Italy has been extremely interested, and most newspaper commentaries said that General Goering is the most appropriate person to convey Hitler's thoughts. It has been two years since Goering visited Italy. During these two years, Goering has held the positions of Minister of the Air Force and member of the Four-Year Plan, with heavy responsibilities and many affairs. This tour of Shengli is just right for a little rest. According to the press, Goering may take the opportunity to meet with important political figures, but the external report that Goering will go to Libya is only reprinted without any comment.

The United Kingdom Orders New Aircraft [Reuters, London, 3rd] It is learned that the British Air Force Department recently ordered two "Fairey" high-speed aircraft and has now continued to order twelve of these aircraft. These aircraft are single-leaf aircraft made of Shen metal, equipped with four engines of 10,000 horsepower. At an altitude of 10,000 feet, the speed is 220 miles per hour. It can carry 30 passengers and fly directly to the capital of any European country without stopping. The passenger seat equipment is excellent, allowing passengers to travel comfortably at high altitudes. The higher the aircraft flies, the faster it can go, because the impact of adverse weather conditions at high altitudes is lower.

It is Rumored that Schacht Will Resume an Important Position, Promoting the "Schacht Plan" [Reuters, Berlin, 4th] It is rumored that former German National Bank President Schacht will take a new position and plans to visit Romania. However, people close to Schacht unanimously deny this. External rumors say that Schacht will take an important position in the near future. Some people even think that the reason for Schacht's return is that the Deputy President of the German National Bank, Dr. Bremen, is in poor health and suffering from mental deterioration. According to reports, Dr. Schacht has recently conducted important economic negotiations with major industrialists and exporters, and plans to travel overseas soon. Special attention is paid to the Balkans, including Romania, where he will conclude negotiations that have already begun regarding the purchase of large quantities of oil. There is a new "Schacht Plan" in the industry, which is intended to supplement the four-year plan. Its main task is to reorganize import and export trade and its regulations. Outsiders also say that Schacht will serve as Hitler's economic advisor, and his position is similar to that of Neurath's foreign affairs advisor.

Political Unrest in Czechoslovakia After Submission The Negotiations between the Slovakian State and the Government Have Reached a Stalemate. [Central News Agency, Czech Republic, 4th] Political unrest has occurred in the Czech Republic again. The Slovakian State previously submitted several requests to the Federal Government. The Federal authorities insisted that the authorities of the State should first explain how they would cooperate with the Federal Government before they would agree to consider them. The Slovakian representatives avoided talking about this matter, and the negotiations therefore reached a stalemate. The Czech political unrest this time may also affect the future domestic political situation.

The New Pope Delivers a Peace Speech, Praying for the World to Reach Prosperity; The Papal Secretary of State Has Been Appointed. [Central News Agency, Vatican, 4th] It is reported that Pope Pius XII has decided to specially appoint the former Archbishop of Paris, Maglione, as the Papal Secretary of State.

[Reuters, Vatican, 3rd] The new Pope Pius XII delivered a peace speech, saying, "This peace is what the Pope advises you and enthusiastically prays for, and is dedicated to it. This peace is the highest gift from heaven and is longed for by kind and righteous people. I hope that everyone will be loved by God and obtain inner peace, bathe in the Holy Spirit of Jesus, and obtain family peace, and hope that all countries will maintain mutual friendship and cooperate together, so as to obtain noble benefits under God's care. At this difficult time, I pray that God will bless the leaders of all countries, so that they can lead their people into a path of prosperity and progress, and I also pray for all welfare for people outside the Church."

[Reuters, Charles Church, 2nd] President Roosevelt sent a telegram to the new Pope today, saying, "I am very pleased to hear of your election as Pope. Your recent visit to the United States, during which I heard your teachings, is still vivid in my memory. Please accept my sincere congratulations."

Religious Disputes Continue Unabated in India. Gandhi Fasting to Advise, Demanding Improved Treatment of the People. The Indian Council of State Requests British Mediation. [Central News Agency, Ragot, 4th] Indian independence movement leader Gandhi fasted for the fourth time yesterday to ask Buddhists to cease their disputes. Gandhi is currently lying in bed, and only a few of Gandhi's most trusted comrades are taking care of him in the room. According to doctors, Gandhi's body is extremely weak.

[Central News Agency, Mumbai, 4th] The Indian Council of State has sent a telegram to the Governor-General of India requesting him to mediate the conflict between Buddhists and Muslims so that Gandhi can resume eating as soon as possible. The Council of State also decided to adjourn for three days.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] Although the news of Gandhi's hunger strike has attracted great attention from people here, everyone now believes that this is a dispute between Gandhi and the Chief of Rajkot, and no higher authority can intervene. Political figures believe that the Chief's tour of Raputdena will not be suspended due to Gandhi's hunger strike.

[Reuters, Ragot, 3rd] Gandhi is on a hunger strike in a simple room on a small bed. Only his most trusted people are allowed to enter. Gandhi's sister, who is 75 years old, entered the room and had an hour-long conversation with Gandhi. The scene was very moving. Gandhi said that unless his proposed reform of Rajkot is fully answered, he will fast to death.

[Associated Press, Ragot, 4th] Gandhi began his hunger strike yesterday at noon after a special prayer. Gandhi's body was originally very weak and not suitable for this move. Gandhi's hunger strike this time was because he had presented it to the Chief of Rajkot last week, requesting that the people be granted more rights. The Chief did not answer. An Associated Press reporter witnessed the Chief of Ragot still at ease yesterday, apparently indifferent to Gandhi's hunger strike. According to the Chief, he plans to send a letter to Gandhi, asking him for time to consider.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 3rd] The conflict between Hindus and Muslims has eased, but six injured people have died. Since January 27th, the total number of casualties has been 213, including 14 deaths.

[Central News Agency, Rangoon, 4th] Muslims and Buddhists clashed again yesterday, with 12 people killed and 200 injured. Fortunately, the British army patrolled the affected areas continuously, and the incident could not be expanded.

[Reuters, Danzig, 3rd] Five hundred Jewish colonists left here today, and their destination is unknown. This is the first batch of Jews to leave here for other places. They boarded cars with their families this morning, and each person was only allowed to carry a canvas bag. They were inspected by customs in advance. The police also received information that someone was planning to smuggle currency, so they arrested many people, including a Reuters reporter, but released them after a few hours.

Palestine Conference, The British Government Issues Important Documents, The Arabs and Jews Still Hold Their Own Views [Reuters, London, 3rd] The "MacMahon Documents" were issued today by the British government in the form of a white paper. The documents are the correspondence between Sir Henry MacMahon, Governor of Egypt, and Sherif Hussein of Mecca in 1916. The Arab representatives currently use them as the basis for demanding independence. The entire set of letters occupies 16 pages and includes a map of Syria and Turkey. The first letter is from Sherif Hussein to Sir MacMahon, dated July 14, 1915. The letter requests that the British side recognize the independence of the Arab countries. Sir MacMahon's reply, dated August 30, 1915, states that the time is not yet ripe. These documents prove that the British government did indeed express to the Arabs that "the independence of the Arabs is the clear desire of Britain."

[Reuters, London, 3rd] British representatives and several Jewish representatives held an informal meeting this afternoon, which lasted half an hour. It is heard that the Jewish attitude has not changed. After the Jewish Committee meets on Monday, discussions will continue. At that time, the Jewish attitude will be determined.

Flying Hotel Sister Plane Named in the United States [Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Pan American Airlines' new 74-seat flying boat will begin regular service on the Atlantic route in a few weeks. Today, Mrs. Roosevelt presided over the naming ceremony at the Anacostia Naval Air Station. It was named "Yankee Clipper". The naming ceremony abandoned champagne and used a water bottle, which contained water from seven oceans. It is said that the flying boat is a sister plane to the "Flying Hotel" that recently crossed the Pacific to Hong Kong.

Film and Drama on Women's Day: Women and the Male-Centric Society in Film and Drama - A Female-Centric View by Hu Chunbing

(I)
From a biological perspective, film and drama tap into three innate human "drives" (or impulses): the self-preservation drive, the sexual drive, and the self-defense drive. These are the fundamental forces that sustain human production, survival, and growth, and they are also the most primal and powerful subjects in film and drama.

Many historical tragedies of character stem from an overweening ego, excessive ambition, building a "tower to fall from." In Greek tragedies, hubris and pride offend the gods or fate, or pursuing miscalculated ambitions (fighting a losing battle) all have the self-preservation drive as their tragic core. This "self" often represents not just an individual, but a place, a social class, a nation's selfishness and prejudice. Napoleon Crossing the Rubicon, and the Macbeths who both meet their doom, are excellent dramatic examples of this "self-preservation drive."

Sexual joy is an eternal subject in art. Likewise, "love is nature's trick to compel the prolongation of its existence." Love is a device of drama and film. No two loves are ever exactly alike, making it an ever-novel and interesting subject. The sexual drive, being closer to natural human life, is the most enduring, widespread, and diverse motivation in drama. This force faces the most obstacles, is most prone to encountering enemies, and is most susceptible to disagreement. In other words, it is inseparable from social relationships, making it often profoundly moving. From Paris's love for Helen onwards, the sexual drive has become an indispensable element in drama and film.

The self-defense drive is the opposite of the self-preservation drive: the latter is oppression, the former is resistance. In popular drama, whether depicting social or popular issues, the underlying force is undoubtedly the self-defense drive.

These three drives are not mechanically isolated. Life itself is an interweaving of these three, especially the sexual drive, whose content is intertwined with limitless human emotions, social aspects, and struggles. Male-female issues become even more legendary in drama and film.

(II)
From a social viewpoint, drama and film are records of constant, diverse struggles, reflecting how a new society is gestating and how an old society is decaying. They depict a specific instance within this struggle and change, whether a success story or a tale of sacrifice. From these fleshy narratives, we can grasp the core of the struggle.

Such figures, starting with the Virgin Mary, are often women. Since the dawn of human "civilization," male-centric private property societies have existed. Among all the oppressed slaves, women have suffered the most, constantly groaning under the burden of dual oppression.

Drama, good drama, should be the cries and resistance of the oppressed. Because women have not yet achieved complete liberation, the woman question remains one of the best themes in drama and film.

(III)
We must not forget that in Greek drama, women still held a "human position." In Roman drama, they became "primarily an object of desire," only to be consciously restored to a reasonable status after Ibsen. In other words, the more women are oppressed in society, the more important their position becomes in drama and film. In feudal society, she is a "vulnerable item" defended by knights; in capitalist society, she is an idol (a plaything). As either objects or divine beings, their distorted circumstances create their importance in drama and film. In socialist societies, where women face less oppression, their position in drama and film becomes more rational – they are human beings like men. This proves that in male-centric societies, drama and film are more female-centric. When men and women can stand on equal footing and work together, the spell of women will inevitably be broken, and the struggle against oppression, brutality, and cultural robbers will become the most important focus.

(IV)
In wartime China, the female-centric state of drama and film persists, and for social reasons. On the bright side, Chinese women have roared, shattering five thousand years of shackles, stepping into factories and battlefields, achieving many heroic feats. Their posture is so moving and lovable that it can inspire the "poor and weak" to aspire to greatness. In the war of resistance, this female-centric perspective is another aspect of liberation. On the dark side, the higher status of "Dan" roles over "Qingyi" roles in old operas, and the higher pay of female film stars than male stars, merely indicate that male rulers continue to treat women as "objects of desire." This is an evasion of or rebellion against the war of resistance, and by no means a good sign.

Only the war of resistance, striving for national freedom, can transform drama and film from a distorted female-centric state into a normal state of male-female collaboration. In other words, the liberation of women must be achieved through the liberation of the nation.

Theater Movement News: A Week of Theater Movement in the Isolated Island [Continued] Wei Lan

These schools have both advantages and disadvantages. They do not have special provisions for poor students, but they do lend tuition fees to general poor students, tentatively capped at thirty students per class. However, in addition to waiving tuition fees of fifty yuan per semester, they still need to pay miscellaneous fees, a deposit, and other expenses amounting to over twenty yuan. After graduation, students must serve in the school or its affiliated institutions for a certain period. Although there are subsidies or salaries to be earned, some people think this method is too rigid!

Regarding stage technology, there used to be a store specializing in renting scenery before the war, but it no longer exists. A group of comrades dedicated to spoken drama have recently organized a "Shanghai Theater Work Service Cooperative," purchasing scenery, lighting, and other equipment as a cooperative to serve small theater groups lacking stage equipment, facilitating their performances, and charging only a very low price. This service cooperative has been established for more than three months, and many small theater groups are in contact with it. The "prosperity" is quite considerable, which can be said to be a very good work in the theater movement.

Seven, The Rising Red Star Troupe

Following the dissolution of the "Shanghai Drama Academy" and the "Xiaofeng Troupe," another large theater troupe has emerged. This is the "Red Star Troupe," founded by Wang Yigong, Huang Tianmin, and Wu Xudong from the film industry, with a capital of about ten thousand yuan. It has signed a four-month contract with the "Queen's Theater," preparing to perform every day with four plays per month, each play running for one week, divided into three groups for rehearsals. In terms of talent, You Jing, Xu Xingzhi, Wu Renzhi, and others have been contacted to serve as members of the writing and directing committee. Actors include Zhou Xuan, Xia Xia, Zhou Qi, Xu Li, Su Ze, and newcomers selected from the Star Performing Arts Training Institute. The troupe premiered "Night of Carnival" at the Queen's Theater on the evening of December 30, directed by Hu Xudong (actually directed by Xu Xingzhi). The box office was quite crowded, and the results were considerable. Subsequent performances included "The Beginning of Man," the long play "Women's Apartment," and "Peach Blossom Spring," which is also in rehearsal. Although this troupe once caused a sensation in the spoken drama scene at the time and made a considerable contribution to the isolated island's theater movement, its artistic standards were not very high due to its over-reliance on commercialization to determine its operating principles, too much emphasis on the implementation of "professionalization," and a less serious attitude towards work.

Eight, Theater Publications and New Plays

The number of theater publications in Shanghai in recent months is far less than before. "Drama Magazine" was founded in September and appeared with a theoretical, reporting, and introductory attitude, but its content seems a little naive. One issue is published every month, and it has now been published to the fifth issue. On November 20, the inaugural issue of "Theater Art" was published. It is a monthly magazine dedicated to introducing foreign theater theories and plays, with very exciting content and very rigorous theories, especially focusing on the introduction of stage technology. It is a rare publication, but it is too far from the reality of the war of resistance! "Drama," published every Sunday in the "Guide," is also very substantial and especially emphasizes practical theory. In addition, "Weekend," published every Saturday in the Great Beauty Evening News, often publishes manuscripts on spoken drama. "Recreation World" in Shen Bao on Sundays also often publishes theater movement information. There is also a theater publication "The Forties" currently in preparation, and it is feared that it will also be born by the time this article is published.

Since the war of resistance, the publishing industry has suffered great damage, so the production and publication of plays have also suffered great obstacles, and the already desolate theater scene has become even more desolate.

Recently, Shanghai has slowly published a few plays, but translations account for the majority, which is also due to Shanghai's political environment.

The following are worth introducing to everyone:

"The Beginning of Man" (Topze) by the French author Barjolais, translated by Zheng Yanyi and adapted by Gu Zhongyi, is a four-act comedy, priced at forty cents. This play previously had a Chinese translation, "Elementary School Teacher."

"The Struggle of Love and Death" (Le jeu dee A etela Mort) by the French author Romain Rolland, retranslated by Li Jianwu, is a French revolutionary historical drama, a very long one-act tragic work, priced at thirty cents.

"Before Breakfast" by the American author Eugene O'Neill, translated by Fan Fang, is a new type of one-act play, priced at ten cents. This play is very novel, with only one female character, and its performance in Shanghai was very effective.

"Courtesan" (Loparfsenne) by the French author H. Beeque, translated by Yue Huan, is a multi-act play, priced at fifty cents.

The famous Chinese playwright You Jingliu stayed in Shanghai and recently published "Women's Apartment" and "Tears Splashed on Flowers" under the pen name "Yu Ling." The former focuses on women as the main theme and has been performed many times in Shanghai with good results. It is a four-act long play, priced at thirty-five cents. The latter has also been published and is a four-act tragedy.

Aying, the author of the famous play "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain," also stayed in Shanghai. Recently, he published the long play "Peach Blossom Spring" under the pen name Ying Jun. This play is an allegorical symbolic play with good content and has already been staged in Shanghai.

In addition, "Private Lives" by Noel Coward, translated by Fang Xin, is a three-act comedy, and "Family of Liars," compiled and translated by Li Jianwu, has also been published recently.

Nine, A New Struggle is Underway

The environment of the isolated island is so difficult, and in the land and among the people who have lost the comfort of the motherland, all are suffering unbearable pain. However, the struggle of the soil writers continues unabated!

The following news is worth reporting in recent months:

Guanghua University performed "Realized Dreams" at the YMCA on December 7th and 8th. This is a three-act long play, directed by Wu Renzhi. Xiao Feng, Guo Yuanliang, Yuan Rongxiang, and others played important roles. The director and actors are all well-known, so the performance was very successful.

The Ant Bee Drama Society's "Abandonment" has premiered with good results. It was directed by Jin Xin. It is now starting to rehearse "Money," directed by Hu Dao. The society also plans to rehearse two new one-act plays published in the second issue of Theater Art: "Two Friends in Distress," adapted by Lan Yang, and "Ten O'Clock," translated by Sha Su.

The Wild Goose Drama Troupe of the Post Office Savings and Remittance Bureau is currently rehearsing the satirical comedy "The Gentleman's Treat" and "Spring Returns," as well as "Chief Blanc," etc., directed by Wei Lan, which will be performed in mid-February.

The Sino-French Drama and Art School is currently rehearsing Ying Jun's famous work "Peach Blossom Spring," directed by Ren Yongliang. At the same time, the song and dance drama "Infant Tree Flower," written and directed by Wu Xiaobang, is also being rehearsed. The Kunqu Opera department will also perform at the same time, so "Sino-French" has been quite tense in recent months.

In short, although the isolated island is "isolated," the theater movement is gradually raising its head. As 1938 strides towards 1939, the new flowers of hope will surely bloom brilliantly! Naturally, in the current situation, there is still a lack of talent, plays, and finances, but what is gratifying is that everyone is willing to work hard and unite in this harsh environment. They are still striving for Shanghai's freedom and are trying to choose materials for plays that are conducive to the war of resistance, although a few performances are still backward and boring.

The efforts of the theater workers on the isolated island are worthy of admiration. They have shed a lot of blood and sweat in the past year, and now they are rushing forward with the new year of 1939. Their future is bright!

(Postscript) The author drafted this article very hastily, and the collection and reference of materials are not very sufficient, so there are bound to be omissions and errors. I hope readers will understand!

January 25, 1938

The Huanghuagang Joint Performance in Shanghai is Underway: The Hong Kong Drama Community is Fully Mobilized by Bai Shui

The Hong Kong drama movement has progressed from poverty to soundness, and from dispersion to seriousness. This phenomenon shows the progress of Hong Kong theater workers' awareness in the war of resistance, and it also shows that the national war of resistance is advancing towards victory.

In order to more broadly win over the field of our work and strengthen the united front, and especially how to strive for a favorable working environment to coordinate with the national war of resistance and unleash the function of struggle, it is urgent to promote and encourage the work.

The arrival of Huanghuagang National Memorial Day undoubtedly has special significance for us, and it is summoning the Hong Kong theater scene to be fully mobilized under a more progressive banner of unity. Holding a joint grand performance with plays that are the richest and most combative materials of the national revolution is a glorious task.

Under the call and initiation of the China Arts Drama Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and the Guangdong Drama Association Hong Kong Residents Association, the work of fully mobilizing the entire Hong Kong drama community to hold a joint performance on the national holiday of "Huanghuagang" has begun.

At around 1:00 PM on February 26th, the first Hong Kong Theater Troupe Representatives Talk was held at the Kowloon China Amateur School.

There are indeed quite a few of the large theaters, China Arts, China Travel, Times, Hong Kong Drama Association, Guangdong Drama Association, Iron Current, Le Men, Lu Feng, Amateur, Amateur Union, Black and White, Ding Chou, Pioneer, New Voice, China, Red and White, Self-Reliance, Ant Discussion, Women's Fourth Federation, Youth Club, etc. More than 20 communities, such as Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, Mr. Hu Chunbing, ... etc. also arrived, with the number reaching more than 70 people. This kind of meeting of theater people full of enthusiasm is the first after the beginning of 1939!

Mr. Hu Chunbing served as the chairman. He represented the three initiating groups to report on the process of this preparatory work, and then put forward very concrete opinions for everyone to discuss.

Every theater worker is so humble, frank, and enthusiastic in the discussion. Undoubtedly, under the banner of strict and great unity, everyone contributed their most precious opinions. Finally, many methods regarding the joint performance were also approved.

The Kuanzi Joint Performance is a charity performance for the purpose of helping refugees, so it is a charity performance. If all the expenses of this joint performance are paid by a certain community or institution, then all the income in the future will be used by the community to distribute disaster relief. Now there is another opinion that the General Assembly should solicit performance expenses from social celebrities or various communities, then the funds raised in the future will be sent to charitable organizations for disaster relief in the name of the Joint Performance General Assembly. This is the opinion regarding expenses, but the specific details have now been contacted by the Standing Committee of the Joint Performance General Assembly.

This performance will adopt a hybrid joint performance, because the play "Huanghuagang" is a total of four acts and six scenes [with a prologue and epilogue], and requires 70 or 80 actors, and backstage staff also need to reach hundreds of people. It is estimated that more than 200 people will be needed, so it is natural to mobilize all Hong Kong theater workers to work together. This grand joint performance has not yet been held in China, only once in Guangzhou last year, so Hong Kong is considered an initiative. This initiative is to make a glorious and brilliant record in the history of the Hong Kong theater movement!

In order to make the work responsible and systematic, the Standing Council was elected at the talk that day: Secretary Zhongyi (Li Hua), Director of Drama Affairs Zheng Zhu Baishui, Deputy Director Tieliu (Zuo Jiu), Director of General Affairs Zheng Times (Zhang Chishun), Deputy Director (Weng Gefen), Director of Propaganda Guangdong Drama Association (Li Shulun), Deputy Director Zhonglv (Jia Bao). In the past few days, they have already started working intensely with Zhongyi as the office.

Because "Huanghuagang" is a heavy and multi-act play, a director team was formed. It has now been decided that the people responsible for directing are as follows: Lu Dun prologue and epilogue, Li Jingbo Act I, Tang Huaiqiu Act II, Hu Chunbing Act III, Ouyang Yuqian Act IV. In the future, the rehearsal locations will probably be divided into two places, Hong Kong and Kowloon, to facilitate the actors of various theater groups. Hu Chunbing is currently responsible for the overall organization of the script.

This joint performance hopes to achieve greater gains in terms of materials and publicity, so it will expand the performance dates from three days to five days; at the same time, this work is vast and extraordinary, and it is impossible without full mobilization, so it is hoped that the various theater groups that have not yet participated will actively participate!

--May all Hong Kong theater workers be fully mobilized under the united banner of the "Huanghuagang" Joint... under the vast call!

Stage Techniques by Lu Dun

Three, The Beginning of Work

The beginning of a director's work is not at the time of starting rehearsals, but before the rehearsals begin. First, some preparatory work must be done, mainly including the following three items:

(A) The selection and analysis of the script.

(B) The selection and distribution of roles.

(C) The determination of stage setting.

The performance of a drama mainly conveys the content and ideology of the script to the audience. Therefore, the selection of the script is a very important task. According to the current situation, the director has a very heavy responsibility for the selection of the script.

The main thing in choosing a script is to see whether its content and ideology are correct. Especially under the current circumstances, the selection of the script must prioritize those that are beneficial to the war of resistance and have an active theme. In addition to correct ideology, it is also necessary to have excellent formal skills. Even with correct content, without matching form and excellent skills, the correct ideology cannot be expressed, let alone conveyed to the audience.

Secondly, it is necessary to see whether the time, place—environmental conditions, and stage conditions are suitable. For example, when performing in the countryside, if you choose a "Sunrise," the villagers will not be able to understand the life written in the play, which is equivalent to playing the lute to a cow. Or, if you suddenly perform a "Defend Lugou Bridge" now, it is also inappropriate. In short, the selection of the script should be matched with all aspects of conditions, to see whether the stage conditions can be achieved, and also to consider the audience, so that it is easier to obtain the desired effect.

After the script is selected, the director also needs to do some work on the script. Here, in order to save trouble, let's give an example: Max Reinhardt spent six months working on the analysis of the script before starting the rehearsals. He made annotations and explanations for every word and every action in the original script. These explanations included everything in the script: actors' postures, voices, movements, rhythms, intensity... scenery and all the trivial matters on the stage. He studied and observed from every angle of the play. He himself served as all the essential elements—actors, stage designers, costume designers, musicians... Only after this preparatory work was completed did he officially start rehearsing.

Under the current theater movement situation, although we do not have this kind of good environment, nor are you allowed to have this long time to study, this kind of careful and serious spirit is something that everyone who is not a director must possess.

The selection and distribution of roles is not a very difficult task (in our current situation). If it is an already organized theater troupe, then the personality of each actor and the type of role they are good at playing are already known, so it is not difficult to distribute them. If you encounter new actors without stage experience, you can look at their physique, pay attention to their contours and demeanor, and ask them to recite a few lines, and you will already have an idea. Because a sonorous voice that can be used freely is the actor's first asset, and this cannot be obtained by practicing in a short period of time. Otherwise, try their expressions again, and you can roughly decide.

However, what you should pay special attention to is never to use the actor's usual actions as the standard for role distribution. For example, calling a person who loves to talk and make noise to play a humorous role, or calling a quiet and taciturn person to play a tragic role, will not be successful, but will often fail. This kind of actor class has a common saying called "behind-the-scenes boss," who is extremely lively behind the scenes. Once on stage, they are as dull as a wooden chicken, because daily life is ultimately different from the life to be expressed on stage. In daily life, we can completely vent ourselves, but on stage, we must restrain ourselves. Therefore, when selecting roles, it is best to first pay attention to an actor's ability to restrain, and then look at their ability to express.

After the script has been selected and the roles have been roughly distributed, there is another important task, which is the determination of the stage setting.

The stage setting was originally an independent department, and it is necessary to have an expert in charge. However, the director has the right to provide opinions or make modifications to the composition and design. The stage setting occupies the entire stage space and is what the audience comes into contact with the most. At the same time, the setting design and application have a very close relationship with the performance method of the drama. If the director decides that a certain play should be performed using realistic methods, then the stage setting must use realistic methods. At the same time, the position of the setting (including the arrangement of large and small props) has a great relationship with the position of the actors' activities. In addition, the stage setting occupies a major component in the completion of the dramatic atmosphere.

Famous directors have mostly been famous stage decorators at the same time. The progress of modern stage decoration has made the performance methods improve day by day; new performance methods must be matched with new stage decorations, and new stage decorations can help create new performance methods.

When studying and analyzing the script, the director can simultaneously study the design drawings or rough outlines of the stage setting with the decorator, and must coordinate with the performance method to ensure that the whole is harmonious and does not conflict with each other, in order to achieve the success of the entire performance.

Sports News: Combined Chinese and Western Armies to Compete for the Governor's Cup Today; A Win or Draw Will Give the Chinese Team the Championship

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The red blooms urged the plum blossoms to bloom, and the green fatigue climbed up the willow branches. Hong Kong, hidden in the mountains and waters, is even more beautiful and lovely since the spring came to the world. People are in this time and place, as if in a paradise, but looking back at the rivers and mountains of the motherland, the atmosphere of × is fierce, and saving the country and resisting × are the things to return to. We are living here, and we must live in peace and think of danger, and not forget the loyal and brave soldiers of the motherland, who are resisting the invading demons in the icy and snowy land.

I was writing about football and actually said the above words, which is a far cry from the topic. However, the slogan of "saving the country through sports" has long been shouted by someone. I am afraid that the compatriots who are in paradise will be transferred by a special environment and forget that the country is in dire straits, so I unknowingly wrote those extraneous words, hoping that everyone will wake up.

Watching a football game is a more beneficial and uplifting entertainment. Especially today's Governor's Cup game held in Kajiyama will definitely be more exciting. Those who are addicted to football must watch it, and those who are not addicted to football may as well watch it, because watching the ball to relieve boredom is better than seeking sound and color music.

This cup was born in 1932 and has a history of seven years. Calculating the past football accounts, the General Union West Union team has won the championship four times, and the Association China Union team has won it about ten times. Speaking of it is quite ashamed, only won it twice. Speaking of things according to the facts, in the recent six or seven years, the Hong Kong Chinese football circle has already reached a fairly developed era. There are many talents, and the strength is also strong, but whenever competing for this championship, China Union always loses more than it wins. After careful consideration, the overall essence of the Chinese football circle is not absolutely strong.

This time, the Chinese Union's selection of people has met the ideal and there is no dissatisfaction. Although the "football circle model" Li Huitang does not exert his strength, it seems that there is a fly in the ointment, but with Chen Dehui as the center, his impact power has not diminished slightly, only Huitang's shooting is more sure.

First, the two formations will be deployed, and then other things will be discussed.

Association China Union Team

Zhang Rongcai (South China South)

Li Tiansheng (South China South) Mai Shaohan (South China South)

Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Liang Rongzhao (South China South Captain) Song Lingsheng (Oriental Club)

Hou Chengtuo (Oriental Club) Li Zhaorong (South China South) Chen Dehui (South China South)

Jing Xiang (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)

(Reserves) Hui Zhongyun, Li Deqi (Oriental Club) Yang Shuiyi (South China China) Liu Qingcai (South China South)

General Union West Union Team

Shi Han (Middlesex) Parker (Police Club) Liao Yachen (Kowloon Club) Gaoshan Slave (St. Joseph)

Captain

Hai Li (Kowloon Club) Billy Ban (Police Club)

Di Chen (Navy Team) Fei Shiwater (Middlesex)

He Xi (Su Huang Army) Ge Ni (Middlesex) Yan Bachen (Military Supply Team)

(Reserves) Wu Liezhi (Kowloon Club) Bi Lu Du (St. Joseph) Yi Shi Du Lanchi (Hong Kong Club) Shi Di (Middlesex)

Each member of China Union is accustomed to cooperation, and the team's liaison work will definitely be more meticulous than that of the West Union, and the technology of each member has always been in good condition. Today, I only ask for more effort and there will be a greater contribution. As for the strategic issues, because they are so varied, there is no certainty, but the most important thing is not to be rigid. If it is rigid, the progress will be slow and fruitless. If they can all exert their best, adapt to the times, and achieve the wonderful effect of echoing each other before and after, and work hard to open up the situation, then they will not worry about not winning.

In an important game, the issue of victory or defeat is most related to the forwards, because this line is the backbone of the entire team. If its support is strong, it will win; otherwise, it will fail. Therefore, I extremely hope that the three outstanding forwards of China Union must make a great determination in this game. If they can take care of both front and back and not give others an opportunity, then the victory is guaranteed.

It is a mistake for the West Union not to use Gao Shannu as the center forward, and its arrangement is beneficial to China Union. I certainly do not want to see it make any further changes and achieve perfection. I also predict that its front line will have the disadvantage of fighting for itself because each player is not accustomed to working together. However, they are all good at sprinting, so the defenders of China Union should be extra careful. As for the inner defenders, there are both virtual and real. The real ones are obstacles to the China Union line, and the virtual ones must have loopholes to find to cope with the five tigers of China Union's extremely connected front line. I believe that they will sometimes be caught off guard and
