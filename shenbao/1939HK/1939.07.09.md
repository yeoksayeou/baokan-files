### China's War of Resistance and the American Revolutionary War

— Hu Shih

Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, delivered a speech in New York on "Japan's War of Aggression in China," comparing China's War of Resistance to the American Revolutionary War. His words were insightful and his language was brilliant. We have extracted and translated the main points of his speech and are publishing them here. On one hand, it serves to commemorate the American Revolution, and on the other hand, it encourages the Chinese people who are continuing the War of Resistance.

China's War of Resistance, in my opinion, is a revolutionary war with the same meaning and similar circumstances as the American Revolutionary War. The hardships faced by Washington's army at Valley Forge aroused boundless sympathy and praise from historians. It was the dead of winter, yet the soldiers had no shoes or socks, and they marched barefoot. Wherever they went, the white snow was covered with bright red footprints. Washington reported to Congress that he had only a little more than two thousand remaining troops, and they were all barely clothed, with no strength left to fight. The number of people falling ill from hunger and cold increased day by day. The hospitals were full of wounded and sick soldiers, and the facilities were pitifully inadequate, even lacking straw mats to cover the ground. Many wounded soldiers died on the frozen ground.

At this moment of extreme crisis, Britain proposed peace talks, willing to unconditionally abolish all unequal laws. This was indeed a glorious offer of peace. If the founding fathers of America had accepted this proposal at that time, the bloodshed and sacrifices of the next four years could have been avoided. However, in doing so, they would have forever lost the more glorious independence, and the United States of America would never have appeared in the world.

At that time, the founding fathers of America resolutely rejected these peace conditions and continued the War of Resistance for another four years. During those bloody years of war, the situation of danger and hardship was like enduring a terrible winter at Valley Forge. They suffered countless military setbacks, and the territory lost grew day by day. Internal strife and difficulties often arose, and even cases of treason were endless. The value of paper money plummeted. Washington himself once said, "To buy a cart of food, you need a cart of paper money." In early 1780, one dollar in paper money fell to two cents; by the end of the same year, ten dollars in paper money were only worth one cent. Under these circumstances, it was simply impossible to maintain the soldiers' food and clothing.

But no matter how precarious the situation, Washington and his comrades were determined not to give up the War of Resistance. After four years of arduous struggle, they finally achieved the final victory at Yorktown in January 1781.

From this perspective, the situation of the American army led by Washington at that time was not much better than that of the Chinese army fighting the War of Resistance today. Originally, all revolutionary wars are fought by people with inferior military strength, inspired by ideals and justice, against oppressors and aggressors with superior military strength. The final victory always belongs to the invaded and oppressed, because their firm belief in their cause, their loyalty, bravery, and their dedication, are enough to overcome all dangers and hardships!

Weekly World Trends From July 2nd to 8th, Year 28

(1) War of Resistance Enters Third Year, Our × Faces Altered Situation

Starting this week, the revolutionary war of resistance against Japan by the Republic of China has entered its third year. We salute the national warriors who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines and struggling in the rear, we mourn all the armed and unarmed compatriots who sacrificed for the country and the nation, and we celebrate that after two years of arduous danger, we can now see the distant prospect of the independence, freedom, and happiness of the Chinese nation!

In two years of heroic and arduous struggle, the Chinese nation has realized unprecedented unity and unification, established and consolidated the national united front and the program for resisting Japan and building the nation, which is the foundation for final victory, and has begun to develop democratic politics. The total mobilization of the entire nation for liberation has gradually realized progress in political, military, economic, and cultural sectors, enhanced our international status, credibility, and strength, strengthened the united front of democratic peace and friendly nations against fascism and aggression, and exposed and increased the weaknesses, shortcomings, difficulties, and crises of Japan's military, domestic politics, and diplomatic situation in its invasion of China.

These two years have written the most glorious page in the revolutionary history of the Chinese nation and the evolutionary history of mankind. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and other leaders have issued many important documents during the great Double Seventh War of Resistance and National Construction Festival, instructing us that: (1) × In terms of personnel, the quick battle and quick decision policy has been broken, and the "quick peace and quick conclusion" conspiracy has failed. Now they have turned to the poisonous plan of "using war to support war," focusing on mopping up and managing the occupied areas, while carrying out tentative and speculative forward advances, attempting to achieve a situation of neither war nor peace. (2) In the international arena, the situation has taken a tortuous and slow turn for the better. As long as we adhere to the "principle of relying on our own efforts to win external support," international sympathy and assistance will have greater development. (3) In our country, from a national perspective, we have indeed laid the foundation for victory. As long as we adhere to a protracted war of resistance in terms of political strategy, oppose compromise midway, launch a full-scale war, and oppose self-consumption; strengthen unity and unification, oppose conspiracies and instigations, and adhere to an active, comprehensive, and protracted war in terms of strategy, enhance the war effort in the front, expand the battle behind the × army, and intensify the cultivation of the decisive force for counter-offensive; victory will come sooner!

(2) North and South Battlefields Report Success Simultaneously, Warning Alarm in × Rear

Speaking of the military situation of the War of Resistance this week, it is like a gift from heaven, revealing the omen of our army's inevitable victory.

First, looking at the southern battlefield, when our × army strongly occupied Shantou, we immediately launched a large-scale counter-offensive in western and northern Guangdong. This week, there was good news: First, our army counter-attacking Xinhui Jiangdou repeatedly entered the city, engaged in fierce battles for days, and wiped out the × army in large numbers; Second, in the Beijiang area, they attacked Yu and advanced in multiple directions, forcing × Dian to flee to Guangzhou in panic. Now Guangzhou is under our army's control. As for the Lingdong area, our army is still engaged in fierce battles with × forces in the suburbs of Chaozhou and Shantou, and has repeatedly attacked the roads around Chaozhou and Shantou, all achieving victories. However, × people are threatening the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, from Dinghai in Zhejiang all the way to Beihai in, with their × boats and warships "advancing and pressing as opportunities arise," which cannot be ignored!

Looking again at the northern battlefield, the × army's attempt to invade Shaanxi in western Shanxi has failed, while the war in southwestern Shanxi continues to be confusing. In the area bordering Outer Mongolia, the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces have repeatedly defeated the Japanese × army in the past week. Our northern Chinese troops took the opportunity to launch counter-offensives in multiple directions, achieving great victories. Now, on the northern bank of the Yellow River, in the area of Yongji Fenglingdu? Most of the army has moved north and fled east, and the military situation in North China is expected to make smoother progress.

Secondly, although there have been no major changes in the war situation in various places such as Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan, the guerrilla warfare behind the × army has generally developed greatly, and on the Jingzhong Road in central Hubei, another victory was won on the first of this month, and five hundred × soldiers were all killed.

Finally, our battles behind the × people also have new developments. First of all, in the areas of Chu, Jing, Shanghai, Pingjin, guerrilla warfare is very active. The Jinghu Road has been unable to operate for many days in the past week, and the suburbs of Pingjin have also been attacked by our army from time to time. In addition, according to a Jin dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd, anti-war elements of the × army are active in various parts of the Northeast, and the puppet army is wavering and defecting. Since the Japanese and puppet troops have provoked Mongolia, incidents have been serious. And in Suiyuan, our army has recently turned active. Our Mongolian and Han military and civilians are closely united and launching counter-offensives. Do not underestimate these small victories. You must know "taking the rear of × as the front, accumulating small victories into big victories" is our secret to victory.

(3) Wang Jingwei Arranges Puppet Show, Chairman Chiang Righteously Punishes Traitors

As mentioned earlier, Japan is attempting to create a situation of neither war nor peace in order to consolidate and manage its forcibly occupied areas. To achieve this plan, a relatively strong traitorous regime is indispensable. Thus, Wang Jingwei has volunteered 'loyally and bravely' to arrange a puppet show for the Japanese × army. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd, the list of the pseudo-central puppet organization that is about to appear is tentatively set as follows:

Chairman: Wang Jingwei (traitor)

Finance: Wang Kemin (traitor)

Justice: Jiang Kanghu (traitor)

Foreign Affairs: Chen Zhongfu (traitor)

Education: Tang Erhe (traitor)

In addition, it is also rumored × that in order to coordinate the relationship between the northern and southern puppet regimes, it is also planned to establish a special committee in Nanjing by Wang, chaired by Wang, to prepare for the organization, joint government, and to negotiate with Liang Hongzhi (traitor), Wen Zongyao (traitor), Chen Qun (traitor), and others. Also worth noting:

1. They still plan to secretly use the Blue Sky White Sun flag to deceive the public;

2. Stealing the name of "Three Principles of the People";

3. Organize the "Anti-Communist Kuomintang"

4. Organize the "Anti-Communist Nationalist Government", attempting to absorb wavering, selfish, and unself-respecting and unconfident scum, as a pillar for its traitorous actions.

It goes without saying that Wang's conspiracy of "peace" and "anti-communism" is completely serving the Japanese × army. This is intolerable to the people of our entire nation who do not want to be slaves. The supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, pointed out solemnly in his proclamation on the two-year anniversary of the July 7th Incident that Wang and his group's activities are insane, and that "those who do not want × people are already holding the grave to bury him himself, disregarding the country, and willing to be buried with × people"! Today, we must also pay attention to the selfish, self-interested, and those who betray their conscience, lose confidence, and rely on friction to get by and make a fortune during national disasters, who are also creating flags such as "peace" and "anti-communism" to respond to Wang's "soul-calling"—they are truly like Chairman Chiang's proclamation says "they want to let glorious nation be buried with him as funerary objects"—we cannot tolerate it.

(4) Anti-Aggression Upsurge Rises, Britain, America, and Soviet Union Compete to Help Us

Because our country has unanimously persisted in the War of Resistance, our international reputation and status have been increasing, and the international aid movement for China is also becoming more extensive and powerful.

In order to commemorate the second anniversary of China's War of Resistance and expand the movement to aid China, the British Aid China Committee specially launched a "China Week" to mobilize British public opinion to help our country. They specially publish a daily newspaper for this purpose, named "China News," and held a mass rally on the 5th. In the United States, most of the pro-China groups that advocate strong aid to China also held a "China Week" on "July 7th." On July 7th, our overseas Chinese held a grand parade, led by Ambassador Hu Shih, and US Democratic Senator Thomas and labor unions also actively participated.

Regarding the Far East issue, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky visited the US Secretary of State Hull on the 30th of last month. Washington attached great importance to this factory and believed that it would have a significant impact on Soviet-American relations. It is reported that the Soviet ambassador discussed the progress of the Far East situation with Hull and inquired whether the United States would adopt its traditional policy towards the Far East. Hull stated that "the purpose of the United States cooperating with other countries in diplomacy is to prevent aggression by force." The Soviet Pacific Fleet also plans to hold large-scale exercises near Vladivostok, while other naval exercises will be held in the Black Sea. Following the Anglo-French Singapore military meeting, the United States and Britain began to take consultative steps on the Far East issue, which will naturally further develop the anti-aggression movement in the Far East.

(5) Mongol-Soviet Allied Forces Annihilate × Troops on Border, Japanese Troops in North China and Outside the Pass Are in Panic

This week, more intense battles took place on the border between Outer Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and the puppet, and the day of the war against the Japanese × army. In order to divert domestic and international attention, to lure Britain into abandoning aid to China and to please Germany and Italy to strengthen their aid to the latter, they constantly launch provocations against the Soviet Union and Mongolia.

However, the Japanese × army's provocation failed: First, today's Outer Mongolia is already a country of church doctrine. Politics, military, and economics have made great progress. The Mongolian nation, inheriting the glorious tradition since Genghis Khan, and recently inspired by the success of the Soviet Union's revolution and the Chinese nation's insistence on unity and resistance to Japan, has become one of the strongest pillars of the anti-aggression front in the Far East and the Chinese nation's war of resistance, and will never condone the × people's and is determined to inflict merciless on them—Second, the Soviet Union has long firmly stated that it must fulfill its obligations under the Mutual Assistance Agreement for Outer Mongolia, send troops to assist Outer, and any invading forces. Therefore, this time the Japanese × army's provocation has attracted a great disaster, I am afraid that it is not just a loss of soldiers.

On the 3rd of this month, the Japanese × Kwantung Army announced that on the 2nd, the Japanese army began to attack the Mongolian and Soviet troops south of Hulun Lake. The scope of the battle was larger than any previous one. Both sides used tanks, armored troops, artillery, cavalry, and aircraft. At dawn on the 3rd, the Japanese and puppet troops again launched a joint air force attack on the Nomon troops, but they all collapsed. And east of the Kherlen River. were occupied by the anti-Communist Allied Forces. From the 3rd to the 5th, the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces launched a general counter-offensive, not only recapturing the southeastern part of Tsairchao and the west bank of the Khalkha River, but also annihilating more than 800 Japanese soldiers, capturing 50 tanks and shooting down 45 Japanese aircraft; the Soviet-Mongolian army suffered 100 deaths and 200 injuries. Loss of 25 tanks and 9 aircraft.

Now the Japanese × army feels that the situation on the Mongolian-Manchu border is serious and that its troops are insufficient, and there are no troops to be transferred from the country, so it will transfer the North China × army. To be used, troops, cars, gasoline, tanks, artillery, and military supplies have been transported north on the Tianjin-Pukou Line and from Tianjin to North for days. The Kwantung Army in the Northeast is also intensifying its anti-war activities, and executions have also begun to rise up and kill ×. The military difficulties of the Japanese × army are even more serious. However, this is not to say that military operations against China will stop, no, on the contrary, if we do not take the initiative to actively fight, the Japanese × army will still make speculative attacks.

(6) Tokyo Negotiations Begin Next Week, Japanese Launch Large-Scale Anti-British Movement

The Tokyo negotiations in which Japan prepared to use a great degree of enticement and intimidation against Britain will be extended to next week due to the unanimous opposition of the British government and public. Although the authorities of both sides are still actively arranging this negotiation, the conflict of interests between Britain and Japan in China has been exacerbated by the Japanese × army's plot to dominate the Far East. During this period, the Japanese anti-British movement has become even more rampant. In fact, the blockade of the Tianjin Concession has become increasingly strict, the seizure and destruction of British interests in China, and the insults to the British people in China have also become increasingly unreasonable. Especially when British Ambassador Craigie visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the 4th to discuss the negotiation process, Tokyo also increased its anti-British movement. The Japanese military department also issued arrogant demands, saying: "Request Britain to change its understanding of the Sino-Japanese Incident" and abandon its aid to China attitude. After July 5th. Tokyo and other places uniformly held "anti-British movement "mass" conferences" and posted unreasonable slogans such as "Down with Britain's ×× policy" and "Expel Britain from China". On July 7th, in front of the British Embassy in Tokyo, hundreds of Japanese rioters demonstrated, and slogans such as "British must withdraw from the Asian continent" were posted everywhere in the vicinity. At the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma issued a statement, saying that "negotiations should be based on the British truly understanding Japan's position and its purpose in the Far East, and that the negotiations will not be truly resolved unless they benefit Japan's construction of a new order in East Asia." On the same day, Japanese Land Minister Itagaki also issued absurd anti-British remarks, saying that no matter what difficulties are encountered in the future, East Asia must be made East Asia for East Asians. This determination will be bravely expressed in front of the third regiment of aid to China, and there will be no consideration.

The reason why the Japanese × army dares to expand its anti-British actions is precisely because the conflicts between Britain and Japan in the Far East are practically unresolvable, and also because Britain cannot resolutely abandon its policy of compromise.

(7) Chamberlain Emptily Shouts Anti-Aggression, Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Progress

On the one hand, the Japanese × army is advancing step by step in the Far East, and on the other hand, Germany and Italy are eroding the power of Britain and France in Europe; especially the Danzig issue in the past week has been slightly quiet on the surface, but the internal crisis is expanding. All these external pressures have more clearly warned Britain that the sacrifice is coming to the final moment, and peaceful compromise will lead to national subjugation!

Therefore, Prime Minister Chamberlain could not but firmly declare his determination to resist aggression—he said in a nationwide broadcast on the 2nd of this month: "We ourselves are peaceful people and have no intention of conflicting with anyone; however, outsiders must not misunderstand that we have absolutely no determination to resist aggression with all our strength. When necessary, whether it is direct aggression against our people or aggression against countries that have obtained our guarantees, we will deal with it with all our strength." And regarding the Japanese × army, British Foreign Minister Halifax formally informed our Ambassador Koo Wei-chun on July 7th that Britain would not compromise on any major issues in the Tokyo negotiations.

However, the British government's sincerity and strength are located in Britain itself, and most knowledgeable people cannot help but express doubts—just look at the negotiations on the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. This was originally a method for Britain to try to protect its own security in the east and west and to protect the peace of all countries in the east and west, but the British government has not yet abandoned its "half-cut policy" and has not abandoned its attempt to use and play with the Soviet Union, only when the situation is pressing. The attitude has turned for the better.

In the past week, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have gradually shown signs of becoming hotter. However, Britain suddenly put forward counter-demands on the 3rd, requesting the Soviet Union to give the Netherlands the same guarantee, and extend it to the Netherlands, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, and Portugal, which have already been guaranteed by Britain. On the 4th, the British side advocated issuing a joint declaration first, and temporarily setting aside the guarantee issue. In fact, this would only weaken the true meaning and strength of the negotiations, especially making the negotiations drag on and cannot succeed immediately. And shirking responsibility to the Soviet government

This situation cannot continue. The British people, especially the vast British workers, have repeatedly shown this. Recently, they have been stepping up their efforts to launch an international workers' united front in order to strengthen the alliance between workers in various countries and nations seeking independence and freedom to resist fascist aggression. This is a force that we cannot ignore—we must strive for, consolidate, and develop this great force.

### Heavy Fighting Resumes in Southern Shanxi; Cantonese Provinces Launch Counter-Offensives, We Hold the Advantage; Total Japanese Military Deaths Reach One Million

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, August 8th] All battlefields are experiencing fatigue in fighting strength. There are no major battles currently. Although there have been troop movements in southern Shanxi, there has been no actual increase in forces. It seems there are no new intentions. Localized contact has occurred in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Small battles have continued in the vicinity of Kuannan, Xinhui, Jiangmen, Zengcheng, and Conghua for days, where we hold the advantage. Our guerrillas are also active in the suburbs of Guangzhou, achieving considerable success. Japanese forces in western Shandong's Heze have suffered heavy casualties during our counter-offensives. Fierce fighting has also continued in various parts of southern Hebei for days. Japanese soldiers in various parts of North China are tired of fighting. At least a dozen parts of the puppet army have recently defected, both large and small.

[Our Hong Kong News] Western newspapers report that Chinese Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, in a speech on the seventh of July, stated that from the start of the war in Hangzhou to the end of June, "Japanese military deaths have reached 917,800, and 8,555 have been captured." He also stated that although the Japanese could conscript 2.9 million soldiers, they must deploy a portion of their forces against the Soviet Union, and their troop resources are now depleted. China, however, still has strength because Japan has many enemies, while China has only one.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, July 7th] The once-dormant southern Shanxi battlefield has seen fierce fighting since the 6th. Approximately 10,000 Japanese troops from Yicheng and Jiang County have launched an offensive in three routes. One force of about four to five thousand is advancing via Nanchang Village and Po. Another force of about 2,000 is advancing from Shimen. Another force of nearly 2,000 is advancing from Diaoshan Gully. All are launching fierce attacks under the cover of aircraft. Our defending troops on all lines are calmly engaging the enemy. In particular, the fighting is fierce on the Diaoshan Gully front, with intense hand-to-hand combat. In short, there will be news developments on the southern Shanxi battlefield within two to three days.

Situation Improves in Jieyang; Chaotic Fighting in Northern Section of Chaoshan Railway

[Central News Agency, Liuhuang, July 7th] On the afternoon of the 5th, over a hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked our Jieyang Tinggang. A certain unit, taking advantage of the Japanese troops' unstable foothold, joined forces with local militias to encircle them. The Japanese were unable to resist and retreated in disorder. Our troops are now pursuing the enemy in victory, having killed over thirty Japanese soldiers.

[Continental News Agency, Urgent Dispatch from Liuhuang] According to Chaoan, the Japanese remain trapped with no progress. On the evening of the 6th, our troops circumvented the south of Chaoan and attacked Hechao Fuyang in two routes, engaging over two hundred Japanese troops. The Cheng Hai Japanese were cut off. The chaotic fighting continues in the northern section of the railway. We hold the advantage. Furthermore, according to news from the Jieyang County Government here on the 6th, there has been no major fighting in Jieyang in recent days. The Japanese, both on land and at sea, have been intercepted and severely attacked by us, and their momentum is exhausted. Our troop strength is abundant, and the situation has improved.

[Central News Agency, Liuhuang, August 8th] On the 4th, multiple Japanese gunboats attempted to land at several locations near Jieyang. They were all fiercely intercepted and repelled by our forces. The Japanese then chose to flee.

Stable Situation in Jin-Ji Border Region; Multiple Japanese Military Encirclement Attempts Fail

[People's Revolutionary Society News Agency, Xingji, July 7th] Recently, our reporter had a detailed conversation with a senior military officer here regarding the war situation in the border region. The fact that our border region directly threatens the Japanese military's four communication lines of Pinghan, Zhengtai, Tongpu, and Pingsui in North China is a fatal wound to the military and political efforts of the Japanese and puppet forces in North China. Therefore, they have repeatedly concentrated their forces to encircle us. However, because our forces are flexible and the cooperation between the military, government, and people is appropriate, each Japanese military attempt has ultimately failed. Since the 19th of last month, the Japanese have launched encirclements from Pingding, Wutai, Quyang, and Meng County. Wutai deployed about 8,000 Japanese troops, with over twenty artillery pieces and eight aircraft, and advanced southeast from Dongye, Taicheng, and Hebian. They fought fiercely with a certain unit of ours for two days and nights at Yaotou Baihouzhen Chuziyuan and other places. Both sides suffered considerable casualties. On the 21st, another unit of ours attacked the rear of the Japanese forces. On the line between Luojiazhuang and Bujia Zhuang, there were four hand-to-hand combat encounters, killing and wounding over two hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese momentum was thus checked. Over a thousand Japanese troops from Meng County also attacked northeast via Shangyu on the same day. Over a thousand Japanese troops from Yangqu Beidayu, with six or seven artillery pieces, attacked Changxingzhen to the east on the 20th of last month. A certain detachment of our forces fought fiercely near Yangxingzhen. Our troops occupied the surrounding hilltops and fired at the Japanese, who then fled westward in disarray. The Japanese forces from the Pingding area, concentrated from Niangziguan Yangquan and other places, numbered over two thousand. They invaded Hongzidian and Tunjue in northwestern Ping Shan and joined up with the Japanese forces in Shangshe, launching a large-scale eastward offensive. After a certain unit of ours intercepted and attacked them in the Ziyucun area, fierce fighting ensued. Because the main forces from the Wutai area had suffered setbacks and the mop-up plan was broken by our integrated attack, the Japanese forces on each route retreated to their original defenses on the 25th and 26th. It is estimated that in this campaign, we fought fiercely with the Japanese for a week, killing and wounding six to seven hundred Japanese soldiers. We captured many spoils of war. Furthermore, the morale of the Japanese troops attacking our region this time was unusually low. Even under the cover of concentrated artillery fire, they dared not advance. Most of them were new recruits, so in just a few days, they were defeated by our two units.

### The Fall of Dinghai City: Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Land on Three Routes; Zhoushan Middle School Principal Detained; County Magistrate Holds Fast on Isolated Island Awaiting Reinforcements

[Shanghai Dispatch] Detailed reports on the fall of Dinghai have only just been obtained. A merchant who experienced the events firsthand and escaped to Shanghai has provided the following account:

Landing Situation

The Japanese military seized Dinghai by landing at three locations: Tuo, about eighty li from the county seat, Shenjiamen, Zongcang Village, about ten li south of the city, and Daotou and Dongyueguan. The Japanese troops landing at Shenjiamen arrived at the city last and entered the city from the east gate. The Japanese troops landing at Zongcang were next, entering the city from the west gate. The Japanese troops landing at Daotou launched an attack on the county seat from the south gate. The number of troops on the road was about 1,400. Because they had guides, they all took winding paths as if they were familiar with the area.

Principal Detained

When the Japanese troops landed at Daotou, they strafed with machine guns. Two ships fired on the shore from Jiangxin, Daotou. The Quanda Garden at Daotou was destroyed. At that time, Zhoushan Middle School Principal Xiang Fangyuan and Christian Church Pastor Chen Dehong boarded a Japanese warship together, demanding that the Japanese military withdraw and not devastate the area. They were detained by the Japanese military, seemingly to be used to organize a so-called "Maintenance Association."

Fighting at Baiquan

At that time, the troops stationed at Pucisi Temple in the northern suburbs, as well as all the self-defense forces in Dinghai, resisted under the leadership of County Magistrate Su Benshan. After four hours of fierce fighting, they were outnumbered and retreated towards Fanhe Ridge. They have now engaged in fighting in the Baiquan, Xiaozhan, and Dazhan areas. As for the residents of Dinghai City, they all evacuated to the mountain villages as soon as the incident occurred. In total, only thirty to forty people were killed or wounded. However, the grain stored in Dong Baihe and other places was looted. Therefore, the food supply for the troops and civilians evacuated to the mountains is a serious concern.

A Tragic Scene

Due to the suddenness of the Dinghai County Magistrate's situation, he was unable to bring his wife with him at the time. When he was leading his troops in resistance at Fanhe Ridge, his wife was escorted to him by his staff. County Magistrate Su and his wife held hands and sobbed. He said with passion, "When a powerful enemy is pressing in, local officials should only know to be loyal and sacrifice their lives. We cannot think of our families. Please do as you see fit, madam. Take care." After speaking, he bid farewell to his wife with tragic words.

Holding Fast to a Certain Island

It is now known that the County Magistrate has not only dispersed his troops to harass the Japanese military with guerrilla warfare, but he himself has also gone to a certain island by sea, holding fast and awaiting reinforcements. There are still two hundred troops and civilians, and they have already been there for a day. As for his wife, after tearfully parting with the County Magistrate, she was disguised by the county government staff and escorted by boat to Ningbo. She has now gone to Jin Su to personally report the situation to Chairman Huang. Furthermore, when the Japanese troops landed at Daotou, three Japanese aircraft provided cover from the sky. The situation regarding the fall of Shenjiamen is not very clear. It is only known that four Japanese warships fired on the shore that day, and the Jixin Winery in the town was hit.

### Resisting the Blockade; Four Countermeasures in Fujian Province; Chen Yi Encourages Officials and People of Fujian

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, July 7th] Chairman Chen has recently issued countermeasures to resist the blockade, encouraging officials and compatriots throughout the province to strive to achieve them. The general meaning of the original text is that the Japanese have recently intensified their blockade of our seaports. We have now planned countermeasures to mobilize human, financial, and material resources. We will intensify our efforts in the future to exert a powerful support force for our long-term war strategy in the military, political, and economic spheres, resist the Japanese side's final-stage tactics of blockade, and prepare to respond to any Japanese attempts. The primary tasks can be roughly divided into the following four items:

(1) Using large-scale wartime civilian wealth and all anti-war propaganda teams to penetrate deep into the broad masses of the people, conduct the most widespread propaganda, stimulate the emotions of revenge and wipe out humiliation, and promote national integrity, using this spiritual power as the foundation for mobilization.

(2) Reclaim wasteland, widely plant wheat and miscellaneous grains, promote cotton planting and animal husbandry, and revive small industries, so that there is no wasteland, no vagrants, everyone is engaged in production, and the people's lives are stabilized.

(3) Strengthen local self-defense capabilities, utilize all civilian weapons and manpower to serve the cause of defending the country and protecting the homeland, and implement unified control and management of food and essential daily necessities.

(4) Rigorously strengthen the self-defense forces of the masses and eliminate traitors. This will be the standard for evaluating counties, cities, and districts from now on.

The article also stated that the Japanese blockade only increases its own disadvantages. Conversely, if we guide the situation and vigorously implement countermeasures to resist, it is a great opportunity for us to regenerate ourselves through our own efforts. We are confident that our compatriots have excellent resources and the ability to endure hardship and hard work. We can sweep away the habitual practices of complacency and procrastination, make up our minds, utilize abundant materials, pool our wisdom and efforts, work hard and fast, and strive together to be the first in the world. In today's situation, success is assured. Victory is certainly on our side.

### Landmine Explodes on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway; Our Guerrillas Pre-Planted It; One Locomotive Destroyed

[Reuters, Shanghai, August 8th] According to Chinese sources, the "Manchurian Express" train managed by the Japanese Central China Company encountered a landmine explosion near Wuxi on July 7th. Fortunately, the driver stopped the train in time, averting a terrible tragedy. However, the locomotive was largely destroyed, and although there were reports of injuries, none were confirmed. Traffic was interrupted for a long time. A large Japanese force rushed to the scene after hearing the news to search for Chinese guerrillas, believing that they must have been responsible in commemoration of the "July 7th Incident."

### Overseas Compatriots Commemorate July 7th

[Central News Agency, New York, July 7th] Today is the second anniversary of the Chinese War of Resistance. Chinese people here held a grand commemorative meeting and erected a monument for the fallen soldiers. Chinese people in Kansas City, Chicago, Boston, Washington, and other places also held commemorative meetings.

### A Certain Commander Discusses the "Sausage-Eating Strategy"; Creates a Great Victory in the Zhongtiao Mountains; Another Great Tale from the War of Resistance

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, August 8th] In this great victory in the Zhongtiao Mountains, our army adopted the "sausage-eating strategy." These words came from the mouth of a certain commander who personally directed the battle. According to him, the Japanese advance into the Zhongtiao Mountains, numbering about 20,000, resembled a string of sausages stretched across the mountain range. We lacked the strength to eliminate them entirely, so we resolved them segment by segment, defeating them individually, just like eating a sausage. We cut and swallowed one piece at a time, thus achieving the annihilation of the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi. Previously, in the great victory in northern Hubei, we had the glorious tactic of "opening the bag to catch the rats." This time in the Zhongtiao Mountains, we vanquished the Japanese with the "sausage-eating strategy." These two achievements complement each other, north and south, and are truly a great tale from the war of resistance.

[Central News Agency, August 8th] Geneva, July 7th, special dispatch. Today is the anniversary of the July 7th Incident. Overseas Chinese here held a meeting at the League of Nations representative office to commemorate it. Everyone also voluntarily donated one day's living expenses. Many Swiss newspapers published the declaration of the overseas Chinese, which detailed Japan's aggressive policies, which have been foiled by China's heroic resistance over the past two years, and called on European countries to continue to provide relief to Chinese refugees. Zhu Xuefan, the Chinese representative attending the International Federation of Trade Unions, met with representatives and journalists from the conference today and discussed ways to obtain resistance films.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Broadcasts a Speech to the United States; Urges Sanctions Against Japan

[Reuters, Chongqing, August 8th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, at the request of the American Anti-Aggression Committee, broadcast a speech to the United States yesterday, urging all countries to fulfill their obligations under their treaties and implement economic sanctions against Japan, as well as provide material assistance to China. Madame Chiang argued that economic sanctions against Japan and material assistance to China would both lead to Japan's collapse sooner.

### Chiang Kai-shek Addresses Compatriots on the Battlefield

(Continued from yesterday) Today, we can only achieve true peace through resistance and victory. There is no other way. If we were like the traitors, fearing death and surrendering midway, the so-called peace they speak of is a shameful act of inviting thieves into our homes. Since the word "peace" existed, it has never been so desecrated. The peace spoken of by traitors is the peace of slaves, the peace of extinction. We have no other name for it, but we can call it "traitorous peace." We, the Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, possess integrity and spirit. When those traitorous Japanese boast and brag, we must be even more determined, actively maintain our dignity, and demonstrate the spirit of heroic struggle.

Furthermore, consider the Japanese military's evil scheme of "using war to sustain war." This is to further consolidate their occupied areas, exploit the blood and sweat of our compatriots, and use it to fund their slaughter of our compatriots. The Japanese have recently deployed most of their military force in their so-called "mop-up" operations, and economically, they have progressed from initial blockade, destruction, and plunder to their so-called "development" and "construction." We must ensure that the Japanese plan to "use war to sustain war" becomes a dead end for them. We must not only focus on military "counter-mop-up" operations but also pay attention to economic "anti-development" and "anti-construction" to thwart the Japanese plan to drain our blood and prolong their demise. To achieve the above objectives, I specifically propose several points for various areas behind enemy lines to refer to when launching counter-mop-up warfare:

First, in areas surrounded by the Japanese, strive to disrupt Japanese transportation and "construction" to exhaust the Japanese and shrink their occupied areas day by day, so that our guerrilla bases become larger and stronger. We must launch a broad guerrilla war to contain even more Japanese troops.

Second, destroy all Japanese economic "construction" and their so-called "development" projects. Encourage all the people in the war zone to refuse all Japanese requisitions, refuse to work for the Japanese puppets, do not use Japanese puppet banknotes, do not buy Japanese goods, and absolutely refuse to supply the Japanese puppets with any food or goods. Work hard and live frugally to increase production, cultivate the strength for sustained combat, stimulate the will to resist, and promote national spirit. On the one hand, eliminate all traitorous activities. Everyone must be worthy of being a citizen of the Republic of China and a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. Uphold the Premier's teachings, the Premier's thoughts, and the Premier's legacy of saving the country and the people, and we will not allow the Japanese puppets to alter them in the slightest. In the war zone, distorting the Premier's legacy and spreading the theory of compromise and surrender are all acts of national treason and should be severely punished and sanctioned. Third, implement a spiritual general mobilization and strengthen vigilance. On the one hand, implement the public agreement, raise awareness of resistance, and promote national spirit. On the other hand, eliminate all traitorous activities.

Fourth, intensify the disintegration of the puppet army and promote the return of puppet soldiers. Intensify the pacification policy of opposing the Japanese and resisting the puppets. The people in the war zone should use various methods in this regard, especially for the puppet soldiers, to actively persuade them to display a great and fearless spirit, turn their guns around, and defect to defend our country. Whatever the Japanese oppose us doing, we must resolutely do to resist the enemy and save the country.

Compatriots on the battlefield should especially be vigilant and encourage each other, love each other sincerely, unite as one, and thwart the Japanese puppets' various deceptions and divisive schemes. Recognize that whatever is beneficial to the Japanese is harmful to us. Therefore, whatever the Japanese ask us to do, we must absolutely not do. Whatever the Japanese say is good is certainly bad. Whatever the Japanese say is bad is certainly good. Observe all Japanese words and actions from the opposite perspective to respond and destroy them.

Compatriots on the battlefield, our two years of resistance have indeed laid the foundation for final victory today. As long as we, the entire country, the front and the rear, are closely united, becoming more and more heroic and stronger as we fight, the day when our Chinese nation achieves independence, freedom, and equality is in the near future. There is no doubt that you will be completely liberated from the iron heel. At present, what we need is for everyone to endure pain and not hesitate to sacrifice. If we can fight to the death and persevere to the end, then the more pain we endure, the more secure the happiness of our descendants will be. The more lives we sacrifice, the more we can preserve the infinite lives of our nation. Everyone must redouble their efforts. The responsibility of saving ourselves and saving the country is the natural duty of our upright Chinese citizens, to seek the glory of final victory. (End)

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing; British Ship Nearly Suffers Mishap; Oikawa Visits Holworth to Apologize

[Reuters, Chongqing, August 8th] Yesterday, twenty-seven Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing. One bomb landed within fifty yards of the British gunboat "Gnat," causing the ship to be severely shaken, to rush towards the riverbank, splashing water onto the deck, and knocking down the bookshelves hanging in the cabins. Bombs also landed near other British and American gunboats. Another bomb hit an air-raid shelter near the American Embassy, burying thirty people alive.

### Anti-Aggression League Presents Embroidered Banner to Chiang Kai-shek

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, August 8th] International Anti-Aggression Movement President Cecil and representatives of the 450 million members sent a message to our country's branch on the second anniversary of the "July 7th Incident," expressing warm sympathy to the Chinese people, and presented an embroidered banner to Chiang Kai-shek in tribute.

### British Army Commander Goes to Peiping to Rescue Spear

### Japanese Military Entices Us to Negotiate Peace (Continued from July 6th)

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

The fourth page has no special titles, such as "Our Newspaper Special Feature" or "Communication," all are filthy words related to anti-resistance men, women, youth, and the film and theater industry. However, they never forgot politics. In terms of content, they often reveal sentences tempting China to abandon England, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and quickly cooperate with Japanese fascists. The reason is said to be: "Japan, a victorious country, has repeatedly proposed peace terms to China, a defeated country (?), but China did not appreciate them and rejected them all. Does it really want to perish?" (On another green paper leaflet, they hope that "the people" will petition the government to make peace with Japan soon, echoing this sentiment.

After all, ivory can't come out of a dog's mouth. The "Peace News" spread such rumors and still didn't fill a small newspaper's page, so it cut and pasted outdated movie advertisements from various theaters in Hong Kong. In order to conceal the source of the newspaper's haphazardness, it also blindly stated that the newspaper was published at No. 12, a certain road in Shanghai (there is no such road name in Shanghai). In fact, are all the people in our war zone such fools that they can be deceived by their doing secret things with lanterns?

### Generalissimo Chiang's Message to the Japanese People (3)

— Continued from yesterday's sixth edition

3.  Explaining the reasons why China's War of Resistance Will Certainly Be Victorious and National Reconstruction Will Certainly Succeed

What was said in the previous section is the reason why Japan's invasion is bound to fail, but this alone is not sufficient to clarify that China's War of Resistance will certainly be victorious and national reconstruction will certainly succeed, because if China itself also has elements of failure, the outcome is still unknowable. Therefore, I must further point out to the Japanese people why we can become stronger as we fight, and what exactly is our grasp of the certainty of victory in the War of Resistance and the certainty of success in national reconstruction. Of course, every defeat of the Japanese militarists has increased our strength, but China itself has other positive elements of success, namely, the Chinese nation already has a unified and firm belief—the Three Principles of the People. On this point, I would like to briefly explain. The biggest difficulty in modern China is its inability to unify itself, its inability to awaken, and its inability to solve its own problems. But now it is unified, awakened, and all problems have been solved ideologically, solved properly. This means that China has indeed been unified under the revolutionary principles of the Three Principles of the People, and this is our greatest guarantee for resisting and fighting to build the nation.

The True Meaning of the Three Principles of the People

——China's Founding Spirit——

I hope that you, the Japanese people, must recognize the Chinese revolution and recognize the meaning of the Three Principles of the People. If this point is not clear, you will never understand the answer to the problem. You probably also know that China's War of Resistance comes from the spiritual training of nationalism. This is correct, but the explanation is not sufficient. The determination of our national army and people to resist the war is certainly due to patriotism, but our patriotism is different from yours. We recognize that the Japanese people are very patriotic, but your loyalty cannot escape the confines of nationalism. When the country is weak, you only seek wealth and power. After it is strong, you only seek development. Therefore, from patriotism, it becomes aggression, leading to the Japan of today. Simply put, you love your own country but do not respect the patriotism of other nations, and even hate and envy the patriotism of others. You regard yourselves as superior and look down on neighboring people as inferior, filled with narrow, arrogant, and aggressive ideas, thus leading to these two years of brutal and inhumane war of aggression against China. China is different. What we believe in is the Principle of Nationalism of the Three Principles of the People. As explained earlier, our interpretation of nationalism is to strive for China's freedom and equality while respecting the freedom and equality of all nations. In other words, our thinking is thoroughly peaceful and not aggressive. This spirit of loving oneself and loving others is originally the basic characteristic of Chinese culture. However, since the Middle Ages, the evolution of politics has stagnated, resulting in this peaceful spirit showing the malady of being passive, scattered, and weak. In the late Qing Dynasty, foreign troubles were serious, and the country was on the verge of collapse. Our late Premier Sun Yat-sen loudly appealed to awaken compatriots to carry out revolution and build the nation. His thought inherited the orthodoxy of Chinese culture and integrated the essence of modern world doctrines, as well as the experience of revolutions in various countries. The result was the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, to understand nationalism, one must understand the entirety of the Three Principles of the People, because they are consistent and inseparable. Let me simply tell you that China is not the so-called nationalism in the ordinary sense, but nationalism. The difference is that although China is fighting for its own freedom and equality, it has absolutely no selfish or aggressive intentions. At the same time, it has a complete and systematic political and economic ideal and program. In the simplest terms, politics is based on "of the people, by the people, and for the people," and economics is based on equalizing land ownership, regulating capital, and developing the people's enjoyment of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The former is stipulated in the Principle of Democracy, and the latter is stipulated in the Principle of Livelihood. These programs all originate from the inherent ideas of Chinese culture and broadly adopt the advantages of modern Western thought, taking the best and discarding the worst, and forging them into one. Its purpose is to meet the current needs of the country and ensure the permanent happiness of the nation, and finally achieve the ideal of world harmony. Therefore, the internationalism of the Three Principles of the People is entirely peaceful and non-aggressive, and at the same time it is just and full of evolutionary potential. In short, the Three Principles of the People is a revolutionary doctrine.

The Situation Since 1928

——China is in a Leap Forward——

China is a new and rising country that believes in the Three Principles of the People and is on the road to construction. In modern China, the obstacles to revolution actually existed more within the country. Mr. Sun Yat-sen struggled his whole life to awaken his compatriots. After losing our great teacher, although our comrades continued to work hard, ideological obstacles within the country and the party still arose a lot. Some had wavering beliefs or actions inconsistent with their beliefs. Since 1928, due to the government being beset by internal troubles and foreign invasion, many political and economic measures that should have been taken were not implemented. Therefore, we reflect that we indeed have many shortcomings and insufficient efforts. However, what is gratifying is that the general public is making progress day by day. When the Japanese militarists launched a large-scale invasion two years ago, our entire country had already reached a consensus in believing in the Three Principles of the People and had a unanimous enthusiasm and understanding of supporting the revolution and building the nation. At that time, the spirit of sacrificing for the country had already been widely ignited, and we had an unwavering will that would not be eroded by time. Our War of Resistance began with this unified spirit and will.

The Ferocity of the Japanese Militarists

——Strengthening the Will to Resist——

Now it has been two years since the start of the War of Resistance. Although our sacrifices have been great, our progress has been even greater. The violent aggressors not only do everything they can to destroy and devastate on the front lines, but also carry out inhumane abuse and slaughter of our non-combatant men, women, old, and children in the occupied areas. At the same time, they bomb cities and towns and kill civilians in our front lines and rear areas, performing irrational and ferocious acts every day. However, there are still very large numbers of villages and fishing ports in the occupied areas that are strongholds for our patriotic people to conduct guerrilla warfare. Japan has no ability and not enough troops to eliminate them. However, wherever the Japanese troops pass through, the property of our compatriots is lost, families are destroyed, and many cities and villages are reduced to rubble. At this time, all sectors of the military and civilians cannot help but deeply realize that the fate of individuals and the nation is absolutely inseparable, and they have a deeper understanding of the ferocity of the Japanese militarists, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the greatness of the Three Principles of the People.

The Chinese People's View of the Japanese

——Both are Oppressed——

I can declare that all the soldiers and civilians throughout the country who are directly or indirectly loyal to the War of Resistance know why they are fighting and why they are dying. They all know that the sacrifice of all labor and life will definitely be necessary and have a reason and a price. What is the price? It is that the sacrifices of modern people can be exchanged for the freedom and happiness of all future generations, and this freedom and happiness is beneficial to all people in the world, including Japan. This means that the new China of the Three Principles of the People must be built firmly through bloodshed and sacrifice. Such a new China can become a great cornerstone for world peace and progress. At the same time, it can promote the renovation of Japan, so that Asia will not have a second tragedy. Our soldiers naturally hate the various atrocities committed by Japanese officers and soldiers in China, but what they hate is their behavior and their thoughts, and they do not hate their people, because the soldiers are all members of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people are deceived by the propaganda of the militarists, and by erroneous education, and forced orders, so the responsibility lies with the Japanese militarists and not with the Japanese soldiers. Moreover, we know that many Japanese soldiers are intellectuals and good people with professions, and some of them also oppose the policy of aggression, but are forced to enlist in the war. Therefore, although we are determined to annihilate the Japanese army in order to liberate ourselves from Japanese aggression, we have never hated the Japanese people or intended to retaliate. Last year, I revised the regulations on the treatment of prisoners of war, and the food, clothing, housing, and all other treatment for captured Japanese officers and soldiers are the same as those for our own officers and soldiers. Our entire army can sincerely abide by them, moving many prisoners to tears of gratitude. Especially, we do not take revenge... This is because our entire army consists of revolutionary soldiers who believe in the Three Principles of the People, because we not only have the firm determination to resist to the end, but also have a revolutionary belief that is farther and greater than the defense of the War of Resistance.

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Begin Next Week All British Public Opinion Warns Government Not to Harm Chinese War of Resistance Interests

[Chongqing Central News Agency, 8th] Tokyo Foreign News. Anglo-Japanese negotiations can be expected to begin next Tuesday. Representatives of the Japanese military authorities who came here from Tianjin are currently holding consultations with the Tokyo military authorities on various issues involving Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The situation is very busy. The two sides plan to discuss everything all day today, and representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military authorities are scheduled to discuss everything in detail tomorrow. Arida will report all the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations at the cabinet meeting next Tuesday morning, requesting the cabinet to express its support for the policy of handling the Tianjin Incident. The Minister of Foreign Affairs plans to draft the agenda of the meeting, and then invite British Ambassador Craigie to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs next Tuesday afternoon to determine the agenda of the meeting, it is said.

[Chongqing Central News Agency, 8th] London, 8th Special Dispatch. All newspapers here are paying close attention to the fact that Japan will send a large number of military experts to participate in the Tokyo negotiations. They all warn the government not to expand the scope of the negotiations. Especially on the Japanese request regarding the currency system in North China, no concessions should be made. "New Statesman" said that the British government is well aware that it cannot make concessions to the Japanese request, otherwise it will have a very bad impact on the United States. "News Chronicle" said that British Foreign Minister Halifax has made assurances to the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, explaining that the scope of Anglo-Japanese negotiations will not exceed the local Tianjin incident. Britain cannot allow the scope of negotiations to be expanded to involve the entire foreign policy issue, because China's legitimate war of resistance is not only important to Britain, but all those who have trade relations with China will benefit from it. Therefore, during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, the British representatives should insist that this issue should be handed over to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty for discussion and should not be raised during the Anglo-Japanese talks. "News Chronicle" said that Japan's attempt to invade China has been halted due to China's war of resistance. This is the best opportunity for Britain to provide financial assistance to China to achieve victory, because China's victory is a blessing for the civilized world. If the Tokyo meeting fails, Britain should step up its assistance to China in order to cope with the Japanese threat. This is Britain's only way out. Otherwise, Britain will have no choice but to surrender to Japan. The result of concessions will inevitably promote the division between Britain and the United States, and force the Chinese people to cooperate with Japan to oppose Britain.

### British and French Ambassadors to the Soviet Union Receive New Instructions The Soviet Union Advocates Sanctions Against Indirect Aggression Britain and France Still Hold a Half-Measures Policy

(Central News Agency, London, 8th) The British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union have received instructions from their governments. The two ambassadors are scheduled to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again today. The content of the new British and French instructions is unknown, but the press believes that it should include the following three items:

(1) The interests of Britain and France in the Netherlands,

(2) Advocate that the Soviet Union should form a military alliance with Poland and Turkey, (3) Explain the meaning of "indirect aggression,"

(Central News Agency, Paris, 6th) Regarding the issue of the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, concluding a mutual assistance agreement, after the Soviet government submitted a counter-proposal to Britain and France, the governments of Britain and France are trying their best to find new ways to satisfy the requirements put forward by the Soviet Union. They have considered several ways and handed them over to the ambassadors of the two countries to the Soviet Union to make a final 'effort' to conclude an agreement of a general nature. If this is not possible, Britain and France may conclude a smaller agreement with the Soviet Union, or issue a joint declaration.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] Foreign Minister Halifax received Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon to discuss the current talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. According to political figures, Foreign Minister Halifax once advised Maisky to come up with suggestions to be closer to the Soviet Union's position. The Soviet Union's reply was too broad, which made the progress of the negotiations inconvenient. However, Britain is still continuing its efforts to establish an agreement of a general nature. People in diplomatic circles said that Britain no longer requires the Soviet Union to guarantee Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, but insists that the Soviet Union should not interpret the meaning of aggression too broadly in the agreement. Regarding this level, the Soviet Union's intention is that disguised acts of aggression can achieve success by attacking explicitly, as can be proved by the past events of Czechoslovakia. Taking this as an example, the countries along the Baltic Sea may also suffer the same threat, and it is necessary to take precautions. Disguised aggression is more cruel than direct aggression and must be prevented.

### Britain and France Consider Air Force Cooperation

[Reuters, London, 7th] The British and French air forces are currently considering cooperation methods, and it is reported that the negotiations have made great progress. If the air force personnel of the two countries can practice long-distance flights, pass through new routes, and identify road signs, then there will be the greatest effect. This cooperation method will allow British aircraft to fly from Britain to southern and eastern France, so that the air force personnel of the two countries can obtain the closest cooperation.

The conference held a debate this afternoon, and representatives from various countries asked questions, and Xie answered them one by one. The representatives of various countries expressed their admiration for Confucianism and the spirit of China's war of resistance. Xie then proposed and passed a resolution, which stated that the eighth session of the World Conference on Religious Faith deeply regretted that mankind had returned to the Dark Ages and condemned violent doctrines, and advocated the development of human virtues.

The content of the statement can be divided into two parts, one part is for the people at home, and the other part is for the international community. The international part has a greater impact on Germany. The domestic part will explain the development of the European situation and deny Germany's claim that Britain's guarantee of Poland will lead to Poland's disintegration, and explain that before Britain provided guarantees to Poland, Germany had attempted to break Poland away from Britain.

### Queen of the Netherlands Plans to Form a National Defense Government

This is the first time that the Dutch royal family has taken such a step. Political circles believe that it shows that the Queen intends to form a national defense cabinet.

### Goods from Totalitarian Countries Should Be Differentiated British Members of Parliament Advocate

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] Several members of the House of Commons recently submitted a bill to the House of Commons, advocating that goods shipped from totalitarian countries to Britain should be distinguished from those of other countries. For example, goods from Germany, Italy, and Japan should be marked with the country's name, and goods from other countries may only use the words "Made in a Foreign Country," so as not to be mistaken.

It is reported that the Bulgarian Prime Minister's talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were mostly of an economic nature, but the issues of Dobruja and Macedonia were also discussed to a considerable extent. Bulgaria has not yet formally raised demands on such issues, so these issues are not considered urgent. The German side acknowledged its sympathy for Bulgaria's demands, but it does not appear that there will be a practical and concrete solution in the near future.

### Poland Announces Policy on Danzig

(Reuters, Warsaw, 8th) A Polish official spokesman announced today Poland's policy on Danzig as follows: 1. Danzig must be independent outside the German border; 2. Danzig's customs duties must be under Polish jurisdiction; 3. Poland's interests in Danzig must not be affected by any third country; 4. The people of Danzig must continue to absolutely enjoy all cultural rights.

### Insisting on Resistance is the Only Way to Survive A Speech by Committee Member Chen Jitang on the Anniversary of the July 7th Incident at Deming Middle School

Today is the anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, an unprecedented commemorative day for our country. Since the history of our country, the current War of Resistance is the most significant in terms of foreign wars, and the crisis of the nation is also the most urgent in terms of being invaded this time. If we understand the meaning of the War of Resistance and we understand the current danger, then we should know that there is absolutely no other way to survive except for thorough resistance. You read books, of course, you understand the situation of the country and the world, and you have read through the history of China and foreign countries, the current situation. Already shows us that not resisting is not enough to survive, and history tells us that not resisting is not enough to establish a country.

However, some people may still be concerned about their own strength, and therefore have various speculations about the future of the country. I think being rash is certainly not allowed, but abandoning oneself is no different from suicide. China's War of Resistance has been going on for two years without realizing it. This is not only something that people with wavering will could not have imagined, but also something that the Japanese did not expect. If the Japanese had known earlier that China could sustain the War of Resistance, they might not have dared to launch it lightly. Now, the consumption of Japanese manpower, material resources, and financial resources has long exceeded the budget. It is really a great danger for them to use such a large part of their strength in China. Therefore, the Japanese are now sighing that they want to stop but cannot. And we, with materials that are far inferior, have already resisted for two years. During these two years, although we have suffered a lot of worries and pains, there has been significant progress in military, political, and economic aspects. If we can resist for two years, we can resist for three years, four years, five years, and even many years. There is no doubt about this. Because our country's materials are not as good as others, we are particularly distressed, but the goal of victory will always be achieved. We must know that the power of the spirit is above the power of the material, and the material has a time of exhaustion. The spirit has no day of extinction. We should swell up the inherent spirit of "sacrificing oneself for righteousness" left over from thousands of years to fight for the final victory. The various difficulties at present will not only not discourage us, but also temper us and make us unswerving in our determination to resist. The ancients said, "A just army is strong, and a crooked army is old." We are the invaded, fighting for the survival of the nation and for the defense of the invaded all over the world. We are justified and righteous. We have no room for hesitation and hesitation. A dangerous war can be stopped if it can be stopped. I don't know that the initiative of this war is in Japan, not in us; for example, if thieves break into the house, the people in the same room can only rise up together to resist. If the thieves do not leave, the resistance will not stop; our country's war of resistance only seeks not to be invaded. If the Japanese clearly withdraw their troops and return our lost territory, so that we will not be harmed, then true peace can be obtained with a wave of the hand; otherwise, seeking peace is no different from begging for surrender. The right and wrong, advantages and disadvantages in this are very clear and cannot be ambiguous!

Based on the above, our only way is to resist resolutely. Since we understand the reason why we have to fight and have to fight to the end, we naturally have a strong will; since we know that the final victory must belong to our country, we naturally have a very solid self-confidence. When everyone has a strong will and sure self-confidence, they will be able to generate great power; China has the largest population, an extremely long history and culture, and a vast territory and products. This power can really be developed to the infinite.

China is not worried about not having power, but worried about not being able to concentrate its power: union is strong, division is weak. The principle is very simple; and the scattered power is easy to disappear invisibly, sometimes or unknowingly, used in the opposite direction, so as to offset each other. Therefore, first, we must contribute all of our strength to the country. We must know that the survival of the individual depends on the survival of the country. The people are born to seek the survival of the country, and they should also die to seek the survival of the country. If we understand this, the evil root of selfishness can be eradicated from this. I have always advocated that the revolution should start with the transformation of the mind. The lessons of these two years are enough to promote the transformation of our minds. In short, everyone has no selfishness, and then they can contribute their personal strength to the country, and then they can concentrate all the strength, and then they can use the entire national strength to fight for the final victory. Second, our strength should be used for the same purpose and the same steps, so there must be a consistent national policy and a unified leader. Generalissimo Chiang presides over the great plan of the War of Resistance with a selfless spirit. He is our only leader. Under the leadership of the leader, based on the established national policy, we work together with one heart and one mind, and we will eventually have a day when we see the blue sky through the clouds and fog.

You are promising young people. Young people are the vanguard of saving the country. Young people are the cornerstone of the country. If young people do not work hard, the front line of saving the country will collapse, and the foundation of the country will collapse. The lack of prosperity in our country is greatly related to the inability to popularize national education. Since you are the young people of China today, you must shoulder the responsibilities of the young people of China today. You must cultivate noble morals to take on the responsibility of saving the country. You must acquire high-level knowledge to take on the responsibility of saving the country. You must forge a strong physique to take on the responsibility of saving the country. Not only the individual, but also guide all the people, everyone should take on the responsibility of saving the country. The victory of the War of Resistance depends on us, not on others. Everyone is moving forward on the road to victory, and they will be able to achieve victory. Young people are the guide on the road to victory. Work hard, everyone!

### Nazi Activities in Scandinavia

— Long

Originally published in "Paris Evening News"

By C. Blanchard

The Nordic countries are in a neutral position geographically and politically. They are not considered dangerous areas of Europe. However, these peaceful nations now frequently hold military exercises to prepare for the advent of war. The last World War involved almost the entire European continent, but Sweden managed to remain neutral and did not participate. But will Sweden be able to avoid being drawn into war in the future?

People not familiar with the recent political situation in Sweden only remember Sweden's neutrality during the European war. They consider this a friendly act toward Germany and believe that Sweden still maintains a favorable impression of Germany. However, the fact is that the situation has changed greatly. Swedish public opinion has undergone a significant transformation, and the main figure driving this change is none other than the world-renowned Hitler. The Nazi regime threatens Sweden's freedom and progress, causing great shock among the Swedish people.

Not long ago, Hitler's generals delivered speeches in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, promoting Nazism and solemnly pointing out that Sweden is a sparsely populated country with ample land capable of accommodating millions more people. The true purpose of these speeches is not clear. Sweden already has various Nazi organizations, and the Swedish people have begun to resist Hitlerism's intrusion. Due to racial, educational, and cultural ties, Sweden has a natural affinity for Germany. Therefore, the Swedish people's aversion to Nazism does not necessarily equate to disliking Germany. However, with the passage of time, opposition to Nazism and anti-German sentiment are becoming increasingly indistinguishable.

Scandinavian cinema is quite developed. In many films, we can see symbols of anti-German sentiment in Northern Europe. However, this does not mean that Sweden will intentionally deviate from its neutral stance, although the risk of being drawn into a world war is extremely high. Moreover, northern Sweden possesses very rich iron ore deposits of excellent quality, which are particularly suitable for manufacturing war materials. If a world war breaks out, Germany will undoubtedly need Swedish iron ore to produce armaments, while Britain and France will surely try to prevent Sweden from sending it to Germany. Under these circumstances, whether Sweden can maintain its neutrality is a very serious question.

Control of the Kattegat Strait is extremely important, especially for the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has built a large naval base in Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean, but this is not intended to attack Norway or Sweden. Its real purpose is to control some natural ports on the west coast of Norway, so that it can prevent German submarine activities from disrupting maritime traffic in wartime. Therefore, countries preparing for war cannot ignore the importance of Scandinavia.

Northern Sweden has many "mountains" that are not only rich in minerals but also have excellent terrain. They are also indispensable sources of iron ore for military industry. Sweden exports several hundred thousand tons of iron ore annually, most of which goes to Germany. If Germany can control Sweden's iron ore resources, it would greatly benefit its expansionist ambitions.

Germany's current advantage in the Baltic Sea cannot be denied. Recently, and have agreed to establish defenses on the Åland Islands, and the Swedish fleet patrols the Baltic Sea. This is indeed a courageous act, but it is unlikely to be very effective. Geographically speaking, the fleet is extremely vulnerable to attack.

It is very possible that Germany will not only control Lithuania but also monopolize Denmark, so that Sweden's sea route for transporting iron ore to Germany will be like Germany's territorial waters, and it will also be easier to control the entrance to the Baltic Sea.

Clearly, we can see that the attempt to control Scandinavia is extremely important for Germany. Nazi Germany, under Hitler's rule, is more aware of these circumstances than anyone else. Perhaps changes will occur in Northern Europe in the near future. Who can predict?

### 100,000 Workers Strike at Work Projects Across America - Opposing Increased Hours and Reduced Wages - Construction of Houses and Roads Halts

[Reuters, New York, July 7] Approximately 100,000 workers employed by the Work Projects Administration across the United States have gone on strike, opposing the new federal economic bill for 1940, which stipulates extended working hours and, in some cases, reduced wages. It is estimated that the number of strikers in New York alone has reached 25,000. Construction of houses, roads, or other projects has been temporarily halted.

### American Isolationists Oppose Revising the Neutrality Act

[Reuters, Washington, July 7] Senator Johnson, representing San Francisco, announced today that 34 senators have jointly signed a declaration stating that they are determined to oppose any changes to the current Neutrality Act by all legitimate and legal means. The declaration stated: "We unanimously oppose the abolition or amendment of the current Neutrality Act to authorize any executive official to determine who is the aggressor in foreign wars. We also oppose it. We believe that our country must maintain true neutrality in any armed conflict." It is believed that this declaration is a threat to the prolonged debate on the government's Neutrality Act amendment. Some senators claimed that this official statement was an open threat to the prolonged debate of the legislative bill. However, government-aligned senators did not feel significantly disturbed by this action. They firmly believe that Johnson's influence is not as strong as it used to be and expressed deep confidence that President Roosevelt will succeed. However, they also acknowledged that a lengthy and intense debate is inevitable.

### U.S. President Regains Power to Devalue Currency, Increases Capital by $100 Million to Aid Export Trade

(Central News Agency, Washington, July 7) The compromise finance bill has been signed by President Roosevelt. The bill stipulates the extension of the application time of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and restores the President's power to devalue currency.

(Reuters, Washington, July 7) According to authoritative reports, the US government leaders have unanimously agreed to cancel the US$500 million prepared to lend to foreign countries within President Roosevelt's appropriation procedure, and allow the Export-Import Bank to increase its capital by $100 million to assist export trade, but it is not allowed to lend to foreign governments.

### McNutt Declares He Will Not Compete with Roosevelt in Election

[Reuters, Washington, July 7] High Commissioner of the Philippines, McNutt, declared today that if President Roosevelt is willing to run as the Democratic candidate in next year's presidential election, he will not compete with Roosevelt.

### Edison Promoted to US New Naval Chief

[Reuters, Washington, July 7] US Secretary of the Navy Swanson passed away today, and the vacancy was filled by Under Secretary of the Navy Edison. The US Senate, upon hearing the news of Swanson's death, immediately adjourned to mourn.

### Swanson's Brief Biography

(Central News Agency, New York, July 8) According to Washington sources, Secretary of the Navy Swanson passed away on July 7 at the age of 76. Swanson was a strong advocate for a tough US Navy policy, served as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for four years, and was elected as a Senator in 1910, serving until now. In 1932, he represented the United States at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. In 1933, he became Secretary of the Navy.

Brief Commentary

### "Permanent Stationing of Troops"!

Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma made a statement on the second anniversary of the "July 7th Incident," in which he mentioned Japan's future policy toward China, stating that the establishment of a so-called "new central government" is not far off. Once this "new government" is established, Japan and "Manchukuo" will formally recognize it. He also solemnly stated: "Japanese troops will remain stationed in Inner Mongolia, North China, and all areas that Japan considers threatened by the Communist Party. It is impossible for the Japanese troops to withdraw completely after the establishment of the new government. The Japanese troops' occupation of various places will be quasi-permanent."

All the traitors, whether openly "anti-communist" and "pro-peace," or secretly, may shout "Imperial Grace" and "Ten Thousand Blessings" for Hiranuma's statement! Because since the Japanese troops are stationing troops in China on a quasi-permanent basis, your lives and actions may be carefree! However, the entire Chinese nation and all the Chinese people must recognize that only by supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, supporting the central national policy, supporting unity and steadfastly resisting Japan can there be a way out! All the ugly content of "peace" and "anti-communism" cannot escape the eyes and ears of the Chinese people!

### Shanghai: A Paradise for White Russians

The Plight of Émigrés

In Shanghai, a long Avenue Edward VII, everyone knows is the most prosperous area of the French Concession, known as "Little Paris". But in reality, if you go and take a look, it's really not "Paris", but "St. Petersburg". On that street, French things are few and far between; but Russian things are available in abundance. Russian grocery stores, Russian jewelers, Russian pharmacies, Russian apartments, Russian restaurants, Russian bars, Russian theaters, Russian dance halls, Russian brothels... and Russian men, Russian women - naturally all White Russians, not Red Russians.

Excluding Harbin, Shanghai should be considered the second home of the White Russians. They envision the French Concession as their "St. Petersburg" - they absolutely refuse to acknowledge the existence of "Leningrad."

The number of White Russians in Shanghai is indeed quite large, and they continue to arrive in a steady stream. But their actual number cannot be known because they come and go without any registration. Who can count them? Among the émigrés, the White Russians are indeed considered the "elders"; their fate of being isolated and helpless is unmatched by others. Just like the Jews who have been expelled from various countries now, they still have the pity of the British and Americans, who are generously providing relief; but when the White Russians lost their Tsar, no one cared. They were met with closed doors wherever they went, so they flowed to this international city - Shanghai. In this free place, the Chinese cannot manage them, and foreigners are unwilling to manage them, so it has become a concentration camp for stateless émigrés, and the White Russians are the main members of this camp.

Among the White Russian community, there are also many talented people. Audley, in his "Shanghai - A Paradise for Adventurers", wrote about the people in a White Russian restaurant:

"...There are indeed many talented people - on any given evening, you only need to select a few, and you can reorganize the General Staff of the Russian Empire. There are plenty of dukes, princes, generals, and colonels here. Similarly, if you want to organize a Moscow song and dance troupe here, it is also a very easy thing. High-pitched singers, bass singers, string players, wind players, as long as you can name them, you will definitely find them here, and even if you select a group, there are still plenty of replacements!"

Indeed, this is not too much of an exaggeration, but unfortunately, fate has made them very unfortunate. Now they have no place to use their talents. Today in Shanghai, the general occupation of White Russians is to open a small shop, work as a clerk in a foreign firm. There are also some who have their own businesses, but they are very few. The most common and well-known occupations for men are as patrolmen in the French Concession police station, or as private security guards. Those who are lower down sell Siberian blankets, or friends who pull and wipe the oil stains from the clothes of others. Some even wander on the streets in front of hotels, speaking a few words of Shanghai Russian. The situation for women seems even more tragic. Maids, dancers, and prostitutes have become their exclusive business. People from Europe and the United States, whether diplomats or foreign soldiers, often fall at their feet, paying for their living expenses.

However, many White Russians, although poor, still seem to have a high sense of self-respect. They feel that the name "Russian" is a bit disgraceful. Therefore, although they speak a lot of broken Russian, they refuse to admit that they are Russian. Some say they are Romanian, some say they are Albanian, some say they are... anyway, a small country in a corner: they are definitely not Russian, they must insist on it.

Although the White Russians are in such a miserable situation, they can never forget the prosperous dream of twenty years ago. Although the hope of "restoring the country" has long been extinguished, they still yearn and dream that one day they will recreate the world and write another chapter in history.

In Shanghai, they have a so-called "People's Grievance Association", which is their organization. The greatest purpose of the association is another longing: "To fight back home". All actions are directed by Semenov, the White Russian leader in "Manchukuo", and Semenov's backstage is the Japanese Kwantung Army, which holds the banner of "anti-communism" in Tokyo.

Not long ago, this good show of "national restoration" slowly began to be staged. Under the leadership of Japan, Semenov wanted to become a "king" in Siberia, but he was awakened by the "Zhanggufeng" incident. Then, he came to Shanghai. Under the slogan of "anti-communism" in Tokyo, three or four hundred White Russians in Shanghai held a meeting at the Leeza Hotel in Hongkou one day last winter, also vowing to join the "anti-communism" and even pledge to be the pioneers of "anti-communism". Alas! This is truly the power of "silver bullets". Naturally, the Russian grandfathers, the generals, have a new industry to make money.

Recently, with the blockade of Tianjin, I heard that the White Russian gentlemen repeatedly want to enter the British Concession in groups to stroll around. It seems that the "way out" is becoming more and more available.

"Excuse me, would you mind making a phone call for me, please?"

### One Person Per Day

Vice Chairman Feng and his wife, Ms. Li Dequan, have a very close relationship. Between the boudoir, General Feng is even more obedient.

When the Northern Expeditionary Army set out and arrived in Zhengzhou, General Feng, due to his busy military affairs, did not care about his appearance. His beard had already grown thick and long. From the perspective of soldiers, this not only did not detract from his image, but added to his majesty. However, one day, he suddenly received a telegram that Madam Feng had already left Xi'an and was coming. This big beard, if seen by the madam, was guaranteed not to receive praise. Therefore, he cancelled most of his beard overnight, leaving only a small part on his lips, becoming a "Jintan-style". By the next morning, he felt that it was still inappropriate, so he modified the "Jintan-style" again, transforming it into a "Chaplin-style". When his wife arrived, they exchanged pleasantries. Accidentally, the conversation turned to the distinction between civilized and barbaric people.

"Barbarians are hairy all over, the more civilized, the less hair" Mrs. Feng said. That night, General Feng immediately overthrew "Chaplin" and swept his lips clean.

### Maritime Storm

— Written by Captain Laughton, translated by Yang Bi

Summary of Previous Excerpts

In the autumn of 1914, Jake, the radio operator of the Chuques Shipping Company, and Billy, the mechanic, took advantage of the German ship's trip to to tour , because Britain and Germany declared war, the British warship was coming to intercept the ship. The ship then fled madly. With great difficulty, they escaped the tiger's mouth and returned to New York. Chuques then asked them to take the "Saint Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to a man named Johnson to send a coded telegram. It turned out that was a German spy called Raviki. Suddenly, the ship mentioned a distress radio call…

"Any more news?" he asked Mullen.

Mullen shook his head, "No, just the first telegram."

Bill was standing in the doorway. At that moment, he suddenly shouted.

"Look, Jack, what's that over there?" he pointed to the horizon.

Looking in the direction he was pointing, a burst of red light surged in the sky in the night. When it rose, it seemed like a blazing iron-smelting furnace. All of a sudden, it fell down, leaving only vague, dim flashes of light. Jack couldn't decide for a long time what exactly it was.

"That's a ship on fire," he later recognized.

At almost the same time, the lookout at the bow of the ship shouted, and the people on the bridge also shouted loudly. They were all reporting that there was such a thing.

Although Jack and the others knew that seeing a ship on fire on the ocean was nothing special, looking at the firelight, rising and falling from time to time, they couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable.

"Well, this old fellow is speeding up," Bill noticed that the "Saint Mark" had changed direction and increased speed.

A crew member, Mr. Wood, led several sailors. They were busy untying a small boat, preparing to lower it into the water. In addition, there were three more small boats, ready to carry the rescued people.

As the "Saint Mark" sailed toward the large ship, the fire became more intense, but the distance was still too far to see clearly what kind of ship it was.

"I want to find a way to get on a small boat," Jack said to Bill, as they watched the people preparing to launch the boats into the water.

"Me too," Bill agreed. "Do you think there's a chance?"

"I don't know. However, on the day the ship sailed, I sent a telegram to Mr. Wood's sick mother for free. This might leave a good impression on him. Anyway, I'll go ask him."

Jack confidently went to find that stubborn fellow and talked for a long time. He returned to Bill's side, smiling.

"It's done," he said. "It was really not easy to get his consent. In the end, I still convinced him, we're going."

"That's great!" Bill cheered. "Now, we need an oilskin coat, this kind of weather, it's indispensable."

"I have one myself," Jack said, "I'll go get it, you borrow Mullen's."

"Thank you—look at that fire, it's like a blast furnace."

### Weather Station

Shanghai, Chinese Shanghai, newspapers are not allowed to write the words "July 7th", are not allowed to publish Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's announcements and speeches; what are your thoughts?

Shanghai, the police of the two special districts carried out a large-scale search, arresting more than 300 people – of course, they are Chinese. But no crime is specified, what are your thoughts?

On the occasion of "July 7th", people always feel a little uncomfortable, wanting to regret not having done something in the beginning; but they can't back down. So, the Naval Air Force to vent their anger – again and again, they went to bomb Chongqing. Bombs fell next to the British warship "White ", and in front of the US Ambassador's house. None hit. I don't know what the executioners are thinking.

Local singers, singing girls, "July 7th" charity performance, with good results. The singers raised 1,572 yuan, the singing girls raised 2,039 yuan. From this it seems that there are still many people in Hong Kong who love this tune.

### Firmly Believe in Our Inevitable Victory in the War of Resistance

Two newly married couples, who moved into their new home not long ago, suddenly received a letter one morning. When they opened it, in addition to two first-class theater tickets, there was no sender's name or return address. After the initial joy, they pondered all day: "Who on earth sent it?"

That night, they took the tickets and went to see the play. When they returned home after watching the play, they discovered that everything in the house had disappeared, except for a note left on the table, which read: "Now, you know, right!"

### Qilin Watermelon

The Spartans, valuing martial arts over literature, hated talking too much. Once, a small island in the Aegean Sea suffered a famine; they sent someone to Sparta for help. The representative arrived in Sparta and, applying civilized methods, tried hard to describe all kinds of tragic disasters, but the Spartans said: "We forgot what you said before, and what you said later had no head and no tail."

The representative returned empty-handed, the people on the island were desperately waiting for food. Helplessly, they sent another representative to ask for help a second time, instructing him to say as little as possible before leaving.

This representative arrived in Sparta and acted accordingly, without saying a word. He opened the empty flour bag, demonstrating with his hands, asking them to fill it up. As a result, guess what, he returned fully loaded.

### Public Baseball Game - South China Concedes a Point Out of Favor, Allowing China to Win - Side Witness Leonard, Burning with Jealousy, Raises Objections - Referee Leaves His Post Mid-Game After Orders Are Ignored - Today, Western Association vs. Hong Kong Association

In yesterday's public baseball league game, China played against South China. China's pillar player, Lin Ye, was absent due to circumstances, and the whole team's communication lost its center of gravity. Many supporters of China were worried about this.

South China, however, had a surprise soldier. Zheng Biao, who had been called for thousands of times but did not appear, surprisingly descended the mountain and made an appearance. Other strong players such as Cen Guanlan and Zheng Bin also followed the coach, making the military appearance grand. In the fierce battle, South China, relying on the power of its new army, performed strongly. Chinese hitters were controlled by their fielders at every turn, making scoring extremely difficult. In the third inning, China's Guodong, Bingnan, and Rongjun successively reached base, forming a good situation of bases loaded. Zheng Kangyong threw a wild pitch, and He Xiancheng was unable to catch it. Guodong then rushed back to home base, scoring one point. Enron, who got a free first base, again made it bases loaded. Bingnan was eager to rush back to home base, but He became quick-witted, throwing the ball to Zheng Biao, who successfully sealed it, resolving the Chinese "bases loaded" advantage. After a while, Hu Zhengqu struck out three times, dejectedly retreating. Although Cai got a free first base, Zhong Cansen's high fly ball was caught, and the whole inning ended. In this inning, China's momentum was exhausted, and South China managed to resolve the situation step by step, showing that South China's defense had made progress.

After six innings, South China still led China by six to four. At this point, South China deeply felt the undesirability of "burning beans to cook beans", and out of personal favor, conceded a point to China, giving them a chance to win. Therefore, in the last inning (seventh inning), when China attacked, the road to Sichuan did not seem difficult. Rongjun, Lunying, Er Zhengqu, and Bingfen hit as they pleased, scoring four points in a row, turning defeat into victory. Head referee Ho (Burmese third baseman), and first base side witness Leonard (Youbei team shortstop) could not stand it, burning with jealousy, and used the excuse that the two teams' competition was childish, ordering the cancellation of the game. Foreign spectators also left one after another, but the China and South teams denied that this was the case and insisted on finishing the game. The two witnesses, seeing that their orders were ineffective, abandoned their posts and left. The China and South teams then agreed to ask someone to temporarily serve as the referee to end the game, pending future resolution. As a result, China scored a total of six points in this inning, defeating South China by ten to six. The scores of both sides are recorded below.

China 2010106 10

South China 1220010 6

Today at 10:00 am, a public baseball league game will be held at Caroline Hill field, with only the Western Association playing against the Hong Kong Association. A fierce battle is expected between the two sides, but the Western Association, which is improving daily, may have the upper hand.

### 南遊日記

— Chen De

June 12th

After breakfast, we prepared for our departure to Singapore tomorrow. Today is the last day of our stay in Saigon. Having been preoccupied by the intense matches of the past few days, we are now free to take a stroll along the pier. Some of our teammates took the opportunity to purchase French products. Due to the strict tariff barriers of French Indochina, goods from other countries are very expensive, while French products are relatively cheap. So, if people buy something, they tend to choose French products because they are more affordable. After our outing, Mr. Liu, a leader of the Hui Zhou community, and Mr. Zhang Zhenfan, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, will host a banquet at the Chamber of Commerce at 7:30 PM this evening to bid farewell to the team. Fei Zaiqi is especially excited about this and keeps urging his teammates to "stay" for the banquet. Everyone who hears this bursts into laughter. Yingqi is truly innocent!

In the evening, we arrived on time. Both community leader Liu and chairman Zhang delivered speeches at the banquet, and team leader Mo also gave a speech to express his gratitude. We dispersed after 10 PM, having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

June 13th

At 9 AM this morning, our team boarded the French postal ship "Alimimis" to Singapore. Many members of the Saigon community came to the pier to see us off. At exactly 10 AM, the ship set sail southward. At lunchtime, team leader Mo requested and received permission from the captain to allow us to run on the deck every morning for practice. He also appointed team leader Bao as the temporary coach. Indeed, team leader Bao has rich experience and considerable talent, and he is well-deserved for the role.

June 14th

The sun rises over the sea, and the morning light fills the air. Secretary Zhou has repeatedly woken people up with good dreams, urging them to start practicing. We hurriedly get up and gather on the deck. At exactly 6 AM, Coach Bao gives us instructions one by one. We start with warm-up exercises, then jump rope and run laps for about an hour. By the end, we are all drenched in sweat. After showering, we have breakfast and then take a walk on the deck to aid digestion. The sea is as smooth as a mirror, and the weather is fine. Even Liang Rongzhao, who usually suffers from seasickness, is smiling and cheerful. Otherwise, he would have spent the whole day in bed, how could he appreciate the vastness of the ocean? At night, the bright moon illuminates the sea like a painting. This kind of scene saddens travelers. Many of my comrades quietly lean on the railing, unable to sleep, overwhelmed by their emotions.

### 浙茶管理方法（續馮各法）

Zhejiang Tea Management Methods (Continued from Previous Methods)

is difficult to achieve. This year's plan is to first determine the highest, lowest, and average prices for raw tea, and order merchants to purchase with cash. To prevent price suppression and monopoly, the Tea Department will establish raw tea purchasing offices in various tea-producing areas in conjunction with the Central Trade Commission, purchasing tea at the prescribed prices. If merchants are willing to offer higher prices to compete for purchases, they will be allowed to do so. In this way, the interests of farmers can be enhanced, and the problems that could not be solved with previous passive restrictions can be easily resolved.

(3) Regulating Tea Industry Finance - To enable farmers to improve their production and tea merchants to improve their manufacturing, it is necessary to ensure that they have sufficient funds and can use them freely. At this time of war, financial turnover is difficult, and it may be problematic for farmers and merchants to raise funds themselves. The Tea Department has specially borrowed tea loan funds from the Trade Commission and is lending them at low interest rates. This year's estimate is that it will be over three million. Regarding tea materials, to avoid difficulties and high costs for merchants in purchasing them, it is also planned to purchase them in bulk at the official exchange rate as in-kind loans.

(4) Improving Tea Merchant Equipment - To improve the organization of tea factories and eliminate speculation, a tea factory registration will be held before the tea season, specifying the necessary funds and equipment. After opening, factory managers will be assigned to be responsible for guidance to improve equipment and production, and to accept the opinions of the Trade Commission regarding the various types of tea that are popular in overseas markets, and submit them to various tea factories for reference and compliance, to achieve the goal of rational supply and demand and planned production.

(5) Adjusting Warehouse and Transportation Organization - Warehouse and transportation during wartime are major issues for the tea industry. On the active side, the goals are to speed up transportation, increase transportation volume, and ensure the safety of warehouses. On the passive side, the goals are to eliminate smuggling and tax evasion. Tea warehouse and transportation stations will be established in various important locations, and tea warehouse and transportation businesses will be registered for unified management.

(6) Developing Research and Training - There are many aspects of tea industry reform that need research. The Tea Department will proceed step by step to the best of its ability. However, the implementation of tea policy depends on talent. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the training and development of sound cadres and talents. These talents must not only have sufficient academic ability in tea production technology but also have a full understanding of the entire tea industry policy, and be able to forget self for the public good and struggle hard. In this way, the transformation of the Chinese tea industry will be promising.

### 「中國化」與文學

"Sinicization" and Literature

— Yu Hua

Due to the arduous struggle of the people throughout the country, the great national self-defense war has finally entered its second stage. The foundation of our resistance and nation-building is becoming more solid, and we have greater confidence in the future of victory. The revolutionary blood of the heroic soldiers is driving our ancient country toward a new and bright path.

With the drastic changes in living environment, our literary workers have also changed their mode of advancement, fighting the enemy on their own front lines, and more literary workers will emerge from the battlefield. These are not coincidences. They will even write out many effective ways to accomplish the difficult tasks of each stage; never frowning or sighing. They smile and wipe away the sweat that steams from their foreheads due to hard work.

Late at night, in the dim light of oil lamps, they strained their eyes. The brushes scratched across the wax paper, and they copied with such seriousness. Lice crawled out of the necks of their worn military uniforms, but they didn't mind. The wax paper was covered with neat, small characters, and they carefully inked and printed it page by page. What was printed was their portrait of the war, and they would shout so enthusiastically: "Comrades, we still need to strive for greater victories!" Some also wrote frankly: "In the next battle, I will definitely chop down more than three devils."

The printed papers were distributed to the companies, platoons, squads, and even the peasants' tobacco pouches. They believed that the printed papers were bullets, bullets that could end the lives of the enemy!

In the past: these phenomena had never existed. In the history of culture over thousands of years, this bright and brilliant chapter will be written. We can say that our generation is ending the old, and our generation is also creating the new. Therefore, the weight of responsibility will urge us to be more energetic and more diligent.

On the cultural front, our literary workers know the specific path to complete the historical mission. Our War of Resistance against Japan has moved from the first stage - preliminary, to the second stage - advanced; and our literature, like all developing movements, also has an inherent nature of developing towards a higher level. Moving from a higher stage of development to a higher level of practice becomes the highest purpose of literature in the War of Resistance.

We know that Chinese culture is a fertile land. In the process of evolution over thousands of years, it has also bloomed golden flowers. But when we wander on that vast cultural land, we will find that very few products truly belong to the masses and are preserved.

Especially those great struggles - such as the Taiping Rebellion, etc., the literature at that time, this kind of scene written with reactionary grammar distortions, represented the foolish ruling class fabricating all kinds of unreasonable stories. Why did the peasants at that time fight? Why did they rush out of their fields enduring hunger? These, the authors at that time finally wrote them as a kind of "ferocious" and "barbaric". In fact, the real "ferocious" and "barbaric" reality was deliberately ignored.

Today, the proposal of the sinicization of academics has opened up a wider avenue for our culture.

In recent hundreds of years, compared with international culture, the distance between Chinese culture is so terrible? This does not mean that Chinese culture has no characteristics and cannot rush straight up. The main characteristics are limited by the stage of social and economic development. Therefore, it is as weak and depressed as Chinese society. However, those characteristics still exist objectively.

Since the beginning of the Reform Movement in our country, to the Xinhai Revolution, to the May Fourth Movement, the two extremes in our country have become more and more acute. These two extremes are: on the one hand, trying to Europeanize as much as possible, and on the other hand, trying to protect the "national essence." The former believed that China's backwardness lies in not being the same as everything foreign. The latter scorned "foreign books," believing that only restoring the old can rejuvenate the country. Some people even called on young people to read the classics to save the country from its misfortune.

In fact, it is a fantasy to turn China into a country that is exactly the same as foreign countries. And it is fundamentally impossible to send a developing historical stage back to those previous historical stages.

Based on these situations, we admit that we do not have enough understanding of the excellent historical traditions of our own country. Young literary workers have neglected the literary treasures that our own country wants. - Precisely because we rarely think about those, we only care about taking things out of the bookshelves of foreign literature. Or we only care about punctuating a thread-bound book. We can say that we have not done as well as our stomach does with food in the work of extracting, digesting, and improving.

As written in the previous paragraph of this article, those passionate inner cries are certainly needed, but in fact, it is impossible for this kind of cry to always become a stagnant state. We will cultivate new emotions in people through rational understanding!

Therefore, we require that literary workers must learn theory, improve their cultural level (this does not conflict with "popularization"), and absorb new ideas from world culture. Following this requirement, we criticize past Chinese literature, study Chinese historical traditions, and extract those essences, which is necessary. Creating a sinicized new literature is not just that. We must also extract the essence of Chinese art to enrich ourselves - this extraction must be integrated with the essence of Chinese literature.

Rigid Europeanization is entirely due to not digesting it.

The sinicization of academics is to make academics suitable for the current needs of China, to make academics an organic part of China's entire culture, and to make Chinese academics an active part of world academics. Our literature, a part of academics, we should stand up and respond to this call - this is entirely an objective need.

In order to make literary works more popular and play a more active role among the masses, our literary workers must first be familiar with materialistic dialectics and use it to understand and criticize Chinese history and culture... At the same time, we must grasp reality. Targeting reality, we write out the works that people need and "promote" people. We know that these are all for the future - the literary land of the new China must be cultivated in our blood and sweat today.

I have seen our soldiers writing "Capture Turhara Alive" on their arms, and some have written words of determination to sacrifice on their hats. These phenomena fully indicate that we are fighting for the survival of our entire nation and the survival of all mankind in the world!

At this point, we need to further understand what is the highest purpose of literature in the War of Resistance.

### 撲向了祖國

Rushing to the Motherland

— Jin Yi

—Still a story of a girl—

After the planes that had created the poisonous evil had flown away, the young man climbed over and told them that the few freight train stations outside were their target, but they hadn't hit them."

The all-clear sounded, and they all got up. There were sounds of crying nearby, bodies lying silently, or flesh and blood flying everywhere, and the living cried sadly.

"Come on, we can go to the pool to wash our faces."

They listened to him, found a clear water's edge, squatted down, washed the blood and dirt off their faces, and then walked towards the platform.

Ambulances and fire trucks were rushing over, stretchers searching for the wounded, and a large bamboo basket to collect the scattered bones and flesh on the ground, a burst of bloody smell pouring into their nostrils.

"We can be considered as reborn!"

Half of the warehouse was destroyed, the fire was still burning, a large pit had sunk in the roadbed, and the rails had jumped several feet away, like two snakes with shiny leather patterns lying prone there.

"Look, that car over there is the one we took."

The young man pointed, the train had already fallen down, and only the bones were left in a few sections.

"Oh, my little suitcase is still on it!"

Jing suddenly cried out, Qing Zhi said lightly:

"What does that matter, look at those!"

The column of injured people on stretchers walked past the fire, blood dripping from the beds to the ground, and some were already unable to groan, almost like the dead. Under a small tree, they saw a person with two legs blown off. His face was as white as paper, and he was still turning his body; but the stretcher bearers looked at him and passed by, asking very calmly: "He will definitely die, no need to take him to the hospital."

Qing Zhi's heart gave a cold shudder, she thought what would happen if that person was her? She didn't know if that person still had a feeling of pain, or if he could still hear what others said?

Night fell, and she didn't feel hungry at all. After walking away from the station for a while, she seemed to still smell the smell of corpses. The young man kindly accompanied them, asking them where they were going. For a while, they couldn't say. The power went out, and the whole place was dark.

In the distance, suddenly the sound of singing came, gradually becoming louder, a piece of firelight turning from the street corner. At first glance, the light seemed a little unaccustomed to, and after a while, they saw that it was five or six people walking in a line holding torches, they were singing, shouting, the first to walk was a soldier on horseback, they seemed not to fear at all, and did not seem to have gone through a massacre, their steps were very firm, and the leaping flames illuminated two red faces, two pairs of dark eyes, shooting out piercing light. There were young men, and women, workers, and businessmen, and even old people with white beards were not absent. They opened their mouths and sang together; shouting, the whole city was trembling in their sound, the earth was shaking under their steps. (To be continued)

### 讀「陳二石頭」

Reading "Chen Ershitou"

— Han Bo

Literary Front No. 23 Serial

"...He sat next to Chen Ershitou. He looked at Chen Ershitou, but Chen Ershitou ignored him. He looked at Chen Ershitou again, but Chen Ershitou still ignored him. After a while, he looked at Chen Ershitou again, oh! Alas! What's so good about looking at it... After a while, he looked at Chen Ershitou again, this is strange..."

Four consecutive looks, it is really written vividly, if briefly replaced by a sentence "looked at him several times in a row," it would not be as good.

The author's success lies in the delicate and powerful description, and it can be told logically. It will not bore the audience and make them feel that this is:

"A lying swindler!"

But in terms of the ending, I think it is too scattered. Scattering is a common problem of storytelling, and there are not a few nonsense, but since it is called "literature," it is natural to return some literary appearance. At least it must abandon the bad elements in the old form before it can be considered "utilization". The author of Chen Ershitou focuses on the breadth of the "lecture" scope, and forgets this point, which is really regrettable. Especially in the sequel in the third issue of the Literary Front, a deserter officer "Wang Deming" is inserted hard, and one "pull" is more than 10,000 words of "melon", accounting for half of the full text. The author frequently uses these words to try to emboss this character:

"...Look at that look, it's scary enough, his eyes are straight, and his face is turning blue..."

"Outside there is shooting... Wang Deming hugged Chen Ershitou's waist with both hands, he was really drunk."

"Chen Ershitou looked at Wang Deming's pitiful look..."

In short, Wang Deming is described as a cowardly, pitiful and cunning and opportunistic inferior soldier, and the grasp of the dark side of this kind of person is very good, but in the end, I think, how will the author deal with him? Abandoned it? Or moved it? But I can't guess anything, the author finished Chen Ershitou to join the guerrillas, he was listed and then disappeared tracelessly, and even made me not understand the author's original intention of spending so much effort to write this character, if it is to strengthen Chen Ershitou's personality, then it may get the opposite effect. If this is writing the typical representative of the "refugee door", then why is there no follow-up? The most important thing in storytelling is "generation clearing", the so-called "if you want to know what will happen next, listen to the next breakdown" is, although lecture literature does not need any "said" "but said", but simple-minded people value the "cause and effect" the most, the story with a head and no tail is difficult to satisfy their causal view, as a result, Wang Deming will inevitably expand to a general bad phenomenon in the concept of the masses.

Chen Ershitou himself is still well written, vividly like a genuine farmer from Xuzhou Prefecture, and even the smallest lens is inserted very appropriately, but when he turns to become a guerrilla, the author uses the word "suddenly" to perfunctorily pass by; it is really too casual to use some "suddenly", except for these points, "Chen Ershitou" is still an excellent mass literature, a generally successful attempt - I am very happy to say that it has laid a new path for us to utilize the old form. (End)

### The Pain of Silence

— Li Liunian

Occasionally, when I am free, I seek out a friend for a chat. Because we are both young literature enthusiasts, our conversations invariably revolve around literature, followed by a round of reckless discussions about the bleak situation on this isolated island. After sitting for a while, I picked up Lu Yan's "Traveler's Heart" from his bookshelf and left. My motive for taking this book was simply because I am also a traveler. I wanted to see what a "traveler's" heart is like, and whether we share the same emotions that run through our hearts.

Back home, I flipped through "Traveler's Heart" and discovered my friend's reflections after reading it, in the form of an eight-line poem, expressing "the pain of silence":

A small circle is drawn on white paper,

Can you escape the longing for your homeland?

Oh, traveler's heart!

Falling into a small circle of pain,

Hoping for all comforts to come,

You bow your head and wait,

The bitter, blocked traveler's heart.

Only seeking to enlarge the light of life!

My friend's homesickness is unmistakably revealed in these eight lines.

But what about home?

Under the artillery fire, home—his and mine—apart from a ground resembling a pile of rubble, is nothing but the remnants of shattered tiles and bricks. Thinking of this, the symptoms of homesickness naturally become heavier. Sometimes, one cannot help but entrust some unspoken pain between the lines, to relieve one's feelings, but the deep sorrow remains.

In reality, he lacks a firm "belief." Otherwise, the pain of silence would not have grown in his heart and wounded him. If this continues to develop, he will sink into the most serious mental depression, never able to free himself. To put it bluntly, he is engaging in a slow suicide.

"Final victory belongs to us!" We must abandon this pain of silence, using it as silent hope and effort, to enlarge that circle of life; isn't that so? President Chiang Kai-shek tells us: "The life of an individual is limited, but the life of a nation is endless!" We must enlarge an even greater circle of light.

### Report of Foreigners Evacuating Fuzhou is Inaccurate. Hai Cheng Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday with Only a Few Foreigners. Wenzhou Blockaded by Communists. Ship Continues to Chongqing.

It is easy for the Communists to invade Fuzhou, threatening foreigners to leave in order to achieve a blockade. Investigations reveal that most foreign residents are not intimidated by the Communists and are determined not to leave. Last Tuesday, a few foreigners transferred to Fuzhou, escorted by British and American warships. The Hai Cheng, which was originally heading to Hong Kong, arrived yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. On this trip to Hong Kong, it carried a total of ten Chinese and Western passengers, along with some luggage, and no other cargo. According to the crew, warships stationed in the Fuzhou sea area have intensified the blockade along the Fuzhou coastline. Foreign vessels are not allowed to enter Fuzhou, and Communist armored speedboats frequently patrol the waters, seemingly to monitor the loading and unloading of cargo from foreign ships. As a result, the loading and unloading of cargo has become quite difficult. The Hai Cheng was also unable to dock in Fuzhou. The Chinese and Western passengers boarding from Fuzhou first boarded the Heroic Duchess and were transferred to the Hai Cheng by small boats. There are still several British and American warships stationed in the Fuzhou sea area to protect foreign residents. Reports that foreigners have evacuated Fuzhou and were transported to Hong Kong on this ship are not true. Only about a hundred foreigners who were forced to leave Fuzhou due to business relations in Shanghai were transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Shipping's Ji Nan a day earlier. Only a few foreigners took this ship back to Hong Kong. As for the situation in Fuzhou city, the ship could not enter the port and could not obtain any information, but the tense situation and heavily guarded state can be seen in general. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou yesterday, but according to a telegram received by the company, Wenzhou was blockaded by the Communists on the 5th, forcing the ship to cancel the trip. The resumption of the ship's route has not yet been confirmed.

### China Traveling Theatre Troupe to Perform "Wu Zetian" on the 13th at the Lee Theatre

Wu Zetian, the only empress in Chinese history, rebelled against male dominance and the patriarchal social system, giving a voice to women who had been oppressed for thousands of years. Although she lacked profound political ideas and failed to establish a solid foundation, her policies during her reign were not without considerations for the people's hardships, and she should not be labeled as merely "licentious" driven by worldly desires. The life and deeds of this remarkable woman have recently been adapted into plays and films. When the Mandarin film "Wu Zetian," starring Gu Lanjun, was shown in Hong Kong a month ago, it drew massive crowds, demonstrating the attention of all sectors of society. As for stage plays, Song Zhi's five-act drama is both ideologically correct and structurally tight. It analyzes "Wu Zetian's" hatred of men with great detail, portrays the suffering of oppressed women with depth, and provides a concise account and correct evaluation of Wu Zetian's policies during her autocratic rule. The China Traveling Theatre Troupe began rehearsing the play four months ago, starring Ye Dexi and Tang Huaiqiu, and it is scheduled to be performed at the Lee Theatre for three consecutive days starting on the 13th of this month. Other performances include "Tears of a Fallen Flower," starring Ms. Gan Cuige, and the Cantonese play "Five Rams City." Given the China Traveling Theatre Troupe's recent good work and performances, it should be just as good as amateur performances.

### Thugs Peddling "Special Refugee Certificates." Those Going to the Philippines for a Living Should Not Be Fooled.

[Our Newspaper Special Report] Since the Philippine government approved the special decree allowing Chinese compatriots to immigrate to the Philippines for a living, some unscrupulous individuals have taken the opportunity to swindle those going to the Philippines, and some have unknowingly fallen for their tactics. Our newspaper's correspondent at the Consulate General in Manila has sent a letter stating that some apprentices in Hong Kong are forging so-called "special refugee certificates" and peddling them to those seeking to make a living in the Philippines, so it is declared that those going to the Philippines should not be fooled. The letter is transcribed below:

To Whom It May Concern: It has recently been reported that some unscrupulous individuals in Hong Kong are forging so-called "special refugee certificates" and peddling them to those who wish to come to the Philippines for a living, each certificate priced at HK$100. Currently, three Cantonese compatriots have attempted to come to the Philippines with forged documents. They were discovered by the Philippine authorities and immediately apprehended. The certificates of temporary refuge in China issued by this consulate require the applicant to submit an application with a guarantor letter from their relatives or friends in the Philippines, guaranteeing their living expenses. After the application is reviewed and approved by the review committee jointly formed by the Chamber of Commerce of Manila, a letter is sent to the Immigration Bureau requesting approval before the certificate is issued. All certificates bear the official seal of this consulate and the consul's signature. Please publish this letter to prevent our compatriots from being deceived. Sincerely, Consulate General in Manila to the Hong Kong Shen Bao.

### Woman Instigates Thugs to Surround and Beat a Man. Lu Zhaoxiang Suffers Serious Abdominal Injuries Due to a Minor Dispute.

Lu Zhaozhen, aged about 32, who lives at No. 44 Yu'an Terrace, Shek Tong Tsui, was attacked by several men at the staircase of No. 25 Nam Li at around 10 AM yesterday morning. The men then fled. Lu suffered serious abdominal injuries on the spot. He tried to support himself by grabbing the handrail and climbed to the third floor of No. 25 to seek help from acquaintances. However, he collapsed due to his injuries. People in the building saw this and provided assistance, and he regained consciousness. He then hired a taxi to take him to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. According to the injured man's family, half an hour before the incident, Lu had a minor quarrel with a woman living in the same building at No. 44 Yu'an Terrace. The argument escalated. Immediately after the quarrel, several thugs went upstairs and looked for Lu to beat him. Lu avoided them and escaped through the back door. When Lu reached No. 25 Nam Li and arrived at the staircase, the thugs followed and intercepted him. The victim's family, unhappy with the thugs' violence, went to the police station to report the case. After receiving the report, police detectives were dispatched to investigate the scene at around 6 PM in the afternoon. They also took five men and women from No. 44 Yu'an Terrace to the station to inquire about the case. After taking their statements, they were released pending further investigation. The police are still searching for the thugs who committed the crime.

### Japanese Consulate Secretary Illegally Taking Photographs. Film Developed but Contents Not Yet Released. Police Still Conducting Strict Investigation.

Matsumoto, a secretary at the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong, took photographs with his sister on Davis Street from the opposite side of Hart Avenue in late July. The area is a restricted military zone. Police detectives noticed Matsumoto's actions and took him and the camera to the police station. After questioning, he was released, but the film was confiscated for development and investigation. It is now known that the film has been developed, but the police have not yet announced its contents. It is reported that the police are still conducting a strict investigation.

### Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to Elect New Chairman on the 15th. Li Xingqu Desired to Continue Leading New Directors. If Li Insists on Resigning, Guo Quan is Expected to Succeed Him.

The terms of office of the chairman, vice-chairman, treasurers, and directors of the previous session of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong have expired. In accordance with the articles of association, a new election will be held. One hundred new directors were elected on the 6th of this month. Li Xingqu received the most votes in this election. Based on past experience, Li is expected to be re-elected as chairman. However, before this election, Li had expressed his determination to retire and give way to someone more capable, and his intention was firm. Li has repeatedly stated that even if he is re-elected as chairman, he will not accept the position. Therefore, the issue of the new chairman has received much attention from the public. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce is not only the general organization of all Chinese merchants in Hong Kong but also the general organization leading all Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong. Especially during this extraordinary period, the responsibility of its leader is extremely important, so there is great concern for the selection of a new chairman. It has been learned that after the election of one hundred new directors, Chairman Li Xingqu instructed Secretary Cao Xueyu to issue a circular convening a meeting, inviting all newly elected directors to attend the meeting at 2 PM on the 15th of this month (next Saturday) to elect the new chairman, vice-chairman, treasurers, and directors, so that the handover can be held as soon as possible. Secretary Cao Xunyu has scheduled to issue the circular today and tomorrow. At the same time, he will also send letters to the members of various industries, asking them to report the list of representatives and directors so that they can be invited to the meeting.

The mystery of the new chairman will be revealed on the 15th of this month. Currently, the candidates with the highest calls for succession are Guo Quan, Ye Lanquan, Yan Chengkun, Lei Yinsun, Feng Xiangquan, and others. However, many of the newly elected directors still hope that Li will continue to assume the leadership responsibility. It is expected that in the election results, Li may be elected as the chairman. If Li insists on resigning, then Guo Quan is most likely to succeed him.

### Financial Secretary Announces that Hong Kong's Exchange Fund is Abundant. The Amount of Hong Kong Dollars in Circulation Last Month Was More Than 23 Million.

Financial Secretary Gimson announced in the Gazette yesterday that the Hong Kong Exchange Fund purchased a small amount of silver coins between June 30, 1938, and the following six months for minting and distribution. During this six-month period, the Exchange Fund did not need to be used in the Hong Kong foreign exchange market. As of December 31, 1938, the total amount of liabilities was $19,113,487. At the noon exchange rate of one shilling and three pence on that day, this translates to £11,945,930. The total assets of the fund were £13,035,370, of which 73.06% were in secure gold pound bonds, 26.85% were in short-term or demand deposits in London, and 0.09% was in silver. In June, the total amount of banknotes in circulation in Hong Kong was $23,858,923, including $21,134,228 issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, $2,306,472 issued by the Chartered Bank, and $4,118,223 issued by the Mercantile Bank.

### Flower Sale Charity Funds Collected Yesterday. Please Submit Flower Funds to the Finance Group.

The Hong Kong Joint Committee for Relief of South China Refugees is commemorating the second anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War and National Reconstruction this year by holding a flower sale campaign. The committee has issued commemorative flowers, distributed to various community groups and schools for sale, and stipulated that the proceeds from the flower sales should be returned to the committee for the purpose of managing relief work for wounded soldiers and refugees. The distribution of flowers began on June 29th and ended on the "July 7th" anniversary. More than 20,000 flowers were issued, an increase of nearly 10,000 compared to last year. It is expected that the flower sale results this year will be higher than last year. The Flower Sale Preparatory Committee under the General Assembly has completed its task and ended on the "July 7th" anniversary. The General Assembly began collecting the proceeds from the flower sales yesterday. A person in charge of the General Assembly issued a statement yesterday, requesting that community groups that received "July 7th" commemorative flowers submit the proceeds from the flower sales to the General Assembly's finance department (accountant Zhu Shengyu of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce) as soon as possible so that the results can be compiled and announced. Many community groups went to the meeting to submit flower sale donations yesterday morning. The finance group received approximately $700 in donations on the first day. Today is Sunday, and the finance group at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce is closed for one day. Please submit flower funds to the meeting tomorrow.

### Residents Disregard Civil Defense Training. Civil Defense Authorities Strive to Persuade.

The Hong Kong Civil Defense Authority has established civil defense training classes in various districts. Twenty-two districts have been established in Hong Kong and Kowloon. However, among the students in the twenty-two districts, the number of those who passed the exams and graduated as civil defense instructors and rescuers is less than seven-tenths of the original budget, which is due to residents' neglect of civil defense training. The Civil Defense Authority attaches great importance to this and intends to persuade merchants and residents to actively participate in training in various districts as soon as possible, to avoid being at a loss in the event of an emergency. Yesterday, Liu Jing, chairman of District A, stated that since the district obtained additional construction land from the Civil Defense Authority, it has been urging merchants in the district to send personnel to participate in training. However, the number of people who come to receive training is still very small, and the Civil Defense Authority is particularly concerned about this district, and the number of trainees who have passed the exam is few, the Civil Defense authority made inquiries. It is expected that many merchants will attend this special training program, but something unexpected happened. This is very distressing. I am currently posting a leaflet and today, brother [Liu Jing] and other committee members will personally go to each household in the district to encourage residents to participate and explain the importance of learning civil defense.

### Education Department to Eliminate Veranda Classrooms to Ensure Student Safety

The number of primary and secondary schools that have moved from Guangzhou to Hong Kong is rapidly increasing. However, due to the small area and dense population of Hong Kong, and in light of the serious concerns about building safety, many schools have simplified their facilities. Some schools have even used verandas and open spaces as classrooms. This situation has been found in many places. The Hong Kong Education Department believes that using verandas as classrooms affects traffic flow in the building and raises safety concerns for students in the event of an accident. Therefore, it has ordered schools in all districts to immediately eliminate such facilities and has instructed inspectors to visit schools weekly to ensure student safety.

(Special Report) Air Force soldiers Huang Changlin, Xu Hanling, and Wei Yitang, who are receiving medical treatment in Hong Kong, accepted a consolation gift of HK$3.00 from nine-year-old Li Baoqiong of the Kowloon Soong Tong School. Details are difficult to record in this newspaper. The three of them were deeply moved by the child’s compassion and dare not accept the money.

### Record of the Grand Gathering of the School of Journalism: Commemorating the Establishment of the Student Association on the Seventh of July Incident

"Two years of national crisis!" This profound memory floats in everyone's mind!

The staff and students of the China School of Journalism, organized by the Young Journalists Association, also had this memory stir up waves in their hearts. Facing the difficulties, our Polish friends want to make a solemn statement today. Moreover, they want to engrave a commemorative mark of inheriting arduous work today -- the establishment of the Student Association, specifically held at this moment.

As the evening sea breeze swayed up the mountain, students with vehicle-wheel badges hanging in haste on Kennedy Road, two, three, were streaming towards the School of Journalism.

At 7:13 PM, the singing and fragmented conversations subsided. The students surrounded the President, the Dean of Studies, and the guests as they strode into a brightly lit hall, each taking a seat in a semi-circular, elegant arrangement. This commemorative meeting with profound meaning began.

Initially, an "interlude" was performed: a donation for the Seventh of July Festival was held at this time. A colleague of elegant demeanor held a small box and walked to each person. Thus, gongs, silver coins, copper coins, 30 cents, 50 cents, Hong Kong paper money, and even Guangdong cents, were thrown into the box one after another. This was like soldiers firing bullets at the invaders in unison.

Following that, the chairman struck a solemn tone. "Tonight, we are holding two meetings simultaneously. One is the Seventh of July Commemorative Meeting, and the other is the Inaugural Meeting of the China School of Journalism Student Association. The meaning is: in the growth of the War of Resistance, we must take a fighting posture and greet new work on the journalistic front..."

The emcee, following the chairman's lead, shouted in a short voice, "Instructions!" Then immediately took over the chairman's duties to invite Mr. Huang Zufen to the stage to speak.

Mr. Huang presented valuable work experience as a gift to the students present. Finally, he specifically emphasized, "...In the Student Association, work should be the priority!"

Following that, the chairman walked to the front of the kind old man (the President of the school, Mr. Guo Butao) and respectfully invited him to the stage to give instructions. At this time, all eyes turned to that side, and applause resounded.

The old man, wearing a light silk gown, left his seat, and the whole audience was once again in solemnity. Many people hoped to hear words, which were finally broadcast from his mouth: (1) The work of the Student Association should eliminate the bad concept of "factionalism"; (2) Select new goals on the journalistic front; (3) News practitioners in the War of Resistance should complete their work in suffering; (4) He hopes that everyone can do it, (hands, brain, eyes,) all used together.

From a soaking-wet corner, Mr. Luo Yinpu was invited to the stage. He gave the students a bright warning in a relaxed tone: "The influence of news reporters is very large... Although he can sell his spirit and time, he cannot sell the correct views... If news practitioners do not find ways to acquire knowledge from all aspects and educate themselves, then 'degeneration' is his only future."

The listeners seemed to be eating a rare seafood, their mouths filled with sweetness, but the slight spiciness also stimulated their taste buds. The evening breeze blew in from outside the window, and the air in the hall immediately felt fresher.

The Dean of Studies, Mr. Tan Siwen -- the "nanny" who sees the students every day at the School of Journalism -- cut straight to the chase and spoke frankly, like a cup of sugar water that aids digestion. After the meal, drinking it can relieve phlegm and reduce gas.

Everyone's emotions and excitement converged, and everyone forgot that the time had approached late at night.

The students, very innocent, one after another, with light and agile steps, went to the podium to express their feelings. From their simple and solid words, it was known that they had developed the idea of ​​starting new work on the journalistic front--

At the meeting, after listening to the sincere teachers and students' words, and seeing the joyful and colorful situation, you will always be convinced that this new army that has not yet been forged will present a new posture on the journalistic front in the future.

The school currently has library facilities with approximately 1,000 types of books, and approximately 4,000 types of physics, chemistry, and biology teaching equipment and specimens.

### The Total Mobilization of Drama Workers Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction

— Bai Chan

China Salvation, China Art, and various youth drama groups are staging performances one after another

Drama workers are always on the front lines of the cultural position: in this great coming of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction, they are welcoming this sacred festival with the most enthusiastic continuation and the fighting experience!

Recently, the drama movement in Hong Kong has been developing vigorously in a white-hot situation. "China Salvation," "Chongzu," and "China Art," several major drama groups, are constantly performing, and small drama groups are also working undercover. In fact, the popular mass drama movement has its self-growth and development, widely and deeply loved and needed by the mass groups. In the midst of the "July 7th" second anniversary, it has undoubtedly become an important work topic for them. Originally, the "Hong Kong Youth Festival Drama Association" should have been in unified order, but due to the recent changes in objective rules and the limitations of material conditions, this relatively large-scale work was restricted. Therefore, each community has to use the method of scattered lines of combat to individually strive for more favorable work opportunities.

In the past few days, no matter in which corner or occasion, there have been enthusiastic, excited, and determined lines of work by our young drama partners, each contributing the greatest enthusiasm and spirit to commemorate this great day.

According to our ability to know, the following performances are available:

"China Salvation" performed the heroic and magnificent historical drama of the War of Resistance "The Light of Southern Shandong" in Chongqing from the 6th as a farewell performance after the forging, to commemorate the great festival of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction, and held two performances on the day and night of "July 7th" with the play "Beside the Wuding River", which is a re-enactment of the history of the Lugou Bridge, and used all the income as a charity performance for the donation movement. On the 8th, "The Light of Southern Shandong" was still performed. For three consecutive days, students and the general public in Hong Kong were entertained with the lowest ticket prices as a farewell memorial. The exquisite and magnificent performance, the enthusiastic and tense emotions of the audience, and the last few performances have received extremely satisfactory harvests.

China Art performed "Dawn" at the Central Theatre at 9:30 am on "July 7th". This was performed by the Hong Kong Branch of the Young Journalists Association, the Chinese Literary Association, and the joint China Art to commemorate the second anniversary of "July 7th".

The Drama Group of the South China Athletic Association performed "March of the Motherland" at the Confucius Hall, which included three related one-act plays directed by Deng Zhongxiu.

The Youth Amusement Club is a reputable youth salvation organization in Kowloon. From July 5th to 7th, every night, women and children were divided into three groups to hold a July 7th memorial, performing one-act plays such as "Women Under the Iron Heel," "Bangzi Opera," and "Submissive People."

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Education Service Group is organized by progressive knowledgeable women and female workers from various factories in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon. On the nights of the 6th and 7th, they jointly held an enlarged July 7th memorial with Qiaoguang Society and Xué Dé Lizhì Society, performing plays such as "Women Under the Iron Heel," "Other Bitter Women," and "Honor Brigade."

The Ziqiang Sports Association, a hardworking community in the Hung Hom district, was invited by all walks of life in Hung Hom to the July 7th Second Anniversary Memorial on the 7th to perform "Blood-Soaked Lugou Bridge" and "The Last Resort."

The New Star Society, an organization of factory workers in Kowloon, has been extremely diligent in the drama movement. The July 7th memorial was also held last night, performing "The Last Resort" and "Zhangjiadian," directed by Ling Si and Hu Ruihua.

The Red Red Singing Team is a new organization of students from the High School Affiliated to Guangzhou University, and a drama team has been established at the same time. Starting from the 7th, they will go to Tsuen Wan and the creation of rural propaganda for four consecutive days. In addition to singing and speeches, they will also perform "Three Rivers Good" and "After the Fall."

The Whirlwind Drama Club is an amateur drama group of workers in Sham Shui Po. On the morning of the 7th, at the invitation of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Refugee Free School, it performed "Can't Return Home" at the North River Theatre, and the "Save a Bullet" by the Alumni Association of Zhiyong Primary School and the "Study to Save the Country" by Huanan School were also performed.

The Huiyang Youth Association held a moonlit gathering at the swimming pool in a corner of their own site in Lizhi on the evening of the 5th, attended by more than 400 members and friends, with extremely enthusiastic emotions. A July 7th memorial was held on the evening of the 7th, performing plays such as "Zhangjiadian," and there were singing and speeches.

In addition to the above-mentioned information that is known to the ability of seven, there are naturally more partners who are working in a tense and enthusiastic manner without being noticed. I believe that this general report has made people quite surprised. I never thought that young drama workers are so calm and hardworking to commemorate this great day, ah.

Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, drama workers have stood on the cultural position with an attitude full of movement and combativeness, and have been the most outstanding combatants. In the midst of this second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction, people feel that their power is vast and immortal.

May our drama work meet the beginning of the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction with stronger and more tenacious struggles!

### A Glorious Page of Enlightenment!

— Zhu Baishui

The old hatred is now to be repaid!

It was late at night when I returned home from Hong Kong. The banana trees planted by my father were growing vigorously, swaying in the moonlight. Weary and with thoughts surging, I strolled in the courtyard, and the night wind blew my messy hair.

I felt infinite emotion, and also infinite excitement. The beginning of the great national self-defense war, the re-enactment of history, the historical drama "Beside the Wuding River" composed of sad and angry emotions, this historical drama, like the afterglow after a knot was untied, gave me an unforgettable performance by "China Salvation"! "Beside the Wuding River" (Protecting Lugou Bridge), this three-act collectively created historical drama, was actually able to be performed happily and completely in this place on the evening of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. Although this performance has already been ××××××××× but the more it feels like a hard-won and unyielding struggle ××××××, the more it makes people feel infinitely emotional, and also infinitely excited!

The performance of the play is certainly worthy of our great admiration, for fighting for a national independence. The inherent freedom of the unyielding action, the spirit of not shrinking. "China Salvation" has given millions of Hong Kong overseas Chinese children a noble national character!

We who work in the drama position often encounter countless unfortunate and unexpected experiences. At that time, how frustrated we were. How to borrow with pain, more remotely think of the great difficulties suffered by the partners fighting in the dark "isolated island", sometimes I can't help but shed tears for the freedom of our nation! But I know that in order to fight for the emancipation of the people, eternal freedom, and the rebirth of the future motherland, we have endured everything, we work with concentration!

Therefore, "China Salvation" can be unyielding and unyielding in several difficulties, and not grow or shrink to fight for the freedom of ××××××××× is unforgettable!

It also deeply leads me to a profound idea: making me more firmly believe that the national self-defense struggle of the motherland is a river of storms and waves, but as long as we use greater patience and greater struggle, we will cross to the shore of victory?

"China Salvation" wrote a page with a glorious enlightenment for our drama movement on the evening of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction!

Two years ago, the joyful cannons of the great battle were remotely transmitted from the Lugou Bridge to the ancient revolutionary region in the south, shaking the entire ancient city with excitement, grief, and fierce emotions.

In mid-August, we finished reading a book with crazy enthusiasm that will forever leave a groundbreaking record in the Chinese drama world, "Protecting Lugou Bridge" {Immediately, all the drama workers in Guangzhou, including the old and young partners, started rehearsing under the call of the "Guangdong Drama Association."

Unforgettable, in the Girls' Christian Association with trees and ground grass, we started our first opportunity, hundreds of young men and women happily assigned roles in that small auditorium, starting the division of groups to confront words, after that, everyone was divided into groups and rehearsed in different places, each partner was working with such enthusiasm and excitement, everyone was hoping for a great performance ah!

On August 23rd, the iron turtle with the sign of the sun began to start in the ruins of the ancient city in the south. Our anti-aircraft gunners also began their first reform and heroic shooting! The iron war was known to be cruel and merciless, and it fell pitifully on our land. However, from that morning, this ancient city has been endlessly subjected to ××××××××× people were completely trapped in a restless day of panic and running. It is pitiful that life is all about cherishing life and running away everywhere. We are young people, we are the active heart of this city, we are not afraid, we are not afraid, we laugh and jump in the air raids, and each group of plays is still rehearsing.

At that time, the lights had already started to be controlled, and we took the tired and excited mood from the theatre, stepping on the road without street lights, talking and laughing loudly, sometimes when we saw ignorant citizens opening a little sea fire light from the door, we used the old voice to pretend to be the police and shouted loudly, sometimes we even bumped the worn wooden door heavily with our leather boots, and the light inside quietly went out.

In this way, we had a proud, indulgent, and full of cheerful laughter.

However, the ancient city gradually became empty, and people dispersed to their hometowns. We who stayed in the city began to feel that work had no home, and it was indeed impossible to continue our work. This frequent alarm made people sigh in vain.

After more than twenty days of exciting work, we were forced to stop, we sighed, but more resentment, this battle had no way to perform in this city, but this city was trampled under the hooves of the barbarians!

Now, it's been two years, and the memories are rekindled in my heart, deeply feeling infinite Zhang Chou and infinite sadness; but the performance of China Salvation gives me a great excitement and joy, and completely washes away all my cowardly emotions - I believe it will also wash away the same emotions of many people.

I remember that at that time, I had agreed to an article, "Remember angrily, who made us lose the freedom to perform?..."

But, now, we are using a new struggle to repay our old hatred!

Late night of the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident

### Cantonese Performance of "Tears Sprinkled on Flowers"

— Wang Gong

—A new, satisfying and successful attempt—

With my stubborn nature as an outsider, since I fled to Hong Kong a year ago, I have never had much affection for Cantonese-performed dramas. Of course, half of the reason is because I can't understand the language, and also because I have never found any dramas performed in the local dialect in other places, so I feel even more unpleasant to hear.

In fact, because of the particularity of the language in Guangdong, there has been Cantonese drama for a long time, which is an inevitable trend, because the greatest requirement of drama is actually to win a large number of audiences. What should be noted is not to cater to the audience and accommodate the audience's low tastes, but to slowly try to improve their interest and lead them to a high level of appreciation. Drama itself is definitely not just entertainment, but contains profound educational significance.

So the problem now is no longer the problem of the dialect of the performance, but is completely rooted in a kind of consciousness, attitude, and the form of the performance. If it distorts the current reality and avoids the trend of the times, even if it has a high degree of mature skill, it will inevitably tend to decline and annihilation.

When "China Art" established a Cantonese group, I was really worried at the time; perhaps it was because most of the Cantonese films gave people a deep aversion, and at that time, I only vaguely knew that the members of the Cantonese group were all engaged in film and television. But then I slowly changed my views and understood that the comrades of the "Cantonese Group" also deeply hated "folk tales" and "wooden fish books", and several artists who had a long history in the film industry before were unwilling to mix in the unconscious environment and resolutely withdrew from the film industry; this time, for the love of drama, and in the hope of obtaining accurate artistic cultivation, they gathered under the banner of "China Art", working hard and painstakingly.

In fact, we cannot erase the current efforts and corrections because of past mistakes. If we can use the actual working spirit and the effect of the performance to give those "artists" who are indulging in the muddy waters a serious stimulus and blow, and shake their turbid concepts, then I think such work, although difficult, has a rather significant meaning: what we are aiming at now is the facts, not the mission of clarifying the workers that can be accomplished by empty shouts, is a practical problem, and after China Art formed a Cantonese group with Peng Ren as the unit, it is even more worthy of serious discussion;

However, Mr. Hu Chunbing's opinion is also worth remembering deeply regarding the problem of Peng Ren's interpretation of historical drama. He provided many valuable opinions that I shared, the main ones being the danger of vulgarization and the bad habits of the star system. Regarding these two problems, they are very likely to occur in commercial society, or even unconsciously go on this dangerous road. I remember that in Shanghai after "August 13th", there was once an organization called "Film Actors' Troupe", which set off to the cities in the rear. This was also a professional drama troupe organization. Although I don't quite understand the details, there is no doubt that they fell into the above crisis, and finally unfortunately disintegrated. This is a lesson for every drama worker, to understand that business is only temporary, and the spirit of art is eternal.

On the night of the "Tears Sprinkled on Flowers" drama performance, I can be said to be the most excited and concerned audience, because I watched it slowly grow under the joint work of dreamers. I felt an unspeakable intimacy, and during the performance, although I could only understand most of the words, each actor attracted the audience with considerable and skilled acting skills, all the way to the satisfactory closing. This was a new and pioneering attempt. But I am glad that they have begun to rush towards the road to success.

Many people must have felt this was an unexpected harvest, a group of film actors were able to have such a considerable success in the attempt, and this performance has even greater significance. Because this is the medium of South China drama and film. The performance of "Tears Sprinkled" is not only a good harvest in the performance, but it has also further done a practical cleaning work, reminding the demise of those scoundrels who eat film and drama meals; this is a very good new force! If this force can be rigorously promoted, it will contain a new influence on the film and drama circles in South China?

### The Radiance of a New Beginning! The South China Film Industry Swearing-in Ceremony: "July 7th" Marked by Outrageous Acts Amidst Solemn Tension

The most important point was: the × people in Eastern China, North China, and Shanghai are actively promoting their so-called "national policy films," attempting to bewitch our ignorant compatriots with this toxic movement. There is also the possibility of it spreading to South China. Our film industry should, under the banner of the War of Resistance and National Construction, exert the great power of film to give the aggressors a stern response.

After Xu Shiying, the acting chairman of the Central Relief Committee, delivered a speech on behalf of Lin Boqu, Cai Chusheng solemnly and earnestly said: The relationship between spiritual mobilization and film workers is very close. Overcoming the life of revelry and complacency, and seeking only temporary comfort, as outlined in the spiritual mobilization program, is tantamount to a life-saving drama for the film industry. From now on, film workers must use the spirit of perseverance to overcome material difficulties, so that the essence of their works is not only entertainment, but also spiritual food, not spiritual poison.

Following this, the leaders and giants of the South China film industry delivered speeches, successively revealing the truth and deeply moving audiences with their warnings. This can be said to be an unprecedented awakening of the South China film industry, and the radiance of a new beginning for the South China film industry.

### The Radiance of Victory

— Wang Ying

My three-month stay in Hong Kong has passed quickly.

When we first raised funds for the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Association and held a welcoming performance, the enthusiasm of the compatriots in Hong Kong was something we will never forget. This inspiration was no different from what we felt on the battlefield. We will take their ardent expectations as encouragement and impetus in our future work.

We deeply understand that the enthusiasm and love of audiences everywhere for us stems from our shared goals. Our work is the work that hundreds of thousands of audience members need.

In the blink of an eye, two years have passed. In our country, during these two years, countless compatriots have suffered unprecedented pain in history, while countless outstanding sons and daughters of China have built a Great Wall of steel on our land with their blood and flesh, with the greatest sacrifice and selfless spirit. Two years ago, on "July 7th," the water of the Yongding River was reddened. However, the entire Chinese nation used this as an opportunity to straighten its back, stand up, and settle scores with the × people who have been bullying us for many years. This debt will undoubtedly be paid off in the near future!

Our country has spent two years in a bitter struggle. The facts tell us that the glorious sacrifices of millions of people, the Great Wall of steel built with flesh and blood, has laid a bright and free foundation for our motherland, and has revealed a ray of truth to the world. Our Chinese nation will never perish. Our Chinese descendants will never fall into eternal doom under the shameless and despicable guise of "peace." We must fight to the end! Our camp is clear: the sons and daughters of China must unite even more closely and strive for our final victory as quickly as possible. Let those historical Qin Huis die; we need not care about them at all!

The water of the Yongding River still flows babblingly under the Lugou Bridge. Today, two years later, we remember "July 7th" even more deeply. We cannot forget the brothers who sacrificed on the Yongding River, and we cannot forget the millions of our most beloved fighters who are fighting day and night on the homeland, in the sky, on the battlefield, persevering and fighting desperately with the × people. They have demonstrated the national soul of the Chinese nation. We are their brothers and sisters. For ourselves, for future generations, and for our country, we must strengthen our vigilance and struggle. Contribute money if we have it, and contribute strength if we have it. The radiance of victory is getting closer to us.

We are about to leave Hong Kong and move farther and farther away from the motherland. But our hearts are getting closer to the motherland. When we gather with you again in a year, perhaps it will be in Guangzhou, Nanjing, or Shanghai. At that time, we will be performing plays about national construction after victory. - Let us encourage each other!
