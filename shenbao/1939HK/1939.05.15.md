### Serious Internal and External Crises in Japan

The Japanese invaders have been facing the staunch resistance of the Chinese nation for nearly two years. Despite the invaders and their hired traitors and compromisers continuing to make every effort to carry out arrogant propaganda, the fact facing people around the world is that the internal and external crises of the Japanese invaders have indeed become increasingly serious, and they have stepped onto the path of ultimate collapse.

First, let's talk about the domestic situation in Japan. The first phenomenon is the severity of the economic crisis. Japanese Prime Minister Yonai recently stated that "Japanese villages all feel a shortage of manpower, because many strong young men in the villages have been conscripted to attack China, and many farmers in various places have rushed to work in munitions and other factories, and agricultural production is on the verge of despair. At the same time, raw materials are lacking, and many industries are on the verge of stagnation!" (See Reuters report carried in newspapers on May 9th.) From this confession by the Japanese authorities, even without additional commentary, it is easy to imagine the severity of the Japanese rural economic crisis, the crisis in production, the crisis in foreign trade, the crisis in people's livelihood, and the difficulties in replenishing troops for the invasion of China! Second, due to the above-mentioned economic crisis, the sharpening of class antagonism and the intense development of internal struggles within the invasion camp have been further created. The main expression of this is the unemployment and unrest among the vast number of farmers, light industrial workers, and handicraft workers, while the munitions industry and related industries… At the same time, due to the persistence of the war, foreign exchange controls and import controls have further driven the panic of all non-military industries and export industrial and commercial operators, forcing the vast number of small and medium-sized property owners to fall into the ranks of the proletariat. How this class division and the formation and development of two major opposing forces will promote the outbreak of the internal crisis in Japan is not difficult to imagine! Third, this economic and even social crisis in Japan not only exists in Japan itself, but also exists in Japan's territories and colonies, and the crisis in these places is even more… Therefore, this crisis is even more serious! The fact that the Japanese authorities are scheduled to convene a national judicial conference today (the 15th) to deal with the escalating anti-war sentiments of the people and to crack down on those who violate economic controls, and have ordered judicial officers from Korea and Taiwan to rush to attend, shows the seriousness of the situation.

Looking at the international situation, Japan's position in the international arena is declining, becoming increasingly unfavorable, and increasingly isolated. First, the consolidation and development of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression front of democratic and peaceful countries has directly and indirectly helped the global movement to aid China and sanction Japan. Recently, the entire US Pacific Fleet has moved east, and since April, no munitions have been exported to Japan (see Shanghai dispatch from Washington on the 14th reported in today's newspaper). Britain is actively strengthening its defenses in the Far East and preparing for the Singapore naval conference, the Soviet Union is increasing its defenses in the Far East with land and naval forces and the advancement of the aid-China movement; and the initiation and progress of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States, and the United States and the Soviet Union; all of these have made Japan's international situation even worse. Second, the "anti-communist" group of fascist aggressors has begun to expose its true nature of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Although they have adopted more frantic collusion in order to deal with the anti-aggression movement of democratic and peaceful countries, such as the recent negotiations on a German-Italian military alliance and even the brewing of a German-Italian-Japanese military alliance; at the same time, the continued existence of the hypocritical compromise policies of democratic and peaceful countries has given the aggression group even more rampant opportunities. However, the difficulties faced by Germany and Italy are in fact the same as those faced by Japan, especially in the economic aspect, so there is no hope of any assistance for Japan's current difficulties. In the confrontation between these two fronts, although Japan cannot but move further towards the reactionary fascist path in order to intensify internal exploitation and external plunder; this will inevitably further increase the degree of internal and external crises in Japan, especially increasing internal turmoil in Japan.

The way the Japanese invaders deal with this internal and external crisis is to adopt reactionary fascist methods, that is, internally… For example, the recent decision to fully implement the National Mobilization Law and unify the army and navy, and the large-scale arrest of anti-war and anti-economic control elements, are obvious examples. At the same time, they do not hesitate to launch a second "February 26th" incident in the country to promote the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance, suppress the anti-war movement of small and medium-sized property owners and the vast masses internally, and externally implement further speculation and adventure, such as recently intensifying intimidation of Britain, the United States, and France, robbing the Tianjin and Shanghai concessions, and landing on Gulangyu. However, this method of dealing with internal and external crises by the Japanese rulers will not only not work, but will instead further increase these crises! Therefore, we dare to assert that if there are no sudden changes in the international situation, such tragicomedies caused by the deepening of the crisis in Japan will continue to emerge one after another!

Here, we must recognize that the severity of the internal and external crises of the Japanese invaders is the result of our 22 months of adherence to the united front and persistent resistance war. It is also the result of our 22 months of resolutely supporting the central government and repeatedly defeating Wang Jingwei's and others' proposals for "anti-communist peace." We have exchanged these results with 22 months of bloody struggle and the sacrifice of countless lives and property, and we must never give up lightly! Absolutely can not be lightly ruined! No! We must also solemnly point out that this crisis and difficulty of Japan is only the beginning. If we can further carry forward the spirit of struggle of the past 22 months, adhere to the united front, and persist in the protracted resistance war, then Japan's internal and external crises will be further expanded and deepened. At the same time, it will also be more helpful to the international situation being favorable to us, and help increase our country's combat effectiveness and political progress, and make it possible to advance the arrival of the period of general counter-offensive, recovery of lost territories, and striving for final victory. Conversely, if we blindly believe that Japan's crisis and difficulties have reached the final stage, if we therefore no longer strengthen the united front, no longer focus on the implementation of democratic politics and the improvement of people's livelihood, and no longer further mobilize the vital forces of the entire nation and international sympathy and assistance, then our national liberation cause may encounter unprecedented setbacks, and actually help the Japanese invaders to resolve their internal and external crises. This is what our entire nation should be urgently aware of today.

### Newspapers Can Now Be Self-Sufficient: Various Counties in Quzhou Are Actively Improving Manufacturing

— Guan Pu

(Special dispatch from Zhejiang) The annual paper production of various counties in Quzhou, Zhejiang is about 500,000 dan. According to regional distribution, Qu County produces about 300,000 dan annually, Longyou produces about 100,000 dan annually, and Jiang, Changshan, Suichang, and Shouchang counties each produce about 25,000 to 35,000 dan annually. The well-known factories that are organized include Qu County's Yuquan Paper Mill, Siwei Paper Mill, Housheng Paper Mill, Huanan Paper Mill, Longyou's Yumin Paper Mill, and the Improved Paper Mill affiliated with the Papermaking Training Institute. The total annual output value is about 3,000,000 yuan, and no fewer than tens of thousands of people directly and indirectly depend on it for a living. There are many types of paper, such as Nanping, Yingjian, 25-pack paper, Fangxi Dajing, Fangjing, Fang 5,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan book, Songbian, improved Mao Lu, etc., and the Huajian of Wei and the Nanping of Longyou are more famous. The output is not only large, but they are also necessary for double books and superstitious paper. Except for a small amount sold locally, most of them were previously transported to Hangzhou, then from Hangzhou to Shanghai, and then Shanghai served as a distribution center, and they were transported to Jiangsu, Qingdao, and the four northeastern provinces. Since the start of the war of resistance, the market has been greatly affected, and now there is only one sales route that takes the route from Wenzhou to Shanghai. However, judging from the production and sales of paper in Quzhou, there are many shortcomings. The main ones are:

(1) In terms of production, although there are many types of paper produced, most of them are not practical. Except for improved Mao Lu yuan and Songbian, which can barely be used for official documents, the rest are of poor quality and are mostly used for foil paper and burning. However, improved Mao Lu, etc. also have many shortcomings: First, the production volume is not large, and second, the paper size is inconsistent and does not meet printing requirements. Therefore, what urgently needs to be improved in terms of production is: (1) Improve papermaking technology, (2) improve quality, and (3) standardize paper sizes.

(2) In terms of transportation and sales, the past sales areas have been affected by the war, and the market is completely controlled by Shanghai merchants. For example, the average price of Nanping paper produced in Longyou in Shanghai in the 27th year of the Republic was more than 8 yuan per dan. After deducting the shipping cost of 3 yuan for transportation from Longyou, Lishui, and Wenzhou to Shanghai, the local price should be 5 yuan. However, the merchants only offered 3 yuan for purchase. Therefore, the aspects to be improved in terms of transportation and sales are: (1) Expand sales areas, (2) find ways to eliminate the control of intermediaries, and enable producers and consumers to trade directly.

Quzhou paper production and sales have many shortcomings, so sales have been shrinking year by year, while Western paper is being dumped in large quantities. Taking Qu County as an example, the comparison of sales of the two types of paper in the most recent three years is as follows:

Note: (1) The above two tables are based on a survey by the Fifth District Office for Improving Paper Production and Sales.

(2) The unit of Quzhou paper is piece, each piece is 2,000 sheets, and the unit of Western paper is ream, each ream is 1,000 sheets.

(3) Among them, white newsprint, white glazed paper, and various colored glazed papers have decreased year by year, probably because this type of paper is mostly imported goods and has been cut off after the war of resistance.

Most Western paper is newsprint. Now, due to the wartime relationship, the supply of coming is cut off, but the demand in the interior is increasing day by day. If Quzhou paper can improve its quality and standardize the paper size, then the sales of Western paper in the past will definitely be replaced by Quzhou paper. There is no doubt about it, so the current problem is the issue of production technology. If the problem of production technology can be properly resolved, then the sales problem can be solved accordingly. In order to meet this demand, the Office of the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fifth District of Zhejiang has prepared to establish the following: Improved Papermaking Training Institute, Improved Papermaking Factory, Production Office, and Improved Paper Production Cooperative, starting with technical improvement and solving production and sales problems in connection with it. The process is quite worth reporting and for general reference:

Cultivating Technical Talents

In order to improve papermaking technology, the cultivation of technical talents is naturally the first priority. On May 1, 27th year of the Republic, the district established the Fifth District Improved Papermaking Training Institute in the Gukou area of Longyou and attached an Improved Papermaking Factory for students to practice. The opening expenses of the Training Institute and the production of the Paper Mill were each 5,000 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan. In addition to 5,000 yuan subsidized by the provincial government, the paper-producing counties jointly raised 2,500 yuan; Qu County and Longyou each contributed 750 yuan, Jiangshan 500 yuan, Suichang 300 yuan, and Bingchang 200 yuan. The remaining 2,500 yuan was borrowed from the Qu County Cooperative Bank for working capital, with an agreement to repay it within one year (October 25, 27th year of the Republic to March 5, 28th year of the Republic). In July of that year, the first class of 14 students and 40 apprentices were recruited, all of whom were recommended by the paper-producing counties to enter the institute. The training period was set at six months. Students in the student class were required to have a junior high school education and were taught papermaking technology, applied chemistry for papermaking, an introduction to cooperation, and factory management. For the first three months, they studied science for two hours every day, and the rest of the time was spent practicing. In the last three months, they were assigned to practice in the attached factory, in order to combine academic knowledge and practical skills. Apprentices in the apprentice class were required to have an elementary school education and were divided into four subjects: material preparation, pulping, papermaking, and drying. They were all assigned to teach in the attached paper mill, focusing on the development of technical management knowledge. The first class graduated in December of the 27th year of the Republic. Except for those who left the institute due to unforeseen circumstances, a total of 40 people graduated, including 15 students (6 from Longyou, 2 from Suichang, 4 from Jiangshan, 2 from Qu County, and 1 from Shouchang) and 25 apprentices (8 from Longyou, 4 from Suichang, 3 from Jiangshan, 6 from Qu County, and 4 from Shouchang). All of them were assigned back to their original counties to take on technical work in improving the paper industry.

Establishing a Model Paper Mill

In order to provide a demonstration for various paper mills in the district and provide a place for students and apprentices to practice, an Improved Paper Mill was attached to the Training Institute. The factory has now achieved considerable success in the manufacture of newsprint. Its products include white newsprint (now discontinued) and several types of green newsprint. According to statistics, the average monthly output is 120 reams of Grade A green newsprint (2.4 feet long and 1.65 feet wide) (1,000 sheets per ream). The following is a table of the factory's production for the first half of last year:

Month Product Quantity

July-August Grade B white newsprint 45 reams

Nanping paper 1 piece (2,000 sheets)

Grade A white newsprint 3 reams

September Grade A green newsprint 55 reams

Grade A white newsprint 3 reams 778 sheets

October Grade A green newsprint 104 reams 46 sheets

November Grade A green newsprint 77 reams 934 sheets

December Grade A green newsprint 119 reams 350 sheets

Total

Grade B white newsprint 55 reams

Grade A green newsprint 356 reams 748 sheets

Grade A white newsprint 24 reams

Nanping paper 1 piece

The green newsprint produced by the factory is carefully crafted with pure heat and has excellent quality. Compared with Western paper, it is not inferior at all. The price is 8 yuan and 7 jiao per ream, which is also cheaper than Western paper. In addition to meeting the needs of various counties in the district, it is sold to western Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and even Jiangxi and Hunan (the Quzhou Daily and Huizhou Daily now use this green newsprint for printing). It is a pity that the output is limited and cannot fully meet the needs of all parties. The factory is now planning to add bag paper and Ma paper this year, and then raise funds to expand production in the second half of the year, and urge the various counties to improve paper production cooperatives in order to achieve large-scale production.

Controlling the Production and Sales of Quzhou Paper

Since the production technology of improved paper has been relatively resolved and the production volume has a growing trend, if the sales channels are not smooth, the previous efforts will be in vain. Therefore, in order to achieve integrated production and sales, the Improved Paper Production and Sales Office was established in July of the 27th year of the Republic. Its members are various improved paper mills (Yuquan, Yumin, Huanan, Siwei, Housheng, Fifth District Papermaking Training Institute), and it is supervised and guided by the Fifth District Commissioner's Office and the Qu County and Longyou County governments. The expenses are initially borne according to the number of paper vats in each factory: Yuquan 3, Housheng 5, Yumin 2, Siwei 2, and the Training Institute 2. In addition, there is the organization of the Fifth District Paper Transportation and Sales Office. Because at the provincial materials adjustment conference held in Lishui in April last year, it was decided to organize a paper transportation and sales office, but some paper merchants and vat owners strongly opposed it due to vested interests. After several consultations, it was finally decided that the Fifth District could organize a transportation and sales office separately, jointly organized by vat owners and paper merchants from Qu, Jiang, Sui, Shou, and Changshan counties. Longyou also operates independently in the form of a cooperative. All of these are in line with the integration of the production and sales of Quzhou paper and seek self-sufficiency in newsprint.

Although we cannot consider ourselves satisfied with the production technology of Quzhou's handicraft papermaking, and the transportation and sales organization should also be adjusted, we believe that Quzhou paper is a very promising industry that can respond to the situation of "newsprint shortage" in the interior in a timely manner and benefit cultural propaganda a lot. The improvement policies adopted by the responsible authorities are also very correct. The development into a "modernized" industry in the future awaits the efforts of the people.

### Unprecedented Unity of Young Students in Heyuan County: Converging into a Mighty Tide of Eliminating Traitors

— Lin Heng

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Enthusiastic applause passed several major resolutions.

Today, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall took on a new atmosphere. Various national defense cartoons and slogans with bold lines and bright colors were inserted around it. As soon as the clock struck eleven, the auditorium was filled with a group of lively and lovely young students and children. Loud voices kept singing: "May Fourth Movement Song", "On the Taihang Mountains", "Eliminating Traitors"... The walls were shaking with the songs.

At the beginning of the meeting, the chairman reported on the historical sites of the "May Fourth" Movement. With the great historical facts, representatives of the party and government authorities and various groups gave passionate and valuable speeches on the experience and lessons of the student movement, the tasks and policies of the youth movement, and the resistance against Japan and traitors.

After the speeches, the proposals began. The first was a telegram supporting Commander Zhang of the Fourth War Area and Chairman Li; the second was a request to the authorities to implement wartime education and organize a committee to handle the matter; the third was to launch various schools to respond to the government's recent call for the movement of 500,000 comfort letters, deciding that each student and youth should write at least five letters each, and a ghostwriting office was also set up to mobilize the public to participate; the fourth was to schedule a joint military-civilian party in Heyuan County on the 14th of this month, stipulating that each agency, group, and school should send at least a number of representatives to attend; the fifth was to decide that the 15th to 21st would be the military service propaganda week, organize teams to go deep into the villages and comfort the families of soldiers resisting Japan; the sixth was a petition to the commissioner's office to reply to the case of punishing the traitor Li Daoxuan and confiscating his property... These proposals were all proposed by the unified organization of the eight major groups in Heyuan County: Heyuan County Anti-Japanese Youth League, Anti-Japanese Workers' League, Anti-Japanese Children's League, County Middle School Student Autonomous Association, Women's Association, Dongjiang Office of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, Heyuan Branch of the Youth Group, and Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Service Corps - the Joint Symposium. They were all passed by the entire audience with enthusiastic and prolonged applause, which was a sign of the success of the meeting.

Converging into a Mighty Tide of Eliminating Traitors

After the chairman announced the order of the parade, it immediately converged into a mighty torrent, originating from the Public Education Center of the Memorial Hall, flowing through the Zuping streets. When it reached the gate of the Commissioner's Office of District ×, the chairman asked the commissioner on behalf of the team for a reply to the case of punishing the traitor Li Daoxuan and confiscating his property, but the team shouted slogans of "Down with the traitor Li Daoxuan (currently the chairman of the puppet provincial government and the administrative commissioner of the First District)" and "Eliminate traitors" outside the gate, followed by a chorus of singing and music.

"Eliminate traitors, eliminate traitors, traitors are a hidden danger in our hearts, how can we save the current national crisis if we don't clear our own ranks?"

"Eliminate traitors, eliminate traitors, traitors are a hidden danger in our hearts, they are national traitors who sell out the nation, not even half of them can be let go."

"Big traitors sell the country to communicate with ×, small traitors sell themselves as dogs, medium traitors surrender to be thieves, and quasi-traitors compromise and seek peace.

"..."

"Dear young friends," the secretary of the Commissioner's Office began to reply to the team, "Everyone's high enthusiasm for saving the country is very commendable, especially the enthusiasm and initiative in eliminating traitors is even more admirable... In the previous Heyuan All-Circles Eliminating Traitors Conference, a petition to the government to punish the traitor Li Daoxuan and confiscate his property was passed. We have already requested instructions from the provincial government. Before the provincial government has replied, we will still obey the government's orders. Tonight, we will urgently send a telegram to the provincial government for instructions and then reply to everyone, okay? Please forgive us..."

After receiving a satisfactory reply, the team marched again in neat steps, singing passionate songs, raising high their passionate iron fists, and shouting the slogan of "Strengthening unity, long-term cooperation, resisting the war to the end". Under such a high tide of anti-Japanese sentiment, the entire crowd walked out of the shops and houses to watch, and some were even attracted to the team, and the marching team became stronger.

The team walked to the public current affairs speaking platform at the intersection, where the traces of the Heyuan All-Circles Eliminating Traitors Movement Week were still left. The Eliminating Traitors Conference was held, followed by performances of Eliminating Traitors plays and anti-traitor speeches on the speaking platform every night. A huge wave of eliminating traitors was set off in Heyuan! The huge wave warned many traitors!

The team walked to the gate of the new house of the traitor Li Daoxuan, and the emotions of the crowd were even higher, demanding that the house be destroyed. After the meeting of the presidium, it was decided that we should not take any extreme actions before receiving instructions from the government, in order to show the youth's sincere support and respect for the government. Finally, only the "memorial arch" in front of the gate was taken down, carried by the team, and brought to the county anti-Japanese support association.

Studying Experience and Lessons

In order to review today's meeting, parade, and study the experience and lessons of the "May Fourth" Movement, the presidium decided to convene an expanded symposium. After a heated discussion, the chairman summarized the experience and lessons:

First, the "May Fourth" Movement demonstrated the great patriotic enthusiasm and heroic spirit of struggle of intellectuals. This great movement promoted the development of the Chinese revolution, and at the same time, it exposed the greatest weakness of intellectuals, the lack of revolutionary persistence. This weakness was the main reason for the failure of the "May Fourth" Movement. This point warns and strengthens how our current youth movement should persist in struggle and strengthen efforts!

Second, the "May Fourth" Movement was a spontaneous anti-Japanese and anti-traitor national united front of students, workers, and merchants. This spontaneous national united front played a decisive role in the victory of opposing the traitors and refusing to sign the Treaty of Versailles. At the same time, precisely because this spontaneous national united front still had the serious weakness of lacking a broad mass base and being insufficiently expanded and consolidated, the "May Fourth" Movement could not achieve a thorough victory! This experience teaches us that we should currently intensify the consolidation and development of the anti-Japanese national united front, which can provide a strong guarantee for the final victory.

Third, due to the domestic divisions at that time, we were unable to resist the enemy's conspiracy to use "Chinese to control Chinese" to undermine our national unity, and allowed them to achieve their unearned victory. Now that the war of resistance is about to enter the second, more difficult stage, the enemy is also intensifying the use of traitors and pro-Japanese elements to undermine unity everywhere. We should uphold unity, adhere to the long-term cooperation of all anti-Japanese forces, and broadly launch the movement to eliminate traitors.

Fourth, the reason why Li Daoxuan became a traitor was not accidental. He had a consistent opportunistic style of fickleness. He was the most selfish and self-interested person, who has always contracted smuggling and directly contacted × and embarked on the road of traitors. At a time when smuggling is most prevalent in Dongjiang, we must be vigilant against all smugglers.

### The Latinized New Script is an Ideal Tool for Promoting Life Education... After Reading Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Letter to Comrades of the Life Education Society"

— Wo Dan

In the Hong Kong Shen Bao of April 20th and 21st, I read Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Letter to Comrades of the Life Education Society," which brought us correct guidance and encouragement. Mr. Tao's advocated Life Education Movement has been going on for twelve years. The seeds of Life Education have swept across China. The Xin'an Touring Troupe is an example, and the various Chinese schools across the country are examples. Moreover, Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational ideals and methods: knowing and then transmitting, doing knowing knowing doing, have become the motto of today's general national salvation workers.

Here, Mr. Tao also pointed out: What have we done in these twelve years? Three things, and these have not been completed. The first is anti-Westernized education, the second is anti-traditional education, and the third is to boldly establish educational theories and methods for freedom and equality in a semi-feudal country.

And in these three things, in order to promote the first two things. The third thing; to build theories and methods for education that strives for freedom and equality, then passive opposition is futile and will not achieve the goal. So, he also said:

The Three Principles of the People are the highest guidance for our work. The important military, political, economic, and educational aspects must be coordinated to transform a semi-colonial and semi-feudal family into a free, equal, and popular state.

Therefore, Mr. Tao also instructed! Education must have several conditions:

First, education must be combative and a weapon for national and human liberation.

Second, education must be life; all education must be effective through life.

Third, education must be scientific: it must be constantly studied to develop concrete methods based on objective circumstances, and the content must include natural sciences and social sciences.

Fourth, education must be for the masses.

Fifth, education must be planned. There must be a plan to allocate human and financial resources with a sense of urgency and importance.

In the fourth point, it is clearly stated that the ultimate goal of education is for the masses and should not be for a few. However, consider that more than 80 percent of our vast compatriots are still bright-eyed blind, illiterate, and ignorant, which is a major obstacle to our war of resistance!

In a proposal by Du Fen and 43 others at the Third National Political Consultative Conference, "A Proposal to Mobilize National Intellectuals, Eliminate Illiteracy, and Popularize National Consciousness to Benefit the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," it is explained in detail:

"Eliminating illiteracy and popularizing national consciousness to increase the understanding and enthusiasm of the broad masses for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is a task that must be urgently pursued in mobilizing the masses."

Moreover, here is a statistic on the large number of illiterate people in China:

"The population of our country is estimated to be 450 million (based on the customs estimate of the seventeenth year). Among them, excluding those aged one to sixteen (belonging to the scope of infant, children's compulsory education, and mass supplementary education), and those aged forty-seven to sixty, accounting for about 50% of the population, the remaining seventeen to forty-six years old account for about 50% of the total population, i.e., 225 million people, of whom about 80% are illiterate, i.e., 180 million people. These 180 million people are all adults in the nation, i.e., the backbone of the masses. At this extraordinary time of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, in order to cope with the current situation and increase national strength, it is an urgent need to quickly improve their cultural level."

Furthermore, this proposal lists in detail various concrete plans, and there are six methods that can be effectively implemented. (See Wartime Education, Special Issue of Volume 4, Issue 2.)

Here, we believe that if we can adopt the Latinized New Script to implement the elimination of illiteracy, consolidate the anti-Japanese national consciousness of the masses, and improve the cultural level, it will definitely accelerate the realization. Therefore, when listing six methods in the implementation proposal, there are two issues worth considering.

First, how can we enable 80% of our illiterate compatriots to quickly acquire the literacy tools to arm their minds, strive for knowledge liberation, consolidate the anti-Japanese foundation, and enhance the strength of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction?

### Fierce Battles in Northern Hubei, Stable Situation in Jiangxi, Stalemate in Southern Henan, Casualties Exceed 10,000 in April

[Special Dispatch from Guilin by this Newspaper on the 14th] After our troops captured Yanmenkou in central Hubei, they continued to advance towards Wamiaoji. The fighting is still fierce in the Suizao area. Xiangfan is guarded by our troops. It is expected that there will be a major battle in southern Henan after the enemy is repelled. According to general observations, the enemy's military operations in Hubei are still aimed at northern Hunan. The Jiangxi front is stable.

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 14th] The enemy's communication line extending north of Sui has been cut into several sections. Currently, a certain unit of our army is behind them, posing a major threat. There was a stalemate in northern Hubei on the 13th and 14th.

[Central News Agency, Xiangyang, 13th] The war in southern Henan has reached a stalemate. This morning, our main forces, in coordination with local teams, fiercely attacked Tanghe. They broke through the county town and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the suburbs. There have been no changes in the Tongbai area. South of Xinye is also very peaceful. At 10:45 am on the 14th, five enemy planes bombed Laohekou, causing no losses.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 14th] The enemy in southern Henan has been actively mobilizing in recent days. On the 12th, about 2,000 enemy infantry and cavalry who had infiltrated Tanghe were encircled by our various units. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the enemy could not hold out and broke through and fled on the morning of the 13th.

[Central News Agency, Pingliang, 13th] Our guerrillas, active in the Wuhan area, have recently achieved another surprising victory. They once recovered Echeng Gedian. At 11 am on the 9th, they stormed Gedian on the eastern bank of the Yangtze River in Wuchang with lightning speed, killing 137 enemy soldiers, capturing 67 rifles, 3 light machine guns, and countless military documents. The next day, our army bravely rushed into Echeng again and engaged in street fighting with the enemy for two hours, killing 233 enemy soldiers, capturing 83 rifles, 5 light machine guns, one mortar, and a large number of light and heavy weapons. The enemy counterattacked by land and water, so we withdrew westward with a full load of spoils.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 14th] Over the past ten days, the Chinese army has launched a counterattack in northern Hubei, annihilating 13,800 Japanese soldiers. In the Battle of Wanjia Mountain, 2,000 Japanese soldiers were completely wiped out. Chinese planes bombed Japanese positions in Nanchang and Anyi, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese army. The Japanese army attempted to invade Qinyang, but after Chinese reinforcements arrived, they launched a fierce counterattack, and the Japanese army could no longer advance.

Fierce Fighting in Southern Shanxi

[Minge News Agency, Ji, 13th] According to a source in a certain place in central Shanxi, more than 10 enemy planes flew over Hongkou at around 7 pm on the 28th, spying at a very high altitude. The national emblem was not easy to identify. The local enemy troops, having been repeatedly bombed by our planes in recent days, assumed that our planes were coming and hurriedly lowered all the Rising Sun flags and fled in all directions. At that time, it was already late, and there was a strong wind. The enemy planes gradually descended due to unclear targets and made low-altitude flights. Seeing troops fleeing in a panic, they assumed that they were insulting our army and dropped all the bombs they carried. Explosions shook the area, and countless warriors were killed heroically under the mighty power.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 13th] On the morning of the 2nd, 600-700 enemy troops from Shicun Houwang (southeast of Anyi), under the cover of artillery fire, attacked a certain unit of our army at Zhangguodian Junjialing (south of Xia County), and released a large amount of poison gas. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we also suffered considerable casualties. The situation is still deadlocked. The enemy in Quwo continues to increase its forces to Yicheng, attempting to make a final struggle. Another unit of the enemy attacked our Wumiao (southeast of Yicheng) from Shicun, with enemy planes providing support. After a day of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered more than a hundred casualties, and the remaining enemy troops scattered.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 13th] On the evening of the 3rd, a certain unit of our army attacked Ci Long (west of Fenxi) in two groups, killing the enemy sentries. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered 40 casualties. At the same time, another unit of our force destroyed more than 100 meters of the enemy's roadbed southeast of Sicha, and recovered more than 100 kilograms of telephone lines. The enemy in the Fenxi area suffered heavy casualties in southern Shanxi and has recently conscripted people from various villages to fill the vacancies. Most of the residents have fled. The enemy in Fencheng recently ordered the people to cut all the wheat seedlings within 10 li of the enemy to defend against our attacks.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 14th] According to the highest command of the enemy in Tianjin, there were a total of 330 battles between the enemy and our troops in Shanxi Province in April. The enemy's military strength was more than 68,000, with 4,930 killed and 7,250 wounded, totaling 12,180 casualties.

Our Army Advances in Eastern Suiyuan

[Minge News Agency, Hecheng, 14th] Our army in eastern Suiyuan is advancing rapidly and has now reached the vicinity of Liangcheng. The highway between Liangcheng and Zhuozishan has been largely destroyed by us. The enemy in Liangcheng is very shaken.

[Minge News Agency, Hecheng, 14th] According to news from the Suiyuan military, a fierce battle took place south of Ulanqab the day before yesterday. Our forces engaged in several bayonet fights on Bijia Mountain, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. At one point, an enemy plane flew low to provide support, but our artillery responded with heavy fire. The enemy plane was hit and caught fire, crashing 15 li east of Ulanqab. All five crew members were burned to death. In addition, a certain self-defense force of our army thoroughly destroyed the Anbei railway bridge and telegraph wires at the Qixiaying station. At that time, a unit of the enemy from various banners surrounded our army, but they were all repelled by our army. A total of six or seven li of nearby battle lines were destroyed by us.

[Minge News Agency, Hecheng, 14th] The enemy in Anbei has increased its forces and is conscripting laborers outside the east gate to build an airport and erect telegraph wires. Our army is constantly attacking them, making it extremely difficult for the enemy to make progress on their projects. In addition, a certain unit of our army destroyed enemy transportation near Sudi Yuan and captured more than 60 puppet soldiers guarding the road.

The Enemy's Offensive in Guangdong is Exhausted

[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 14th] Our guerrilla teams are extremely active along the Xinhe and Xinkai lines. On the 11th, our troops directly approached the suburbs of Xinhui and engaged in a bayonet fight with the enemy, gaining many spoils. The enemy could not hold out and retreated to the city. After completing our mission, we immediately withdrew. In this battle, more than 100 enemy soldiers were killed, and many military supplies such as steel helmets, flags, and gas masks were seized.

[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 14th] The number of enemy puppets in Jiujiang has been increasing, reaching more than 1,000 in total. On the morning of the 14th, enemy shallow-water warships on the Jiujiang River, under the direction of enemy planes, shelled the Huangbaokeng area of Dazhi Mountain. Subsequently, about 10 enemy steamships and rubber boats advanced towards Haikou in Heshu. Our coastal defense forces calmly met them and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, who fled in defeat.

### Gulangyu Enemy Landing Incident, Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement: Enemy's Purpose is to Test the Attitude of the Powers, Also a Prelude to Seizing the Shanghai Concession

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Chinese and foreign reporters visited Foreign Minister Wang of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and asked him to comment on the recent actions of the enemy in South China. He issued the following statement: The Japanese consul in Gulangyu was originally a member of the Gulangyu Municipal Council. Now, the Japanese army has landed in the Gulangyu concession without prior notice to the Municipal Council. Its intention is to test the attitude of the powers towards the Far East and is also a preliminary action for Japan to seize the Shanghai Joint Concession and other areas with similar status. Japan's contempt for the rights and interests of third countries is not the first time. Today, we can clearly understand that if the powers want their rights and interests not to be excluded from the Far East, their only strategy is to adopt sanctions and retaliatory measures against Japan, the aggressor.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] Secretary of State Hull told reporters that regarding the Gulangyu incident, the American consul in the area, Mr. McVitty, recently telegraphed that after the assassination of one of the members of the Xiamen Security Committee, 250 Japanese Marines occupied the Gulangyu Public Concession and arrested people everywhere. As for how the consul negotiated with the Japanese authorities, nothing is yet known.

### Chongqing Authorities Announce Disaster Relief Situation, 250,000 People Evacuated in Three Days, Strict Baobing System to be Established in the Future

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A reporter visited a responsible official on the 14th to inquire about the disaster relief situation in Chongqing and the future plan for reorganizing the city's finances. He replied that after the enemy planes indiscriminately bombed the city on the 3rd, 4th, and 12th of this month, our Supreme Leader immediately allocated a large sum of money from the government for emergency relief. At the same time, he ordered party, government, and military agencies to organize service teams, concentrate vehicles and ships, and actively transport citizens away from the disaster area. Within three days, from the 5th to the 7th, the number of citizens evacuated, according to statistics, reached about 250,000. In the future, the number of citizens who will continue to leave voluntarily by free ships is not included in this number. After the citizens are evacuated to safe areas such as XX, the service team will either find houses for them to live in with local residents or guide them to temporary accommodation in reception centers established by the government. Their food, medicine, and security have also been arranged properly and in an orderly manner, which is very convenient for the citizens. Chongqing is our wartime capital, so Commander Liu (Zhi) specially transferred a certain unit of the army to work with the service teams of various agencies, following the instructions of Chief of Staff He (Yingqin), to actively clean up the disaster area and renovate the city. However, in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifices, the government will continue to work hard to evacuate the elderly, weak, women, and children, and various agencies that do not need to stay in Chongqing. As for the areas near Chongqing, those who cannot leave Chongqing due to production or work reasons will be investigated and registered by the authorities separately, and certificates will be issued. A strict Baobing system will also be established, and people will be assigned to lead it, so that the citizens who stay in Chongqing can carry out their work with peace of mind under an organized and planned situation, and work as usual. Now that Mayor He Guoguang has taken office, there will be more active measures in the city administration of Chongqing, our wartime capital, in the future. Under the guidance and supervision of the Supreme Leader, the order of society, the solemn atmosphere, and the tense work of public officials and the general public in this wartime capital are all expected.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 14th] The chargé d'affaires of the French and Belgian embassies in China, accompanied by three journalists, crossed the river to inspect the French naval barracks, which had been damaged by Japanese planes attacking Chongqing yesterday. While crossing the river in a small boat, it was accidentally hit by a steamship, and the boat broke in two. Everyone jumped into the river and struggled against the current, and were later rescued by Chinese boatmen. As a result of yesterday's air raid, the French naval barracks were not damaged, but a certain American business office nearby was destroyed by fire. Yesterday's air raid resulted in more than 300 deaths and injuries, and three Japanese planes were shot down.

### Gulangyu Plunges into a State of Terror

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 14th] After the Japanese Marines forcibly occupied Gulangyu, they searched houses one by one in the city yesterday and the day before, and our residents were poisoned by them and could not escape. Currently, hundreds of young people have been taken to Xiamen, and their lives and deaths are unknown. The city is full of Japanese military posts, and the Municipal Council is unable to exercise its police power. Chinese and foreign shops are all in the downtown area, plunged into a state of terror. British and American expatriates are also extremely frightened.

### Political Department of the Southwest Headquarters Strengthens Military-Civilian Cooperation, Six Key Points Ordered to be Followed

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 14th] In order to strengthen military-civilian cooperation, the Political Department of the Southwest Headquarters has specially stipulated six key points to be followed: (1) Implement the Military-Civilian Cooperation Convention; (2) Hold an Anti-Japanese Oath Ceremony; (3) Hold a Military-Civilian Joint Celebration Meeting; (4) Vigorously Perform Services for the People; (5) Earnestly Implement the Military-Civilian Cooperation Method; (6) Use Local Administrative Organizations to Encourage Township Chiefs and Impartial Gentry to Lead the Masses in Comforting Wounded and Sick Soldiers, Providing Tea and Transportation Facilities to Troops Heading to the Front Lines or Undergoing Rearrangement, and Holding Welcome and Farewell Meetings.

### Shantou Air Raid

[Reuters, Shantou, 14th] This afternoon, Japanese planes attacked Shantou again. One bomb landed 200 yards west of Jardine Matheson & Co. The company was attacked by bomb fragments and machine guns. Several coolies were killed and injured. The British oil tanker "Hayton" and the small warship "Folkestone" sailed away amidst the dense machine gun fire, fortunately without loss.

[Reuters, Shantou, 14th] Three Japanese planes attacked Shantou this morning, dropping bombs in various parts of the city. The number of casualties is currently unknown.

### Ningbo Bombed, Dozens Killed and Injured

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 14th] Ignoring the protests of the American ambassador to Japan, the Japanese side sent seven planes yesterday to bomb the prosperous areas of Ningbo again, dropping sixteen bombs. The Quzhou (Ze Yin) Girls' School, the famous pagoda of Ningbo, and the private residence of the county magistrate were all hit, causing considerable damage. It is reported that more than 100 houses were destroyed, and dozens were killed and injured. Because of the evacuation of the population and proper hiding, the number of deaths and injuries was still small.

### From the Old Army to the New Army - An Interview with General Wang Jingguo

— Cao Jin

[Minge Jinxi Correspondence] A certain army stationed in the 8th War Zone was the first to enter northern Shanxi, defending the Zhuanli and fighting in Xinkou. The officers and soldiers fought bravely and achieved miraculous feats, but suffered heavy losses. After the withdrawal from Taiyuan, seven or eight out of ten of the original troops were wounded or killed. The army then moved to western Shanxi, focusing on new replenishment, new command, new training, and new tactics, and taking advantage of the Battle of Xuzhou. Launching a counterattack against the enemy, they immediately captured the important town of Liulin. They have been stalemated with the enemy in Lishi and Zhongyang for ten months. During the Liulin battle last autumn, they made good use of new tactics, and the enemy fled with injuries, not daring to invade again. Recently, the enemy in Jinxi attacked Jingle on four routes. The army then coordinated with friendly forces to capture Jiaokou a few days ago - Jiaokou Town is the intersection of the Taiyuan Highway to Zhongyang, and its situation is extremely important; when the news of the victory came, everyone was delighted. The reporter visited the general in a certain place and extended deep congratulations and condolences, and was able to hear the general briefly describe the army's combat experience, saying, "The initial failure is not surprising; the future victory is in sight." Calm and steadfast, truly displaying the demeanor of a great general. The military history described by the general can also represent the general characteristics of the entire national revolutionary war, and is introduced as follows:

First Period: Retreat in the Battle of Positions

"The first stage of operations of this army was to prepare to enter Tongguan for the battle, taking on the task of defending the front of Yanmen Pass. Later, the battle situation changed, and the army retreated to the county, covering the concentration of our rear forces in Xinkou. The task was fairly completed, and the strength was already more than half lost. After reorganization, the army returned to Xinkou to fight. After these two battles, seven or eight out of ten soldiers were wounded or killed, and most of the company commanders were also wounded or killed. Of the regimental commanders, only one was left. The ferocity of the battle of positions and the appalling number of casualties were the result of the accumulated fear of more than ten years.

After withdrawing from Taiyuan, one independent brigade was replenished in Yangxian. Seeing that the enemy avoided Hanhuling, they took a two-wing encirclement on Linfen. The army hastily opened up the right pass of Damaijiao for defense. Although they had slightly thwarted the enemy, they suffered heavy losses, with 4,000 wounded, killed, or scattered. A certain heroic brigade commander also became a martyr in this battle."

Second Period: Mobile Warfare and Guerrilla Warfare

After Linfen fell, the division of defense zones began, and guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare were used. However, the main communication lines were all occupied by the enemy. Due to this factual predicament and need, although the army was not familiar with the new tactics, it was quite brave in experimenting. At that time, after the enemy besieged Jixian on eight routes, they continued to go deep, besieging Shilu on six routes, attempting to attack our headquarters. We had to find an opportunity to withdraw, and the enemy then attacked Yonghe, but was met with our fierce resistance. When the enemy retreated to Maozhi Mountain, they were ambushed by us again. In these two attacks, the ratio of enemy to our casualties was reversed. We also captured a large number of spoils, and then recovered Guanxian, Shilu, and Daning. This was due to the strong morale, and we did not regard the temporary retreat in tactics as a defeat. The application of the new fierce tactics was difficult at first, but this also proved its great effectiveness. The understanding of the cadres was strengthened as a result, and they no longer suspected that the "Four New Education" (Note: that is, new replenishment, new command, new training, and new tactics) was not beneficial to the public and harmful to oneself.

In order to cooperate with the Battle of Xuzhou, our army unanimously adopted an offensive. This army first captured Jundu and Liulin, and also frequently attacked the enemy in Lishi and Zhongyang, all with minor victories. The morale was greatly boosted, which laid the foundation for the victory in Liulin in September of last year. At that time, the enemy was attacking Wuhan, but could not succeed. In order to contain our army's strength, they declared that they would invade our Great Northwest, one route of which was to attack Jundu, making a tentative crossing.

Previously, the enemy had increased its forces in Fen and Li to about 5,000 or 6,000 troops, and went north from Dawu, feigning an attack on Lin County. We noticed their treachery and sent out a team to attack first. The enemy also sent troops back to respond. We slightly engaged them on the front and then scattered into the mountains on both sides. The enemy, with its arrogant army, went straight to Jundu, but was attacked from all sides by us, and immediately withdrew to Liulin. They also attacked Daning, where our headquarters was located. Our army in the north then took the opportunity to attack Liulin, killing one enemy regimental commander and one deputy commander of the station. The enemy returned and attacked north, shelling for two days without a target. Our army in the south then approached Liulin again. The enemy did not leave the city. Our two wings simultaneously launched a counterattack, and the communication line between Liu and Li was controlled by us. The enemy then fled Qin City, and we pressed on in pursuit, holding the line with the enemy in a certain place west of Lishi City. On the "Double Twelfth" Memorial Day, and three days later - the anniversary of the fall of Nanjing - the enemy launched a combined land and air attack on Liulin. We already had the experience of the first time and made proper arrangements. We set up an ambush on two high grounds on the flanks and front, concentrated the main force on the rear front, and made a deep deployment. The enemy recklessly pressed into the shell, and we attacked from three sides, leaving more than 500 corpses and fleeing in disarray. Our army suffered only 80 to 90 casualties. At the end of last year, the enemy again attacked Jixian. The enemy attacking Shilu from the north by way of the central route withdrew halfway due to the pressure of our army in Liulin. Recently, the enemy launched a four-pronged siege of Jingle, with about 4,000 to 5,000 troops from Lishi via Dawu. Our army took the opportunity to recapture Jiaokou and destroyed six enemy bunkers and fortifications. We are currently searching and advancing in the direction of Lishi and Zhongyang. Even if we cannot recover them all, we can warn the enemy not to make the vain attempt to advance westward.

Third Period: Victorious Counteroffensive

After Commander Wang finished speaking, the reporter asked about the current situation in the war zone and the future prospects. Commander Wang gave a detailed analysis, saying: "Judging from the geographical situation and our forces' preparedness, the enemy on this route will never dare to peer into northern Shaanxi unless they can increase their forces to more than 50,000. Judging from the current war situation, the enemy is no longer able to go deep, but is trying to consolidate its occupied areas and prolong the stalemate. We must strike at them at any time to hasten their collapse and enter the counteroffensive stage as soon as possible. As for what the counteroffensive situation will be like, there is no need for empty talk today. By this time next year, it will be possible to supplement the narrative."

### Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Civilians; US Lodges Protest with Japan; China Branch of International Anti-Aggression League Reports on Atrocities by Enemy Planes to Headquarters

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Hull recently released a statement to the press, briefly stating that after Japanese planes extensively bombed Chongqing, Shantou, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and other locations, the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has lodged a verbal protest with the Japanese government. This action is based on the consistent attitude that the US government condemns all acts of bombing ordinary civilians.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] To enable the world's populace to better understand the enemy's atrocities and to promote sanctions against Japan, the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League has telegraphed the General Anti-Aggression League in Geneva with factual details of the enemy's repeated air raids on Chongqing. The telegram specifically pointed out the enemy's despicable tactics as a sign of their increasingly weakened state. These tactics are not only ineffective, but also deepen the understanding of Chinese citizens regarding the enemy's cruel nature. The emotion of shared hatred grows stronger, and the determination to resist until the end becomes more resolute. The branch also earnestly requests the General League to find ways to promote the implementation of various proposals from the Paris Anti-Bombing of Undefended Cities Conference and to strengthen effective sanctions against the enemy.

### Proceedings of the National Production Conference

— Zheng Bo

[Continental News Agency, Chongqing Express] Under the leadership of President Kong, the National Production Conference commenced on the 10th of this month and concluded successfully on the 13th. Over 120 officials from various ministries, representatives from agencies, and experts attended. The proposals were divided into (1) Agriculture, (2) Industry, (3) Continued Industries, (4) Transportation, Economics, and Other categories, totaling over 360 items. All of them are closely aligned with the needs of the wartime environment and are urgent priorities for completing the great task of resisting Japan and building the nation. National experts in agriculture, industry, finance, and economics gathered together in a tragic environment after the enemy's large-scale disturbances. They were diligent and dedicated, engaging with the most sincere and enthusiastic attitude in the research and planning to increase national production and cultivate national strength. The conference was filled with a spirit of unity and vigorous advancement, and the harmonious atmosphere demonstrated the bright future of China.

The convening of the Production Conference is essentially a review of past work and a promotion of future production. Its significance is as the conference declaration states: "Resisting Japan and building the nation, planning and advancing simultaneously, is the established national policy of the central government. Modern nations are founded on the three pillars of economics, education, and military strength. The victory or defeat in war is determined by the sustained supply of economic power, as clearly instructed by the Commander-in-Chief." Since the start of the war, our nation's military strength has grown stronger with each battle. The key priority today is to develop national production, so that the country's economic strength becomes increasingly abundant and can match this powerful national military force to strive for the victory of resistance and establish the foundation for national construction.

On the second day of the conference, Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally attended to give instructions, expressing admiration for the members who traveled long distances and made sacrifices to attend for the sake of the nation. He provided detailed and repeated instructions on the importance of production and conservation. The Commander-in-Chief gave thorough and clear instructions on economic construction, resource concentration, transportation development, and manpower utilization. He also encouraged all members to make efforts to increase production through academic research. All members expressed their joy and were deeply moved by the Commander-in-Chief's rare and approachable great personality.

The conference declaration was passed at the final meeting and will be fully published after slight revisions to serve as a reference for government policy implementation and for discussion among the people of the nation. The conference believes that China's economic construction has seen decades of effort, but significant effects have not been seen due to two main reasons: "First, before the establishment of the National Government, there was some construction but no planning. Second, after the establishment of the National Government, there was planning, but it was hampered by internal and external troubles, and long-term development was not possible." Now that the War of Resistance has begun, the nation is unified, internal troubles have been eliminated, and external troubles are mired in the mud. In the future, China's economic policy should absolutely adhere to the Principle of People's Livelihood, aim to solve the legitimate needs of the people's lives, and especially develop national capital, support private enterprises, and promote cooperative movements. At the same time, prevent the concentration of capital, and nationalize, democratize, and rationalize production enterprises to lay the foundation for the construction of a new China and cultivate the economic strength of the entire nation. Resistance and national construction are related to the nation's safety and survival. The government should adhere to the principles of military first, victory first, nation above all, and ethnicity above all, and plan the nation's production forces as a whole, ensuring that all kinds of necessities for the military and the people are produced in large quantities and endlessly to meet the needs of national defense and enhance the strength of resistance. There should be a comprehensive calculation of the types and quality of products, and there should be close connections between various production enterprises, making the entire national economic production a systematic and organized mobile entity. The basis for national revival lies in the interior of the Southwest and Northwest. Therefore, the economic construction of the rear is an urgent task. Before the war, the economic center of the country was in the Southeast. In the years after the war, the economic center of the country will be in the Southwest. Therefore, all economic construction in the rear should be based on planned calculations. The members of this conference believe that one of the central principles of the country's entire production policy in the future should be the economic construction of the Southwest, which should be recognized by the entire nation."

### Reviewing Past Work

— Kong Xiangxi

Promoting Future Production—Opening Address at the National Production Conference—

Fellow members, the opening date of this Production Conference was originally scheduled for May 5th, the day when the Premier assumed the post of Extraordinary Grand President eighteen years ago. The intention was to reflect on the Premier's spirit of hard work and struggle in those years and to dedicate ourselves to the current great cause of production and construction. However, due to the enemy's indiscriminate bombing of various places in our rear and the difficulty of transportation in the city, it was slightly postponed. Today's meeting coincides with the National Humiliation Day of May 7th, the day when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai. From reflecting on the difficulties of building the nation and feeling the current oppression, we are even more aware of the importance of our future responsibilities. Under the two major goals of resistance and national construction today, we must constantly review, constantly encourage, and move forward with diligence and energy in our respective duties. The convening of the National Production Conference is based on this kind of motivation.

This is more important and more meaningful than any other kind of gathering during the war. The material supply needed for the war effort is vast, and the key to recent victories or defeats depends on whether economic resources can be sustained for a long time. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Chiang said, "Modern warfare is a final between nations of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Those whose economic resources can provide a sustained supply will win the final victory." For more than a year, the enemy has spared no effort to destroy our economy and finance. Fortunately, thanks to the government's efforts to cope and the people's enthusiastic support, inland economic construction is still continuing, and the credit of legal tender is becoming more and more consolidated. Recently, the price of counterfeit currency in North China has plummeted repeatedly. Although the enemy has exhausted all kinds of means to try to salvage it, they have ultimately failed. It should be noted that counterfeit currency and enemy currency belong to the same group. The plummeting price of counterfeit currency is equivalent to the plummeting price of enemy currency. From this perspective, our country has already defeated the enemy in the economic aspect. If we can continue our efforts, work hard to produce, and continuously supply and strengthen our material and financial resources, then we will surely be able to win the war and achieve the goal of national construction. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has been aware of the huge consumption of war and the difficulty of the country's material resources. On the one hand, it has promoted conservation to reduce unnecessary consumption, and on the other hand, it has encouraged production to develop resources to supplement them. All domestic highway production enterprises are doing their utmost to promote and support them in order to reduce difficulties, strengthen their strength, and increase their efficiency. Such as assisting factory relocation, organizing agricultural and industrial loans, and subsidizing production capital, etc., are being done with the greatest effort and the greatest courage. In order to be convenient to use and quickly effective, in addition to the competent ministries urging and handling, the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee and the Industrial Cooperation organizations have also been established to engage in production work. However, although the promotion is strong, its effectiveness still needs a thorough review in order to correct shortcomings and develop reasonably and smoothly. Therefore, the purpose of convening this conference is to "review past work and promote future production." Now, I would like to put forward a few opinions on these two goals for your reference.

First, the establishment of a production plan. Regarding national economic construction, the Premier has already given detailed instructions, and we should take them as the law and strive to realize them. What we should ask for today is to increase the necessary production of various kinds on the one hand to meet the current needs and to strengthen the resistance force, and on the other hand to follow the legacy and establish a hundred-year plan to lay the foundation for national construction. Since the war of resistance, the government has paid attention to three things: First, the delimitation of regional economic plans, second, the coordination of state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, and third, the relief of agricultural and rural economies. China is vast and rich in resources, and large-scale production can be planned everywhere. However, the mutual coordination between the natural environment and the production enterprises also has a lot of room for choosing the good and the bad. Therefore, after the development plan of the economy is carried out, it should be vigorously corrected. Now the government has decided to select local sites in Sichuan Province for the first phase of industrial areas to be developed in light of the resources and transportation of the southwestern provinces to engage in the exploitation of coal mines, petroleum, and coal gas, and has established alcohol factories, power plants, chemical factories, etc., which are still in the planning stage, iron-making paper mills and sugar mills, etc. The signing of this regional economic plan is a major point in the current economic construction. Under the leadership of the People's Livelihood in the construction of the country, it is necessary to control private capital and prevent a small number of capitalists from monopolizing the market and controlling finance. Therefore, the government's economic plan is designed in accordance with the Premier's legacy of heavy industry and national defense industries, with state-owned industries as the principle, and light industries with government-encouraged private enterprises as the principle. Now the main means of transportation in the country have long been reclaimed. The larger-scale mining areas, especially the mining areas related to national defense industries and heavy industries, have also been designated as state-owned areas. However, private enterprises must also do their utmost to promote and support them in order to cooperate and advance together. Therefore, the government has paid special attention to the revision of the Company Law, the encouragement of private enterprises, and the cooperation between officials and businesses. As for rural economic relief, we have been paying close attention to it before the war, such as promoting village cooperation, agricultural experiments, and establishing agricultural banks. Since the outbreak of the war, the work of the Agricultural Bank has been even more important in the southwestern provinces, such as establishing county cooperative treasuries, organizing agricultural loans, investing in agricultural farmland and water conservancy, purchasing cotton yarn, cotton cloth, food, and transporting them to the rear, etc. has been developing for many years and will continue to work hard to achieve universal results in the future. However, whether these plans are perfect is related to the future of the business, which is of great importance, and it is urgent to consider the social situation and carefully review it based on personal experience. Special attention should be paid to the following two things:

### Anti-Aggression Negotiations Still Actively Underway; Soviets to Reply to British Proposals; Mussolini's Speech Uses Moderate Language

[Reuters, London, 13th] Diplomatic circles believe that the international situation has improved slightly since the weekend. The most important factor is the finalization of the Anglo-Turkish agreement. The Anglo-Soviet negotiations are also showing signs of progress. Chamberlain's and Daladier's clear declarations, coupled with the axis's taciturnity, make them appear subdued. Whether the situation can continue to improve depends on Mussolini's speech tomorrow. According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the Anglo-Turkish agreement is sufficient to change the situation in the Balkans significantly. It not only has a stabilizing effect on Yugoslavia, but also has a marked reaction on Bulgaria. The Anglo-Turkish agreement clearly dispels Bulgaria's dreams of obtaining access to the Aegean port and revising its northern border. However, it is believed that Bulgaria will also feel that maintaining peace is better than war, and its sympathies are gradually separating from the totalitarian states and leaning towards the anti-aggression front. The change in Bulgaria's attitude is probably due to the axis powers' increasing belief that they have long planned to dismember Greece, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria to establish an independent Macedonian state. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin is now going to Geneva to meet Halifax and Bonnet, which is also a clear sign of progress in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and various parties. Some quarters believe that the Soviet authorities will continue to demand that, in addition to the scope agreed upon, other borders of the Soviet Union be guaranteed. Diplomatic circles believe that Poland will agree to provide guarantees to the Baltic states, and the Baltic states will not reject such guarantees once they are offered. As for how and when the British and French governments will provide these guarantees to them, there is still no sign of this.

[Reuters, Kaunas, 13th] It is reported that relations between the Soviet Union and the Baltic States are becoming increasingly close. It is said that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin will visit the Baltic States after the League of Nations meeting, and the Soviet ambassador to Lithuania, who has been suspended for a year, will also be dispatched soon.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The diplomatic correspondent of the "Observer" wrote today that the Soviet government will not wait for Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Geneva, but will first send to the British government the results of its observations on the recent British proposals. It is expected that this reply will arrive in London at the beginning of this week. It is reported that the main motive of the Soviet Union is to express concern about the danger of delaying negotiations. In view of the desire to conclude an agreement with the British government as soon as possible, the Soviet government will indicate its willingness to accept modifications in terms of form or wording, but will still repeatedly insist on its main idea, namely, to conclude a British, French, and Soviet military alliance to resist German aggression.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 14th] According to newspapers here this morning, the United Kingdom will invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov or Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to London for negotiations.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Mussolini delivered a speech here, stating, "Millions of people are now asking whether we will move towards war or peace. This is a serious question, especially for those who are responsible for deciding between war and peace. Today's fascism is stronger than ever before. Regarding the problems of Europe, we will seek solutions with Germany. We also want to invite democratic countries to express fair opinions on our views. Italy ardently supports peace. Are democratic countries also like our country? We really cannot help but be suspicious. Democratic countries have now begun an economic war against us, which shows that they do not ardently protect peace. But we will defeat these countries with perseverance and will. Any attacks against us will be ineffective. The guarantee system will also be damaged. What doubts do we have about the future? No matter what happens, we will be able to achieve all our goals."

[Reuters, London, 14th] Reuters has learned that the impression of Mussolini's speech in diplomatic circles here is not entirely satisfactory. It is believed that the speech uses moderate language and will not affect the current situation. It is worth noting that Mussolini's speech did not mention Danzig, Poland, the Anglo-Turkish agreement, and demands to France.

### Turkish Parliament Approves Anglo-Turkish Cooperation Plan; Prime Minister Reports on Importance of Agreement; Neutrality Impossible in a Critical Situation

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] A telegram was received from the Turkish capital stating that at the Turkish Parliament meeting on the 12th of this month, the government submitted a detailed report on the Anglo-Turkish negotiated agreement, which was extremely satisfactory to the British after learning of it. It is said that at the Turkish Parliament meeting, the Turkish Prime Minister first explained the importance of the Anglo-Turkish agreement in Turkish history, briefly stating that recent events in the world have progressed rapidly. Turkey originally wanted to take a neutral policy, but the development of events has extended to the Balkans and the security of the eastern Mediterranean, and Turkey is also in a critical situation. Although it wants to maintain neutrality, it is impossible. The Mediterranean should be jointly owned by all countries based on equal footing. Anyone who attempts to interfere with this common political power will endanger Turkish security. I (the Prime Minister referring to himself) now request the Parliament to authorize the government to promise that Turkey will cooperate with the United Kingdom to save the world from the scourge of war. The Prime Minister finally stated that if necessary, the Turkish navy and army will jointly protect peace in the Mediterranean with the British army. After the Prime Minister's speech, the Parliament immediately passed a vote of confidence in the government, approving the government's policy of establishing friendship and close cooperation with the United Kingdom.

German Newspapers Attack British Diplomacy

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The reaction of the Nazi newspapers to the Anglo-Turkish agreement today is the same as their criticism of the Anglo-Polish agreement a few days ago. They mostly express disagreement with Turkey's single-mindedness and attack it with distrust. They claim that Germany believes that this new agreement is a further expression of Chamberlain's proposed movement, namely, the so-called "encirclement policy against the Axis powers, and this time it first starts with Italy." Generally speaking, the trend is that Germany is naturally deeply disappointed with Turkey's close proximity to democratic countries. Some Nazi newspapers said that this agreement will cause a crisis in Turkey. The Nazi officials have not yet made any criticism for the time being. According to foreign views, it is necessary to obtain the full text of the agreement before a statement can be issued. However, a certain semi-official newspaper (the newspaper is published only on special occasions) said that the United Kingdom is now using "coercion and inducement" to forcefully provide protection to various countries, and said that Turkey should understand that Germany and Italy are not only inseparable partners in the military, but also indestructible fortresses. No matter now or in the future, any united front will not be enough to affect the policy of the Axis powers.

### French Foreign Minister Arrives in England to Meet Halifax; Discuss British-Soviet Negotiations; Delivers Speech Praising Anglo-French Cooperation

[Associated Press, London, 14th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived in England by plane yesterday, expressing close cooperation with the United Kingdom to maintain the common interests of the two countries.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 13th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet said in a speech at a luncheon of the French Alliance in Southampton today, "The front line of the United Kingdom has not only expanded to the Rhine, but now extends to the Vistula River" (the Vistula River is in Poland). Bonnet flew from Paris to Southampton with his secretary. In his speech, he tried his best to show France's efforts to expand its military. All factories related to national defense have resumed the system of working 60 hours a week. Bonnet said that the French government extended the term of military training for reserve soldiers, and the reserve soldiers were able to show a spirit of no complaint, which is admirable. The friendship between Britain and France is due to each other's determination to protect national defense, so it is even closer. Bonnet praised the British for being able to resolutely break traditional habits and accept compulsory military service. After the luncheon, Bonnet went to London and will meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax. It is reported that the two will focus on discussing the British-Soviet negotiations.

Another Conflict on the Border of Manchukuo

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] According to a message from Changchun yesterday, on Thursday, more than 100 Outer Mongolian troops entered the territory of Manchukuo near Lake Bel, crossed the Khalkha River, and attacked the Manchukuo border guards. The two armies held each other for several hours. The Outer Mongolian soldiers were repelled, five died, and the number of casualties on the Manchukuo side is not yet known. Such incidents occurred once in early May, so the number of Manchukuo border guards has been greatly increased.

### US Interdepartmental Committee Asks for Improvement of the Air Force; Plan Submitted to Roosevelt; Develop Civil Aviation to Enhance National Defense

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The Interdepartmental Committee has submitted a plan to President Roosevelt to improve the status of the US Air Force and make the United States a strong air force country. The plan first calls for an immediate doubling of the number of mechanical engineers in existing aircraft manufacturing plants, about 40,000, so that 500,000 pilots can be quickly obtained in wartime. According to the "New York Times", another interdepartmental committee will soon submit a plan to develop civil aviation to enhance national defense.

### National Production Conference Proceedings (Continued from Page 3)

His Excellency issued an order stating that agriculture, industry, transportation, and commerce are the mainstays of future national economic construction. Therefore, in the declaration, a summary of each is presented. In addition, several matters that must be paid attention to in the development of production are (1) capital, trade, and finance; (2) labor; (3) production and education, with detailed explanations. The conclusion is: "The President has wisely pointed out that our country's resistance base is not in the shallow, narrow communication zones along the coast, but in the vast and deep inland areas. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are especially the source of our resistance strategy. Only the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest can provide a solid foundation for long-term resistance and national reconstruction. This National Production Conference is held at a time when the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles and launching counter-offensives, achieving success and under the heavy threat of enemy aircraft's bombing. We, the members of this conference, mindful of the severity of the national crisis and deeply aware of our individual responsibility, have exhausted our thoughts and deliberated day and night, hoping to contribute our meager efforts to the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest. We reverently admire the President's grand vision for the country and also comfort the government's earnest expectations. The realization of this great historical mission and the shouldering of this arduous responsibility rely on the concerted efforts of the entire nation. We, the members of this conference, must devote our hearts and minds and respectfully follow the people of the country and work hard. We hope that the government and the public will devote their attention and effort, ensure that the plans are practical, economize on expenses, and ensure the success of the undertakings. We must work diligently and practically to achieve success. The revitalization of the country, after a century of difficulties, has an ancient saying: 'Continuing the past and opening up the future, the responsibility lies with us.' The past two years of resistance have allowed us to gain unlimited practical experience and inspiration amidst hardship and struggle. It has also allowed us to deeply realize that our Chinese nation, nurtured by the divine spirits of Yan and Huang, will surely overcome great difficulties and stand firmly on its own in today's world, illuminating our nation with a new destiny. Future national construction will surely prove the greatness of the creative power of our Chinese nation, capable of completing China's production revolution with its remaining strength amidst the national resistance, establishing the new Chinese production system and realizing the central government's national policy of resisting while building. Let us all strive together for the nation."

### Italian-Romanian Negotiations Plan to Revise Trade Agreement, German-Romanian Exchange of Goods

[Haitong News Agency, 14th] According to the "Lun Huaibao", the Romanian Minister of Finance, who met with Mussolini on Friday, is currently conducting important negotiations with the Italian government to plan the revision of the Italian-Romanian trade agreement of December last year. The report also stated that Romania will exchange flour, livestock, petroleum, and timber for Italian artificial fiber machinery and furniture. A group of young personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank will be sent to Italy for observation.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th] Germany and Romania have now concluded an agreement. Romania will exchange timber for German machinery. The signing date will be next month.

### Conflict Occurs on the Bulgarian-Romanian Border

[Reuters, London, 13th] A border conflict has occurred in Southern Dobruja, causing anger in Bulgaria. It is reported that in the conflict, Romanian gendarmes killed twenty-three Bulgarians. However, the Romanian side stated that Bulgarians crossed the border to cause trouble and attacked Romanian farms. They were immediately arrested by Romanian gendarmes. However, during the escort through the forest, gunshots were suddenly heard. The gendarmes, believing they were being ambushed, immediately returned fire, resulting in the death of twenty-three Bulgarians. The Romanian Embassy in Sofia has been heavily guarded to prevent accidents.

### German-Italian Military Agreement, Term Set for Ten Years, To Be Signed on the 20th of This Month, Court Spain to Resist British Agreement

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th] According to well-informed sources here yesterday, the German-Italian military agreement may be signed on the 20th of this month.

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] "Le Matin" today published a report from Rome stating that the German-Italian military and political agreement was initiated by Hitler. It is reported that the military part of the agreement was drafted by Hitler. The agreement is for a term of ten years and can be revised after the term expires. The report stated that the military part of the agreement is as follows: (1) In the event of a European war, Germany and Italy will immediately discuss military measures. (2) The countries signing the military agreement agree to consider common interests. Once war breaks out, Germany and Italy will immediately form a military alliance and unify military actions and command. (3) Germany and Italy will cease military actions only with mutual consent. The political part is based on the principle of the German-Italian axis, but Germany added two points: (1) Each ally shall respect the friendly relations of the other party with third countries existing after the conclusion of treaties. (2) Germany and Italy will not unilaterally conclude new treaties with other countries without mutual consultation.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The "Times" correspondent in Berlin reported on Sunday that the result of the British-Turkish agreement will cause the German-Italian axis to enthusiastically court Spain. Since the end of the Spanish war, German writers have exaggerated Spain's military strength and military importance, as if Spain had already joined the German-Italian axis. However, Spain has only concluded a cultural treaty with Germany, in addition to joining the Anti-Comintern Pact. Observers here believe that Germany and Spain will soon conclude a military alliance and at the same time conclude a new trade agreement to further strengthen the economic relations between the two countries.

### Japanese Army Officials Discuss the European Situation, To Decide on Policy Soon, Hiranuma Also Reports to Diet Members

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Senior officials from the Japanese military and the General Staff held a meeting at the Ministry of the Army for two and a half hours to discuss Japan's attitude towards the European situation. Attendees included the Minister of the Army, the Vice Minister of the Army, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Nakajima, and many key members of the Ministry of the Army and the General Staff.

[Tokyo, 13th, Foreign News Agency] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma will host a banquet for members of the Diet tonight and report on the European situation. All parties attach great importance to this gathering. Well-informed sources believe that Japan's policy towards the European situation and the Far Eastern situation will be finalized tonight.

### Poland Prepares for War, Authorities Issue Statement, Resist Attempts to Seize Danzig

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 14th] Polish authorities issued a stimulating announcement stating that Polish troops are in a state of readiness, preparing to resist any attempt to seize Danzig. This warning is purely directed at the Nazi plot to instigate a "rebellion" in Danzig. Well-informed sources claim that the Polish government considers this statement necessary because the authorities have received reports that the Nazis in Danzig believe that the Polish side will not take "active actions" even when the next general vote is held in Danzig. At the same time, political observers are waiting for the demonstration march scheduled to be held in Danzig tonight, from which the general attitude of Germany can be seen.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th] Poland issued a warning stating that if Danzig attempts to join Germany, Poland will send troops. However, Nazi Party sources here indicated that the Danzig problem will be resolved soon, as the Nazi parliamentarians in Danzig stated that Danzig will issue an announcement, determined to return to Germany, and that "when the fact arrives," the Polish authorities will not take military action. It was also said that even if Poland sends troops, the 50,000 fully armed Nazi troops in Danzig can prevent the Polish troops from advancing and wait for the arrival of the German army.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 13th] According to sources here, the windows of Polish restaurants, shops, and residences in Danzig were smashed tonight. The evening newspaper criticized the Danzig Senate, stating that its attitude is close to provocative and that it has no ability to restrain the public. One newspaper said that Polish public opinion found evidence of the Danzig authorities' malice in the attitude of the Danzig Senate, and that they are trying to incite disputes between the Polish and Danzig people.

### Canada Prepares, Grand Welcome for the British Monarch, Australian Queen Encounters Fog, Delayed, Expected to Arrive in Ottawa the Day After Tomorrow

[Reuters, Ottawa, 13th] Due to the Australian Queen's delay, officials have announced that the British Monarch's visit here has been reduced from four days to three days. The British Monarch and Queen will arrive in Ottawa next Wednesday. The inter-departmental committee responsible for planning this royal tour is currently busy revising the royal tour program. It is reported that this revised new plan will be officially announced as soon as it is known when the Australian Queen will arrive in Quebec. All Canadian towns and cities have raised flags and decorations, warmly awaiting their Majesties' arrival. The destroyers "Skeena" and "Saguenay" have sailed to the mouth of the St. Lawrence Seaway, ready to receive the Australian Queen. As soon as the ship enters the St. Lawrence, their Majesties will for the first time experience the welcoming grand occasion that Canada has prepared for months. Great commemorative torches will be lit along the route. When the ship arrives at Wolf's Cove, the bells of the riverside church will ring together and salute cannons will be fired. Prime Minister King will personally board the ship to welcome them. The British Monarch and Queen will deliver their first speech when they attend the luncheon hosted by the Dominion Government at the Chateau Frontenac Hotel, which will be broadcast to all of Canada and the United States.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] A Reuters correspondent on board the Australian Queen reported today that the ship had changed course twice due to encountering icebergs. At 12:30 PM, the ship's whistle sounded three times, indicating a change of direction. After the heavy fog cleared, another iceberg was spotted, and the ship changed course again. After the fog cleared today, a large iceberg was found about a quarter of a mile from the ship. The crew was able to maintain a good spirit thanks to the Queen's cheerful demeanor. The Queen spoke to the crew about the icebergs, saying, "This situation is similar to Arctic exploration."

[Reuters, London, 14th] A Reuters correspondent on board the Australian Queen reported that another large ice floe was spotted last night, but the ship is apparently about to sail out of the iceberg area.

### British Military Aircraft, Can Produce a Thousand per Month, Will Be Able to Exceed Germany

Short Commentary

### Expanding the Production Movement

The National Production Conference, under the leadership of President Kong, opened on the 10th of this month and concluded successfully on the 13th. More than 120 officials from various ministries, representatives of institutions, and experts gathered together amidst the tragic environment after enemy planes' wanton destruction to jointly plan the ways to increase production power and complete the task of resisting Japan and building the nation. This demonstrated the spirit of great unity among agricultural workers and experts in finance and economics throughout China. The highest leader also attended and gave instructions, further inspiring the conference's spirit of strengthening unity and adhering to resistance. We would like to express our highest and warmest respect on behalf of the people.

This conference received more than 360 proposals, divided into agriculture, industry, transportation, economy, and other categories. As a result of the conference, many appropriate decisions were made, which will surely make a significant contribution to the future of resisting Japan and building the nation. The conference declaration particularly cited President Chiang's instructions: "Modern countries are based on three pillars: economy, education, and military force." "The victory or defeat of war depends on the duration of economic power and supply." It resolutely advocated: "Developing national production in conjunction with strong national military force to strive for victory in the war of resistance and establish a foundation for national construction." These are the basic principles of China's production movement and economic construction in the future, and they should also be sincerely supported by the people of the country.

What we want to express our enthusiasm and expectations here is that firstly, the government authorities and those involved in production enterprises must follow these basic principles in the future, be practical and serious, eliminate obstacles, and move forward bravely, striving to fully achieve the high goal of making production enterprises serve the persistence of long-term resistance and the establishment of a Republic of the Three Principles of the People. Secondly, in order to effectively achieve this highest goal and expand the production movement, we must not rely solely on government agencies and the power of a few capitalists and experts. The main thing is to develop the initiative and enthusiasm of the people of the country so that they can fight to the end for the great production movement, that is, to concentrate talent and concentrate manpower. Here, it depends first of all on eliminating the bureaucratic habits and malpractice of the past. We must eliminate the concepts and prejudices of parties, systems, and sectarianism, and boldly and massively promote young cadres who have a correct political understanding and fighting spirit, and who are rich in both experience and knowledge. At the same time, it is also necessary to universally and effectively grant all members engaged in expanding the production movement democratic rights, improved living conditions, and opportunities to enjoy wartime production education, political education, and collective learning.

In addition, the article "Intensify Production, Persist in Resistance" published on the editorial page of this newspaper yesterday and the day before yesterday is also a valuable reference material for those of us who are engaged in expanding the production movement in the future, and we hope that it will not be taken lightly.

### Rampant Smuggling on the Sino-British Border, Large Amounts of Defense Raw Materials Smuggled into Hong Kong, Tungsten Sand, Ramie, Scrap Copper, and Iron Reach Thousands of Tons per Month

The border between the New Territories and the British and Chinese sides has always been a haven for smuggling activities. Although it had once subsided, it has recently resurfaced and has become extremely rampant. In the past, only nighttime joint operations were carried out, but recently, they have been frequent day and night. These smugglers believe that the current situation is turbulent, that our anti-smuggling network has been torn apart by the enemy, and that the customs anti-smuggling operations are inevitably more relaxed than before. They consider this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and greatly expand their smuggling operations, especially on the water. Although the Kowloon Customs is paying special attention to anti-smuggling along the border, their efforts are difficult to extend to some sea areas due to enemy warships running rampant. They cannot help but find other ways to patrol the British waters or the Sino-British border. However, the smugglers are extremely cunning, and this method is of little effect. Therefore, they dare to smuggle openly, taking advantage of opportunities to cross over. There is nothing that can be done about them. Although the situation on land is not as bad as in Shanghai, the activities are mostly carried out at night, making it difficult to catch them. Moreover, the smugglers use their financial power to collude with others everywhere, with accomplices spread across major stations, making their information very nimble and allowing them to avoid dangers.

Smuggling is Rampant on Both Land and Sea

Investigations have revealed that the smuggling operations on land involve main figures searching for various target items in the interior, then transporting them to villages near the British border for storage. They then hire local accomplices to carry the goods by shoulder along secluded paths directly to New Territories for storage. Then they split the items into batches that are shipped to Hong Kong. During the smuggling process, they travel in groups as though they were local farmers enjoying the countryside. Several armed guards follow behind, making the organizational structure very tight. If the customs officials discover and try to arrest them, they will fire their guns to resist. The accomplices will be able to escape from the scene. This kind of event has occurred countless times along the Sino-British border. As for the maritime side, their accomplices also search for smuggled items, hire boats to carry them over. Since the start of the war, most civilian boats have not dared to travel to the interior due to enemy arson, and most merchants are also afraid to hire boats to transport goods. As a result, people in general boats have no way to make a living and have no choice but to become tools for the smugglers, taking the risk to be hired or working together to smuggle various items for export, knowingly violating the law. According to the reporter's investigation, many boats dare to engage in smuggling in the harbor.

Raw Materials Flowing In Steadily

According to those familiar with the situation, the main items smuggled into Hong Kong from the interior by smugglers are government-prohibited or controlled export defense raw materials, of which tungsten ore, ramie, scrap copper, and scrap iron are the largest. The amount of each item reaches several hundred tons per month. The amount of tungsten ore is even greater, because the price of this raw material is the highest and the profit is also the highest. Each load can earn at least fifty or sixty Hong Kong dollars. Because foreign merchants are competing to buy the raw materials, the prices only rise and never fall. Therefore, there is no need to worry about not being able to make a huge profit. Moreover, most of the above-mentioned raw materials are pre-ordered by foreign merchants once they are smuggled into Hong Kong. They are doing their best to collect as much as possible. Among the smugglers, many have close relationships with foreign merchants. Smuggling activities have been going on steadily. According to reliable statistics, an average of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 tons of tungsten sand, ramie, scrap copper, and iron are transported to Hong Kong each month. The enormity of this number can be seen from this.

### × Vessel in Port Intercepts and Searches British Ship Again; Yunnan and Kunming Vessels Searched Successively; Goods Searched and Thrown into Disarray, Hong Kong Newspapers All Tossed into the Sea

× Since invading us, [they] have constantly harassed and searched foreign merchant ships along the coast, even to the point of detaining and seizing them, showing no fear of the law. At present, this kind of evil conduct is not only continuing but intensifying. Yesterday, the Taikoo vessel "Yunnan" departed from Hong Kong for Shantou. After leaving Hong Kong and arriving at the mouth of Ma Island, it was again surrounded and intercepted by × vessels. The cargo was searched, resulting in extreme disarray. All Hong Kong newspapers on board were thrown into the sea. The shipowner immediately telegraphed a report to Hong Kong. Numerous × soldiers boarded the vessel and searched for about ten minutes before leaving resentfully. According to another source, the "Kunming" vessel, which departed from Hong Kong for Shantou the other day, was also intercepted and searched by × vessels en route, and all Hong Kong daily newspapers were also thrown into the sea.

### No More Infectious Diseases in Chaozhou and Shantou, But Ships Still Need to be Inspected Upon Arrival in Hong Kong; Third-Class Passengers Find Procedures Extremely Troublesome; Chaozhou Community Plans to Request Cancellation of This Rule Again

Last year, due to the epidemic prevailing in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, the Hong Kong government announced that third-class passengers on ships from Chaozhou and Shantou must be inspected before they could disembark. This rule has not been abolished to this day. Months ago, the chairmen of the Chaozhou Eight Districts and Jia Ying two chambers of commerce in Hong Kong visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, stating that there were indeed no infectious diseases in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, and that the inspection procedures for third-class passengers from there were extremely troublesome, requesting permission to abolish it. However, the Hong Kong government did not approve it, believing that this rule should continue to be implemented. Yesterday, a person in charge said that various Chaozhou groups in Hong Kong are now planning to jointly send a letter to the Chinese representatives in Hong Kong, asking them to forward the request to the Hong Kong government for cancellation, and at the same time, they plan to jointly visit the Secretary for Chinese Affairs.

### After the Establishment of the City Planning Board, a Decision to Divide Hong Kong and Kowloon into Zones, Designating Locations for Industry, Commerce, and Housing, and Improving Housing for Residents; The Design Committee Has Already Internally Designated Todd to Serve as Chairman

Hong Kong is small in area and densely populated. For decades, the authorities have exhausted much effort on the housing problem, but still, there has been no improvement. People of the middle and lower classes live in narrow, cramped rooms, with several family members living, sleeping, standing, and sitting within a small space. Although it is much more comfortable than those who use a space the size of a chessboard as a bedroom, Hong Kong is a modern city, and the housing problem of its residents should be vigorously improved.

Improving Residents' Housing Problems

The current issue of the Hong Kong Government Gazette publishes a draft of the City Planning Ordinance of 1939. At the next meeting of the Legislative Council, the Attorney General, Mr. Anli, will propose a first reading for its passage. It is expected that the third reading of this ordinance will pass and be implemented. After this ordinance becomes law, the first step will be to improve the housing problem of residents. The location of factories and shops, the flow of air, light, and everything else, do not meet health standards and indirectly greatly harm the welfare of residents. The authorities have attached considerable importance to this, and the problem of slums is also what the authorities are eager to solve. Previously, the only way to deal with slums was to evict the poor or burn their shacks. This kind of solution is harmful and without benefit. After the poor are evicted, they cannot but seek shelter in other remote and empty places. Advocates of forced solutions will feel like trying to burn off grass that cannot be completely eradicated by a prairie fire. Now, the authorities seem to be well aware that the previous methods could only treat the symptoms. Now, with the establishment of the City Planning Board, it is necessary to seek ways to treat the root cause, to find ways to settle these people, so that the city's appearance can be tidied up and hygiene work can proceed unimpeded.

Zoning of Hong Kong and Kowloon

According to what the reporter knows, the official and non-official members of the City Planning Board have already been internally decided. Once the ordinance is officially passed, the formal appointment will be made. The Chairman of the Municipal Health Bureau, Mr. Todd, will concurrently serve as the chairman of the committee. After the establishment of the committee, it will first conduct zoning work, designating industrial areas, commercial areas, residential areas, and areas for other uses in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is said that the industrial area will be selected at Ma Tau Kok, which is a semi-developed area with a vast area. Factories that have already been established there include a gas mask factory and a canned food factory. Nearby there are also slaughterhouses, steamships, small-scale docks, and a cement factory. After being designated as an industrial area in the future, if residents want to build houses in this area, the authorities will certainly allow it, but the environment does not seem suitable for building houses. As for residential areas, the authorities will prevent the establishment of factories in or near these areas. As for how the authorities will develop and improve the urban area, the steps cannot be known until the ordinance is passed and the City Planning Board officially starts working. In the United Kingdom and the United States, the establishment of urban improvement is the responsibility of a city planning board, and urban planning experts have emerged as a result. The City Planning Board in Hong Kong has not yet decided to hire planning experts to assist in the work, but there is no shortage of people in Hong Kong who are slightly familiar with this field. A planner from the Public Works Department has received a city planning certificate. He is currently on vacation in the United Kingdom. If it is deemed necessary to hire experts in the future, it will be decided to look for suitable candidates in the United Kingdom.

### Moving Towards a Common Goal: A Pledge from the Hong Kong Spoken Drama World

— Qi Zhuo

More than Five Hundred Drama Workers Held a Meeting at Po Hing Theatre Yesterday Morning

This is a great action under a great call.

More than forty drama groups and more than five hundred drama workers from all over Hong Kong sat silently in the middle of the Po Hing Theatre. Compared to their usual active presence on stage in makeup, their positions were exactly reversed.

The eras of China Salvation, China Art, and China Travel, the Guangdong Theatre, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association... artists all gathered together, a grand gathering. The neat uniforms and badges of China Salvation were particularly eye-catching, and many male and female friends from China Art and China Travel were also particularly noticeable.

The stage was simply but splendidly decorated. Chen Ce, Zhong Tianxin, and the presidium including Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Jinshan, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Tan Guochi, Li Hua, Lu Dun, Tang Huaiqiu, and Shi Biao Gong Jiabao sat in an arc. Tang Huaiqiu and his team members sat below.

The meeting was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. The ceremony and the oath of the National Covenant proceeded solemnly according to the order, with Jiang Ming as the master of ceremonies.

Chairman Mr. Hu Chunbing delivered the opening speech. First, he explained the meaning of spiritual mobilization, then described the era mission of drama workers, and finally earnestly encouraged everyone to use every minute and every second, every drop of blood and sweat, to contribute to the final victory of the national liberation movement. This was a manifestation of Mr. Hu's practical action, and it is known that he is a firm believer in this conviction.

Central Committee member Chen Ce extended the comparison of us × in military, political, diplomatic, economic aspects... proving that the final victory must belong to us.

Mr. Tianxin told a story: When Guangzhou was evacuated, Mr. Zhong led more than a thousand young people to work in the inland areas. There were eleven children—from nine to fifteen years old, all elementary school students from good families—who set out with the team. When they arrived in Luoding and were about to transfer to Shaoguan, because of doubts about the strength of the children, they discouraged the children from continuing the Long March. The children replied, "Chairman Chiang said that there is no distinction between north and south, east and west, and there is no distinction between men and women, old and young. Children also have children's work." The adults were deeply moved and finally let them follow. They walked for twelve days from Luoding to Shaoguan, and the children's spirits were very strong. Working in Shaoguan, they deeply moved people everywhere. How could children have such strength far surpassing adults? It was because the children's spiritual mobilization had already made a determination. The children's performance in drama was unexpectedly successful. From this, we can know the importance of spiritual mobilization and drama. Based on this concrete example, the significance of this joint drama workers' National Covenant oath is explained.

Then he said: The greatest power that changed the old appearance of the poor and remote countryside after the war of resistance was drama. Mobilizing the masses is an important condition for winning the final victory. The mobilization work is still not done enough, and it depends on the efforts of drama workers. It is very difficult to develop drama work in the inland areas. Directors, scripts... all kinds of problems arise. In Hong Kong, however, it is very convenient, and I hope everyone will provide assistance. This was a very practical speech, which was met with a warm round of applause. The photographer of China Salvation kept running around the venue, busy without end. They were preparing to bring the glory of the motherland to Nanyang to comfort the overseas Chinese.

The speeches seemed to be coming to an end, and everyone seemed reluctant to leave this unprecedented gathering. As the applause rang out, Mr. Jinshan, the head of China Salvation, began a speech that electrified the atmosphere.

"First, spiritual mobilization must be followed by unity and organization. All those who are anti-Han can unite together. Today's gathering is a representation of unity and the beginning of organization. Second, don't let today's oath become an excited farewell; it must be thoroughly persisted in. Finally, he said very earnestly: We, the friends of China Salvation, are willing to follow you and fight to the death for the War of Resistance." Sincere feelings expressed in drama are good dramas with content; expressed in speeches, they are good speeches with content.

Therefore, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's words were opened.

"What Comrade Jinshan said about unity is very important. This performance in Huanghuagang is a symbol of unity. The various drama groups are different because of their history, economy, and the personality of their leaders. Some are unexpectedly successful, some are step-by-step, some are working nervously, and some are working steadily. As long as we are moving towards the common goal of the War of Resistance and national construction, it doesn't matter if the style and methods are different. We should put ourselves in their shoes and not use excessive standards to measure everything. For example, if someone is performing a certain second-rate play in Shanghai, he has received a warning and it is not easy to continue performing. If you still criticize such a performance as not enough based on a too-high standard, wouldn't it discourage people—isolating yourself and looking down on others, what difference is there from the ivory tower of the past!

Regarding supplementing Mr. Zhong's words, Mr. Ouyang also said well:

It is very difficult to develop spoken drama in Hong Kong. We hope that everyone has a unified organization. In a public place, we can practice singing, practice rehearsing dramas, without distinguishing each other. By then, we can become a supply station in Hong Kong, supplementing the needs of directors, scripts... all kinds of needs, our drama workers will certainly be in short supply. This is the actual situation. Mr. Ouyang also said based on objective facts: Our spoken drama is already better than Japan's, and even if it is moved to Europe and the United States, it is not necessarily inferior. We must not relax our work. Drama is a collective art, and the drama movement should be a collective action.

Mr. Zhong Qinan felt compelled to stand up and say: "What is needed now is action to express ourselves, a collective action. Two-thirds of those present come from the mainland. We are comfortable here, and we must not forget the difficulties and suffering of the mainland." The atmosphere of the meeting became more and more tense. The applause seemed to mean that Gong Jiabao was being asked to speak. He also unreservedly represented China Travel and Mr. Tang Huaiqiu.

"The spirit of unity today is very moving. Under this difficult situation, I hope that one is to be united sincerely, and two is to be diligent and hardworking, to strive for the final victory." Again, there was a burst of warm applause.

Mr. Hu Chunbing finally came to a conclusion: A great task is placed before us. We must first mobilize ourselves to mobilize the masses: we need collective action to launch a living drama movement. Today is the beginning of a great task.

### Rampant Human Trafficking in Shantou ××, Mostly Targeting Refugee Women and Children; Transported to the Straits Settlements and Other Ports

During our country's War of Resistance, cities and villages were subjected to × bombings and devastation, and refugees were displaced everywhere. There are actually human traffickers taking advantage of the situation, mostly targeting the young women and men of disaster refugees who have no one to turn to, luring them abroad to the Straits Settlements, Siam, and other ports, in order to achieve their aim of trading in "piglets." These human trafficking agencies are currently very active in Hong Kong. According to yesterday's English newspaper report, the transport of young women and children between ports in southern China north of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, Siam, and other ports is constant, with children being the most numerous. The main ports for exporting "piglets" are Shantou and Xiamen, the former being the main location. The report also said that Hong Kong was the hub for this kind of trafficking last year, but after a large agency was seized and the Immigration Department took strict precautions, the trafficking hub was moved to Shantou. It is now found that each batch of "piglets" transported from Shantou to Bangkok and Singapore numbers about fifty, mostly accompanied by old women who take care of them along the way. These "piglets" are trained to answer appropriately when questioned by the authorities, and all claim to be the children or relatives of someone at the destination. The agency is still active in Hong Kong, but on a smaller scale than last year. Immigration authorities are closely monitoring it. Recently, two old women requested to go to Singapore. The women, aged about fifty-three to fifty-six, both carried young children of several months, claiming they were their descendants. Subsequently, the authorities immediately sent the children to the Po Leung Kuk, and an investigation is underway. It is suspected that the old women are managers of the human trafficking operation.

### Contributing Money and Effort: The Life Choir Performed Yesterday

— Yu Lang

In Response to the Short Clothes and Trousers Collection Campaign

Special Article in This Newspaper - "Life Choir" is an amateur singing group organized by "Life School."

They understand that in times like these, "singing for the sake of singing" is a regrettable thing: singing may be your best skill, then you should use this skill to do things that benefit the country and society; only then does your skill have value and meaning.

They have also used their choral skills to do something like this. They have participated in charity performances, done street plays, etc. However, this was the first time that a solo singing and drama recital was held at the Confucius Hall last night.

This time, they are raising money for the "Guangdong All Sectors Comforting Association" to collect short clothes and trousers to send to the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines. Their meeting method is worth introducing here: According to the announcement published in their special issue, "The proceeds from this performance will all be allocated to the Guangdong All Sectors Comforting Association. All expenses incurred due to the performance will be entirely borne by the members of the group..."

Good, good, good, giving both money and effort is a good model for disaster relief work. If everyone did it this way, the efficiency of the fundraising work would definitely double.

Although each item performed last night was a "first try," it was also very impressive. The choir was very skilled in the choral aspects. "Eight Hundred Warriors," "Grand Army March," "Manjianghong," "Final Victory is Ours," "　　　" "… Several songs were sung very well.

Wu Zixiang sang "Can't Return to My Hometown" solo. She sang very gently, and she won a warm round of applause.

There were two one-act plays in the drama performance. The first one, "Two Wounded Soldiers," wrote a story about military-civilian cooperation. It was done very standardly.

The second one, "The Signal Sounded," wrote about a father and children in a guerrilla area responding to the call to kill the ×. Although the father was injured and died in the incident, the children stepped on the glorious bloodstains of their father,　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.

"Life Choir"! Work hard, strive, and progress!

### Ladies and Celebrities Perform Charity Show to Raise Disaster Relief Funds; "Dream of the Red Chamber" is Exquisite; Introduction to the Various Protagonists in the Play (Part Two)

The protagonists of the charity performance for disaster relief, organized by the Women's War Relief Association, last night rehearsed the "Dream of the Red Chamber" scene of "Baochai Catching Butterflies." Miss Xin Muwen, one of the three outstanding tennis players from the Xin family, played Xue Baochai, with bright eyes and white teeth, dignified and elegant, and more than competent. During the rehearsal, she used her slender hands, holding a paper fan, suddenly chasing to the left, then to the right, then forward, then backward, as if there were live butterflies flying on the stage. Her posture was very lively, able to draw the audience's attention, and she is truly worthy of being a famous female athlete.

Continuing the performance of the scene "Shi Xiangyun Sleeping Drunken Among the Peonies," Miss Jian Ming, the younger sister of Hong Kong gentleman Mr. Jian Yingfu, played Shi Xiangyun, graceful and beautiful. She was graceful and charming. On that day, Baoyu invited her to a birthday wine, and Shi Xiangyun drank with particular enthusiasm, becoming very drunk, sleeping on the stone steps in the peony bushes, with peony flowers flying all around, her face and collar scattered with red fragrance. Miss Jian's performance, from being drunk to awakening, was a delightful and successful masterpiece.

In the scene "Twelve Hairpins Celebrating Birthday," the selection of actors for both the main and supporting hairpins was particularly strict. After four months of rehearsals, their artistic achievements were used to determine whether they were qualified to be selected. Among them, Miss Luo Qin Su, who played Zijuan, was petite, smart, lively, and particularly outstanding. It turns out that Miss Luo is the fifth daughter of Mr. Luo Renbo, the inspector of the Hong Kong Education Department. She is currently a graduate of the Italian Infant Hall. She is eager to learn and always wins first place in every examination. She has a deep understanding of music and dance.

### Eliminating Illiteracy, Popularizing Education: The Most Effective Tool - Dynamics of the New Script Movement - The Hong Kong New Script Society Organizes New Script Training Classes

— Huo Xi

Special: Understanding the New Script

Chinese Latinization is a phonetic script that uses Latin letters to spell Chinese; therefore, it is also called Latinized Chinese characters, or Latinization of Chinese characters, or Latinized New Script. Whether in theory or in practice, it has been proven that the new script is the most effective tool for eliminating illiteracy and popularizing education. For example, let’s take the sentence: "We are now going to study the new script." When written in the new script, it is: WOMN XIANZAI LAI IANGIU SIN MENZ. What a highly efficient method!

Based on the laws of script development, no matter which country's script, it has invariably evolved from the pictographic and ideographic stage to the phonetic stage; Chinese characters are no exception. Facts tell us that Chinese characters have long gradually departed from the pictographic and ideographic stage and entered the phonetic stage of pictophonetic characters and mutually explanatory characters.

Cai Yuanpei, Sun Ke, and more than seven hundred other people have expressed the following opinions on promoting the new script: "The most important task in the current stage of China is to popularize national self-salvation education. We must mobilize all tools to carry out this work. But when choosing tools, we must point out the great effectiveness of the new script. Script is a medium of communication. Chinese characters are like a wheelbarrow, Mandarin Romanization is like a steamboat, and the new script is like an airplane. When we take the new script's airplane to spread the education of national self-salvation, we will know that the new script not only does not hinder China's unification but also has the power to help awaken the masses and save our dying motherland." In addition, people such as Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and Chen Heqin are also pioneers in promoting the new script. This is a well-known fact to those who are slightly concerned about the cultural movement because it is the dawn of China's new culture.

Doubt and Evolution

Since the new script has such value, why do some people still doubt it?

First, they feel that it is a pity to abandon the national essence—square characters—that have been passed down for thousands of years. In fact, from the point of view of the new script, it opposes both the stubborn assertion of those who regard Chinese characters as sacred and inviolable relics that should never be changed and the overly leftist assertion of abolishing Chinese characters.

We believe that script is just a tool, and its development follows the development of society, economy, and politics. Before the creation of phonetic Chinese characters, Chinese characters were also constantly developing and changing to meet the needs of a developing and progressing society. The Latinized Chinese script and every phonetic Chinese character scheme in the past ninety years are nothing more than a form in its continued development. Chinese characters themselves have their own historical value, and there is no need to abolish them, nor will they be abolished. Even in the future when Latinized Chinese characters become popular, Chinese characters will still be learned by people as the main tool for studying ancient Chinese academic thought.

Second, there is stubborn prejudice stemming from dislike and hatred—some people think that those who advocated the new script in the past held different political views from them, and they did not understand them. Therefore, they also became suspicious and denied the cultural tools used by the other party, just as woodcuts and anthems were not seen for what they really were.

The reason why the above two kinds of doubts occur is that people have not studied in detail what the new script actually is. Society is evolving, and "facts" will force the narrow-minded to be humble: those who do not understand the new script will gradually understand it.

A Precursor to Petitioning the Government to Promulgate and Promote the New Script

In the past eight years, there has been a surge of momentum across China for promoting the new script. In Guangdong alone, the Latinization of Cantonese and the Latinization of Chaozhou dialect have both shown a breakthrough attitude. After the "August 13th Incident," Dr. Chen Heqin, director of the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and a famous Chinese educator, achieved particularly remarkable results in promoting the new script in refugee shelters. Now, new script newspapers, publications, and mass reading materials in Shanghai are springing up like mushrooms after a rain.

The Shanghai Education Society has seen remarkable results in its experiments with the new script. At the National Education Conference in Chongqing, the following proposal was made:

"Our country's script is difficult and there are many illiterate people. In the past, various methods were used to promote literacy education, but it has been proven that it is not easy to achieve results in the shortest time. If this continues, illiteracy will not be eliminated and there will be no hope of raising the cultural level. It has been found that the Latinized New Script has been promoted domestically for many years and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, experiments in refugee shelters in Shanghai have yielded very satisfactory results. Refugees who were previously illiterate were able to read after studying for one month and were able to write after studying for two months. The speed of achieving results is far better than directly teaching Chinese characters. At this time of resisting the war and building the country, it is an urgent matter to eliminate illiteracy to enhance the strength of resistance and construction."

—The future of the new script is from now on revealing its dawn.

Dynamics of the New Script Movement in Hong Kong

The Hong Kong New Script Society is an academic organization organized by well-known university professors and linguistic experts. After completing the registration procedures with the British government two months ago, its work has been carried out very actively. This newspaper's short commentary once gave it special praise.

Now, in order to step up the promotion of the new script and popularize education, the Society plans to hire two teachers first to teach in various places. However, since new script education is a pioneering undertaking in Hong Kong, it is necessary to study it first. Therefore, a new script teacher training class has been specially opened, enrolling 40 students for training. After the term expires, two qualified students will be selected first to serve as teachers, with a modest stipend of 20 yuan per month for each. The remaining outstanding students will also be hired if there is an opportunity. This is truly a new record for popular education in Hong Kong.

The regulations for the New Script Training Class organized by the Hong Kong New Script Society are as follows: (1) Name: New Script Teacher Training Class. (2) Subjects: New Script and its theory, teaching methods, etc. (3) Location: Chi Chung School, 2nd Floor, No. 7, Du Lao Zhi Road, Wan Chai. (4) Time: Classes are held every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM. (5) Term: Six weeks. (6) Qualifications: Anyone who is interested in the new script, is willing to promote the new script movement, and can speak fluent Cantonese can enroll. Those with teaching experience and those who can speak Mandarin are also welcome. (7) Limit: This class will initially enroll 40 students, limited to those who register first. For those who exceed the quota but want to learn the new script, the Society also plans to set up classes for training in preparation for future teachers. (8) Tuition: Free; Textbook fees are paid by the students (approximately 1-2 jiao). (9) Registration: Hong Kong New Script Society Life Bookstore in the Amateur Association, 4th Floor, No. 23, Gan Nui Road, Wan Chai; Chi Chung School, Wan Chai. (10) Classes begin: Scheduled to start on Monday, May 22nd at 7:00 PM.

### ×Encirclement Resembles Trapped Beasts　Reinforcements Arrive for Intense Jiangmen Battles　×Planes Bomb Various Highways Frantically, Our Positions Undamaged　Tranquility in Zhongshan County, Artillery Fire Heard in the Fifth District Late at Night

[Zhongshan Express] Jiangmen is under siege by our army. Defending the city to the death, intense battles have been raging in various locations near the city for three days. Our frontline vanguards have repeatedly approached the suburbs, and the situation is extremely favorable. Guangzhou × chieftain reportedly learned that our siege of Jiangmen was very urgent. Yesterday (the 13th), it dispatched 18 planes that flew south to bomb our army's positions along the lines of Huicheng and the Xinhe-Jiang-Fo highways. We suffered no major damage. Several hundred × cavalry and seven or eight tanks also traveled from Rongqi, Guizhou, and Jiujiang to reinforce. Fierce battles occurred between our certain female security team and the enemies in the area west of A Xin Highway and Fuzi'ao. The sounds of gunfire and artillery continued throughout the day. At the same time, fierce battles also broke out in the Zhuangtangxia area of the Jiang-Fo Highway. A certain puppet army unit of several hundred people assisted the × in stubbornly resisting. Both sides are still fighting. The × have shown signs of fatigue and are not difficult to annihilate. Because Zhongshan is near the sea, it may be threatened by the ×. However, after County Magistrate Zhang and Commander Wu (Fei) arrived in Shiqi successively to deploy defenses, our strength has greatly increased. The military and civilians are on high alert. If the × invade, they will have to pay a heavy price. Currently, there are six × warships in the waters off Sanzao Island, moored between Dagang and Tanzhou. Around 2:00 AM late at night on the 13th, artillery fire echoed from the sea in the Fifth District, likely fired by × warships chasing fishing boats.

(Xijiang Express) In the Jianghui battles downstream of the Xijiang, our army has consistently taken the initiative. After successively capturing major strongholds such as Tangxia and Huicheng, they advanced towards Jiangmen and gradually annihilated the remaining × along the Jiang-Fo and Xinhe highways. The × army occupying Jiangmen is now in a state of encirclement on all sides, desperately seeking reinforcements from various sources. According to intelligence from military authorities, the × army in Jiangmen is continuing to reinforce, attempting to defend to the death. Yesterday, the 11th, over a dozen electric boats transported approximately 2,000 × reinforcements, along with over ten tanks and over 200 cavalry, via Jiujiang. In addition, Li Daoxuan and Liang Tianlu's 300-strong puppet self-defense force, combined with the original × puppet army, totaled approximately 9,000 troops.

(Zhongshan Express) Our counterattack on the Jiangmen front is proceeding smoothly. The × on the fourth section of the Jiang-Fo Highway have now completely collapsed and retreated to areas such as Tangxia, Xinmiao, and Yutang. There are no × traces left. Currently, the × have retreated to the line of Baitu-Shuanglong below, building defensive fortifications. On the 12th, over a hundred × soldiers traveled to Licun-Shuanglong, forcibly conscripting over two hundred civilians to build trenches and erecting a pillbox at the Licun bridgehead. The × in Zhoujun, Hengjiang, Huling, and Tianhe have also fled back to Ganzhu. Only a few dozen × soldiers remain on Zhutou Mountain opposite Jiujiang, erecting military telephone lines to transmit news from Jiangdou to Jiujiang. The × in Heqing still fire artillery at the opposite bank, targeting Gulaowei and Shitou Haikou. Currently, only about a hundred people are disguising four cannons on Dagang Mountain, aiming the muzzles at Gulao, Maicun, and Wangcun, putting on a show to intimidate. It's truly pathetic.

### Ministry of Interior Memorandum to Provincial Government: Eradicate Extravagant Burial Customs: Rather Than Burying Goods, Donate Them to the Nation

(Qujiang Express) The Ministry of Interior believes that during the period of resistance against Japan, everything should be based on frugality and thrift. Extravagant spending on civilian weddings and funerals has already been strictly prohibited. Recently, it has been observed that wealthy families still engage in extravagant and wasteful practices during funeral ceremonies. These bad habits should be eradicated. Yesterday, a memorandum was specially sent to the governments of all provinces, stating, "Investigations have revealed that funerals should be based on mourning and respect, without resorting to superstition and wastefulness. Frugality rather than extravagance is a clear ancient precept. Recently, it has been observed that wealthy families often bury the deceased with extravagant ornaments, burying useful goods underground. This is extremely unwise and can easily incite thieves to covet, desecrate graves, break coffins, and expose bones in the wild, which violates the sentiment of mourning and respect and loses the original intention. These bad habits should be strictly eradicated to reverse the declining trend and correct bad customs. Furthermore, at a time when the nation is facing a severe crisis and fighting a difficult war, the government is in need of funds. If the families of the deceased can transfer their burial ornaments and donate them to the nation, it would greatly benefit the future of the war effort. Local governments should widely encourage this and strive for practical results. In addition to distributing this memorandum, we are also sending a request to investigate and instruct your subordinates to earnestly prohibit and encourage these practices."

### Beihai Import and Export Goods: Additional Taxes Collected: Appropriated for War of Resistance Expenses

(Beihai Correspondence) Beihai is an important stronghold for the War of Resistance in Southern Guangdong. National defense facilities should be prepared early. Funding for the local self-defense team's wartime preparations has also been planned separately, with donations allocated according to public debt proportions. Beihai accounts for 3,500 yuan. However, due to the frequent harassment by × planes and warships, very few people reside in Beihai, and they are unable to donate as allocated. It is proposed that 3/1000ths of the value of goods imported and exported by ships and boats in Beihai should be collected according to customs valuations, to raise 3,500 yuan in national currency for the self-defense team's wartime preparation expenses.

### Party, Government, and Military Join Forces to Form Fishing and Salt Inspection Team: Divided into Two Districts, Departing Soon

(Shantou Correspondence) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, coastal fishermen and salt producers have suffered greatly from the ravages of the ×. In order to quickly alleviate the disaster and find ways to improve the production of the fishing and salt industries and improve the lives of fishermen and salt producers, the Guangdong Party Bureau is organizing a fishing and salt inspection team. The team will consist of two or four representatives from the Fourth War Zone Commander's Office, the Provincial Party Department, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Department of Construction, the Provincial Relief Association, the Provincial Bank, and the Fisheries School. The team will conduct inspections along the coast in areas such as Chenghai, Shantou, Chaoyang, Huilai, Lufeng, Haifeng, and Huiyang, and organize and train fishermen and salt producers so that they can participate in anti-Japanese work at any time. The team has now arrived in Shantou. It is reported that the team will be divided into two districts, the Eastern Sea District and the Western Sea District. The leader of the Eastern Sea District is Liao Langru (representative of the Department of Construction), and the leader of the Western Sea District is Lin Jiemei (representative of the Department of Construction). They will depart for various locations soon to conduct inspections and report to the war zone and provincial government in order to improve the lives of fishermen and salt producers and promote wartime production.

### Leizhou Customs: Bans Export of Local Sugar: Merchants Request Reversal of Order

(Mazhang Correspondence) The Leizhou Mazhang Customs General Administration recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that Southern Road local sugar contains 3/100ths of impurities, which seriously affects the credibility of foreign trade. Its export should be prohibited. Upon receiving the order, the Customs immediately implemented it. It is found that sugarcane sugar produced in the Leizhou Peninsula is transported and sold to Hong Kong and Macau every year in large quantities. Since the outbreak of the war in Jiangmen, sales have already decreased. Now that exports have been banned, the business of general sugarcane sugar merchants has plummeted, and they are all filled with sorrow. They have raised objections and, in accordance with the wishes of various merchants, the Dabao Chamber of Commerce in the county has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting a reversal of the order.

### Executive Yuan Issues Clear Regulations: Relief Measures for Housing in the Interior: Provincial Government Orders All County and City Governments to Implement Them Effectively

### After Our Army Captured Fuhe: Zengcheng × Suffers Another Defeat: Attempt to Invade Lapu Thwarted by Our Heavy Assault

(Wengyuan Express) In the battles of Zengcheng, our army is winning steadily. The × has suffered a setback. Because we captured Fuhe, we can approach Zhongxin to the west and attack Zhucun to the east, cutting off the Guangzhou-Zengcheng highway and the ×'s return route. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing heavy troops to reinforce Zhucun and strengthen defensive fortifications, they actually sent 400 infantry and over 100 cavalry yesterday (the 10th) to invade Lapu along the eastern section of the Zengcong Highway, attempting to intercept our army after the capture of Fuhe to relieve the crisis in Zengcheng. Our army's Liang Division immediately launched a head-on assault. The × cavalry repeatedly broke through our defenses, but we dealt with them calmly. The × could not succeed. Our army at Xitan, hearing the alarm, came out diagonally from the Longzeng Highway, crossed the Zengcong Highway, and flanked the × army. The × could not hold out and quickly fled along the original route towards the Kengkou area. Our army is continuing to advance towards Xiaolou.

### Guangdong Wartime Administration Guidelines: About to Be Implemented

(Special Dispatch) The Guangdong Wartime Administration Guidelines have recently been formulated and promulgated. Chairman Li believes that most of the various plans promulgated by the government in the past have not been realized. The reasons are due to a lack of determination and a failure to implement them effectively. The impossibility of the plan's content being implemented due to environmental needs, manpower, and financial resources is also a major reason. Great importance was attached to the formulation of these guidelines. First, senior officials from the provincial government and various departments, in accordance with the intentions of the Chairman and the Department Heads, drafted an initial draft based on Guangdong's environment and financial resources. Then, they repeatedly held meetings to discuss and draft the plan. Finally, Chairman Li invited Central Committee members陸幼剛 Deng Qingyang Xi and other committee members to discuss and revise the plan item by item. Then, it was submitted to the 18th Provincial Affairs Conference in early May for approval, promulgation, and implementation. The items listed are all those that are urgently needed in Guangdong's current wartime environment and can be implemented with manpower and financial resources. It is indeed a very complete set of administration guidelines. Now, according to its nature, the responsible authorities have gathered specialized personnel to formulate implementation measures. Among them, the more difficult tasks are to complete the Baojia system throughout the province and to prohibit opium and other drugs. It has now been decided to implement them. The remaining issues will also be quickly determined with implementation methods. If the Central Government grants authority and the people unanimously support it, it will definitely be successful on schedule. It is reported that the first meeting of the Senate to be held in the coming days will discuss this plan. However, the senators believe that it is already very complete. What will be discussed is how to mobilize the people of the province to promote the implementation of this plan.

### Dynamics of × Warships in Southern Guangdong: Carrier Off Weizhou Island: Moved to Haikou Four Days Ago

(Beihai Express) Warships have been frequently sighted off the coast of Qinlian a month ago. The situation was severe. However, after our armies began to launch an offensive on Guangzhou, the ×, facing military pressure, transferred troops and ships to Guangzhou to reinforce. However, on the 3rd of this month, a × warship suddenly came to Beihai and cruised off the coast of Dianbai Liao, and then went elsewhere. Simultaneously, two × warships were also spotted on the Fangcheng side. One ship was moored off the coast of Jiangping, about 2,000 meters from the shore, and the remaining two ships were moored off the coast of Bailongwei, also about 2,000 meters from the shore. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, seven large and small × warships sailed from east to west off the coast of Haikang. Their whereabouts are unknown. Only one or two × warships are currently cruising in the Qiongzhou Strait. At 7:30 AM on the 5th of this month, a × warship moored off the coast of Sanniang Bay in Beihai sailed through the sea off Dianbai Liao and spotted a three-masted ship, which it immediately hijacked and sailed towards Yuandao. Artillery fire has been heard frequently from Qiongshan in recent days near Xuwen Gong. It is believed that the battles there are very intense. The × aircraft carrier previously moored off Weizhou Island sailed to Haikou four days ago. When the × aircraft carrier was moored near Tuanzhou, × planes flew daily over the counties of Southern Guangdong and the border areas of Guizhou and Yunnan, wreaking havoc. However, since the aircraft carrier sailed elsewhere, there have been no × planes taking off from the Weizhou area.

### General Cai Tingkai Sincere: Situation in Xijiang Stabilized

(Shengqing Special Dispatch) The war in the Youjiang and Huijiang areas of the Western Front has been at a standstill for weeks. The 16th Army Group, responsible for the military affairs of the Southern Route of the West River and the left wing, has launched a major counterattack to the front line and left by way of mobile warfare and has recaptured important military strongholds such as the old Sanshui Makou Yangmei. The × army was greatly restrained. Vice Commander-in-Chief General Cai Tingkai inspected the Xijiang line to arrange counter-attack military affairs. He has now completed the inspection and returned to a certain location. According to his conversation, the frontline soldiers are all working hard. The troops along the line are strong and coordinated with the armed forces of the people. They are confident in both offense and defense. Regarding the counter-attack, General Cai said that of course, we have to counter-attack, but it is not a matter of one side or one front. The deployment is of course subject to the highest authorities. He continued that he had previously inspected the Southern Route and inspected the Xijiang ten times. The feelings were of course different, but in general, the anti-war sentiment in various places is rising day by day, the morale is rising day by day, and the future of the war is very optimistic. Cai also said that while the soldiers in the front are fighting hard, the people in the rear must do their best to provide spiritual and material assistance. Although the fall of Guangzhou has caused a big mistake, as long as we fight hard in the front and rear, we will be able to restore the glory of Guangdong. Cai attached great importance to overseas Chinese propaganda. He said that the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for resisting the war is commendable. During the Shanghai War, we received a lot of help from overseas Chinese, and their achievements are no less than those of the frontline soldiers. However, most of the overseas Chinese are Cantonese, and it is not difficult to imagine their feelings about the fall of Guangzhou without a fight. However, I hope that overseas Chinese will not be discouraged because of this. General Yu has previously sent Chen Mai and others to Nanyang and the Americas to raise aviation donations, and has raised more than 5 million yuan in donations. However, the number has never been announced since the fall of Guangzhou. Now overseas Chinese are very concerned about this, and I have also received many letters of inquiry, hoping that the authorities can announce the number as soon as possible, so as not to affect the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in resisting the war.

### Our Tax Police Regiment: Twice Raids into Meiyang

(Xijiang Correspondence) In recent days, our army on the north bank of the Sanshui River in the Xijiang has frequently attacked the × in Yangmei Market on the Luxi Highway. On the 4th and 6th evenings, a certain unit of our tax police regiment raided Yangmei twice, annihilating many × and seizing many guns and documents. Therefore, the × in that area have been very alarmed in recent days and have repeatedly asked the × Command in Hekou for assistance. On the morning of the 9th, a unit of about 100 people from the × Takada unit moved from Zhennan Xinlu to Yangmei. After arriving, they invited all the gentry, civilians, and puppet maintenance committee members in the market to a meeting at the command, forced to participate were a total of seventy or eighty people. The × army said that the civilians who were attacked last time were suspected of colluding with the guerrillas and immediately arrested several puppet maintenance committee members and escorted them to the × Command in Southwest China for interrogation, forcing them to confess the base of our army and guerrillas," otherwise they would be charged with colluding with bandits. It is reported that several people are still being held in the southwest and have not been released. Their life and death are unknown.

Film and Drama

### Wartime Japanese Cinema

— Xin Yi

Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, their film industry has gradually declined. The recent popularity of Japanese pornographic films can be said to reflect this slump, and it sufficiently proves the failure of their wartime cultural policies. Originally, the excessive control of people's thoughts and freedom only deepens their reactionary psychology. To use art to encourage the so-called "glorious war" and thereby anesthetize the people into joining what they consider a sacred fascist group, they must first restrain the people's minds, restricting them to the narrow scope of "praising the war." This may be greatly disadvantageous to the military warlords' aggressive actions, but the Japanese people, under heavy oppression, have long seen through the warlords' deceptive tactics and are no longer willing to be driven by them, like lambs obedient to the despicable hands of the military.

Film is a reflection of society and a promotion of culture. In modern countries, it has imperceptibly become a spiritual food needed by the masses. Since the Japanese people have exposed the military's numbing propaganda and various attempts at self-interest deception, they have consciously discarded films that praise the "Imperial Army's" great virtues and depict the various aspects of the "holy war" and have had to seek their spiritual nourishment elsewhere. In this situation, pornographic films have become a deformed development. Due to the uncontrollable rise of anti-war sentiment in the country, pornographic films that cater to base tastes are showing a lively trend. We speculate that the reason for the popularity of these pornographic films is none other than to vent the public's pent-up feelings of misery, ease their conflicting thoughts, and give the public a high degree of stimulation, so that they can temporarily forget the suffering they are enduring. The further the subject matter of the films is from reality, the more advantageous the military might think it is?

An old Japanese professor said: "Cannon fire has destroyed the ivory tower." Indeed, wartime Japanese cinema will never find cultural and artistic value.

The military has noticed this. Inevitably, worries arise. Thus, after Minister of Education Araki once hosted the film industry to explain the government's newly passed law prohibiting young people from watching love films, he recently banned films depicting gambling games. This is a bit confusing to us. We don't know if the so-called gambling games films refer to war films. If they know that gambling games are inappropriate, then is their invasion of China a desperate gamble?

Because of the promotion of war films, the various contradictory forms manifested by the Japanese film industry will become increasingly obvious. Japanese culture and art are also buried in the hands of the warlords. Just by looking at the hesitation of Japanese films under the guns, one can see a glimpse of the whole picture.

Film Novel

### Husband, Wife, Friend (10)

Feeling flustered. Going on stage was too early. Once on stage, looking at the scenery and the audience, he was so frightened that he became confused. He circled on stage, and the sound he made trembled like his legs. The audience found it amusing and booed, driving him off stage. Li Ona was so scared that he couldn't stand still. When he entered the backstage, he slammed into the scenery, even knocking off his hat. Caval asked him to go on stage again, but he refused to agree no matter what. The opera ended abruptly.

He returned to the dressing room and sat silently in front of the mirror. Suddenly, he saw Tao Si coming. Tao Si was also in the audience.

Tao Si rushed out and embraced him, exclaiming, "You poor child! Those audiences are so hateful! Don't pay attention to them, my love. You and I have sung songs, but in the end, you are not a singer, and I love you." Then, she couldn't help but chuckle, "I love you even more when I saw you bump into the tree on stage."

Li Ona also laughed, "It was an interesting thing."

Tao Si laughed loudly and said, "It was so funny that I almost gave my wife to a Li Po brother."

The phone rang. He picked up the phone and jokingly said, "I am a wandering poet."

"Stop messing around. I heard you messed up an opera. Is that true?" It was Mick's voice asking.

"Exactly. I messed it up," Li Ona said.

"Congratulations," Mick said, "because we have signed a contract for a building worth one million dollars in Marseille. We have to take the train to Miami in twenty minutes——"

Before Li Ona finished the phone call, he had already put on his coat, not even bothering to take off his costume. Tao Si took off his fake beard and threw it against the wall, then called for a car.

"My love," Li Ona exclaimed, kissing her and smearing the oil paint from his face onto her cheek. He embraced her, carried her out the door, and said, "We won't do this singing thing anymore. If we sing again, I will definitely shoot us both dead!"

"Okay!" Tao Si replied resolutely. (The End)

### Yesterday's Baseball Games: South China and Youpi Both Triumph Two Games Took Four Hours and Fifteen Minutes Min Dian Nu and Western Society Both Suffered Defeats

Yesterday, two games were held in the Hong Kong Open Baseball League: (1) Min Dian Nu vs. Youpi, (2) Western Society vs. South China Society. Chinese and Western spectators were very crowded, and the shouts of encouragement echoed throughout the field, making it quite lively. The two games took a total of four hours and fifteen minutes (from 10:15 AM to 2:30 PM), which was exhausting for both the players and the recorders.

In the first battle, the foreign sailors fought against Youpi. Many expected the foreign sailors to have a strong chance of winning, but the result was the opposite. The American naval heroes, such as the giant Degilith and pitcher Lu Ailu, both performed abnormally. Therefore, in the third inning, they changed their formation, with Degilith stepping down and being replaced by Todd at first base. With this change, the situation worsened, and they were repeatedly run back to home base by Beishi, Susha, Bashi, and Li Anna, scoring four points. Although Min Dian Nu scored a home run by Tamas during the attack, sending Tali back to the base, they only scored two points, half as many as Youpi. In the fifth inning, Min Dian had no points, but Youpi's Xi Gao Li sent out a fly ball during the hit. Wei Luson did not handle it properly and missed the catch, allowing Xia Gao Li to return to home base in one breath, also scoring a home run. In the sixth inning, Min Dian Nu again failed to score. When it was Youpi's turn to attack, Susha, Ya Bashi, and Di Li Anna successively got on base, forming a "full base" advantage. When Xia Gao Li got a "triple," they all returned to base in succession, scoring three points. Xia Gao Li stole back to home base while Li Anna was hitting the ball. In this inning, Youpi scored a total of four points. In the seventh inning, Min Dian Nu's Tali hit a ground ball and sprinted to first base. Li Anna was overly anxious and threw the baseball. Li Anna at first base failed to catch it, so Tali got to first base. When Tamas hit, he also got a home run, so Tali and Tamas each scored one point. In total, Min Dian Nu scored four and Youpi scored nine. The Min team lost.

Min Dian Nu:

Pitcher: Lu Ailu, Horton; Catcher: Tamas; First Base: Degilith, Diaoli; Second Base: Zha Shi; Third Base: Horton, Lu Ailu; Shortstop: Mai Jin Ma, Diaoli; Right Fielder: Tali; Center Fielder: Wei Luson; Left Fielder: Hu Limin.

Youpi Team:

Pitcher: Xia Gao Li; Catcher: Rong Li; First Base: Di Li Anna; Second Base: Susha; Third Base: Man Xia Gao Li; Shortstop: Li Anna; Left Fielder: Beishi; Center Fielder: Ya Bashi; Right Fielder: S Li Anna.

Youpi Team 0 0 4 0 1 4 X 9

In the second battle, the Western team attacked first, but failed three times. When South China attacked, Wu Zhenbang and Tang Rongguang each scored one point, with great momentum. In the second inning, the Western team was at a loss and again ended with zero points. South China's Liang Zhuoquan first got a free base. Feng Jingxiang hit the ball skillfully and sent a long ball, running to second base. When Situ Bi hit the ball, the Western pitcher missed the catch, so Liang Zhuoquan returned to base, and Ge Xiang and Situ Bi each advanced to first base. Li Zhongshi hit a short ball, and Jingxiang sprinted to the base and succeeded, scoring one point. The Western pitcher and catcher failed to kill Jingxiang, but Li Zhongzhen successfully reached first base. Li intended to sacrifice, but was lucky to reach base safely. Then, Wu Zhenbang went up. The high ball was caught, and Rongguang struck out three times in a row. Zhu Guolun got a hit, and Situ Bi and Li Zhongzhen took the opportunity to return to base and scored one point. Bao Jiaping hit a high ball that landed near first base. Biludo missed the catch, and Jia Ping safely reached first base. Guolun stole to second base. Yu Tian got a free base, and Zhu Guolun returned to base. Bao Jiaping stole second base. Liang Zhuoquan returned to the field, taking advantage of the pitcher's "four balls" to advance to first base. When Liang was blocked, the overall situation collapsed. Later, the Western team scored three points in the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings, totaling five points, which was no match for the South China team, which scored seven points in total.

South China Society:

Pitcher: Li Zhongzhen; Catcher: Liang Zhuoquan; First Base: Chen Yutian; Second Base: Tang Rongguang; Third Base: Wu Zhenbang; Shortstop: Bao Jiaping; Left Fielder: Feng Jingxiang; Center Fielder: Zhu Guolun; Right Fielder: Situ Bi.

Western Society:

Pitcher: Daya Luweishi, Paila Ci; Catcher: Wen Dusha; First Base: Biludo, Baluoshi; Second Base: Buladu; Third Base: Paila Ci, Daya Luweishi, Biludo; Shortstop: Xiao Ya Luweishi; Left Fielder: Fei Jia Ledu; Center Fielder: Ma Kuishi; Right Fielder: Ba Weishi, Ba Ladu.

### Dai Cup Tennis Match: New Zealand Ultimately Loses to England Southern Hungary Wins a Singles Match First

[Hainan Society, London, 14th dispatch] After England won two singles matches yesterday, it entered the second week with three wins and two losses against New Zealand. In the first match, Shahqi (England) defeated Blair (New Zealand) in three straight sets with 6-3, 6-4, and 7-5. In the second match, Hall (England) also defeated Erfalai (New Zealand) with 3-0, with scores of 7-5, 6-4, and 6-4.

[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 14th dispatch] Yesterday's Dai Cup Southern vs. Hungarian singles match was delayed due to heavy rain. In the first match, Song Te'ao (Southern) narrowly defeated Gabo (Hungary) with 6-3, 0-6, 2-6, 6-1, and 6-1. The reason for Gabo's defeat was that he went all out in the first three sets and was exhausted afterward, suffering a miserable defeat. In the second match, Hungary's Boshi led with 7-5, 4-6, and 6-5, but the match was postponed due to darkness. The South team led 1-0.

### Yesterday's Basketball Games: Three Division B Games Today

Yesterday's public men's basketball games at the Youth Gym included three Division B games. However, in the Qing team vs. Huaqiao team game, the Qing team did not appear, and the referee declared that the Qing team had forfeited, making the Huaqiao team the winner. In the first game, the police faced Pei Ying. The police were not a strong team, but their fighting power was exceptionally fierce, and they were physically strong. Pei Ying was a strong team in this competition. Since the start of the competition, they have been invincible. When the two teams clashed, Pei Ying passed the ball well, and Guan Zhenbin, Chen Xiyang, and Huang Yaohua took advantage of the situation to launch surprise attacks. On the police side, Shalifu Qin Shagen, He Shouyi, Chen Guoliang, and others all made contributions. However, Pei Ying made more progress and ultimately defeated the police with 33 to 25. In the final game, Guan Dian fought Taikoo. Guan Dian was united and coordinated well. Wang Tongfu, Yu Jiaoyuan, and Yu Jinbang were all able to hit the target accurately. Taikoo's Zeng Qiliang, Zhu Fuxian, Li Guocai, Feng Ziqiang, and Guo Ying tried their best to counterattack, but the front line did not take active enough steps. Taikoo ultimately lost with 49 to 57. The results are as follows:

### Building a Common Front of Sports Friendship (1)

— Chen Suixian

Since the "May Fourth" Movement, the purpose of education has been to emphasize morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. At that time, it was deeply felt that the "emphasizing literature and neglecting martial arts" of the past imperial examination era had lost its value. Therefore, the "May Fourth" slogan loudly called for "eliminating emphasizing literature and neglecting martial arts"—this is a glorious expression of the sports promoted by the "May Fourth Movement"—but this glorious expression—has reached twenty years. The original educational purpose has been manipulated and manipulated, but there is no way to balance it—as for mass sports, it is even more out of the question.

In fact, sports and politics have a cause-and-effect relationship, and they have a closer relationship with the nature of society. In the past, Chinese athletes did not have a deep understanding of this point, or they had an understanding but did not implement it effectively, so the sports cause could not develop. It is not a phenomenon of miscarriage, it can be said that it has not conceived.

This article is to build a common front of sports friendship. As usual, with many unfamiliar sports comrades, you always have to come up with a set of cold-style polite words first, but I have not learned this set of polite words, please forgive me, sports friends. In fact, politeness is not good at all, it only helps to promote hypocrisy. We can only encourage the struggle for the real sports cause. Although we don't know each other when we meet on the street, when I write this article, I treat every reader who reads this article as my close friend, because I want to write out my enthusiasm and ideals, and tell my wishes for sports. I firmly believe that friendship built on a correct and common understanding is worthy of being promoted.

The so-called sports in our country in the past were only nominally carried out in schools. Recently, the military and police schools seem to be more active, but the sports of farmers, workers, and merchants have never been mentioned. However, the sports of schools and the sports of the military and police are completely inconsistent with the essence of sports because they do not grasp the truth of sports, because sports training in general schools emphasizes "championship" and "athlete system." Every time they win a championship or sports meeting, it seems that the sports have succeeded. After these athletes who win championships are vigorously promoted in the society, they can become an important administrative staff or coach of sports. Although there are many advanced sports comrades who strongly advocate universal sports training and implement the slogan of eliminating championship and athlete system, it is only a temporary passion. Because of the lack of publicity of "sports truth," as well as the lack of concrete actions and firm will, they are surrounded by the inherent forces of the athletes, and they have to beat their own mouths. As for military and police sports, they also value the championship principle. A well-known athlete can join the ranks of the military and police to fill a dignified military officer. This dignified military officer is not used to serve as a regular sports coach. The purpose is to win long-term championships - this is an obvious fact that no one can deny.

Therefore, the sports meetings held in various counties, provinces, and even the national sports meetings are all places for creating athletes. Only those well-known student athletes and military officers who are used to compete for championships gather to show off their skills. In the sports field, those idol-worshipping audiences cheer loudly, using entrance tickets worth a few cents or a few yuan, just to encourage them to compete for championships. They are of no benefit to themselves, but the entrance tickets are at least a few cents, so only the property class can enjoy it. The poor people outside the venue who can only hear applause, and the newspaper reporters who can be visited when the audience comes out of the venue, such sports meetings are called "promoting sports"—

However, according to the general practice of sports meetings, the four sides of the venue are inevitably pasted with glorious colorful slogans, "Implement universal sports—", "Implement sports to save the country—", "Implement national sports" and so on. But I have never seen slogans such as "Eliminate championship—", "Promote sports for farmers and workers", "Eliminate sports for gentry and merchants", "Eliminate the athlete system", etc. This kind of sports meeting that promotes sports has been going on for more than 20 years. If we are going to popularize mass sports in this way, it will be useless to extend it for decades or even hundreds of years.

Since the outbreak of the national liberation war, they still do not recognize the turning point of this great era, so the work of sports has not been coordinated with the war of resistance. We know the culture in the war of resistance. Is there any department that does not participate in this sacred national liberation struggle? National defense mass literature penetrates the countryside, national roar singing penetrates the countryside, and mass cartoons and woodcuts also penetrate the countryside...... Only the sports that have claimed to save the country for more than 20 years have not been able to come up with any facts. (To be continued)

### Philippine Miscellany

— Dongtang

Gan Wei suggested a dice game, saying that if I won, I should treat everyone. Afternoon

May 6th Market Mangoes

I woke up early and pushed the window open. Rain followed the wind. The distant mountains were shrouded in mist and rain, a natural painting. After breakfast, I braved the rain to leave Baguio and returned to Manila in the afternoon. The luggage had already been transported to the "Taiping" ship, preparing to return to Hong Kong early tomorrow morning. At five o'clock, we went to the market together to scramble to choose gifts for relatives and friends. The king of Little Luzon, visitors to this place, do not forget this special product. In the evening before returning to Hong Kong, my friends held a farewell banquet for me. After the meal, I took Yao Yishi, Mao Anxi, Mai Qijing, Bi Ziyou, and others to a late-night gambling session. I won many tickets, and Yishi lost even more. I went to the market today.

I vaguely heard the sound of calling out for pheasant, but the season was about to pass, and there were not many fine products. Strong and luxurious ones were as rare as morning stars. I had no choice but to settle for second best. After dinner, my teammates parted ways and went their separate ways, some watching movies and some going to dance halls to pass the long night. Although I boarded the ship late, I inspected each room, and nine out of ten rooms were empty. I think my friends are still immersed in the nightlife, and they are happy to return to the fields.

May 7th, 8th, 9th Return Voyage

At dawn on the 7th, the "Taiping" ship sailed north. Only a few close friends came to see me off. After lingering for ten days, I set off on my return journey again. This time, parting is difficult to predict when we will meet again. God intentionally played tricks on people. "When coming, there were waves, but when returning, there were no waves." The voyage lasted two days and nights. The weather was beautiful, and the water was calm. Those who feared the sea put their hands on their foreheads and were deeply grateful. On the ship, I was again taken care of by the enthusiastic Hua Manager Lin Chengjun. The food and drink were excellent, and there was nothing lacking. All day long, we gathered and sat in the smoking room, playing leaf cards, with drinking as the prize. The 46-hour voyage life was spent in sleep and laughter. On the morning of the 9th, I saw Hong Kong again. A tired bird returning home was still safe and sound. I saw friends gathered on the Jianggan shore to welcome me, about one hundred people. Before the ship docked, we recognized each other, competing for the strongest eyesight. When we left the ship, the teammates said goodbye one after another, looking forward to meeting again in the future. What I have said above is based solely on my personal memories. My writing skills are limited, and I don't care about the skill of the work. After tea and wine, I talk casually, with no other intention. (The End)

### After Lu Zhenxuan Published an Article Expressing His Views, It Aroused Resentment in the Basketball Community, and a Formal Letter Will Be Sent to the Federation Requesting Sanctions

On the 13th of this month, a certain newspaper published Lu Zhenxuan's "Impressions" of basketball games in "Hong Kong". The wording in the article was insulting to the Hong Kong basketball community, which aroused resentment. The Hong Kong basketball community was extremely dissatisfied with this matter, so yesterday at 1:00 PM, a meeting was held at the Si Hao Hotel, second floor. Representatives from various basketball teams attended. The chairman announced the reason for the meeting, and then began to discuss the incident of Lu Zhenxuan insulting the basketball community. Various parties expressed their opinions, all believing that Lu's actions were indeed an insult to the entire Hong Kong basketball community. It was immediately proposed: (1) Whether to take unified action to deal with Lu Zhenxuan's article, and it was resolved to take unified action; (2) To jointly send a letter requesting the Basketball Committee to impose sanctions to rectify discipline, which was passed; (3) Two committee members were publicly elected to draft the letter to the Federation. The meeting adjourned after 3:00 PM.

### After the Recovery and Prosperity of Shanghai's Trade, the Import Surplus is Alarming, with Japanese Goods Accounting for the Largest Share

Shanghai, due to its superior location and convenient transportation, has seen its industry flourish daily, becoming the trade center and economic hub of the country, and the only major port in the Far East. After the war, the center of finance and trade shifted inward, causing a period of decline, but it has now gradually recovered. However, the import surplus has increased significantly. The details are as follows:

Since the first year of the Republic of China, the total value of import and export trade has increased from 30 million yuan to over 100 million yuan, accounting for more than 50% of the total national trade. Before the eighth year of the Republic of China, imports generally accounted for 12% to 18% of the national total. From the ninth to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, this increased to over 20%. Since then, it has increased year by year, with the highest rate being 58.96% in the twenty-fifth year. From the first to the eighth year of the Republic of China, exports generally accounted for over 40%, but then decreased to around 30%. However, after the twenty-second year, it increased again to 50%.

In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, imports were 51,081,100 yuan, accounting for 53.42%, and exports were 40,467,200 yuan, accounting for 48.25%. If the August 13th Incident had not occurred, the import and export trade would have increased by another quarter, possibly setting a new record since the first year of the Republic of China. After the war, due to the inward shift of the financial and trade center, there was a period of decline, but it soon gradually recovered. For example, in the twenty-seventh year, imports were 27,489,600 yuan, accounting for 30.77%, and exports were 22,303,900 yuan, accounting for 29.20%.

Since the third quarter of last year, Shanghai's trade has gradually recovered. In the first quarter of this year, imports were 12,890,900 yuan, accounting for 46.97%, and exports were 8,133,000 yuan, accounting for 41.80%. Compared with the same quarter of last year, imports were 5,280,900 yuan, accounting for 22.95%, and exports were 3,369,800 yuan, accounting for 25.10%. The increase in import and export trade was 12,373,700 yuan, which proves that Shanghai's trade is gradually recovering.

Shanghai is a city in an occupied area, and the Jianghai Customs is under duress, having changed its flag to the "Five-Colored Flag". Tax revenue is now deposited in Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank, and the number of Japanese customs officers has increased. As a result, many orders from the Chinese government cannot be implemented by the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai. The plan to eliminate the import surplus cannot be realized by the Shanghai Customs. Although trade is gradually recovering, the import surplus continues to increase. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the import surplus was 47,578,000 yuan, an increase of 28,471,000 yuan compared to the 19,100,700 yuan in the same quarter of last year. This is something that all people in Shanghai should be ashamed of.

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Customs that since May of last year, the import of Japanese goods has ranked first in the trade of various countries with China. In the first quarter of this year, it was 71,386,000 yuan, an increase of 23,375,000 yuan compared to the second-ranked 48,013,000 yuan. The import of Japanese goods, except for the customs in North China, is mainly through the Shanghai Customs, rather than the occupied areas in the southwest. These Japanese goods are being dumped into the occupied areas. The important reason for this is that the Shanghai Customs has been seized, the tax rate has been arbitrarily modified, and Japanese goods are given various conveniences for import.

As Shanghai's trade gradually recovers, the number of foreign merchant ships coming and going has also increased, ranking first among all customs in the country. For example, in January of this year, imports and exports were 280 ships, 1,181,478 tons; in February, imports and exports were 260 ships, 1,189,993 tons; in March, imports and exports were 290 ships, 1,263,901 tons. In the first quarter of this year, there were a total of 835 ships, 3,635,372 tons. However, the ships coming and going are mostly Japanese merchant ships. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the number of Japanese merchant ships was 1,545, 2,526,287 tons, ranking first among all countries.

### It is Not Easy to Live in Shanghai; Food Prices are Soaring

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident in Shanghai, people's lives have seen a sharp increase in expenses. In addition to the sudden increase in housing and population, resulting in soaring rents, household goods have also continued to rise in price. Daily necessities such as rice, vegetables, and the "seven necessities of life: firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea" have all increased in price. For example, meat such as fresh pork and ham costs one yuan per pound; for middle ribs, one yuan can only buy four taels per catty; live chickens cost one yuan for one catty and two or three taels; fresh fish also costs three or four mao to eight or nine mao per catty. Even vegetarian foods that common people consider the cheapest, such as "bean sprouts and salted tofu", have seen prices soar due to the Japanese manipulation of raw materials such as soybeans and sesame oil. At the beginning of this spring, one yuan could buy five catties and seven or eight taels of sesame oil, but now it can only buy less than three catties. Therefore, even the cheapest foods are no longer inexpensive. The recent price increases for food are listed below:

(1) Prices at Tofu Shops [Unit: Mao]

Tofu skin per catty: 2.60; Old tofu, small block: 8.00

Tofu skin per sheet: 20 wen; Large block per block: 10.0

Thick fried dough sticks per catty: 3.00; Per piece: 100 wen

Thin fried dough sticks per catty: 3.50; Tender tofu per block: 5.00

Minimum sale: 0.30; Per piece: 20 wen

Fragrant dried tofu per piece: 0.10; Triangular fried tofu: 20 wen

Stinky dried tofu per piece: 0.10; Small piece: 15 wen

Tofu skin sheet: 0.60; Square fried tofu block: 10 wen

(2) Prices at Flour Shops [Unit: Wen]

Flour per catty: 380; Sliced noodles per catty: 300

Real flour: 640; Noodle skin per catty: 300

Small flour: 480; Flour skin per sheet: 20

Water thread flour: 140; Tofu per block: 40

(3) Most Common Vegetarian Dishes at Vegetable Markets [Unit: Mao]

Chicken feather vegetables per catty: 0.90; Yellow bean sprouts per catty: 0.80

Radish tops per catty: 0.80; Green bean sprouts per catty: 0.70

Tender goods: 1.20; Sprouted bean sprouts per catty: 0.80

Celery per bunch: 0.60; Pickled mustard greens per catty: 1.20

Small bundle: 0.50; Minimum sale: 0.20

Chives per catty: 1.40; Fresh bamboo shoots per catty: 3.20

Mustard greens: 0.60 to 1.50

Chinese cabbage per catty: 1.00; Tender spinach per catty: 2.00

Fresh broad beans: 1.00 to 1.50

To 0.80; Mugwort per catty: 0.90

Broad chard: 0.80; "X" vegetables per catty: 3.00

The prices of the above vegetarian dishes have generally increased by two-thirds compared to before the war, and some have even doubled. For example, tofu used to cost 10 wen per block, but now it costs 20 wen; dried tofu used to cost 15 wen per block, but now it costs 30 wen; pickled vegetables and bean sprouts used to cost a minimum of 40 or 50 wen, but now they cost a minimum of four or five fen in foreign currency. The hardship of the masses is all thanks to the invaders.

### This Year's Shanghai Silk Reeling Industry

The most pressing and important problem facing the Shanghai silk reeling industry is raw materials. Shanghai silk factories consume more than 150,000 dan of dried cocoons annually, according to current conditions. This year, the so-called Central China Company actually wants to ban the transport of cocoons to Shanghai, control cocoon businesses in various rural areas, and attempt to monopolize the industry. Shanghai factories are deeply concerned about this. Recently, the situation has eased slightly. Except for the towns, cocoon businesses in the surrounding rural areas are mostly controlled by guerrilla forces. If "Central China" officially goes to the countryside to purchase cocoons, it will inevitably be attacked by the guerrillas. Therefore, after deliberation by the Japanese puppet regime of "Central China", it was decided to temporarily abandon cocoon businesses outside its sphere of influence and have Chinese agents purchase cocoons in the countryside in their names, transport them to the city, and then resell them to "Central China." On the one hand, it publicly declared that Chinese cocoon merchants were allowed to freely set up businesses to purchase cocoons without hindrance. As a result, other cocoon merchants saw a great opportunity. However, it is rumored that the cocoons purchased must be divided equally with "Central China," with some saying they can be transported to Shanghai, while others say it is absolutely impossible. There are also many rumors.

Currently, there are 37 silk factories in Shanghai. If there are no real raw materials transported to Shanghai, they will inevitably be forced to suspend operations. Each factory is concerned about this, so they openly gather to discuss the issue. At this time, it is impossible to give a definite answer. If it is decided to first start renting businesses in the guerrilla area, it depends on the policy of the agents. Cocoon business owners in the countryside who understand the greater good are unwilling to be used by "Central China," so they mostly refuse to cooperate and flock to Shanghai to sign lease contracts with various factories. Both parties cooperate closely. Due to environmental reasons, there are concerns about various obstacles, so the business owners are fully responsible for all liabilities. The general contract prices on the market are listed below:

(1) The business owner is responsible for all military taxes, levies, shipping costs, staff salaries, and meals from the time of self-collection to the loading on the river steamer. The contract price per dan of dried cocoons is approximately 35 yuan to over 40 yuan.

(2) The business owner is only responsible for the cost of producing dried cocoons and drying labor. The factory is responsible for police expenses, meals, and other issues. The contract price per dan is approximately 20 yuan to over 20 yuan.

Generally speaking, merchants favor businesses in Guangyin because they are close to the Yangtze River and shipping is more convenient. Therefore, the rise and fall of contract prices depend on the current environment and are approximately three to four times higher than before the war.

In Yixing, due to the fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops, there is no certainty about the future of cocoon purchases, and the danger is greater than in other places. (Xiang)

### "Unite Sincerely to Resist Aggression to the End"

— Bing Xin

I remember very clearly that on the evening of March 27th last year, I received an express letter from Lao Xiang from Hankou, saying that the National Literary and Art Association would hold its founding conference on April 1st. He wanted me to come and attend no matter what. At that time, my excitement was truly beyond words. I felt that the literary workers who were usually ridiculed as "writers despising each other" and who had had so-called "Shanghai School" and "Beijing School" in the past could now put aside all personal prejudices and unite under the banner of resistance against aggression and national construction, taking the interests of the country and the nation as the premise. This matter was really too great and too gratifying! At that time, because I was entrusted by Madam Feng Li Dequan to raise money for the wartime children's protection society in Changsha, and the matter had not ended, I could not attend the founding conference, but my full enthusiasm and expectations for the conference were conveyed by the telegram "Unite sincerely to resist aggression to the end."

The circumstances of receiving the letter and sending the telegram are still vivid in my mind, but the relentless time has slipped away for another year.

In this year, I personally feel very ashamed. I have not made any contribution to the Literary Association. Because of my frequent illnesses and the fact that my residence is too far from the association, I often miss meetings. The Literary Association should bear considerable responsibility in this great era, but the work is not yet sufficient and is far from what everyone desires. In the future, I hope that every comrade of the Literary Association will concentrate their efforts to help the Literary Association develop the following tasks:

1. Expand the organization and strengthen the organization.

2. Connect the feelings of members and intensify the work of members.

3. Improve the leadership organs, establish branch associations in the front and rear, and establish the closest contact with the general association.

4. Establish a literary library so that members or non-members can borrow books freely.

5. Establish a youth creative guidance committee to provide opportunities for many young friends who aspire to engage in literary creation.

6. Establish a literary worker's inquiry office to be responsible for introducing new books and magazines, and the correspondence addresses of literary friends, etc.

7. Plan to print soldiers' reading materials and mass reading materials.

8. Organize front-line service groups or rear-area inspection groups to go deep into the ranks and the public to carry out propaganda. The above are a few points that I thought of in a hurry as suggestions for this conference. I hope that my dear comrades will continue to adhere to the spirit of uniting sincerely and resisting aggression to the end, and work harder for the national country!

### On the Recitation of Poetry and Recitational Poetry

— Chang Renxia

The recitational poetry movement, which arose with the songs of national salvation, has gradually attracted attention. Although recitational poetry has not yet shown much power among the masses, this movement, if it can continue to develop well, will surely achieve the results it deserves in the future. This is predictable. In order to develop this movement, to make it grow, develop, and even become healthy, we should arouse the support of the broad literary and art circles, and actually try, explore, and improve it, in order to become something that the masses are happy to accept.

Regarding the recitation of poetry, some people think that the musical component should be emphasized. However, based on the results of my personal experiments in several recitation meetings in Hankou and Guilin, it is better to say that recitational poetry focuses on the dramatic aspect rather than the musical aspect. There is a distinction between "recitation" and "singing." To "sing" poetry is to musicalize it, that is, to make it neat and rhythmic, and often to use instruments to accompany it. To perform the poem using the "singing" method. But "recitation" is another method. It does not need to have rhyme. In repeated experiments, it is unrhymed prose poetry that is easier to recite. What is necessary for recitation is the sonority of the tone and the clarity of the pronunciation. In order to convey the imagery in this poem, the reciter can add high and low accents to each sentence or word. Sadness, solemnity, joy, anger, hatred, longing, hope, fear, etc. must all be expressed in the voice. At the same time, one should use acting skills. Do not forget the posture of your body, the movements of your hands, and the expressions on your face. These must be integrated with the poem you are reciting. The valuable techniques you have gained on the stage are also best used when reciting poetry.

A few years ago, a world-renowned recitational poet from Denmark came to China and gave a large recitation in Nanjing. I went to see it. His recitation of La Fontaine's fables and many famous European poems was just like a stage performance. Perhaps many people have seen the famous films "Romeo and Juliet" and "As You Like It"? These are adaptations of Shakespeare's poetic dramas. In "Romeo and Juliet," the famous actor John Barrymore's long recitation as he walked down the stairs was excellent, with his hands and eyes working together. In "As You Like It," the leading actress, also a famous European actress, participated in the production, and the two monologues at the beginning and end were also two great recitations of poetry, beautiful and moving, which can serve as models for our recitation of poetry. Recitation leans towards the dramatic aspect and not towards the musical aspect. Recitation has its own unique points. If recitation is the same as singing, then how is it different from songs of national salvation? If you think that "any poem can be recited, so why is there only recitational poetry?" then you are not entirely correct. Take ancient Chinese poetry as an example. In regulated verse and quatrains, the focus is on the coordination of level tones and oblique tones and rhyme, which emphasizes the musical component and makes it suitable for singing. As for ancient-style poetry in five-character and seven-character lines, Du Fu often had lines with five level tones or five oblique tones, and used oblique rhymes, which was to try to break away from music and make it unsuitable for singing. By the time of Song poetry, it was common to use the method of ending with three level tones, which was also to increase the sonority of the tone when reciting. The popular drum songs in general society often have different ways of singing and speaking. The so-called speaking in drum songs is also recitation. Recitation does not need music, but it can also be accompanied by music, the purpose of which is only to help the reciter to emphasize the atmosphere, just like the music accompanying movies, which is different from the accompaniment of singing poetry.

Regarding the poetry for recitation, it is generally believed that it should be popular, mass-oriented, and colloquial. This is of course true, but what should be avoided is the use of slogans. In addition, the emptiness and abstraction of the content also become fatal flaws of recitational poetry. Poetry has its artistic techniques, and even recitational poetry is no exception. If the content is not moving, even if it is popularized, mass-oriented, and colloquial, it still cannot be welcomed by the masses. The so-called popularization, mass-orientation, and colloquialization are only conditions that enable everyone to understand, but to arouse the interest of the masses, it is not enough to only fulfill these conditions. In the current anti-Japanese war, it is easy for poets who serve the masses to achieve popularization and colloquialization, but on the one hand, those schools of poetry such as imagism, aestheticism, or the demonic school are rapidly decreasing, and on the other hand, poetry of slogans and catchphrases has suddenly become rampant and popular. Slogans and catchphrases are definitely not poetry. To string them together into poetry is to court death. The masses still need a lot of explanation for the meaning of a slogan. If you recite a string of slogans and catchphrases, the masses will look blank. We must make the external form of recitational poetry popular, and the emotions in the content even richer, and the narration even more concrete. The best poems for recitation are narrative poems. The ancients said that even old women could understand the poems of Bai Juyi, which also refers to his narrative poems. The works of Homer, the ancient bard, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, which have been handed down to this day, are all epic poems. The storytellers circulating in our villages also tell stories of heroes and upright officials. In the current struggle for national liberation, there are many heroic historical facts that can be used as themes for recitational poetry to arouse the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist enthusiasm of the whole people and jointly embark on the camp of resistance.

Lyric poems are not suitable for recitation. Small lyrics can only be recited in a low voice. Some are simply only suitable for reading and conveying emotions through vision. The so-called sensory school of poetry is this kind. Don't recite what cannot be recited. Even if it is recited, the masses will not have the leisure to enjoy it. We must study the customs, habits, living conditions, and underlying suffering of the masses in order to serve the masses, and use these as the scope of our creation. The upright officials and heroes that the storytellers of the past talked about relieved the suffering of the people and helped the poor and needy. This was precisely a kind of dream of the people under the oppression of feudal forces, so it was welcomed by the broad masses. Stories like the Sword Pavilion Song and Daiyu's Autumn Sadness are just diversions for the leisure class after they are full. The masses do not have this kind of sentimental interest. Literary and art workers who are engaged in the task of resistance cannot recite things that are unrelated to the anti-Japanese war.

Recitational poetry is a new movement. We should hold more recitational meetings. Only through practices can we discover our mistakes and stabilize our foundation. First conduct small-scale experiments, and then go to the streets, go to the countryside, go to the factories, go to the troops, go to all kinds of different mass groups. This is how the positive effect of recitational poetry is brought into play.

In order to support this movement, we hope to conduct continuous exploration and continuous experimentation on the creation of "recitational poetry" and the methods of "the recitation of poetry." (End)

### Current Cartoons

— He Chengjiang

Painting is a branch of noble art. Art for national defense, art for the war of resistance. Therefore, drawings should also coordinate with the war of resistance to create propaganda. However, painters are, after all, artists, lofty scholars in ivory towers. Therefore, some painters cover their ears and close their eyes, entrusting their emotions to high mountains and flowing water, flowers, and birds. However, we cannot ignore a group of young cartoonists who are using art, valuing reality, and observing reality. They express all contradictions, all darkness, and all injustices through the coating of art, using light and color, and background to give full play to their mission to resist the war.

Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, I personally have visited two exhibitions of cartoons about the War of Resistance. The first time was at the Guangzhou Changdi Youth Association last spring. The second time was this Chinese Cartoon Exhibition at the Central Theater!

In this Chinese Cartoon Exhibition, there are dozens of cartoons, all the works of famous artists, fully expressing the greatness, sacredness, and bravery of the War of Resistance. It should be meaningful to promote the War of Resistance and to create art for national defense! Ding Tingjun's "Mom" shows the tragic fate encountered by children. The picture shows a child crying at his mother who was crushed to death in a bombed house. This is a very profound work, with excellent light and color. Mr. Ye Qianyu's "Peace Bait" fully shows us not to fall for the enemy's peace tricks. We know that compromise is death. Xu Ruzheng’s "When I Grow Up, I Will Be a Soldier Too," Chen Yanqiao’s "     ," and "          " are all very good. Besides, they are all quite decent. They are all meaningful works, which cannot be compared with the beautiful landscapes, flowers, and birds by elegant scholars and poets. However, in these works,      , there is a lot of praise for the bravery of the soldiers, praise for the cooperation between the military and the people, and affirmation of the victory of the War of Resistance. However, the dark side of politics, the fate of traitors, and the corruption of township and county chiefs have not been satirized, attacked, or admonished. In the current cartoons, the mission of resisting the war propaganda is of great importance, and it is more effective than other literary propaganda. With intricate lines, combined with light and shadow, and color, a successful work can truly control people's emotions, and it can be understood by illiterate people.

Chinese cartoonists and woodcut artists, rise up! Face reality, face the invaders, and use artistic eyes to

praise the War of Resistance and express the bravery of soldiers and the cooperation between the military and the people. Only with the cooperation between the military and the people can there be a reliable backing and great strength. However, the profound meaning of the implication and the beauty of the composition depend on the efforts of the cartoonists!

Work hard! Step up! For the sacred nation     , promote to the whole country, the whole world, and all mankind! Cartoonists, do not forget the important responsibilities at hand! Youqiu

### Introduction to "Captain of the Marauders," a Collective Creation

— Youqiu

The three-act play "Captain of the Marauders" is one of the collective creations of the "   Art" drama department and can be said to be a great achievement of wartime drama. Its outline is as follows:

Yuan Zhankui, the platoon leader of a machine gun company, led his men to leave the team. He wanted to live a life of marauders but merged with a folk guerrilla team, and Yuan became the team leader. But Yuan himself was a man with the consciousness of marauders and bandits, so he let his subordinates harass the common people, rob them of their belongings, and thought that this should be the case, because the guerrillas were risking their lives for the common people, and the common people should obey everything and not be allowed to speak. Xu Zhanru, the original leader of the guerrilla team, is now the political instructor of the team.   He carries out political work among the people, but it is constantly sabotaged by them. The people treat his words as empty words. But he continues to work tirelessly and believes that these saboteurs will be educated and changed in action. Because the discipline is not strict     , traitors mixed into the team. Captain Yuan was also bewitched by Da Yun and Yao Ersao and threw himself into the arms of the traitors. They all regarded Xu Zhanru as a thorn in their side, plotted to drive him away, and arranged a situation of traitorous violence  , wanting Captain Yuan to lead the troops to a place close to the enemy, planning to surrender to the enemy with both men and guns. However, this plan was obstructed by the strength of the masses, making it impossible for them to proceed smoothly. Instead, in the actions of retreat and defense, Xu Zhanru was able to develop his abilities and pull back several of Captain Yuan's men, who became awakened. After the plan failed, the traitors revealed themselves, Da Yun was executed, and the   captain was also sentenced to death in the roar of the masses. The guerrilla team has become a conscious battle line, a real force of the people, and an iron tributary to resist the enemy.

Here, the growth process of the guerrilla team is the theme. It gives us the true face of guerrilla warfare. The collection of folk guerrilla teams is certainly unsatisfactory in the initial stage. But the implementation of political work and the re-education of members in action will turn the team into a solid one. Guerrilla teams are often imagined and mythologized, which is wrong. Here is the answer. The guerrilla teams are slandered as marauders by Wang Jingwei and others. This is to exaggerate the shortcomings and regard them as unchangeable. This answers this question and uses images to indicate the process of the consolidation of the guerrilla teams and its inevitability, which is enough to smash the slanders of the traitors! Therefore, the play "Captain of the Marauders" has educational significance for the people in the rear.

Furthermore, it can express the shortcomings of the guerrillas and their overcoming in a typical and graphic way, explaining the importance and arduousness of political work, and that it can only be successful with the support of an indomitable spirit, but it also shows that every seed sown by political work will germinate, and constant effort is nourishing water. Therefore, the play "Captain of the Marauders" has a major educational significance for guerrilla warriors and political workers.

The typical creation is very successful.    It does not dazzle people with the increasingly powerful   , but only uses living people to grab the audience. The characters all have personalities, and there is no formulaic stereotype, which is the  basis for the success of the technique.

Besparov said, "When a certain huge problem is solved in the image, the image has a huge educational significance." It is very appropriate to use this to explain the value of "Captain of the Marauders."
