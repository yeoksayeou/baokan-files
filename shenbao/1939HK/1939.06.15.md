### General Yan Xishan: Consolidating Mass Organizations to Lay the Foundation for Victory

(I) New Tasks Under the New Situation

The War of Resistance has now entered a new phase. The main characteristics of this new phase of the War of Resistance are: First, the attacking power of the Japanese has not yet been lost, and the Japanese's attacking attempts have not yet stopped. However, due to the improvement of our strategic and tactical methods and the huge consumption of Japanese troops and materials, as well as the increasing dispersal of their forces, the attacking power of the Japanese is gradually increasing with new difficulties, and it is gradually shifting from strategic offensive to strategic conservatism. Whether this possibility can be quickly realized, of course, depends on the degree of our efforts. Second, although our country has lost more land and increased more difficulties, in the national revolutionary war, it has removed many obstacles to the vitality of the nation, cultivated new revolutionary forces, created some conditions for the victory of the War of Resistance, and laid a preliminary foundation for the emerging country; however, it is still not enough. Although there are conditions, they are not perfect, and although there is a foundation, it is not solid. Although the new revolutionary forces have grown, they cannot be refined. Third, as the Japanese's offensive becomes increasingly difficult, they will inevitably turn to suppressing the anti-Japanese forces in their rear to consolidate their occupied areas. In this way, the anti-Japanese forces fighting in the Japanese rear will suffer more difficulties. This is the new situation of our War of Resistance.

General Yan Xishan: Consolidating Mass Organizations to Lay the Foundation for Victory

What is the development prospect of this new situation of the War of Resistance? I believe that the most likely prospect is: First, although the Japanese attempt to continue to penetrate deeper, in the course of the war, the Japanese will gradually turn from strong to weak, and we will gradually turn from weak to strong, forcing the Japanese to stop their offensive and turn to a conservative state. Second, our country's new revolutionary forces will become more refined, the conditions for the victory of the War of Resistance will become more perfect, and the foundation of the emerging country will become more solid. In short, the time for the success of the national revolution is getting closer. Third, the Japanese will do their best to attack the anti-Japanese forces in their rear. However, the anti-Japanese forces fighting in the Japanese rear will become more united, more consolidated, more developed, and stronger, creating powerful conditions for the future recovery of lost territories. However, this bright future can only be achieved through the efforts of our people across the country. Otherwise, it may also lead to the most difficult and worst path, delaying the progress of the national revolution's victory.

How can we strive for the bright future mentioned above? For the whole country, we should, on the one hand, launch a full-scale War of Resistance, stop the Japanese's continued offensive, and embark on the path of turning defense into offense and turning defeat into victory. On the other hand, we should strengthen domestic unity, continue to reform politics, accelerate economic construction, mobilize the whole people to participate in the cause of the War of Resistance and national construction, create a large number of modernized new armies with a foundation, and finally launch a counter-offensive to recover lost territories. For the Second War Zone, we should establish a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area nationwide as a fortress in North China and a fortress for the whole country, fulfilling a part of our responsibility to the country and the nation. To achieve this, I believe that we must establish a modernized iron army with 300,000 troops with a foundation and consolidate a million mass organizations. This is our new task under the new situation.

(II) Establishing a Sound and Consolidated Guerrilla Base Area and Consolidating Mass Organizations

As mentioned above, establishing a modernized iron army with a foundation and consolidating mass organizations are the two major foundations for establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. I don't want to say much about the issue of establishing an iron army here, and I will discuss it in another article in the future. Here, I want to briefly discuss the issue of establishing a guerrilla base area and consolidating mass organizations.

I believe that it is impossible to establish a guerrilla base area without the masses. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires establishing a modernized iron army with a foundation, but without the participation and replenishment of the masses, without the masses to help the army fight, the iron army cannot exert its power. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires a consolidated and progressive regime, but without the masses to maintain the regime and promote the regime, our regime will collapse. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires economic construction, but without the participation and support of the masses, economic construction will fail. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires eliminating internal traitors and preventing foreign traitors, but without the masses to patrol and report, the work of eliminating traitors cannot be carried out effectively. Even if it is carried out reluctantly, it will be twice the effort with half the results. From this, it can be seen that the masses are an important condition for establishing a guerrilla base area.

But I want to further point out that in order to enable the masses to participate and help the army, maintain and promote the regime, participate and support economic construction, and carry out the work of eliminating traitors, it is impossible not to organize the masses. Therefore, we say that establishing a guerrilla base area not only requires the masses, but also requires organized masses.

As early as during the War of Resistance in Suiyuan, I put forward the slogan of organizing a million masses, advocating the extensive organization of the masses under a unified will to concentrate manpower and assume the mission of national revolution. In the past two years, although Shanxi's mass organizations have made some achievements, the foundation is still too weak and not solid enough.

Today's War of Resistance situation urgently requires us to establish a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area, and this major task of establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area urgently requires us to have a consolidated and extensive mass organization. It cannot be denied that the consolidation of Shanxi's mass organization today is not enough to meet the needs of establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. Therefore, I put forward the slogan of consolidating a million mass organizations today.

In short, establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area and consolidating mass organizations are inseparable. Consolidating mass organizations is a basic condition for establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. Without consolidating mass organizations, establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area is empty talk.

(III) Review of Shanxi's Mass Organizations in the Past Two Years

I believe that the development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years can be divided into three stages. The period from the establishment of the Public Sacrifice Society to the fall of Taiyuan is one stage. In this stage, Shanxi's mass organizations were universally established. From the village administration assistants and special commissioners who successively went to the countryside to work, the masses who were previously ignorant began to wake up. Shanxi's masses went from a state of not caring about national affairs to a state of enthusiastically participating in the Public Sacrifice Society. This is the first development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years. The period from the fall of Taiyuan to the fall of Linfen is another stage. In this stage, many new mass salvation groups were universally established in various places, such as the Peasant Salvation Association, the Worker Salvation Association, the Youth Salvation Association, the Children's Salvation Association, and the Women's Salvation Association. These mass salvation groups played a great role in promoting and supporting Shanxi's War of Resistance. The organization of the Self-Defense Force has also become more壮大了and more enriched. On the basis of the Public Sacrifice Society, a political mass salvation group, more various mass salvation groups were organized according to the different interests and characteristics of the masses. This is the second development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years. The period from the fall of Linfen to the present is another stage. In this stage, all kinds of mass salvation groups formally joined the Public Sacrifice Society and became members of the Public Sacrifice Society. At the same time, various mass salvation groups have also established their own senior leadership organs one after another. Shanxi's mass organizations, whether in politics or organization, have gradually moved from a relatively chaotic and scattered state to a relatively orderly and unified state. This is the third development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years. The third stage is not yet over and is still continuing to develop.

From what has been said above, the development and progress of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years has been quite rapid. In the past two years, in terms of quantity, Shanxi's mass organizations have reached a million masses or even exceeded a million. In terms of quality, Shanxi's masses have progressed from ignorance to awareness, and from awareness to the ability to take action in part.

Here I want to briefly explain that the main reason why Shanxi's mass organizations have been able to develop and progress like this in the past two years is because they have the following advantages: First, the various mass salvation groups in Shanxi in the past two years have grown and become stronger in the battle with the Japanese. Therefore, it is full of combat effectiveness. Second, they are all democratic and centralized organizations. Third, their organizational work can generally be linked to the actual life of the masses. Fourth, their relationship with the government is generally very good.

But I want to solemnly point out that although the development and progress of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years has been very fast, its weaknesses are also very big and very many.

The first major weakness of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years is the lack of in-depth and practical political mobilization and organizational work. The lack of in-depth and practical political mobilization makes the organizational work only have a framework and lack strength. The lack of in-depth and practical organizational work makes the political mobilization only have slogans and lack content. These two weaknesses work together, resulting in a huge weakness, that is, political weakness and organizational fragility. This is a huge crisis for Shanxi's mass organizations.

The second major weakness of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years is the disorganization and weakness of organizational leadership. Various mass salvation groups have not established their respective highest leadership organs in a relatively long period of time (although the General Labor Union has recently resumed work and the Provincial Peasant Salvation Association is being prepared, they have not yet embarked on the path of unified leadership and still need to continue to work hard). This inevitably hinders the unity and strengthening of the leadership of the mass organizations, and also hinders the greater development of the mass organizations.

The second major weakness of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years is the lack of selection, cultivation, and training of cadres, especially local cadres. In the past two years, although a lot of new mass movement cadres have been produced, they are far behind the actual needs, especially the local cadres are too few. In this way, it is not easy to quickly organize many of the masses who have not yet been organized. Even for the masses who have already been organized, it is impossible to grasp them and use them. The combination of these three major weaknesses has formed a major problem for Shanxi's mass organizations at present, that is, more in name than in reality, and outwardly strong but inwardly weak. In other words, it is not consolidated. If this major problem cannot be overcome in the future, Shanxi's mass organizations will not only fail to develop and progress rapidly, but will gradually weaken and decline.

(IV) Basic Principles for Consolidating a Million Mass Organizations

I have already said before that in order to establish a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area, we must quickly consolidate the mass organizations. After reviewing Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years, we found that the biggest problem of Shanxi's mass organizations is that they are not consolidated. In this way, the task of consolidating a million mass organizations cannot but become very important and urgent.

I believe that in order to consolidate a million mass organizations, we must first determine the following general principles:

First, consolidating a million mass organizations should be aimed at establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. All work should be done in this direction.

### The Current State of Education in the Yao Mountains of Guangxi

— Bai Xue

(Guilin Correspondence) Recently, I had the opportunity to enter the Yao areas of Guiping and Xiang counties in Guangxi and visit a dozen or so national elementary schools established in the "Special Education Zone." It would be impossible to represent Guangxi's implementation of minority education with just such a narrow area and such a small number of schools. However, the number of problems found in these schools is enough to make people think deeply and provides valuable research material.

Guangxi's overall plan requires that any county that has Miao or Yao mountain areas must designate these minority residential areas as "Special Education Zones." The county government, based on local topography, transportation, population, and school-age children, delineates school zones, draws maps, and provides explanations, which are then submitted to the Provincial Department of Education for approval before schools can be established. In the first two years after the school is established, if the county funds are insufficient, the county can also submit a request to the Department of Education for subsidies based on the circumstances. It is said that this plan has not changed from the 23rd year of the Republic to the present, and the number of schools subsidized by the province has reached more than 540, which shows how actively the Guangxi authorities are promoting the education of ethnic minorities.

However, because the plan to train Miao and Yao children and send them back to their original places to run education is progressing very slowly, most of the educators in the special education zone are still Han Chinese. Therefore, there are more and more complex problems.

First, they are not familiar with the life of the Yao mountains. Once they run into the deep mountains and valleys, they naturally cannot get used to living there. Therefore, the teachers have to go out of the mountains at least once a month and stay for eight to ten days or even twenty days. According to the author's visit to the mountains, I have been to nine schools, and only two schools' teachers were seen because we asked them to be guides and they led us in from outside the mountains. The other six schools did not even see the shadows of the teachers. According to the local Yao people, "They went out of the mountains!"

Second, because the life of the Yao mountains is very boring in the eyes of outsiders, at a time when there is a shortage of cadres everywhere, it cannot be said that there are no teachers who are more knowledgeable in the mountains; but it cannot be said that there are no people who are just making up the numbers. In the winter of the year before last, the author met a principal (and teacher) in the Yao mountains. He wrote a "limit document" (a note limiting the time to pay money) for the Yao people, about sixty words. I read it several times and could not even figure out the general meaning. Later, I asked the Yao people who showed me the note, and he told me the general meaning of the document, and I knew what was going on. But the author's visit to the mountains this time found that the teacher was still teaching in the Yao mountains, which is really lamentable!

Third, there is also a need for improvement in teaching. For example, in the southeast of Xiang County, although there are schools, there are very few students, some with only five or six students, and they cannot come to school every day. This is the case in Liuxiang and Huashan villages. In addition, in some places, Yao children are willing to go to school, but because the teachers are not suitable, there are students at school, but no teachers to teach, such as Shang Guchen and Xia Guchen villages. As for what to teach? Apart from asking students to recite a few sentences from the textbook, there are few opportunities to write.

Fourth, the school equipment should be as complete as possible. In the southeast of Xiang County, except for the Liuxiang village where the township office is located, which has a school building that can accommodate ten or so students, there are no school buildings in other villages. And the folk houses used are pitifully narrow. Even if there is a room, there are no tables and chairs inside. Apart from a small square blackboard, you can't see anything else. It is said that the provincial subsidy is mostly used for school equipment. I hope it will be purchased immediately. In the Yao mountains of Guiping, most of the places where schools have been established have a school building, and there are already desks, chairs, blackboards, and other items. However, when it comes to equipment, there is also a need for improvement.

Fifth, in addition to teaching students to read textbooks, teachers generally do not pay attention to the lives of the Yao people. For example, when infectious diseases are prevalent in the Yao mountains, causing many people to be sick, the teachers are helpless. If they can use medicine to treat the Yao people's suffering, not only will the teacher be immediately respected by the Yao people, but wouldn't it be a great opportunity to start improving the sanitation of the Yao village?

Sixth, the Yao mountains are always in the remote areas of the county, and Yao education is not regarded as different from general basic education, or it is thought that the education in the Yao mountains can be run as well as the education outside the mountains. In fact, this view is wrong. Obviously, up to now, the situation of Yao mountain society and non-Yao mountain society is fundamentally different. How can we regard them as the same? To force them to have the same facilities will result in neither black nor white, but will hinder the progress of special education. In addition, some people are too pessimistic about Yao education, thinking that it will not be done well anyway, so why bother. The government wants the county to do special education, and the county government just wants to do it and be done with it. They have no time to ask about all the problems that occur during the implementation of special education.

In summary, some people may blame the author for being too demanding. The author is very clear that Yao mountain education has only been run for a short history of four years, so naturally there are still many places that are not done well enough. I am writing this in the hope that everyone can strive for improvement. Here are my personal opinions for your reference:

First, the county government must understand the provincial government's painstaking efforts to develop the education of ethnic minorities. Within the scope of possibility, it should list more construction funds for the Yao mountains in the county budget, especially education funds. In particular, ethnic equality and nationalism must be promoted as much as possible to eliminate the centuries-old isolation between the Han and ethnic minorities.

Second, the provincial government should immediately proceed with selecting and training minority children so that the overall plan can be easily completed. When it is still necessary to borrow talent from the Han, the candidates must be carefully selected. They must not only be knowledgeable but also have a creative spirit. They must not only have a passion for work but also be able to endure hardship. They must not only have the ability to teach but also have a plan and steps to transform Yao society. On the other hand, within the scope of the county's finances, the salaries of these teachers who are responsible for special education should be increased so that they can solve the minimum level of life and be able to serve with peace of mind.

Third, the teachers who are sent to work in the Yao mountains and Miao caves should preferably use examination methods to select outstanding individuals and concentrate on short-term training. In the training, not only should we focus on education, but also on politics. Moreover, we must go to the mountains to actually investigate the situation of Yao society and bring the problems found in the mountains back to the classroom to study and seek solutions. After the training is over, there must be a special education research association. In the future, when they go to work in the mountains, they will be scattered, but they must also have a contact. Every few months, members must gather again to report on their work experience and discuss problems that they cannot solve individually. In this way, not only can the loneliness of those who are educated in the mountains be reduced, but also new vitality can be added, so that everyone will not dare to slack off in their work, and there will be ways to seek solutions to problems.

### The Yi Affairs of Ning Province, Xikang, Deserve Serious Attention

(Kangding Correspondence) The nationalities in Kang and Lian provinces are very complex. The people in the Kang area are more pure because they worship Buddhism, and government decrees can still be implemented. However, the savage Yi people of Ning province are extremely fierce and difficult to govern. According to the research of various Chinese historians and overseas scholars such as Stevenson and Boughton, it is still uncertain what the origin of the Yi people is. It is believed that the theory that they are an inherent Chinese nation is correct. The Yi people take the Liang Mountains as the center and are distributed along the Jinsha River and Dadu River, as well as in more than ten counties in Leima Ping'e and Ning province. They all have their strong forces. It is generally estimated that there are no less than a million people who are hot-blooded, white, and black. Because the people are fierce and unruly, the rulers in the past have always regarded them as people outside the law. According to historical records, since the Shu kingdom drove out the Man people, the Yi people have been regarded as a major problem for the country in all dynasties. Some used force to conquer them, some used education to subdue them, some divided land to guard them, and some awarded titles to pacify them. All of them implemented the policy of suppression and appeasement. However, the Yi people were cunning and treacherous, and their rebellions were constant, so they were never able to make them submit and return with joy. Moreover, their strength grew and spread. The incidents of attacking cities and looting towns, robbing and killing merchants, and driving out Han people to occupy land increased with the times. In the past, even with the rich financial resources and strong military force of Sichuan province, it was still felt to be thorny and unable to achieve the effect of suppression and appeasement. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. In the past, although garrisons were set up to prevent them from invading, hoping for temporary peace, there was never active assimilation, making a once and for all plan, so that the country has more than a million simple, brave, and strong Yi people, but it cannot use them. On the contrary, because of their kidnapping, not only are the Han people uneasy, but also the local resources cannot be developed, which is lamentable. After the Xikang Provincial Government took over Ning province, in view of the mistakes of the past passive policy, it should be corrected urgently. During the current period of full-scale War of Resistance, in order to meet the needs of rear area construction, a proactive policy was adopted, and it was decided to completely assimilate the Yi people and completely establish governance in the Yi area. The steps to be taken are to first send capable soldiers to conquer the stubborn and murderous savage Yi people to establish prestige, and then use political power to gradually influence the savage Yi people of Ning province. Since Deng Xiuting, the commander of the Border Pacification Command, led his troops to suppress the Yi bandits around Xichang to Ningnan, they have gradually been wiped out. The remaining Yi bandits have surrendered and are willing to sit as hostages to show their faith. According to recent Ningfang intelligence, the Xining Avenue has been completely cleared. It is heard that Liu Wenhui, the chairman of the Provincial Government, plans to inspect Ning province in the near future to guide the assimilation of the Yi people in the area and promote the establishment of governance in the Yi area. The reporter recently visited the Provincial Government and interviewed Liu to inquire about the implementation guidelines and methods for Yi affairs. Liu said that there are more than a million Yi people in Ning province. They have no religion, no writing, and their actions are no different from animals. They have been a problem for the border for a long time. Since the implementation of both suppression and appeasement, the Xining Avenue has recently been completely cleared, and the suppression is now advancing towards the Huili area. Once the Xihui Road is open, we will seek to open the Yuejun Road. In the future, we plan to gradually change the Yi areas of Huili, Yanyuan, and Yanbian into governance. Because the area is very large, more than a dozen counties can be established. For handling Yi affairs, we focus on politics. The newly organized Xikang Ning Province Reclamation Committee is now an important political organization. As for Liu's inspection trip to Ning province, he plans to first go to Hanyuanchang to preside over the unity of protection and training of cadres training class. The training matters are scheduled for a period of one month, and then he will go directly to Xichang to inspect the counties in Ning province and supervise Yi affairs and reclamation matters.

### Reporter Li Zhuang of the People's Revolutionary Society: Please Look at Today's Beiping and Tianjin - Darkness and Light Intertwined

I. Transportation Controlled by × People

(Hebei North Communication) From Xietai (Shunde) to Tianjin, before the incident, it was only a two-day train journey, but now it takes at least four or five days. The railway tracks are often destroyed by our guerrillas, so repairing the road is necessary while driving the train. Sometimes, when a larger railway bridge is destroyed, it might take as long as ten days or half a month.

These are truly unbearable four or five days! Traitors and × troops can accuse you of being suspicious at any time. In other words, there is always the danger of being arrested. Train derailments or attacks are commonplace, and ordinary people on the train are often implicated by the × troops on board.

If you want to go out, you must first obtain the qualification to go out, a "Good Citizen Certificate," a certificate from the pseudo-county government, and guarantees from two shops.

After getting on the train, you have to go through very strict inspections on the train. Whether it's luggage or suitcases, everything has to be opened to check for contraband. When the police—Chinese—inspect—if there are no Japanese soldiers present, they often do it perfunctorily. When there is an opportunity, they often complain to the people being inspected: There's no way, we are all Chinese, who would willingly be a traitor? But they force you to the point where you have no choice, you can't even run away. The conclusion is often exciting! Don't rush, wait and see, when there's a chance, I'll show them!

If you are unlucky enough to encounter a plainclothes traitor inspecting, then you are extremely unlucky. Most of them wear long robes and top hats, with bayonets in their hands, and are often followed by fully armed Japanese soldiers. If they don't like the look of you, they will search everything, even your crotch or socks. When opening boxes and unpacking luggage, if they think you are "too slow!" they will unceremoniously use their bayonets to open them for you.

When Chinese people board the train, they must line up in an orderly manner, supposedly to prevent chaos. Of course, the Japanese have the priority to board the train first, followed by the Koreans, and finally the Chinese. And they must proceed in an orderly single file. If the Japanese don't have seats, the Chinese must immediately give up their seats to them, otherwise, they risk getting slapped in the face.

At the front and back of each passenger train, there are two armored cars each, and in front of the two armored cars in the front, there are also three or four troop cars with Japanese soldiers sitting on them. Their mission, it is said, is to guard against bandits on the one hand, and to boast about the large number of the "Imperial Army" and demonstrate to the people on the other. In reality, it's always the same few people going back and forth. On the same train, for example, running from Shijiazhuang to Beiping, and then from Beiping to Shijiazhuang, only when they are killed by our guerrillas will there be new replacements.

Each station has three or four cannons and blockhouses, and Japanese guard soldiers are stationed there regularly, ranging from four or five hundred at large stations to two or three hundred at small stations. Next to each railway bridge, there are two cannons and a fort, and several Japanese soldiers are usually stationed there.

Even so, it still cannot prevent our guerrillas from regularly removing rails and planting landmines because as soon as night falls, they lie in ambush in the bunkers like corpses, and even if they discover someone destroying the rails, they dare not come out easily. From Xingtai to Tianjin, on average, a train derails at least three or four times every few dozen days.

Chinese people are not allowed to carry more than one hundred yuan of legal tender when going out. If you want to carry more, you can only exchange the legal tender for counterfeit currency issued by the United Reserve Bank. Otherwise, you will be suspected of being a "bandit" and will be arrested. Once, a merchant in Shijiazhuang risked carrying one thousand three hundred yuan of legal tender, but unfortunately, he was searched by a traitor. So the traitor said to him: "You are too daring, daring to disobey orders and carry so much legal tender. You are lucky to have met me. If the Japanese had seen it, what would have happened?" As a result, the merchant was lucky to escape with his life, but the one thousand three hundred yuan of legal tender was unceremoniously taken by the traitor.

The houses along the railway line have been demolished or burned by the Japanese army, supposedly to prevent guerrillas. However, this cruel behavior of the × people not only failed to stop our guerrillas' activities in the slightest; on the contrary, often overnight, the sides of the railway are covered with sawn-off telegraph poles. Recently, in order to prevent sabotage by our guerrillas, the × people often use iron wires to wrap the telegraph poles tightly one zhang or more above the ground, but this does not have much effect because our guerrillas will use ladders.

The common people near the railway sometimes experience great difficulties. The × people often guard the villages at night, so they dare not come out, so at night, the villages are almost completely dominated by our guerrillas. At this time, the common people help our guerrillas to work, destroying roads, sawing telegraph poles... At dawn, the guerrillas leave, and the common people immediately report to the × army, and then the × army orders the local common people to repair the roads or telegraph poles that they themselves destroyed at night... (To be continued)

### × Side Rejects Various Countries' Rights and Interests in China, British and French Governments Join Forces to Deal with It, Tianjin's Two Concessions Have Been Blockaded by × Since Yesterday, the International Situation in the Far East is Conducive to Development

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Regarding the situation in Tianjin, the British and French governments are maintaining the closest contact and conducting careful research. As for what decisions the British and French have made, officials are keeping silent. However, according to "Le Figaro," the British and French have decided to act jointly.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] According to foreign news, after actively exchanging views recently, the authorities of Britain and France have decided to cooperate in all aspects. Therefore, the British military authorities in the Far East have recently invited Lieutenant General Dou Co, commander of the French fleet in the Far East, and the commander of the French army in Vietnam, and De Foz, chief of staff of the Southeast Air Force, to visit Singapore Port at the end of this month to inspect defense affairs, and to hold talks with representatives of the British Navy, Army, and Air Force, so as to achieve a unified joint action method for the navies, armies, and air forces of the two countries in the Far East. This is the same meaning as General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of France, recently going to London to discuss the issue of joint defense in Europe with the British military authorities. According to reports, representatives of the British headquarters and the two autonomous territories of Australia and New Zealand held an important meeting in New Zealand in April to discuss two cases: (1) the implementation of joint defense in wartime by British territories; (2) how to achieve self-sufficiency economically. The results of the meeting have been notified to France, and the French government has also taken the same measures to ensure the safety of the south. The Singapore meeting is actually a supplement to the New Zealand meeting. It is true that Japan still has the possibility of joining the Anti-Communist International Pact, and the actions of Britain and France must be adjusted accordingly.

[Central News Agency, London, 12th] At the afternoon meeting of the British House of Commons on the 12th, Conservative Party member Hana asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "The Japanese government recently announced that if its troops stationed in Shanghai believe that their safety is threatened, they intend not to respect the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by the public concession. Regarding this, has our government exchanged views with the governments of the United States and France?" Foreign Secretary Butler immediately responded on behalf of the Prime Minister, saying that for all issues jointly related to the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, our ambassador to Japan, Craigie, maintains close contact with the ambassadors of France and the United States.

Negotiations Between Tianjin and Tokyo

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, a reporter for financial news and foreign affairs recently stated that the United States and Britain have been in contact on this matter. The US government has agreed to have its Consul General in Tianjin serve as the chairman of the joint British-Japanese committee. In addition, there will be one committee member each from Britain and Japan, for a total of three members including the US representative. The method for this organizing committee to resolve difficulties is being sought from the Japanese government.

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, people close to the government here recently stated that the authorities are currently considering forming a joint British-Japanese committee to resolve the current disputes, with each side of Britain and Japan recommending two committee members, and the US Consul General being invited to serve as the chairman. The US Consul has also agreed to this. Although the Japanese side opposes the appointment of an American as chairman, the Consul General is impartial and respected even by the Japanese.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 14th] British Ambassador to Japan Craigie visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon to discuss the situation in Tianjin. Today, Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki also met for several hours. Afterward, Domei News Agency announced that the three had decided to adopt a tough policy towards the concessions in China (including the Tianjin concessions) because the concessions have become the base for supporting the "Chiang regime."

[Reuters, Tokyo, 14th] At yesterday's cabinet meeting, the situation in Tianjin was discussed. Foreign Minister Arita reported on "Japan's determination to deal with the Tianjin situation." "Yomiuri Shimbun" commented on the British side's compromise proposal, saying, "The purpose of Japan's actions this time is not limited to the corner of the British concession in Tianjin. Japan's purpose is to deal with all foreign concessions in China and the entire Far East policy of Britain and France."

The US State Department Pays Extreme Attention

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Hull and all officials of the State Department are currently paying secret and close attention to the Japanese preparations to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin. It is learned here that the Japanese blockade note has been delivered to the US Consulate General, and the note contains a statement that US commercial interests will be affected.

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 14th] Although the US government has not yet decided what steps to take to deal with Japan's blockade of the Tianjin concessions, the State Department is paying extreme attention to this matter. The US government must wait for Britain and France to take action before agreeing. There are 400 US manufacturers in Tianjin, all with branch offices. There are a total of 1,200 shops under the management of the US Consul General in Tianjin, including two banks, with investments exceeding 12 million Chinese paper currency. The annual business is about 200 million. If the Japanese implement a blockade, US merchants will suffer great losses.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] Regarding the serious current situation in Tianjin, today's "Shanghai Evening Post," a major American newspaper here, proposed that the best solution is to request a ruling from the US court in China, based on the principle of justice. This matter can definitely be resolved. It also said that the United States sympathizes with the methods proposed by Britain, but the Japanese must believe that the United States will be able to handle the matter fairly. It also said that the responsible persons on the Japanese side also have the same view. Finally, the newspaper stated that although the United States is not the target of Japan's exclusion of foreigners in China, it must also protect Britain's reasonable steps.

The British Side Releases the Course of Negotiations

[Reuters, London, 13th] Foreign Secretary Butler gave a report in the House of Commons today on the Tianjin issue, saying, "On April 9, the manager of the Tianjin pseudo-United Reserve Bank and the newly appointed Customs Superintendent was assassinated in the British concession. This is the first time that riots have occurred in the British concession since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The murderer was a Chinese who is still at large. The Public Works Bureau invited the Japanese side to cooperate and conducted many searches in the concession. As a result, several suspects were detained. The Japanese authorities insisted that four of the detained were terrorists and were related to the above-mentioned murder case and the killing of three Japanese soldiers. The Public Works Bureau handed over the four accused to the Japanese side for questioning. The four confessed, almost admitting their guilt, but after being sent back to the Public Works Bureau's patrol room, they immediately recanted their confessions. The British concession then issued a warning on June 7 that anyone who disrupts the neutrality of the concession will be handed over to the relevant authorities for interrogation or expelled from the concession. However, the four were arrested before the warning was issued, and there is currently no evidence to prove that they are related to the murder case. The confessions they made under Japanese interrogation also claimed that they were forced to confess under severe torture by the Japanese side. Therefore, the British government believes that there is absolutely no reason to hand over the criminals to the local Japanese puppet court for trial. This attitude is absolutely consistent with the habits of the past twenty-two months. The British Consul General then notified the Japanese Consul General on June 7, stating that he would keep the criminals in custody pending the Japanese side providing evidence. If the Japanese side does not provide evidence, the British authorities will only expel the four from the British concession. Two other people who were found to be privately hiding bombs can be handed over to the Japanese side for handling, and those who violate the law in the future can fulfill the covenant of the above-mentioned warning. However, the Japanese authorities said that they were not satisfied with the reply and have taken certain measures to force all Japanese shops and puppet organization Chinese employees in the British concession to leave the British concession, and to isolate the British concession. The situation is now very serious, but both sides are continuing negotiations, hoping to reach a resolution." Labour Party member Burke asked whether the British government would explain to Japan that the Japanese side's continuous opposition to the public concession would inevitably lead to serious consequences if this behavior continued. Butler replied that he believed the Japanese authorities were aware of the British attitude, and the report had already indicated this. Conservative Party member Milner asked whether the past practice was to send such criminals to a court in the British concession for public trial, or whether a special court could be set up in the future to try such criminals so that evidence could be presented fairly. Butler replied that the situation in this case was particularly different, and the authorities would definitely consider all possible measures. Labour Party member Beringer then stated that he and all members of the House of Commons hoped that the Foreign Secretary could state that the British government would absolutely not allow the Japanese to carry out their threats, that is, to blockade the British concession in Tianjin. Butler replied that he hoped Beringer would pay attention to the last sentence of his report, that is, the situation is extremely serious, but negotiations are still underway.

Tianjin × Started Implementing Blockade Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tianjin Foreign News, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin issued a notice yesterday, stating that starting from 6:00 am today, pedestrians and vehicles between the British and French concessions, the Japanese concession, and the Chinese territory should be prohibited from passing through. The Japanese army stipulated that pedestrians and vehicles should be inspected at seven locations. Ships in the Haihe River must also wait for inspection near the Dalian Mail Ship Company or the Nihonbashi in Special District 2. Those who violate the notice will be dealt with in accordance with the regulations of the Japanese Army Headquarters. The Japanese side has recently released detailed information. A spokesman for the Japanese military authorities said yesterday that the Japanese side's "isolation" of the British and French concessions is a due responsibility for the Japanese surrendered army in the current situation. The reason why the Japanese side has taken this measure is because the British authorities refused to hand over the four assassination suspects to the Japanese side. However, in reality, it is more than that. The notice issued by the Japanese side is an expression of the anger of the Japanese government and the Japanese people caused by the British's "pro-China" policy. Now that the arrow is on the string, the current problem is not only solved by the British side handing over the suspects to the Japanese side. Unless the British concession authorities cooperate with Japan to jointly build a "new order in East Asia" and abandon their "pro-China policy," the Japanese side will never stop its restrictive measures. The so-called "pro-China" policy is to protect anti-Japanese elements and communist elements, support Chinese legal tender, hinder the circulation of United Reserve Bank notes, monopolize materials, tacitly allow illegal elements to set up and use radio stations, and allow schools to teach anti-Japanese books, etc. The spokesperson continued that residents of China, Germany, and the United States in the British and French concessions will feel inconvenience after the "isolation" of the British and French concessions. This is very regrettable, but residents of all countries can move away from the concessions. The British and French concessions are the source of disputes and the source of undermining the "construction of a new order in East Asia" and undermining the "restoration of public security in North China." The Japanese army's "isolation" of the concessions is the only solution in the current situation. Currently, at the border of the British concession, in addition to British military trucks still patrolling as in the past few days, other measures have been taken, but it is difficult to determine what their nature is. The authorities have investigated the supply of food. The amount of flour stored is still sufficient, but British merchants are worried about the impact of the new restrictions, because their business is already in a difficult situation. Residents in the concessions show no signs of panic, and they express their determination to be angry. However, all parties acknowledge that the current situation is extremely serious. According to news from the Japanese side, there are no British or Japanese shops in the British and French concessions. They have all been evacuated. The Yokohama Specie Bank branch and the "United Reserve Bank" branch both moved out on the 11th. News from the Japanese side also said that foreigners in the concessions are showing signs of uneasiness. 350,000 Chinese residents and foreigners will be trapped in the concessions, and prices have risen by 20%.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 14th] This morning, a reporter from this agency inspected the surroundings of the British concession in Tianjin and saw that the Japanese method of blockading the concession was quite effective. All roads leading to the British concession have been blocked. Two roads are open (one in and one out). People waiting to enter and exit at each intersection are lined up in long lines. Except for residents of Germany and Italy, all people entering and exiting are subject to strict searches and questions. Their documents are also reviewed. Chinese people must take off their clothes for inspection in the guard room. Food prices have soared, with some as high as 70%.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 14th] At 5:00 am this morning, the Japanese army began to implement the blockade of the British concession. The barbed wire and other materials used for the blockade had been prepared several days ago and were built today. It is said that the Japanese military authorities notified the British concession late last night that they were impressed by the spirit of its compromise solution, but it was too late. The Japanese side had already prepared to implement all blockade measures, so it could not suddenly change its original plan in such a short period of time.

[Reuters, Beiping, 14th] British and other foreign women and children in Tianjin, unwilling to be trapped in the city during the hot summer, flocked to Beidaihe, Shanhaiguan, and Beiping yesterday. Japanese newspapers stated that except for those leaving the concession on official business, who would not be inspected, all others would be strictly inspected when entering and exiting. An army spokesperson in Beiping said that food would still be allowed to be transported into the concession freely.

British Public Opinion Strongly Advocates a Hard Line

[Reuters, London, 14th] "The Daily Telegraph" wrote today, "Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has repeatedly taken anti-British actions. Now, the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin is another addition to a large number of anti-British incidents." The report mentioned the Tinker incident and the detention of Speel, saying, "The search of the Rampura wheel gives the impression that the occurrence of new anti-British actions is encouraged and planned. It is very clear that Western countries do not want to be involved in the war in the Far East, but Japan has invaded the limit that the British government can tolerate. The repeated occurrence of British-Japanese incidents clearly has a fixed purpose. It is obvious that Japan's invasion of China has been slow to progress. This is also commonly seen by the Chinese and Japanese people, so they want to rebuild the Japanese side's 'face' with the loss of a third country. Some recent anti-British incidents are miserable and unpleasant, but this is a sign of Japan's weakness, not its strength. It is important that the British government and local representatives should not accept the Japanese side's illegal actions without protest or removing the protection that the defensive army can implement."

[Reuters, London, 14th] "The Daily Mail" said today, "The situation in Tianjin has gradually foreshadowed that the Japanese authorities not only blockade the concessions, but also a spokesperson hinted at expanding the incident about the extradition of four Chinese. If the Japanese people's purpose is not to try these people, but to destroy the position of the concessions, then this challenge action is related to Britain's entire position in the Far East."

[Reuters, London, 14th] All newspapers published the news of the blockade of the Tianjin concessions in a prominent position, with maps and detailed discussions of the Japanese attack on British interests in North China. The Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have rejected the British proposal to form a joint committee. Reuters has learned that the Japanese government replied to the British note, saying that the Tianjin incident is a "local incident" and must be resolved locally. The British government is currently closely considering progressive steps. Officials here are keeping silent about what retaliatory steps will be taken. Public opinion generally believes that the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concessions is an intolerable action. The British government will never yield. The British and French governments are currently discussing and believe that the French are prepared to take any necessary steps to assist Britain. The US government has authorized the US Consul General in Tianjin to serve as the chairman of the joint committee proposed by Britain and to make every effort to mediate and obtain a resolution.

[Reuters, London, 14th] MP Moore today raised the issue of the blockade of the Tianjin concessions in the House of Commons, questioning whether the government could immediately notify the Japanese government to stop this action, otherwise, it would immediately refuse the Japanese to use Hong Kong, Singapore, and Penang as transportation ports. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that the government is currently considering appropriate steps to deal with the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concessions. Mr. Mantel questioned whether the government maintains close contact with the French and American governments. Butler replied that the British government is in close contact with the French and American governments, and Mr. Mantel can rest assured.

Short Review

### Treating Prisoners of War Well

Yesterday, various newspapers published the "Instructions on Treating Prisoners of War Well" issued by our country's military authorities, allowing people all over the world to see a strong contrast:

On the one hand, it represents the reactionary, regressive, and even heaven-defying forces, which are the Japanese invaders. In their war of aggression against China, they not only rampage and plunder ×× slaughter, but also use poison gas and bombing to ravage undefended cities, kill innocent civilians, women, and children, and destroy sanitation and cultural institutions.

On the other hand, it represents the revolutionary, and it can even be said that it is the heaven-ordained force, which is our China in the War of Resistance. Our resistance is not only a "holy resistance that the sage has no choice but to use," but also, when bombing the three islands last year, promoted the sacred and great national spirit that I would not × with the Japanese people, and treated prisoners of war with benevolence and generosity as the main principle.

The ancients said, "Those who gain the Way prosper, and those who lose the Way perish." Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" also puts gaining the Way first. Our War of Resistance this time has not only gained the support of the entire nation at home but also the sympathy of the world abroad. Even the Japanese people under the control of the invaders will not be able to suppress the same feelings of excitement. The opportunity for victory or defeat has long been as clear as a torch!

### Honoring the Teacher's Way

According to Guilin Aviation News in yesterday's evening paper, the Guangxi Provincial Government issued a circular to all primary and secondary school students in the province, instructing them to respectfully address teachers as "Laoshi" (teacher). From now on, all instances of the word "Jiaoyuan" (educator) should be changed to "Jiaoshi" (teacher).

This is a manifestation of honoring the teacher's way. Originally, honoring the teacher's way was a virtue passed down for thousands of years in our country. Even since the revolution, our great leader Sun Yat-sen has repeatedly praised it, and our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly elaborated on its great relationship in his recent address to the National Education Conference.

Of course, everyone hopes that, as the Guangxi Provincial Government's telegram said: "When the name is correct, the leader will naturally not underestimate himself, and the disciples will also follow the rules and regulations, and be respectful and courteous, without daring to overstep!" 'Ah, how glorious!' But when asked whether those who are currently teachers, know whether they "can repay the appearance"!

We hope that all children in the world will respect teachers, but we also hope that all gentlemen in the country who are teachers will not be complacent about being respected. You must be worthy and without shame. First of all, you must constantly promote the era in the trend of the times at any time and lead the masses in the student groups. Do not make students be able to follow the rules and regulations, especially to enable students to be vigorous and promising day by day, and to shoulder the important responsibilities of the country in the future!

### The Zhongtiao Mountains are as Solid as a Fortress; Six Attacks Planned by the Enemy Result in Utter Defeat; Stability in Northern Jiangxi; Air Raids on Hunan

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 13th] After suffering a major blow from our forces, the bandits in Southern Shanxi, who made six attempts to seize the Zhongtiao Mountains, have retreated from Zhangdian (approximately 2,000 bandits) and the area south of Yanchi (approximately 2-3,000 bandits) to the east of Anyi. Only a few remnants are still active in Dachen Village (south of Zhangdian). We have advanced to encircle and attack them, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them completely.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 13th] There have been no changes in the battle situation in Northern Jiangxi. There has only been sporadic artillery fire from the enemy. However, our guerrillas remain very active, launching surprise attacks on the enemy from time to time.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 14th] At around 7:00 AM on the 14th, six enemy planes flew from the direction of Hankou, passing over Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, and Yiyang, dropping bombs twice. Ninety-seven innocent civilians were killed or injured, and over fifty houses were destroyed. The planes then circled over Hanshou several times before fleeing north.

### The Regent of Tibet Holds Ceremonies Praying for Victory; Monks and Taoists of Mount Heng Participate in Rescue Efforts; All Sectors of Hubei Province Celebrate a Major Victory

[Central News Agency, Lhasa, 13th] The Regent of Tibet, Reting Rinpoche, believing that the War of Resistance has entered its second phase and is gradually achieving victory, in order to uplift the spirit of all Tibetans and jointly advance towards the goals of "Military Affairs First, Victory First," and to block the invasion of the enemy bandits, specially ordered that on May 12th, at the three major monasteries, the Shang*** (unclear telegraph code) courtyard, and various ancient temples, ceremonies be held to pray for victory for our army and to chant curses to swiftly destroy the enemy bandits, hoping to expel the demonic forces, turn misfortune into blessing, and achieve ultimate victory. Prayers were also offered for all things to go smoothly for Chairman Chiang and for his lasting health and prosperity.

[Central News Agency, Hengshan, 13th] The Mount Heng Buddhist and Taoist Relief Association gathered hundreds of young monks and Taoists for wartime training, which has lasted for a month. Yesterday, a graduation ceremony was held, and they were divided into three groups—comfort, rescue, and propaganda—to engage in national salvation work. In the coming days, preparations will be made for the second phase of training. Additionally, dozens of Buddhist youths have formed a Buddhist Youth Service Corps, which recently held a founding oath ceremony. The corps will soon be led by its director to various battlefields to work.

### Many Puppets of the Pro-Japanese Regime in Nanjing Poisoned; Little Hope of Survival; Delirious and Ceaseless Vomiting; Miyashita and Funayama Already Dead

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Shanghai sources report that on the 10th, army and diplomatic personnel in Nanjing, as well as traitors such as Liang Hongzhi and Wen Zongyao, were invited to a banquet at the Japanese Consulate-General to entertain the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shimizu. Unexpectedly, shortly after the banquet ended, all the attendees suffered from poisoning, abdominal pain, ceaseless vomiting, and delirium, falling into a state of near death. Although doctors provided treatment, it was largely ineffective. Two secretaries, Miyashita and Funayama, died on the spot, and it is said that the others have little hope of survival.

[Central News Agency, Somewhere in Central Hubei, 13th] The Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters convened over a thousand representatives from all sectors on the 12th to hold an expanded memorial meeting to celebrate the major victory in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan. Chairman Guo Chan reported on the course of the major victory. Finally, the entire assembly passed a resolution to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang, Commander Li, and the soldiers at the front.

During the War of Resistance, he organized self-defense forces in Guangdong, achieving considerable success. Upon hearing of the fall of Guangzhou, he was deeply grieved and stopped eating, ultimately sacrificing his life. In remembrance of his loyalty and sacrifice, the government deeply mourns his passing and hereby orders that he be posthumously commended as an example for all to follow. This order is given.

### Wang Jingwei's Surrender to the Enemy Creates Just Another Puppet; Japanese Political Circles Also Do Not Take Him Seriously; Shanghai's "Continental Times" Publishes Commentary

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Shanghai's "Continental Times" recently published an editorial stating that the National Government's order last week to arrest Wang Jingwei was not surprising. When Wang left Chongqing, the National Government still adopted a lenient attitude, hoping that he would come to his senses. However, Wang willingly served the enemy and cut himself off from the people, so the National Government had no choice but to follow public opinion and issue an arrest warrant. Wang is now reaping what he sowed. According to Chongqing sources, Wang recently went to Tokyo for secret negotiations with the Japanese, with the clear aim of seeking a puppet position. Even if Wang achieves this goal, it is doubtful whether he can coordinate and get along with other puppets. Jiang's political power in the country has long been eliminated. His return to China with Japanese support will make it even more difficult for him to rally the people. Even figures in Japanese political circles doubt Wang's capabilities, believing that Wang's eventual rise to power will merely be the addition of another puppet created by Japan.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] The Mexico City branch, the Mexico First Direct Branch, the Mexico Second Direct Branch, the San Pedro branch, the Panuco branch, and the Mexico City Anti-Japanese Association all telegraphed President Chiang and Chairman Lin, requesting that Wang Jingwei be labeled as a traitor and that an arrest warrant be issued for his severe punishment.

### Special Correspondent Article: Luofu Travelogue

— Firefly

Gathering at Yihe Market

The weather in April was sultry. The rain fell like strings of beads, and the road was muddy. Every step required careful attention to one's footing. Enemy planes, silver with red dots, circled over our heads once, twice, heading towards Boluo City and Huizhou City behind us. This kind of flying and reconnaissance, experience told me, meant the front line was somewhat tense. But we were heading to the tense front line.

The shattered Boluo City had already disappeared behind us, and the green hills and misty rain had blocked our view. "Sir, how about taking a break at Yihe Market?" the honest porter carrying comfort goods asked us. "Of course, we're meeting at Yihe Market," I replied.

The dilapidated shops and stunted trees were before our eyes. The dilapidated shops, in the midst of the fierce wind and rain, seemed particularly pitiful and small.

Upon arriving in Yihe, the more than ten representatives of the Boluo community's comfort delegation to the front-line soldiers and civilians had gathered. Everyone looked like a drowned rat, but everyone felt victorious in their hearts—this could be said to be a tactical success, dividing dozens of people into several small teams to advance, avoiding enemy reconnaissance targets—using the opportunity to avoid the rain to rest was undoubtedly worthwhile. It was a pity this small market was so pathetic. Besides blind man's cakes, peanuts, and cigarettes, it was impossible to find a cup of tea. Judging from this townscape, one could have felt comfortable and had some tea. The shopkeeper standing at the entrance of the market clearly had a brand new sign of a teahouse, so why was there not a single person in sight? If it was not bombed, why were all the shops still so deserted? I raised these questions. The experienced Secretary Zhu replied: "Indeed, this place used to be prosperous. The lime wall over there is where the warehouse with 100,000 capital was located ten years ago, before Yang Ximin's rebellion, it was looted by bandits and all the shops left. The market inside had a special period of prosperity. Every day, it was filled with foreign goods, ingots, and gambling, and people flocked to it. After the government implemented a ban on gambling, some people who made a living from gambling regarded this place as their forbidden fruit. After the Japanese entered, the liveliness was beyond words. After the recovery, the gamblers had to leave, and after this group of people left, the market was bound to be deserted."

We rested for more than an hour. At one o'clock in the afternoon, we left Yihe and headed towards Longhua. The rain continued to fall. On the way, Comrade Chen Yuanrui from the War Workers' Group supplemented some of the special circumstances of Yihe Market, because he had come to work here a month after the recovery of Boluo and had encountered several bandits robbing people, and every day there were bandits robbing in the vicinity. Only now was it no longer happening.

Therefore, the only impression Yihe gave me was: "Bandits, gambling, bandits." (To be continued)

### British Representative Strang Arrives in Moscow; Soviet Newspaper Comments on the Progress of Negotiations; Insists on Guaranteeing the Baltic States

[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] British Foreign Office expert William Strang arrived here this morning from Warsaw. The Director of the Third Western Department of the Soviet Foreign Office, Tytarenko, the Deputy Director, and secretaries from the British Embassy greeted him at the station. However, no senior Soviet officials were present at the station because Strang did not have the rank of cabinet member. After consulting with the British Ambassador here, Strang immediately went to the Soviet Foreign Office to meet with Molotov. He will reside at the British Embassy and there will be no social events. The Anglo-Soviet negotiations are still in progress. The Soviet press does not mention Strang's trip, which is customary in the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, London, 14th] As British envoy William Strang was about to arrive in Moscow, the Soviet government newspaper "Pravda" commented on the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations, insisting that Latvia, Estonia, and Finland must accept Soviet guarantees. The newspaper argued that the neutrality of the Baltic states was absolutely essential for the security of the Soviet Union and that these countries needed guarantees from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union because they could not resist aggression. The newspaper also criticized the governments of the Baltic states, implying that the opposition of the foreign ministers of Estonia and Finland to Soviet guarantees was due to German influence. It stated, "In this situation, we are faced with a misunderstanding or hidden ill will, hoping to break the defense line of peaceful countries against aggression."

[Haitong News Agency, London, 14th] Former British First Lord of the Admiralty, Cooper, recently published an article in the "Evening Standard" here, strongly advocating that the government should immediately guarantee the independence of the Baltic states and quickly conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. He stated that the Baltic states were to the Soviet Union as Belgium was to Britain. Even if the Belgian government adopted an unrealistic policy and declared that it no longer needed British and French guarantees, this would not change Britain's attitude. Britain would still go to war to prevent Belgium from falling into foreign hands, whether Belgium accepted the guarantee or not. The Soviet Union regarded the integrity of the Baltic states as extremely important to its security, and this attitude could not be condemned. If Britain wanted to obtain Soviet assistance in times of crisis, it should also provide assistance to the Soviet Union. If the British government did not quickly conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, it would ultimately fail.

### Reportedly, Britain and France Will Propose Changing the Status of Danzig; A Complete Plan is Currently Being Drafted; Will Be Submitted to Germany in the Near Future

[Haitong News Agency, London, 14th] According to today's "Daily Express," Britain, France, and Poland will soon issue a joint declaration on the status of Danzig. The newspaper stated that William Strang, the head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, met with the British Ambassador to Warsaw, Kennard, on his way to Moscow, and the topic of discussion was Danzig. The well-informed "Daily Express" believes that Britain, France, and Poland will soon propose changing the status of Danzig, drafting a plan to be submitted to the German government in the near future. The newspaper concluded that Danzig would not be "completely annexed" by Germany.

### Refuse to Buy Japanese Goods; Assist China

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] During the afternoon session of the House of Commons on the 13th, Liberal MP Mander asked if it was true that imports of Japanese goods to Britain had greatly increased and whether the British refusal to discuss Japanese goods would not greatly benefit China's war of resistance. Secretary of Commerce Stanley replied that import figures for Japanese goods in 1938 had not yet been released. As for 1937, the import volume was much smaller than in 1936.

Editorial

### Concessions and War

"Japan's true enemy is not in China, but in the concessions within China." This is the opinion of the Japanese newspaper "Miyako Shimbun," as reported by Reuters from Tokyo on the 6th of this month. Such words are almost universally recognized by intuition as expressions of emotion. Since they arise from emotion, whether they are grounded in reason can be set aside. However, in all times and places, the historical traces of mankind are more often driven by emotion than governed by reason. Therefore, for those who value reason, it is important to skillfully manage one's own emotions and not to ignore the emotions of others. Moreover, observing Japan's actions towards us, most are based on emotion; at least, the initiation of the conflict at the Marco Polo Bridge and the sudden dispatch of heavy troops into Shanhaiguan, as well as the initiation of the conflict at the Hongqiao Airport and the sudden dispatch of naval forces to threaten Wusongkou, have made the Sino-Japanese problem unresolvable and led to war, which today marks the beginning of its twenty-fourth month. Is this a rational act? It is driven by emotion! In this vein, how dare we despise the "Miyako Shimbun"!

Regarding concessions in China, it is not difficult to explain their origin from a historical perspective, their boundaries from a geographical perspective, their nature from a legal perspective, and their system from a governance perspective. However, in terms of their relationship, their influence, and the analysis of their good and bad, fortune and misfortune, benefits and losses, it is extremely complex and subtle. Not only do various contradictions coexist, but they also evolve and transform in multiple contradictory directions. It is not easy to create a concise outline or an accurate concept. Therefore, throughout history, Chinese and foreigners have held diverse views on concessions: some longing for them, some despising them; some cherishing them, some discarding them; some believing in their unlimited future, some doubting their imminent destruction; some viewing them as paradise, the source of all blessings; some viewing them as hell, the source of all evils. This is because their multifaceted nature leads to vastly different assessments. This is true in peacetime, and when the Sino-Japanese war broke out, the contradictions inherent in the nature of concessions became even more exposed. After launching a military invasion against us, Japan encountered unexpected troubles in military, economic, and diplomatic aspects. Let alone finding a way to resolve these troubles, it is impossible to answer the previous causes of these troubles. Instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed heaven and others, and then shifted their anger to the concessions, as if they had found something and said, "The enemy is here!"

How can concessions be Japan's enemy? The materials for our country's war of resistance are based on the vast inland, including fields, hills, forests, and mines. Concessions are like bullets; how can they be significant? The spirit of our country's war of resistance lies in endurance, hardship, perseverance, and the reproduction of the military and civilians in the interior. The quality and quantity of those living in the concessions are only a hundredth of that of inland. The import of our country's war of resistance weapons comes from Guangdong and the only northwest and southwest remains as channels, so is there a reliance on concessions for imports and exports? Our country's victory in the war of resistance lies in a long period of time and a vast space. The factors for the victory or defeat of both sides are not at all related to the concessions. To put it bluntly, if today's concessions are controlled by us, what benefit is there to the war of resistance? If the concessions are controlled by Japan, what harm is there to the future of China's war of resistance, and what benefit is there to Japan's operations? Moreover, concessions and war are not only unrelated, but also closely related. What is the relationship? If Japan wins, Japan will surely regard the concessions as its forbidden fruit. If China wins, the concessions will surely prosper unprecedentedly with the rise of China's great cause of recovery. Therefore, to say that the fate of war is tied to the concessions is completely unreasonable. The fate of the concessions is in fact transferred according to the final outcome of the war. This is because the concessions are in our country, and the natural destined can also be. This kind of close relationship, this kind of inevitable cause and effect, is well known throughout the world. If one is driven by emotion and attempts to change the fate of the concessions before the war decides victory or defeat, it is like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, tantamount to suicide. Why? Preserving the concessions depends on the cooperation of all parties, while destroying the concessions can be done by any one party. Therefore, we not only advise Chinese people within the concessions to respect themselves, but also want to warn the Japanese not to mistake the concessions as enemies!

Emotional words are not relevant to reason and are not beneficial to reality. However, if one stirs up emotions and leads many people to emotion, even forming emotional actions, it is not only irrelevant and useless, but also leads to a wrong path and brings disaster upon oneself. Therefore, if China cannot understand that the concessions are irrelevant to the war situation and cannot respect themselves within the concessions, leading to the destruction of the concessions, then international sympathy for China will have an unfavorable change. If Japan regards the concessions as enemies, then the concessions are inherently international bombs. If Japan detonates them, we will see the Pacific Ocean boil!

### British Attitude Towards Japan Gradually Strengthens; Authoritative Figures Demand Positive Action; Britain May Retaliate Against Japan

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] Influential circles in Britain are now exerting pressure on the government to take positive measures to protect British rights in China. The suggestion made by Lord Ailwyn on the first of this week, advocating that Japanese ships not be allowed to load and unload goods in Singapore, Penang, and other places, will still be raised by someone in the House of Commons in the coming days. Today, a powerful delegation will meet with Undersecretary Butler to present the following demands: (1) Implement a consular visa system for goods shipped from China to Britain; (2) Strengthen British defenses in Shanghai; (3) Take all other necessary measures to protect British rights and interests in China. According to well-informed sources, in recent months, Britain's attitude towards Japan has greatly strengthened. Even newspapers that have always been lenient towards Japan have changed their attitude. Each time the House of Commons meets, government officials report that they have made representations to Tokyo, and the various chambers of parliament sneer at this. Other parties believe that the Japanese military is exerting pressure on Britain, which will inevitably become more serious, and will inevitably lead Britain to openly express its intention to retaliate against Japan.

### House of Commons Discusses Chinese Legal Tender; Credit Remains Unshaken

[Reuters, London, 13th] Member of Parliament Bellinger asked in the House of Commons today the reasons for the devaluation of Chinese legal tender and the temporary suspension of the use of the Currency Equalization Fund. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Simon, replied that he had quoted the communique issued in Hong Kong on June 8 and said, "As generally known, in the past few weeks, the Chinese Currency Equalization Fund has not been under pressure, and the credit of Chinese legal tender has not been shaken in the slightest. The purpose of announcing a temporary suspension on Wednesday was to allow Chinese legal tender to seek a more suitable economic level on its own, so that import and export transactions can reach a balance." Simon further cited a similar fact in June of last year as an example, saying that after the level of eight pence was found, it was able to be maintained until December. He firmly believed that the new level had now been obtained and would be firmly maintained. Some goods that China previously imported from abroad are now manufactured domestically. According to reports from various places, a bumper harvest is expected this year, which will also contribute to reducing the import of foreign goods. The foreign exchange needed by the Chinese government to purchase military supplies and other supplies has been arranged and does not need to go through the exchange market. The strength of the Equalization Fund has been strengthened, and efforts to further expand the fund's base have also been successful. Therefore, the authorities have absolute confidence in their ability to maintain foreign exchange prices, and there is no problem. Although the foreign exchange price of Chinese legal tender has changed repeatedly, it is still greatly supported and trusted by the people, because it can still be exchanged for foreign currency at any time. Bellinger also asked about the use of the Chinese Currency Equalization Fund. Since it was used to stabilize Chinese currency, but the foreign exchange price of China has fallen, has this fund been ineffective? The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this fund still has its effectiveness and again pointed out the communique issued in Hong Kong on June 8. Bell also asked whether the fund proposed by Britain had been affected, so the fund had stopped operating. Simon again asked him to refer to the June 8 communique, saying that the most complete information was nothing more than this.

### US Neutrality Act; Will Cancel the Clause Prohibiting Arms Exports; Aims to Assist Democratic Countries

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The US government's Neutrality Act, which stipulates the cancellation of the clause prohibiting the export of arms to belligerent countries, has now been unanimously approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. According to a member of the committee, when the bill was discussed, representatives from the US State Department informed the members of the committee that the large amount of arms Germany had obtained in Czechoslovakia and the fact that Bohemia and Moravia were under German protection had given Hitler an advantage over Britain and France. If the United States still prohibited the sale of arms to belligerent countries in the event of a war in Europe, it would be tantamount to helping Germany.

### Spain No Intention of Joining German-Italian Military Alliance Spanish Military Delegation Arrives in Rome Franco to Visit Italy in September

[Reuters, Rome, 13th] According to Burgos, General Franco is scheduled to visit Italy at the end of September.

[Central News Agency, Madrid, 12th] After arriving in Rome, the Spanish military delegation discussed the issue of Spain joining the German-Italian military pact. However, it is generally known that most important figures in the Spanish government oppose this proposal. Today, the official news agency issued a statement saying that the national military delegation held a meeting with Italian military leaders this morning. Interior Minister Suner and Foreign Minister Ciano were also present. This statement has not yet been published by the newspapers. It is said that the proposal for Spain to join the German-Italian military pact is strongly opposed by all sectors of society, which can be seen from this.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 14th] Since learning of General Franco's planned visit to Italy in September, newspapers here have been discussing the possibility of Spain joining the German-Italian Axis. The issue was also mentioned during the visit of the former Spanish Interior Minister to Rome and Foreign Minister Ciano's preparations to go to Madrid. However, newspapers today have criticized and expressed their belief that Spain will soon form an agreement with the Axis powers. This kind of viewpoint is expressed for the first time. The Rome correspondent of "Le Figaro" stated that a new Spain will inevitably return to the German-Italian Axis sooner or later. The Rome correspondent of "Le Journal" stated that Foreign Minister Ciano of Italy will visit Spain in July, and his real purpose may be to sign an agreement with Spain.

### Hitler to Stay at Villa

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] Hitler has left Vienna for Berchtesgaden. Some sources say that he will stay there for two months, but in any case, Mr. Hitler will stay there for several weeks.

### British and French Air Forces to Hold Exercises in Mid-July Key Figures from Both Countries to Participate

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] A joint air force exercise between Britain and France will be held in Touquet from July 14th to 17th. No less than 600 fighter planes will participate in the exercise. British Air Minister Wood, Undersecretary Balfour, Home Secretary Hoare, and many key members of Parliament, as well as French General Daladier, and many senior military officers and politicians, will all personally participate.

### Britain Reports to the League of Nations on the Situation in Palestine League of Nations Commissioners Ask Questions One After Another Bombings Continue in the Holy City

[Reuters, Geneva, 13th] The British representative today reported to the League of Nations Mandates Commission on the events that occurred in Palestine last year. He said that the terrorist organization there was disbanded at the end of April, and since May, efforts have been made to restrict the entry of illegal Jews. The Jews strongly oppose the British government's White Paper. As for the attitude of the Arabs, it is not yet fully understood. Some members of the Mandates Commission asked questions about the nature of the disturbances and where the rioters obtained their weapons. The British representative replied that most of the weapons used by the rioters were manufactured and hidden in Palestine during the World War. Regarding Dallas Jordon, the British representative said that although the people there support the terrorist incidents in Palestine, they are still calm. In addition, British Colonial Secretary MacDonald will deliver a speech to the Mandates Commission on the 15th of this month.

[Haitong Agency, Jerusalem, 14th] On Sunday evening, after the municipal telephone factory in Tel Aviv was bombed by rioters, ten more bombing cases occurred in various places the next day. It is reported that five public telephone booths and one post office were severely damaged. There are no reports of casualties.

[Haitong Agency, Jerusalem, 14th] The British military authorities have re-promulgated a nighttime curfew in Tel Aviv, prohibiting residents from walking on the streets from 8:30 pm to 4:00 am. It is reported that this measure was taken due to the bombing case on Monday evening.

### Polish Delegation Goes to Britain to Negotiate Discussing Loans to Purchase Armaments

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 13th] A Polish economic delegation, led by Government Financial Advisor and Polish Bank Director Colonel Kok, set off for London this afternoon to seriously negotiate with the British government on the issue of obtaining export credit loans to purchase various armaments.

[Haitong Agency, Warsaw, 14th] Polish Ambassador to Italy, Chaski, recently returned here from Rome. It is expected that he will reside here for a long period of time, because according to the opinions of Polish political circles, there is no need for Ambassador Du to remain in Rome in the current situation. Recently, the Polish press's attitude towards Italy has been extremely hostile. An Italian newspaper published an article pointing out Germany's reasonable demands for the "Polish Corridor" and warning Poland not to provoke Germany. Polish newspapers were particularly angry about this, saying that Italy's anti-Polish rhetoric could not be worse than this. Poland originally expressed sympathy for Italy, but this type of writing is actually forcing Poland to decide to change its attitude.

### Germany Merges with Slovakia to be Formalized German Troops Have Already Arrived at the Border Three Slovakian Planes Flee to Poland

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] Hitler will soon annex Slovakia and turn it into a third protectorate. Part of the German army has already arrived at the Slovakian border, and Slovakia has no way to resist. It is reported that the German side has indicated to Hungary that if Hungary can cede the land west of the Raba River to Germany, then Hungary can take back most of the land of Slovakia. Hungary has firmly rejected this proposal.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 13th] Yesterday, three Slovakian planes landed in Deblin, southeast of Warsaw. Among them were six Slovakian pilots, all of whom surrendered to the Polish government. The planes were also taken over by the Polish side. It is said that they specifically flew the planes out of Slovakia to prevent them from falling into German hands.

### Ten Commandments for Courtship

Believe it or not

First Commandment: Don't fall in love with the first boyfriend or girlfriend. It's best to make several friends of the opposite sex, compare them, and choose the best one.

Second Commandment: Don't pursue a member of the opposite sex who constantly stimulates your nerves, causes frequent quarrels, or turns you into someone who likes to quarrel. If a man and a woman are not very harmonious during courtship, then after marriage, there is certainly no possibility of growing old together. It's true that it's a lot of fun when lovers reconcile after a quarrel. But after marriage, it's not easy to repair a broken mirror when disagreements arise!

Third Commandment: Don't fall in love with someone of the opposite sex who is too jealous. Don't be too jealous yourself. During courtship, you should have the right to make male and female friends. At the same time, you should also allow the other party to have the same right to make male and female friends. If young men and women are often jealous during courtship, then after marriage, the family will become a prison for one or both parties.

Fourth Commandment: Don't expect marriage to change the personality of your lover. If young men and women like to drink, gamble, or do other bad things before marriage, and promise to improve after marriage, even if they swear to heaven, they will never keep their promise after marriage. Let them use the behavior of turning over a new leaf to prove their intention to change before getting married. Don't expect the wedding to change the other person's bad habits.

Fifth Commandment: Don't make the foolish move of getting engaged in a fit of pique. Many women have disagreements with their fiancés and, in order to make their fiancés feel heartbroken, get engaged to men they don't like, just for revenge. Many men also make this mistake, just to let their girlfriends know that there is more than one woman in the world. Remember, a marriage of spite never succeeds.

Sixth Commandment: Don't get married too quickly. On the other hand, don't delay the engagement indefinitely for several years. Because in both of these situations, there are many hidden dangers.

Seventh Commandment: Don't tell your future spouse about your past mistakes, and don't ask your future spouse to confess his or her past mistakes, because neither of you is marrying the past. If you are both physically and mentally ready to get married, then the past should always be buried underground and not dug up.

Eighth Commandment: Don't expect courtship by correspondence to have a happy ending. Before the wedding, both parties must have direct and concrete knowledge of each other.

Ninth Commandment: Don't marry someone whose background is too different from yours. Interracial marriages rarely have happy endings.

Tenth Commandment: Don't commercialize marriage. If you commercialize marriage, you will find that you are losing a lot in this transaction.

### One Person a Day

Hitler, the Nazi demon king, relies on his big mouth to shout, and is now considered one of the world's three great orators. This is what he is proud of.

Once, he was performing again. Speaking of the defeat in 1918, he said, "That should be entirely the responsibility of the Jews." One standing in the front row, who was clearly Jewish, was also nodding his head in agreement.

"You see," old Hitler laughed and shouted, "Even the Jews are sympathetic to what I say." Then he said to that person, "Tell us, in what aspect should you Jews be responsible for our failure?"

"It's very simple!" the Jew replied, "Because there were too many Jewish officers."

"Nonsense, there are no Jewish officers in the German army," old Hitler corrected.

"Yes, I mean, in 1918, there were too many Jewish officers in the French and American armies!"

### Statistics

In the past thirty-four centuries, there have been three thousand and one hundred years of war; two hundred and seventy-seven years of peace; and eight thousand peace treaties.

### Tidbits

Two women went to see a doctor. She rushed into the doctor's office and shouted loudly, "Doctor, I want you to tell me frankly what's wrong with me."

The doctor observed her from head to toe for a week. "Madam," he finally said, "I have three things to tell you. First, your body needs to lose fifty pounds. Second, if you use soap and water often, you will become more beautiful. Third, I am an artist, and the doctor lives next door."

B: May I ask who that is?

A: Nanjing City's senior craftsman, Li Xiaoba Zi!

### Weather Station

Today's weather, the XX Observatory predicts: southwest wind, gentle, dense clouds, occasional sunshine, and local short-term rain. For the past few days, no, maybe for the past few months, it has been the same every day. Moreover, there are clouds, there is rain, there is wind, and there is sunshine. You think, what other changes in the weather are there? Therefore, I think it is better to rely on myself than to ask for help from others. The weather station has decided to predict the weather itself from now on. Today's weather, the weather station predicts, is cloudy and sunny, or there may be wind and rain. Believe it or not, you can not listen if it's not accurate.

Every day, I see news in the newspapers about catching gamblers, and it seems that they can't catch them all. But, who knows, what's the use of catching them? You walk on the main road, and everywhere there is the sound of "pi pa pi pa", day and night. And the "Mahjong Sutra" has become a fashionable book in everyone's hands: The responsibility of mahjong for national gambling lies in this. Going down the line, you turn the corner and you will see newsboys, sedan chair carriers, vendors, and pawns all playing cards and shouting. This may be a kind of trend in Hong Kong. Can you say it is gambling, or is it not?

Look, who told you to ask me to dress up like Robert Taylor!

Previous Excerpt

In 1914, when the European situation was tense, the German-American route's "Kronprinzessin Cecilie" carried six million gold bars to Germany. Chuckes Shipping Company's radio operator Jack and mechanic Bill also took the ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator Roumon Garros. At the same time, Jack also became friends with the German radio operator on the ship, Bauer. Jack was working for Bauer when news arrived...

### Sea Storm Four

— by Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi

"In the current situation, we can. Britain has declared war on Germany and Austria. You should stop, or it will be detrimental to you."

A burst of footsteps startled him, and he quickly turned around. Roumon Garros came in.

"Are you in charge of the radio? I guess that friend who is always hungry must have gone to eat again. Ah, is there any news? When I came in, I saw you working on the machine."

"I haven't received any news since I came in," Jack said nonchalantly, "I was wondering who could be joking with me using the radio."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, someone sent a message saying they were the British cruiser HMS Iron Duke, saying that Britain had declared war on Germany, and—"

Before he could finish speaking, Garros stretched out both hands and pressed them on his shoulders. "This is not a joke, it's the truth."

"This is the truth? How do you know?" Jack asked strangely.

"For months, the diplomatic world has been filled with this atmosphere. I thought war would have been declared long ago. That's why I went to the United States to buy airplanes."

"What, is France involved too?"

"That's right, Russia too. Two days after Russia declares war, it will be France's turn. These are the so-called Triple Entente, and two have already moved. Now, it is expected that Britain will also come to help resist that tyrannical Germany."

"But how do you know so much? When we left New York, the newspapers didn't say anything about it! There was just a small conflict between Austria and Serbia."

"That's what caused this, or in other words, that's the fuse. But, if you ask me how I know about Russia and France declaring war, I'm not the only one on this ship who knows about this. Captain Lock and some of the crew know about it too, and they got the news from the radio, just like me. They have been paying attention to British cruisers for a long time, because they are afraid that Britain will join the Franco-Russian alliance. This German ship has six million gold bars, which is a valuable prize for Britain. My friend, there is a show to watch."

"That's amazing. In that case, the message just now wasn't a joke, and this British cruiser might capture us and take away these treasures."

"If she can catch us—that's it. She will imprison many Germans on the ship and take this ship to Britain."

"What should I do now?"

"That little Bauer is coming. Tell him the news and tell him to report to the captain immediately. If we are captured, my urgent business will be delayed until who knows when."

The German radio operator came into the room, still chewing on a large piece of German salted biscuit. Jack told him the news he had just heard, and he was stunned in shock, and the salted biscuit fell to the ground.

"God!" By the time he could speak, he shouted. "Britain and Germany are at war, and a British ship is chasing us. Damn it! If they catch us, I, Hans Bauer, will become a prisoner, with no good food to eat, only bread and plain water—"

### Black Market Foreign Exchange Restrictions on Supply Trade Deficit Expected to Decrease Sharply This Year's Trade Deficit Reaches Post-War High Record Restricting Foreign Exchange is Most Beneficial to Domestic Goods Enterprises

Shanghai is the only major trading port in the Far East, holding the reins of the national customs. Imports and exports of goods are the best of all customs. When the war first started, the customs trade suddenly declined due to the shift of the trade center inland. Since the summer of last year, it has gradually recovered. This year's April import and export trade totaled 88,770,764 yuan, setting a new post-war record. However, the trade deficit figures

increasing without decreasing As for last year, the total trade deficit was only 51,857,000 yuan. But this year, January was 9,356,413 yuan, February was 5,129,304 yuan, March was 33,092,748 yuan, and April was 24,737,258 yuan. January to April totaled 72,316,000 yuan, compared with

last year same period two thousand two hundred and eight five five actually increased by 54,511,000 yuan. The National Government has repeatedly tried to eliminate the trade deficit of the Shanghai Customs in order to reduce foreign exchange leakage. However, because the Shanghai Customs is located in the occupied area, its power is insufficient. It is heard that today HSBC Bank

restricting supply black market foreign exchange is also a strategy to eliminate the Shanghai Customs trade deficit. Therefore, the Shanghai Customs trade deficit figures may gradually decrease sharply in the future, and the development of domestic goods enterprises and the entire future of the war of resistance will benefit greatly.

### Same Surname

— Geng Zhi

In China's patriarchal society, the power of those with the same surname is significant. To have a famous ancestor from whom one claims to be a "remote descendant" can certainly intimidate others. Even during clan fights, shouting "Everyone with the surname ×, attack!" can seize the initiative and secure victory.

Zhang Xianzhong, who nearly exterminated the people of Sichuan, wanted to establish a kinship with Emperor Wenchang and dared not destroy the temples of Zhang Huanhou. Huang Chao, who massacred eight million people, spared those with the surname Huang—even Huanggang and Huangmei counties were spared from slaughter simply because they bore the character "Huang" in their names. The influence of shared surnames extended even to bandits. It is no wonder that its power has not waned for thousands of years, and now it seems to be intensifying.

This so-called intensification is not just my conjecture. Some people, seeking to harness the power of shared surnames but finding no immediate way to do so, have resorted to imitating the Oath of the Peach Garden or emulating the Elegant Gathering in the Apricot Garden, forming sworn brotherhoods and registering genealogies to bolster their influence. Others have set their sights on numerous foreign tycoons. It is said that a certain "Gao Erchu," with "Er" as his generation name and "Foundation" as his ideal, not only sought to establish kinship with that great Russian writer but also to regard him as his compatriot and brother. Then, individuals with the surname Xiao, following the ancient examples of "Bo Da Bo Shi" or "Bo Yi Shu Qi," named themselves "Bo Gui" or "Shu Gui" to claim brotherhood with the British "George Bernard Shaw." ...

I imagine that in the future, this might indeed become a reality: someone with the surname "Ma" named "Kreis" or "Forbes"; someone with the surname "Zhang" named "Zhong Chang"; someone with the surname "Luo" named "Slugh"; someone with the surname "Shi" named "Danfeng" or "Qinglin"... It is a pity that China, apart from Mo Di, who was suspected of being an Indian charcoal merchant in ancient times, seems to have no one with the surname "Mo" now. And apart from Mr. Xi Yi, who lived reclusively on Mount Hua during the Five Dynasties period, there is no one with the surname "Xi." Otherwise, could not the "esteemed surnames" of modern eccentrics be used to draw these wonderful people with the surnames "Mo" and "Xi" into our "Hundred Family Surnames," creating a flourishing clan?

Some say that if the Chinese were to truly do this, there would be nothing wrong with it, because foreigners do the same. Many wealthy foreigners spend vast sums of money to have genealogies fabricated to prove that they are descendants of famous people. Many warlords or celebrities add words like "Von" or "Don" to their names to indicate that they are descendants of nobility. They even practice "endogamy," which is worse than China's "marriage prohibition between people of the same surname." But while this may be true, it misunderstands my point, because I do not look down on those who are keen on forming kinship and registering genealogies; on the contrary, I sincerely praise them. This only reinforces the greatness of the power of shared surnames, which has existed since ancient times in foreign countries as well.

However, foreign affairs are ultimately too vague, so let us turn back and talk about ourselves.

In some organizations, a particular surname dominates, from leaders to servants, most of whom share that surname. Some people call these organizations "family shrines of that surname," believing that this is inappropriate. However, I believe this is harmless: did we not have "General Yue's Army," "General Yang's Family," and "General Xue's Family" in ancient times? Moreover, the world has always been controlled by a single surname. Those who share a certain surname and follow the ancient ways are truly people of antiquity! People of antiquity! The dead are always good, and the ancients are especially good—if not "former kings," then at least "ancient people." We really should not recklessly criticize them.

Therefore, I not only agree with those who vigorously cultivate the power of shared surnames, but also want to offer some suggestions for their reference. I wonder what they think:

If the surname is "Kong," one can bring in "Kong Ming" and "Kong Que" (peacock) as close relatives, because those with the surnames "Zhu" and "Ge" have already looked up to Mr. Wolong (Zhuge Liang). Naturally, we with the surname "Kong" can follow suit and not lag behind. As for the "peacock," Yang Xiu of the Han Dynasty had long called it Confucius's domestic fowl. Similarly, those with the surname "Yang" can, as Kong Qun said, regard "Yangmei" (waxberry) as their family fruit; those with the surname "Han" can invite "Han Lu" (a famous hunting dog) into the clan... In this way, the power of your esteemed surname will become even more formidable, and everyone will look at you with awe, daring not to show disrespect.

A scholar with the surname "Liang" refused to acknowledge "Bo Yi" and "Tai Su" as his ancestors but was willing to claim "Lvzhu" and "Hongyu" (famous courtesans) as his ancestral aunts. Another clerk with the surname "Jiang" refused to casually establish kinship but claimed to be a descendant of "Jiang Zhushan" (a famous artist). These people are truly beyond foolish and deserve to be unsuccessful for life.

### Underwater Farmland

— Ji

Several years ago, the Dutch government, due to the scarcity of land and large population, fought against the sea, spending huge sums of money to build a massive dam several miles from the coast. Then, they pumped out the water, leveled the land with soil, and it has now become a fertile field. This was all due to the Netherlands' world-leading hydraulic engineering, and its success and boldness are admirable. The Netherlands spent enormous manpower and resources to obtain a small piece of land, which reflects the preciousness of land in Europe. So, is it not a waste of natural resources to possess vast lands, fail to utilize them, and leave them barren, benefiting no one? The current issue of Magazine Digest reprinted an article from the London "Tingshe" newspaper, which records the situation of this new land. It is very interesting, and I will translate it below:

In the Netherlands, there is a place that was seabed eight years ago and is now a prosperous rural area. A few days ago, I had a pleasant conversation with a Dutch farmer who lived there. The farmhouses within the area were all built by the government, each with a granary and cow shed, arranged very cleanly. The farmer invited me to see their black and white cows, about thirty in total, lined up in a brightly lit shed. Next to each one was a copper can, and they would use their noses to lift the can's lid, then touch a mechanism, and clear water would flow out. This is not a tall tale; I personally witnessed their actions. Around the farmhouses, the land is flat, with fields crisscrossing, stretching endlessly. I have never seen such an orderly wilderness in any village I have visited. Even more, white and bright red farmhouses, like scattered stars, dotted the landscape, complementing each other. On the quiet brick roads, cars often sped past. All this makes it hard to imagine that just a few years ago, this place was seabed.

In this underwater farmland, there is now running water and electricity, and telephones will be available next year. All this comfort and safety depend on the 26-mile-long dam built on the coast of the Dutch West Sea, which blocks the waters of the North Sea and transforms the Zuyder Zee into a clear lake, at least the part of the lake that has not yet been reclaimed.

Before completing the great project, the Dutch government built small islands in the sea, and then gradually expanded the dikes until they formed a narrow opening. The rapid currents of the North Sea rushed into this narrow opening, with great force. Closing this narrow opening was extremely difficult; each time stones and gravel were poured down, they were swept away by the sea. But time after time, the narrow opening was finally closed successfully, and now the waters of the North Sea have succumbed to it. Farmers till the fields peacefully, and women sit quietly at home, listening to the radio broadcasts, enjoying the happiness of a pleasant countryside. They told me that it took six months to pump out the water from the first bay, and then two years to extract the salt contained in the soil. Initially, because the soil was loose and wet, horses could not be used for plowing, so machines were used instead. Since then, fields of barley, wheat, and rye have gradually appeared. Because this land was formed from the sea, many strange problems have arisen, one of which is the fish problem. For example, the fish of the Zuyder Zee were originally saltwater fish, but now they have become freshwater fish.

### Depth and Originality

— Ding Di

In times of suffering, to raise the banner of freedom and liberation, to write about the moving and inspiring deeds of brave warriors, the great achievements of success, or the painful sacrifices, to explore the hearts of countless vibrant souls, to transfer their hurried breaths amidst gunfire and bullets onto paper, to expose those walking corpses wearing masks whose insides are already rotten, to strip away their ugly coverings—whether you are sculpting a beautiful monument or exposing the ugliness of a depraved soul, you need to delve deeper, so that readers sing praises for beauty and gnash their teeth at ugliness.

Naturally, not only now, the primary function of literature has always been to infect the reader. A capable and conscientious writer would never want readers to remain indifferent after seeing their work. Often, the success of a work lies in captivating the reader's spirit. They can understand the author's emotions and reproduce the author's artistic conception. Therefore, the author's efforts are not in vain; the more they strive, the more the reader benefits.

There are naturally many factors that move the reader. Leaving aside the degree of appreciation, from the author's perspective, there are roughly the skill of technique, the richness of life experience, the burst of inspiration, and the depth of observation. Among these factors, in my opinion, deeper observation is the most crucial, and in the current situation, where some literature and art are somewhat formulaic, we also need this tonic.

Despite the fact that the content of our literature and art has a common tendency, the faces presented should never be imitative and identical. This means that despite "convergence," there must be "divergence."

The impression of vagueness is often due to the author's perfunctoriness and negligence. If one cannot extract the core when observing a situation, and the analysis of personality is not deep enough, clinging to the surface, coupled with the inheritance of language, one often unknowingly uses many established phrases. This is naturally a lazy thing, but everyone is prone to laziness due to the influence of educational forces. Especially in the current stage of the War of Resistance literature and art, we have many opportunities to see the same type of writing. We have read a lot in this magazine and that supplement. Inadvertently, we accept the inheritance of culture. If we are not careful, we will mix the characters from other people's articles into our own when we write, and unconsciously use the established vocabulary. As a result, you cannot concentrate all your efforts to create a "unique personality." Your "personality" appears ordinary, popular, and without any special characteristics.

Wordsworth said in the preface to Lyrical Ballads: "To throw over common things a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect." These words seem mysterious, but in fact, they are simply asking us to avoid the commonplace. As long as we can carefully appreciate, extracting pearls from the keel dragon, there is fundamentally nothing commonplace in the world. It is only through similarity that there is the commonplace; similarity is still due to your lack of depth. It can be seen that as long as the author is patient and can extract differences from the ordinary, everything ordinary can be transformed into the extraordinary. This extraordinary is your originality.

Finally, I must briefly mention the method of delving deeper. According to Wordsworth, imagination can be used, but this is only suitable for the method of symbolism, and it is only suitable for poetry. At least in our modern China, we need to face the vast reality before us.

Let me transcribe a passage from Maupassant citing Flaubert to illustrate the method of delving deeper: "Talent is long patience! It is a matter of gazing intently and attentively for a long time at what one wants to express, in order to discover in it an aspect that has not yet been seen or said by anyone. Because when we use our own eyes, we inevitably recall the opinions of our predecessors on what we are looking at. So, in everything, there are still unexplored places. Even the most trivial things contain a little bit of the unknown. Go find it. In order to describe a burning fire, and a tree growing on the plain, we must keep facing this fire and this tree, until they appear different in our eyes from any other tree and any other fire." Go find it. What should we face?

For the sake of depth and originality, if possible, you should still see more of reality, so as not to build a cart behind closed doors at home.

### Hometown Rain

— Wei Ming

After a long and frantic run, I have finally stopped to catch my breath here.

×, you must be laughing at me. Yes, I myself don't understand why. I have changed, and often I am lost in thought alone for a long time, without saying or moving, staring blankly at the white clouds or stars. Being in such a "cage," surrounded by gloom, everything looks like it has been coated with a layer of dark gray when I look out of the window. So, I too feel like I have been painted with a heavy dark gray, and I feel waves of coldness coming over me.

You know that I deeply love the rain in my hometown, and recently I have missed it even more. When a person is lonely, memories of the past naturally come to mind. Even trivial and ridiculous things can make me nostalgic, and now is the season of rain in my hometown!

…

When the sunlight timidly withdraws the gold smeared on the tips of the willows, and the whirlwind whistles, tightening one moment and then tightening again, it is like rain that nourishes the soul! I call it rain that nourishes the soul not without reason, and I need it! Receiving its invitation, I hold my beloved book and lie on the cot in the bamboo garden behind the house, quietly listening to the subtle sound of the rain, as if played on the strings of the heart, savoring the mournful and beautiful verses. My attention is divided equally between them.

Drip! Drip, falling on the sharp, vividly colored leaves that seem about to melt, as if telling an ancient and sweet story, and then falling again, each time bursting with round and clear sounds. Opening my eyes, a flash of white light jumps over, which is the small stream surrounding the bamboo garden, as crystal clear as a beautiful silver ribbon. Raindrops touch its face, and immediately smiling ripples leap, letting the drizzle caress my hair. I truly understand the meaning of "the wise find joy in water."

I also like the refreshing and comfortable atmosphere after the rain, the dazzling green of the washed leaves, and the small grass that grows more tenderly and angrily.

I don't have the courage to recall, and writing to you, I am complaining in a painful tone, and also raising a faint sorrow like light clouds.

×, you should understand me.

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

4.  The Difficulty of the Shu Road

Passing the Stone Buddha Mountain, one gradually enters deep mountains and high valleys, and the further one goes, the more imposing the mountains become. There are no signs of human habitation or trees on all sides, but only towering stone walls, soaring into the clouds, which give people a sense of grandeur. The road winds and twists, climbing the mountain peaks, so the car travels very slowly. We are intoxicated by the scenery around us, forgetting how long we have been driving. Presently, we found that we had climbed to the top of the mountain. Looking down, the cliffs were thousands of feet, and we could not see the bottom. No matter how healthy and strong-hearted a person is, after seeing this bottomless and dangerous scene, they will immediately feel weak and unable to support themselves. The driver, although accustomed to and familiar with such dangerous roads, of course, dares not look aside at all. Because if he glances to the side, his heart will be happy, his eyes will be blurred, and he will drive the car to the bottom of the valley, turning both people and the car into shattered pieces. Arriving at this point, only those few courageous passengers dare to take a look. After seeing it, you say a sentence, he says a sentence, saying how dangerous it is, and what would happen if we fell down. The old woman, about fifty years old, with five children, both boys and girls, said superstitiously:

"Don't talk too much! Don't be talkative! Everyone is safe."

Her second and third daughters, although only thirteen or fourteen years old, were very naughty. They said:

"Mom, we want to see."

The young male passenger next to her immediately grabbed the small girl's hands, saying:

"Little sister, don't look down, look up, there are white clouds flying around the mountain, birds singing, and the sun, which is both warm and bright."

The mother immediately followed up, saying:

"Sun! Sun! The sun shines on us all the way, safe and sound, home." (To be continued)

### Illness Enters from Within: He Ruitang's Broadcast Speech on Cholera Prevention and Treatment; Cholera Cases in Hong Kong Show a Gradual Spread This Week; Certificates Required for Travel to Macau and Vietnam

Recently, cholera has broken out in Hong Kong and is spreading rapidly. There have been several deaths as a result. To alert the community to the importance of prevention, Mr. He Gantang delivered a broadcast speech last night at 8 p.m., highlighting the importance of cholera prevention. The original text is as follows:

Cholera is Dangerous, and Its Harm is the Most Severe

Brothers and sisters, tonight I am entrusted by the government's Chief Medical Officer Situ Yongjue to speak about the dangers of cholera, as well as methods of prevention and treatment. Cholera is a disease characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and cramps, and its harm is the most severe. It spreads extremely quickly because it originates internally from exposure to cold and heat, as well as from toxins. This leads to muscle spasms, exhaustion, and often death. The source of the disease is actually caused by a type of bacteria that contaminates things that are drunk or eaten (especially drinking water, milk, or fruits or vegetables) and invades the human body. It usually occurs from May or June in the summer until October or November. Moreover, the population of Hong Kong has increased by approximately 700,000 from 1937 to this year, and the population density is high. Therefore, in 1937, the number of cholera cases reached more than 1,600. Last year, after I gave a detailed speech on this disease on the broadcast, the authorities strictly prohibited the sale of cold foods and peeled or rotten fruits, herbal jelly, bean curd jelly, etc., and informed residents to get cholera vaccinations free of charge, which was a great help in eliminating cholera. Furthermore, residents actively assisted the authorities in jointly managing the situation, so in 1938, there were only more than 500 cases throughout the year, which was two-thirds less than in 1937. This year, the disease has occurred again, and as of yesterday, there were 79 cases. We still hope that everyone will take the same precautions as before to prevent the spread of this disease. Now, I will announce the various prevention methods again, so that everyone is aware:

Be Careful with Food and Drink to Prevent Infection

The most important prevention method is to never eat raw vegetables. They must be cooked thoroughly before they can be eaten. Raw fruits, especially those that have been cut open or have rotten peels, should be avoided. Even raw fruits with peels should be eaten sparingly. Clams, raw oysters, raw shrimp, and raw fish must also be cooked before eating. Water and milk, or cream, must also be boiled before drinking. Ice cream, frozen jelly, herbal jelly, bean curd jelly, *wentouluo*, ice water, etc., are all harmful and should not be eaten. However, ice cream and soda water that are produced by well-known stores and have undergone disinfection can be consumed. Not only should one be careful with food and drink, but also the chopsticks, bowls, plates, knives, forks, cups, and other utensils used for cooking in the kitchen should be washed thoroughly with boiling water and dried before use. The most effective way to spread this disease is through flies, ants, centipedes, etc. Because flies like to gather on feces, garbage, and the most unclean and rotten things, they spread the cholera bacteria to food. If you are not careful with your diet, you can easily get infected. If you see flies gathering on cooked vegetables, do not eat them. If you think it is a pity to throw them away, then cook the vegetables again before eating them. If someone has cholera, not only is their life at stake, but also the clothes and bedding they have worn and used must be washed with disinfectant water or sterilized with sulfur before they can be used again. If there is no flush toilet in the house, the used waste buckets must be tightly covered, as must the garbage cans, to prevent flies from spreading the infection.

Public Hospitals Offer Free Injections

As for the best way to prevent infection with this disease, it is best to get a cholera vaccination in advance. Within five months after the vaccination, you can avoid infection with this disease. Even if you do get infected, it will be in a small number of cases, and the symptoms will be easier to treat. Currently, a large number of cholera vaccines and medicines have been shipped and distributed to residents for vaccination, free of charge, and without pain. There is no need to panic. There may be some slight pain, but it will only last for a few hours. If you apply a hot water-soaked towel to your mouth at this time, you can stop the pain. Residents of Hong Kong who wish to get vaccinated to avoid infection with this disease can go to: (1) Queen Mary Hospital, (2) the old site of the National Hospital on Queen's Road, opposite the Ko Shing Theatre, (3) Tung Wah Hospital, (4) Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, (5) West Point Public Medical Office, 105 Third Street, (6) Central District Public Medical Office, 3 Aberdeen Street, (7) Eastern District Public Medical Office, Stone Nullah Lane, Wan Chai, (8) Lady Grantham Health Centre, Johnston Road, (9) Shau Kei Wan Public Medical Office. Residents of the opposite shore can go to: (1) Kowloon Hospital, (2) Kwong Wah Hospital, (3) Ma Tei Public Medical Office, Kansu Street, (4) Hung Hom Public Medical Office, Kwun Yum Temple Street, (5) Sham Shui Po Public Medical Office, (6) Kowloon City Public Medical Office, Kak Hang Tsuen Road, (7) Yuen Long Public Medical Office, (8) Tai Po Public Medical Office. One vaccination per person is sufficient. If residents can afford it, please consult a doctor for vaccination to avoid overcrowding at the public vaccination centers. If you have been infected with this disease, it is best to go to the National Hospital, Tung Wah Hospital, or Kwong Wah Hospital for treatment. Otherwise, please consult a Western doctor, or a Chinese person who has studied Western medicine and has a license. Because it is the rule in Hong Kong, it must be done this way.

Consult a Doctor and Make Accommodations

Because many residents are poor and have difficulty finding a Western doctor, and sometimes there are no beds available in hospitals, I have discussed the situation with the health officials and requested accommodation. If the patient is in critical condition in the middle of the night or during the day, can a Chinese medicine practitioner be allowed to treat them? However, after the treatment, the Chinese medicine practitioner or a relative of the patient should immediately, or on the following day, report to the Royal Health Officer on the third floor of the Post Office so that it can be registered. After registration, the Royal [Officer] will definitely take the patient to the infectious disease hospital in Kennedy Town, Sai Wan, or Lai Chi Kok on the opposite shore. After three or four days, they will be allowed to return home, so as to prevent the patient from infecting the residents on the same floor. This method has been approved and is hereby announced, so that all residents can follow this method to avoid violating Hong Kong law, which is of utmost importance. This year, more than 100,000 people have already been vaccinated at the above locations. In addition, there are many residents who can afford to consult a doctor for vaccination themselves. Residents of Hong Kong often like to bathe in the sea in the hot summer, but it is not advisable to bathe in seawater that is not far from the city and is clean, because recently, many new buildings in Hong Kong have water closets, and the old sewage flows into the sea, causing the water at the seaside to be slightly unclean. If you get infected, you can also get sick. I hope that all men and women will do their best to follow the methods of vaccination and prevention mentioned in this article, and work together to avoid too much spread. If we do not take precautions, and if cholera becomes severely prevalent, all countries will inevitably recognize Hong Kong as a plague port. Ships departing from Hong Kong to other ports will have to enter quarantine to carry out epidemic prevention work. In this case, both passengers and shipping companies will suffer losses. Therefore, ships coming to and from Hong Kong will inevitably have to increase fares to compensate. As a result, food prices in Hong Kong will inevitably rise, and many unfavorable circumstances will occur at the same time. This is just one example. Given these advantages and disadvantages, I earnestly hope that compatriots will work together to prevent and eradicate cholera. First, we can protect our own lives. Second, we can protect social harmony. Third, we can protect the prosperity of Hong Kong. This is my sincere hope.

Macau Epidemic Prevention Starts on the 19th

The Macau authorities have decided to implement epidemic prevention measures from the 19th of this month. Yesterday, they issued a notice stating that passengers arriving in Macau by ship or plane from cholera-affected areas (including Hong Kong) must carry a doctor's certificate with a photo attached. It is valid from six days after the date of the vaccination for four months. Those going to Macau must comply with the new regulations, otherwise they will not be allowed to land.

Vietnam Strictly Checks Certificates

In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the Vietnamese health authorities have recently stipulated that passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Vietnam must obtain a doctor's examination certificate in Hong Kong in advance and be vaccinated against smallpox and other epidemic diseases before being allowed to enter the country, otherwise they will be returned on the same ship. After receiving this notice from Vietnam, shipping companies in Hong Kong also require passengers traveling to Vietnam to have a doctor's certificate before they can purchase a ticket. However, some people in the community do not have time to see a doctor and purchase a ticket in Hong Kong, so they borrow other people's certificates to replace them, which is discovered by the Vietnamese authorities and they are not allowed to land. At the same time, the examination of doctors' certificates upon entry has been strengthened. Overseas Chinese going to Vietnam should pay attention to avoid losses.

### Report on Current Diseases

According to the Medical Department's report, in the past 24 hours, two cases of cholera, twenty-four cases of tuberculosis, eight cases of measles, four cases of dysentery, three cases of typhoid fever, two cases of cerebrospinal meningitis, and one case of diphtheria were found in this hospital.

### Commemoration of the "July 7th" Incident Two Weeks Later; The Student Relief Association Presents a Portrait of Chairman Chiang; Can Be Sent Out Before the First of Next Month

The Hong Kong Student Relief Association recently held an executive committee meeting to discuss the commemoration of the second anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance. As a result, it was decided to launch a campaign to present a portrait of Chairman Chiang, the significance of which is to commemorate the hard work and meritorious achievements of the supreme leader, to raise funds to comfort the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines, and to achieve two goals at once. The portraits are divided into two types: three-dimensional plaster statues and badge-shaped photographic impressions. The former will be distributed to various associations, schools, and shops for decoration, while the latter will be distributed to individuals to wear on this day to commemorate their past. The association has been actively carrying out this resolution for several days, and it is expected that it can be sent out before the first of next month.

### Police Officer Bribery Case; Trial Opened Yesterday Afternoon; Secretary of Xie An Proves the Use of 100 Dollars; Judge Orders the Case to Be Adjourned Until This Afternoon for Retrial

The case of Ruan Zhaoji, the interpreter of the Hung Hom Police Station, and Yi Huashi, the British assistant officer, who were accused of soliciting bribes from Liu Xiyu, caused a sensation for a time. People in Hong Kong believed that the Hong Kong authorities were strictly enforcing official regulations and reforming officialdom. The fact that a British deputy officer was accused in court, and that his crime was soliciting bribes, was unprecedented in Hong Kong since its opening. Therefore, when the Kowloon Magistrate's Court continued the trial yesterday afternoon, even more people came to observe. The court opened, and first, Yin Weixian, the interpreter of the Hung Hom Police Station, testified, saying that at 7:10 a.m. on April 23, he saw a bus ticket seller and the plaintiff come to the police station together. He had met the plaintiff before, but did not know his name. Then, the officer on duty ordered him to inquire about the dispute between the two parties. However, the officer on duty was busy preparing a report. Later, he saw the British police officer Feidun enter the police station, and he immediately ordered Feidun to inquire about the case. After a while, he saw the officer on duty leave the detention center, and the plaintiff was standing in front of his writing desk. At 10:15 a.m., the first defendant returned to the station from outside to be on duty. About two minutes later, he also went off duty. After answering the cross-examination of Shao Yali, the lawyer representing the first defendant, he continued to answer the cross-examination of Xiao Zhongshi, the lawyer representing the second defendant, the British deputy officer Yi Huashi, saying that after the officer instructed him to order the bus ticket seller to leave, he did not see Ruan Zhaoji take the plaintiff into the Chinese detective's office. He continued to say that the officer on duty was as usual that day. At this time, he was busy with his work, so he did not pay attention. The officer on duty had returned to the police station several times that morning. In short, his observation that day made him feel that the officer on duty did not intend to sue Liu Xiyu.

Next, Wu Daxing testified, saying that he had been transferred to the Hung Hom Police Station for two months. On April 23, he was on duty from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. During this time, he had arrested a hawker and returned to the police station, but the Chinese interpreter was no longer at the police station. It was not until 10:50 a.m. that he saw the first defendant, Ruan Zhaoji, return to the police station from outside. Then, Jia Lidengtang, the British Detective Chief Superintendent, said that on the morning of April 23, he happened to be at the Yau Ma Tei Police Station. At 8:10 a.m., the British officer Yi Huashi called him from the Hung Hom Police Station, saying that an old man had used two counterfeit one-mao coins, and a bus ticket seller refused to use them. The man then gave him a ten-dollar bill, but the ticket seller refused to give him change, and said that the two parties had arrived at the police station. He saw his report and instructed him to investigate the person's history in detail. By 9:30 a.m., Yi Huashi called him again, saying that although the man had two counterfeit coins, he had a job and worked for the Whampoa Dock. He ordered him to release the person. Later, on May 4, he asked Yi Huashi to take a statement. At that time, Yi Yishi said that he was suspected of being involved in the case, and he had to consult a lawyer before answering. When the case was filed on May 25, Yi Huashi said that he denied the crime he was accused of this time, and he reserved all defenses. Then, Liang Jiejuan testified that at one o'clock that morning, he saw the plaintiff and a young man enter the Xie An Club together. When they arrived at the building, Liu suddenly asked the secretary Ma Qi to borrow 100 yuan in cash. Ma counted it and gave it to him. When Liu took out a ten-dollar bill from his body and placed it together with the one-hundred-dollar bill, the young man immediately said, "Isn't it 120 yuan?" But the young man eventually took away the 110 yuan. Later, during the identification, he recognized that the young man was the current first defendant. Finally, Ma Qi, the secretary of the Xie An Club, testified that the plaintiff had asked him for 100 yuan in cash that day. After he gave it to him, he wrote on the ledger, "Paid Liu Nian (i.e., the plaintiff) 100 yuan." Next to it, he also wrote the word "police officer." At this point, the judge ordered the case to be adjourned until this afternoon for retrial.

### War of Resistance Photography Exhibition Opens Today

The War of Resistance Photography Exhibition organized by the Guangdong and Hong Kong Branch of the Military Service Committee of the National Youth Association has been prepared and will open today for twenty consecutive days. It will be held at the Chinese Youth Association on Bi Lie Shi Street and the Kowloon Branch (June 15 to June 24 at the Hong Kong Youth Association, June 25 to July 4 at the Kowloon Youth Association). This photography exhibition has extremely magnificent content. Each frame has been strictly selected, and the themes are rich in War of Resistance propaganda materials. The photographic techniques are also very exquisite. It is a rare masterpiece. At the same time, the Youth Association also has flea play performances, which is also a refreshing art. Spectators can visit and achieve two goals at once.

### Imperial Airways Plane Takes Off and Gets Stuck in Mud; Delayed for Two Hours

At 7:00 a.m. on the 13th, the Imperial Airways plane, the "Philippine", departed from Kai Tak Airport for Singapore. There was only one female passenger on board, who was returning to England. However, during the takeoff run, it suddenly got stuck in the mud and was stuck and difficult to move. It was ordered that coolies dig out the mud and push the plane onto hard ground before it could take off. It was delayed for two hours. The "Delia" was damaged in Annam some time ago. It has now been repaired and arrived in Hong Kong on the 13th, but it was an empty plane without mail or passengers.

### Bizarre Blood Case on Peking Road; Involving a Young Girl; Woman's House Found with the Deceased's Shirt; Police Authorities Are Conducting a Thorough Investigation

At 5:30 a.m. on the 11th, a foreign man was found injured and lying on the ground in front of a certain number at the intersection of Peking Road and Hankow Road in Kowloon. Passers-by discovered him and reported it to the police on duty, who sent him to the hospital in a Red Cross ambulance. He died of his injuries en route. Afterwards, it was found that the deceased was the American Jin Beier, an employee of the China Aviation Machinery Trading Company. Details have been published in the newspapers. Recently, the police authorities, in order to thoroughly investigate the cause of death, have dispatched detectives to investigate separately. According to the information obtained, when Jin was found injured, a young girl in a cheongsam with disheveled hair ran away from the scene, which was quite suspicious. As for the deceased's whereabouts that night, he had a small drink at the Peninsula Hotel at 1:00 a.m. that day, but he was not drunk and was very conscious. At 4:00 a.m. that morning, someone saw him at the "Cao Jiage Lao" Hotel. It has not been possible to find out when he left, or what happened until the incident. According to the deceased's friends, the deceased was neatly dressed when he went out that night, but when he was found injured on the road, he was only wearing a shirt and trousers. According to Western news, the deceased's coat was found by detectives in a woman's house yesterday, and the deceased's letters in the Western Youth Association were also taken away by the police authorities for investigation. This case has been handed over to Detective Deputy Ninghan for handling.

### Overseas Chinese Who Care About the Motherland Should Accept a New Baptism; Highly Recommend "War of Resistance China"; Premiering Today at the Central Theatre

— Qi Zhuo

This is good news:

"War of Resistance China" is produced by the Central Film Studio. The sound, lighting... and conditions of film art are all very satisfactory. In terms of content, it is the facts of the struggling China and the newborn China. The film was recently screened at the Central Theatre to invite cultural circles, making viewers feel like they were thrown into the arms of the motherland. The whole atmosphere was tense and inspiring. Everyone was warmed by the light, evaporating with the glory of victory. Starting today, "War of Resistance China" will be officially released at the Central Theatre. In order to allow our beloved overseas Chinese to receive a new baptism from the motherland, the reporter has an unshirkable duty to give readers a general report:

"War of Resistance China" is divided into five episodes: It is composed of the latest newsreels and war zone films.

The first episode, Sha Wang took office in Chongqing, showing unprecedented national unity. The Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League participated in the tree planting ceremony, symbolizing "ten years to plant trees, a hundred years to cultivate people" is our grand plan. After watching the National Oath, we can discover the great power lurking in every corner. The annual meeting of the Literary Association and Lao She's work report are undoubtedly a cordial encouragement to our cultural workers. How innocent and lively are the little masters in Children's Day, and how exciting is the army comfort in Baishi.

The second episode, after the bombing by the enemy, the ruthless flames are burning fiercely. The ruined walls and dead bodies make people feel heartbroken and sad. "Only hatred," one only has revenge, "War of Resistance to the end," "an eye for an eye," with passionate and powerful oaths, causing the audience to resonate, and applause thundered. The British Consulate in Chongqing was also bombed, letting those with eyes see the true face of the enemy. Young girls and students diligently sew clothes for the soldiers on the expedition. After the bombing, the service team distributed relief tea and porridge. The military and civilians are integrated, which is so inspiring.

The third episode, is the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Chairman Chiang and party and state leaders such as Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, Chen Cheng... appeared on the screen, and bursts of applause reflected the people's love for the leaders and senior generals. Chairman Chiang's firm and earnest instructions made the entire audience feel as if they were being trained in person. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session stated: "The party itself must be hardworking, humble, brave, and courageous." I sincerely hope that party members will follow the leader's intentions and set an example. Our compatriots across the country must also practice what they advocate, encourage each other, and the corrupt China is dead! A lively China is reborn!

The fourth episode, has liveliness in solemnity, and interest in tension. The New Life Exhibition, in addition to telling us that domestic medicines and machinery have made great strides towards science, the rationalized clothing, food, housing, and transportation are also very interesting. The simple and neat men's and women's clothing proudly indicate: "This is our China!" The Chinese and Western buffet is also a good phenomenon of progress. Sanitary housing is showing the future new China, which will improve the living standards of the masses in this way. Mass weddings, needless to say, are also an interesting scene.

During the women's donation campaign, in addition to Mrs. Chiang's speech, Chairman Chiang also gave a speech in the midst of enthusiastic applause. There is a long time to look up to the dignity of the leader, which can satisfy the hopes of every citizen. After being inspired by the leader, they are more optimistic about the future of the country.

The concert of the Lizhi Society played very pleasant and moving music. In the song "War of Resistance to the End" sung by the chorus, the slogan "If you have a gun, take a gun, if you have a pen, take a pen" shows us that "400 million people are of one mind" is also imprinted in the minds of every audience.

The fifth episode, is the prelude to victory. It has "Clouds of the South China Sea" and the real scenes of Guangzhou and Wuhan, evoking our memories of our homeland. The applause was the most enthusiastic when the guerrillas and regular army charged into the enemy positions. This is a sign of returning our homeland.

There is also the Victory Celebration Conference of the military and civilians in Southern Shanxi, the wonderful performance of the cavalry, the civil righteousness of the Red Spear Society, the prisoner-of-war camp in Xi'an, and the flag献 by the Hui people in the Northwest to participate in the War of Resistance, all of which are rare and vivid materials.

Our motherland is fighting so hard, so great, so bright, and so progressive. I sincerely hope that all overseas Chinese who do not forget their roots will visit "War of Resistance China" and receive a new baptism from the motherland!

### Police Detectives Searched Dart Entertainment Venues Last Night; Four Arrested and Released on Bail Pending Trial; Prosperity Resumes as Usual After Police Depart

When "dart entertainment venues" first appeared in Hong Kong, there were only a few in Central. However, in a short period of time, they have spread throughout Sai Wan and Wan Chai, with an estimated number of no less than several hundred throughout Hong Kong. Although the organizers of this type of dart game euphemistically call it "entertainment with great prizes," it actually contains an element of gambling. The prize system is ostensibly a gift, but in reality, it is a deceptive trick. Many ignorant women, children, apprentices, and servants are attracted to these "entertainment venues," indulging in them day and night, wasting money and time. The harm is even greater than that of "zi fa" and "zi dan." Moreover, in these types of venues, criminals mingle, and disputes often arise due to gambling competition, affecting local order. Members of society hope that the government will strictly ban these venues to maintain public safety. The police authorities have also paid close attention to the rapid rise of "dart venues." The night before last, between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM, the Central Police Station suddenly dispatched a patrol car with an officer leading a group of policemen to dart stalls in Gough Street, Gage Street, and Stanley Street in Central District for a surprise inspection. At that time, men and women gathered at the stalls to gamble, and upon seeing the police detectives, they scattered and fled in disarray. The police detectives searched the stalls and arrested two people in charge and two gamblers, taking them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were brought before Magistrate Arthur Edwards at the Central Magistracy. The men, surnamed Wen and Chen, were charged with operating dart venues on Aberdeen Street and Stanley Street. Huang and Li were charged with gambling. Prosecutor Officer Hawkins requested that the court adjourn the case for one week before further hearings. The first two defendants were granted bail of $50 each, and the third and fourth defendants were granted bail of $3 each, pending trial. It was also noted that when the police detectives searched the dart venues, nearby dart venues closed their doors. However, after the police detectives left, they reopened and gamblers gathered again.

### Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Resolves Yesterday to Continue Operating the Library; Hong Kong's Only Library to Be Preserved; Expansion Due to Economic Constraints Difficult to Realize

The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a general meeting of members yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM on the fourth floor of the association's building. Attendees included Chairman Li Xingqu and dozens of others. After the meeting began, the treasurer first read the meeting notice, followed by Chairman Li Xingqu announcing the purpose of the meeting. Then, discussion items began: (1) Approval of last year's yearbook: Proposed by Chen Jianbo, seconded by Gao Liangqing (passed); (2) Election of ten supervisors to manage the 14th Board of Directors election: Lei Yin-sun, Liu Jingqing, Zhou Xingchi, Feng Qizhuo, Xing Yuming, Ma Boping, Cao Fuzhao, Du Zewen, Chen Zhongchi, and Li Zhuoquan were nominated on the spot; (4) Setting the date for ballot closing, verification, and counting: After the general meeting, the supervisors held a temporary meeting and decided that July 4th would be the ballot closing date, July 5th would be the ballot verification date, and July 6th would be the ballot counting date; (5) Discussion of relocating the library: Attendees paid special attention to this issue, and everyone strongly advocated that it should not be relocated and should continue to be operated on the fourth floor of the association's building. Zhou Xingchi spoke first, saying that the association's library has been established for ten years. Several years ago, the number of people visiting the library to read books increased daily, and seats were often unavailable. At that time, Ou Zesen suggested expansion and proposed renting neighboring buildings to expand the space. However, after several negotiations, an agreement could not be reached, so the matter was dropped. This is the only Chinese cultural organization in Hong Kong, with ten years of history to date. If it were to be moved to another location, even if it were not closed, the new location would be the Confucius Society, and the location of that society is not as good as this association. It is better to continue to preserve and operate it in its current location. Chen Jianbo then said that according to the library's budget over the past few years, it has not been exceeded since 1935. This shows that whether the library is relocated or not has no bearing on the budget. At the same time, the association's location is convenient, and the number of people coming to read books is increasing with time. If it were to be moved to the Confucius Society, transportation would be inconvenient and access would be difficult. It is believed that the number of readers would decrease, which would run counter to the original intention of establishing the association. Several years ago, due to the problem of limited space, old newspapers were moved to the rooftop and the purchase of new books was stopped to avoid occupying more space. Deng Yutang said that since the association's library was established in 1929, it has continued to operate until now and has been praised by the community. We should do our best to promote it to avoid tarnishing the past reputation of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. In my humble opinion, we should solicit donations to expand the library so that the association can become a leading organization in the business community. The association's rental income from the second floor is only a little over a thousand dollars per year. The association also donates this amount to the University of Hong Kong. It would be better to take back this income, move the third-floor office to the first floor, and expand the third floor into a library so that people from all walks of life can have a large space to consult books and newspapers. As for the budget, we can assess the situation at the time and consider donations. This type of cultural organization should not only not be relocated, but should also be expanded to accommodate more readers, especially in today's Hong Kong, where there are millions of Chinese people and only this small library for reading. The chairman expressed great sympathy for Deng's suggestion, saying that the library established by the association is indeed inadequate, with limited space and a lack of books. It should have been expanded into a grand library long ago to live up to the expectations of the community. However, the economic issue is the most important factor for every undertaking. I hope everyone will work together and make donations to make it happen, and not just make empty promises. Ou Zesen then proposed to keep the library in its current location and continue to operate it, which was unanimously approved. Finally, the issue of restoring elevator access for readers was discussed. As a result, it was decided that it could not be restored because the elevator was too old, had been in disrepair for a long time, and there were concerns that it would be overloaded and cause danger if too many people came to read books. The meeting was then adjourned.

### Our Army Continuously Victorious in Jiangcun New Street Area; Approximately Two Thousand in Yue Road New Street Area

(North Red Express News) The Guangdong North troops have recently received reinforcements, plotting unusual movements. However, our army is using mobile tactics to attack, causing the enemy to be contained everywhere and exhausted. On the 9th, a certain division of our army launched an attack towards Hengtan near Xinjie, with small gains. The battle situation is as follows:

Enemy Reinforcements to Jiangcun

On the morning of the 9th, enemy troops on the Yue Road front line arrived in Jiangcun in a military vehicle loaded with enemy soldiers from the Ishii area to reinforce them. The unit number is the Suzuki unit of the 104th Division. Also on the same day, more than ten other enemy military vehicles, carrying 500 soldiers and supplies, arrived from Guangzhou North to Renge and Longxiang. According to statistics, in the past week, the enemy has reinforced the Huaxian and Yue Road New Street areas with approximately two thousand soldiers. However, this is only for defensive purposes. The original enemy soldiers stationed there have suffered heavy casualties due to our attacks and surprise attacks. Many corpses have been transported back to the Liuhua Bridge area in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou for cremation.

Our Attack on Hengtan

In addition, enemy forces in Longkouxiang have recently been attacked by our army. The remnants have retreated and replenished themselves in Hengtan, Yuzhongtan, and other places near Xinjie. On the afternoon of the 9th, the Wang regiment of our Zhao division launched an attack on the enemy troops in Hengtan, engaging in a fierce battle for two hours, annihilating over twenty enemy soldiers and seizing several guns. In recent days, fierce battles have continued near Xinjie. Our and enemy positions have changed along the village pond embankment, and the situation is intensely stalemate. Our local guerrillas have established very close contact with the army and have obtained sufficient ammunition replenishment, making them a strong force and repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy.

### Guerrillas Destroy Guangsan Road; Enemy Military Vehicle Derails at Shizi Dou; Over Ten Enemy Soldiers Killed, Enemy Army Sets Fire to Lion Mountain in Anger

(City Sea Urgent News) On the evening of the 6th, at around 8:00 PM, guerrillas from the Nanhai Sanshui area secretly removed fifteen pairs of railway tracks on the Guangsan Road between Shizi Bao and Xiaotang, and disguised the roadbed with wooden tracks to conceal the damage from the enemy. In the early morning of the 7th, a empty military vehicle loaded with military supplies to resupply the enemy troops in Sanshui traveled from the southwest towards the east through Fochu, carrying a small team of thirty soldiers. The enemy had not noticed anything beforehand. At 7:00 AM, when the vehicle arrived at the damaged section of wooden tracks in Xiaotang Shizi Dou, the tracks could not withstand the pressure and collapsed with a loud noise. The enemy military vehicle derailed and overturned. The enemy soldiers in the carriage were unable to escape and were crushed to death on the spot, killing over ten people. Around 8:00 AM, enemy troops from Foshan arrived, dispatched thirty engineers in vehicles to provide rescue and transport the wounded and dead enemy soldiers back to Foshan for treatment. They were incensed against the villagers.

After the enemy military vehicle was damaged, the enemy, filled with extreme resentment, sent over a hundred enemy soldiers to Lion Mountain, arbitrarily pointing fingers at the local villagers, indiscriminately shooting and killing people, and setting fire to over twenty civilian houses. They only withdrew at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.

### Chaoshan Area; Peaceful and Stable; Strictly Preventing Enemy from Feinting to the East and Attacking in the West

(Shantou Express News) Since the 12th of this month, the Shantou enemy fleet has added one large-caliber gunboat and one cruiser, all stationed outside Nan'ao, plus the two destroyers originally stationed outside Mamuyu, for a total of four vessels. On the 12th and 13th, the enemy dispatched boats to spy on the Mamuyu blockade line. Our garrison was on high alert, and the enemy did not succeed. Chaoshan is as peaceful as usual. According to a senior military official here, the enemy's spying on Mamuyu will not affect our defense. It is expected that the enemy's arrival may not be here. Rather, they are testing a feint to the east and attack in the west tactic, secretly launching an attack, and our military deployments everywhere have learned to strictly prevent this, and we can guarantee nothing will be lost.

### We Resolve to Launch Large-Scale Guerrilla Warfare on the Southern Front; Formulate Key Points of Guerrilla Warfare

(Shaoguan Express News) General Zhang Fakui, acting commander of the Fourth War Zone, following the instructions of the highest military authorities, adheres to the principle that guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare in the second phase of the war of resistance. He is determined to launch large-scale guerrilla warfare on the southern front. Recently, in addition to establishing a guerrilla command post to unify the command and dispatch of teams, he has also paid great attention to the political training of the guerrilla forces themselves and the research and improvement of strategic and tactical warfare. Yesterday, in conjunction with the headquarters of a certain army group, he compiled "Key Points of Guerrilla Warfare" and distributed them to the commanders of various regional columns to ensure that the most effective strategies are used to achieve the goals and tasks of guerrilla warfare.

### Xiaolan Tongren Hospital Destroyed by Enemy Bombing; Another Proof of Disregard for International Trust

(Zhongshan Express News) On the 12th, enemy warships shelled Xiaolan from the Shunde River surface, landing in the northwest area of Lan Town, collapsing the tiles and walls of two civilian houses. Fortunately, no one was injured. It was discovered that Tongren Hospital, which was founded by Americans and flies the American flag, is located in this area. It is run by American doctors and has achieved considerable success. It was harmed today. It can be seen that the enemy disregards international trust and acts recklessly. Fortunately, the patients in the hospital fled in sickness upon hearing the shelling, avoiding being bombed. There are still three enemy warships on the Yinggezui River surface, constantly shuttling back and forth, visible from a distance from Shakou in Zhongshan.

### Provincial Government Rectifies Bao Chiefs; Strengthens Resistance War; Improves Treatment and Secures Funding

### Group B Basketball Qualifiers for Finals; International Defeats Li Xing; Peiying Chunfeng Also Triumphs

Last night, three matches were held for the public men's Group B basketball qualifiers for the finals. In the first match, Guangzhong played Peiying. After a hard-fought battle, Guangzhong was defeated by a single move, losing 26-43. In the second match, Li Xing played International. Both teams are strong teams in this tournament. This battle is inevitably a contest for the championship and runner-up, so before the start of the game, it was expected that Li Xing would be victorious, as Li Xing has been invincible since its debut and its strength is extremely strong. Unexpectedly, after contact, the two sides fought fiercely. International went all out and maintained the advantage. Li Xing's entire team performed poorly in the first half. Lin Youpei and Huang Jiuwu's shots were inaccurate, and the defense was repeatedly broken by International's Li Fuqi, Li Bonian, and Yuan Fangtao. After breaking into the second half, Lin Youpei, Chen Yuting, Zhang Dezhang, and Chen Chengji all worked hard and once chased back to 33-34. Unfortunately, at the last moment, the defense was poor, and Li Bonian and Guo Si from International launched attacks from both sides, and Li Xing lost 33-38. Overall, both sides performed well in this game. International's offense and defense were suitable, while Li Xing's defense was weak, and the change of players and disordered scheduling were also the reasons for their defeat. In the final match, Huaxiong resisted Chunfeng. The two sides fought fiercely. The first half ended in a 27-27 tie. After changing sides, Huaxiong continued to press forward, but Chunfeng responded calmly, taking advantage of the opportunities to launch repeated attacks. After Huaxiong stubbornly resisted, they lacked energy, and Chunfeng's long-range and close-range shots were invincible. At the end of the game, they won a big victory with 59-46.

### School Volleyball Tournament; Southwest B Defeats Deming; Paul Defeats Yinghuang

Two junior-level school volleyball tournament games were held yesterday. In the first game, Southwest B played Deming. Southwest prepared carefully, while Deming's defense was not perfect and was repeatedly broken by Southwest. They lost the first game 16-21 first. Deming, seeing the loss, immediately tried to counterattack. Ou Xueguang, Situ Qin, Gao Zian, Wu Ganmin, and Zheng Hanxing launched attacks from five directions. Southwest's Rong Zequan, Liang Jinbiao, Liang Jinchang, and Liang Chuguan also worked together to resist, but Deming's momentum was strong and they won the second game 21-17. Taking advantage of the momentum, Deming frequently put pressure on Southwest. However, Southwest's army fought very hard and could not be attacked, while Southwest again took the third game 21-19. After that, Deming lacked stamina and had no fighting spirit, repeatedly failing to break through Southwest's defenses, losing the fourth game again 1-21. Southwest won 3-1.

In the second game, Paul played Yinghuang. Paul's fighting strength was better than Yinghuang's, and the whole army was able to bravely go forward. Yinghuang's defense was weak, and their offensive power could not be used freely. Paul won 3-1. The first game was 21-17, the second game was 21-11, the third game was 9-21, and the fourth game was 21-14. The lineups of each team are as follows:

### Wishing Xu Chengji Could Fulfill His Lofty Ambitions

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Xu Chengji went abroad in 1935. Before he went abroad, some people had already discussed his future, saying that he was a genius tennis player. If someone could provide funding to send him to travel to European and American countries, and compete and learn from famous players from various countries, then his skills would definitely improve further. It was said that he might even reach the ranks of the world's top ten players and win some glory overseas for China, which was lagging behind in sports.

Later, he indeed received funding from the Ministry of Education to go abroad and worked and studied in a certain place in France. His life was quite difficult. However, he was a promising young man and was not restricted by the environment. He often strived for his own future.

Soon, the Ministry of Education stopped his subsidies. Fortunately, overseas Chinese living in Java were willing to help him and often sent remittances for his living expenses. Therefore, he did not return home halfway but remained overseas, striving towards his great future. Until now, almost every tennis community in the world recognizes the great name of Xu Chengji.

During his stay in Europe, he defeated many famous players from various countries. The Englishman, Austin, was also defeated by him once.

The Wimbledon tennis tournament this year is about to begin. According to general predictions, the final four this year should be Austin, Menzel, Puncec, and Henkel. In addition, Henkel of Germany, Xu Chengji of China, Betra of France, and Perry, all have considerable hope.

In short, Xu has the possibility of being on the list of the world's top ten players this year.

### From Ancient Greece to the Various Aspects of the Olympic Games

— A Very Valuable History of Cultivation —

Second: The participant must have no political or moral stain of any kind. Third: He must have the certification of eight or more judges that he has been practicing for more than ten months and must swear before the gods when he obtains the qualifications to participate in the competition that he will never engage in illegitimate activities. Because of these strict restrictions, all athletes participating in the competition are representatives of the various federations. If they win the competition, they are considered to be incarnations of the gods, not just the glory of themselves and their families. It is simply the glory of a federation. Moreover, they are confident that their peninsula is the center of the world, so the Olympic Games (Olympin Games) are also considered a world affair, called the World Peace Festival. During the festival, it is a sacred truce period. If federations are at war with each other at this time, they will immediately cease military actions due to serving the divine power. Even in places where pirates are rampant on weekdays, merchants who must be vigilant at all times can also travel back and forth with peace of mind without any precautions at this time. Because before the festival, messengers have already been sent to publicize the will of the gods to various federations to prepare for the meeting.

The Reality of the Olympic Games

The only great god of Greece, Zeus, lived in a magnificent temple. Beside the temple were many tombs and altars of lesser gods, as well as marble statues of warriors. The arena was located northeast of the temple. The day of the festival was clearly set to begin one month after the summer solstice. In addition to the athletes, philosophers, poets, orators, historians, and sculptors from various countries gathered at the meeting to display their talents and spread the seeds of civilization. Even merchants exchanged the products of the federations at this time. In 728 BC, there were only short-distance races and other events, which could be completed in one day. After the twenty-seventh battle with the Persian, the reverence for the gods became more enthusiastic, and the number of events also increased, such as boxing, jumping, skill _, long-distance running, chariot racing, walking, horse racing, etc. Later, as the number of events gradually increased, the period was extended to five days. The reality of those five days is as follows: On the first day, a pig was sacrificed to the great god Zeus of Olympia. After the judges' guidance to the athletes and the swearing ceremony before the gods, the Greeks who came to the meeting talked to each other, talking about nothing but the praise of the previous competition results and the speculation of this time results. Many relatives and friends of the athletes held welcome parties and prepared for the support of Ming Jiu. As the east turns white on the second day, the competition begins. The general audience, who had camped out in the arena the night before, had already arranged themselves in order. At this time, the words of encouragement and exhortation from the athletes' parents cannot be described in words. Then, the judges led the athletes into the arena. Only women and slaves were prohibited from watching. Women were only allowed to be in the south of the arena and were not allowed to cross the ALpdcus River to the north. However, there was also a mother who was so eager for her son's victory that she disguised herself as a man and entered the arena, but was later discovered and sentenced to death. Only because the winning son pleaded, was she pardoned. This day was still a competition for teenagers and young people. The second and fourth days were adult competitions. On the fifth day, the award ceremony was held. In the early days, the winners of the competitions were mostly awarded very valuable prizes. Later, because they gained too many rights, they were changed to laurel wreaths made of woven olive branches. But this coarse olive crown was the treasure that the Greek people dreamed of, even to the point where women who were pregnant prayed that their sons could win the laurel wreath. Those who dared to move even one branch of the olive tree in the temple during peacetime were executed. Only the winners of the competition, who were the most beloved by the gods, that is, the incarnations of the gods, could cut down the olive tree with a golden knife to make a crown, and insert a [wood radical] tree, a rolled woolen object, on the crown, and place it on the jade throne in front of the gods. Finally, the judges placed it on the head of the most outstanding winner (Oltympiem), announcing his name and the names of his parents and hometown. The crowd cheered, shaking the heavens and the earth. Their slogans included calling him the darling of the gods, the bravest of the nation, and the model for raising men. A grand honorary banquet was held, orators praised his actions, poets sang of his character, and sculptors sculpted his body. When he returned to his country in glory, riding his own horse, wearing purple clothes, a triumphal meeting was held, a triumphal street was opened, and a triumphal arch was built. Even if the walls of the citizens' houses blocked his horse's path, they would be demolished. He was exempt from taxes for life, received the treatment of an honored guest at banquets, and had free access to all views. In Athens, there was a reward of SllDrad Am l (one equal to four corners in China) and a banquet with foreign envoys. In Sparta, he could be a king's guard and freely choose a beautiful woman as his wife. In short, all the glorious things in the world were concentrated on the winner. Let me give four more examples to show the general glory of the winners.

(1) In 640 AD, Cylou, the 35th competitor, won the girder with 400 meters. But he was not only an athlete but also a schemer. He wanted to seize the political sovereignty of Athens, occupied the city mountain, and fled to the sacred _ of the temple after the defeat to avoid punishment. (Six)
