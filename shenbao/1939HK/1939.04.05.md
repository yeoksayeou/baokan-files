### A Good Opportunity for Britain to Strive for Leadership

After the European War, European leadership was shared by Britain and France. However, in recent years, since Daladier came to power in France, he has been following in Chamberlain's footsteps. Britain has virtually held the power to guide European politics alone. However, the recent rapid development of the European situation and the complexity of world political problems have sometimes left Chamberlain at a loss. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement and Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia are sufficient to prove Chamberlain's misguided leadership. Now Hitler has annexed Czechoslovakia and is also preparing to implement his policy of a "Nazi Crusade" to conquer the small countries of Eastern Europe. This kind of action ××××× Chamberlain ×× then has the intention of uniting peace-loving democratic countries and cooperating with the Soviet Union. Chamberlain's shift in diplomatic policy has already had some effect. If it can be earnestly and sincerely implemented, it is not absolutely impossible for Britain to obtain leadership in Europe and even the world.

I remember when Hitler's sword was flying towards countries such as Lithuania and Romania, and the Eastern European countries needed the formation of an anti-Hitler group, Chamberlain once said that whether this plan could be realized depended on the attitude of the small Eastern European countries. Now, Poland has accepted British guarantees, and Romania has also accepted the same guarantees; and has agreed to Britain's request that if Poland is invaded by Germany, it will immediately help Poland. The tendency of the small Eastern European countries to lean towards Britain is generally no longer a problem. The key thereafter lies entirely in whether Britain can truly fulfill its guarantee obligations. In other words, if Britain's guarantee is as ineffective as the Munich Agreement, then Britain will not be confident in firmly holding leadership in Eastern Europe and even all of Europe. The entire Soviet press is skeptical of Britain's guarantees this time, and even suspects that Britain's guarantees to Poland are the foundation for Britain to exert pressure and force it to cede the Polish Corridor, which is naturally not without reason. We hope that Chamberlain will not repeat his mistakes and lose the opportunity to lead Europe.

Yesterday, a London telegram stated that Polish Foreign Minister Beck will arrive in England today, and French Aviation Minister Chamberlin will also arrive in London tonight. There may be further developments regarding the connection between Britain, France, and Poland to resist Hitler's aggression. The center of European politics has obviously shifted to London. The importance of Britain's position today is self-evident. However, if Britain wants to stabilize this leadership, it is not enough to only connect with France and Poland. A few days ago, the situation in Europe once demanded a broad anti-Hitler front. Initially, Britain seemed to feel the necessity, but the result was a shift from convening a six-nation conference to brewing a four-power declaration, and finally only Britain issued a declaration alone. This kind of trend has already given pessimistic factors to people around the world.

What Europe and even the whole world urgently need today is a collective security system for anti-aggressor countries. A true guarantee of peace can absolutely not be achieved by the individual actions of one or two countries. The Soviet Union must not be missing in the integration of this group. The Soviet government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," proposed to Britain to issue a general anti-aggression declaration, in which, in addition to the countries involved, various small democratic countries and the Soviet Union would participate, and also requested Britain and France to abandon their non-intervention policy and re-adopt collective security actions. If Britain and France agree to oppose any aggression, then the Soviet Union will naturally help with all its strength. The positiveness of the Soviet Union's attitude can be imagined from this.

We should pay attention to two points: the collective security system should be large in scale, including all anti-aggression countries in the world, and at the same time, the target of resistance cannot be limited to Germany alone. All countries that commit aggression in the world must be resisted. Secondly, the most important thing in resisting aggressors is practical action, not empty gestures, let alone empty slogans. The Soviet Union's suggestion is very specific in these two points. It is hoped that Britain can deeply understand and accept it, and sanction any aggressor in order to be effective.

Looking again from within Britain, Chamberlain's opposition party, from the leaders of the Labour Party and Liberal Party to the Conservative Party, such as Attlee, Sinclair, Eden, Churchill, and even Lloyd George, all advocate taking a positive attitude to deal with aggressors. If Chamberlain can sincerely change his past policies in accordance with the general demands of Britain, he can not only achieve the guarantee of true peace in Europe, but also maintain his regime; otherwise, he will lose the support of the British people and cause the complete shaking of the current government. A wise Chamberlain should not miss this rare opportunity!

### Chengdu Unveils the Curtain of Military Construction (2)

— Yu Fei

(Continued from page 2, April 3)

After passing the city bridge, a great painting of the heroic posture of the flying generals continues in front of you. Another picture says, "Come! Join the Air Force." A flying general waves to greet the viewers. The crowd in the park is surging, just like a raging tide in the sea.

The podium is set up under the "Monument to the Martyrs of the Xinhai Railway Protection Movement." On the base of the monument, there are large satirical paintings of "Building the Air Force" and "Current Situation of × Country." One picture of the "Current Situation of × Country" exposes all the ugly aspects of the Japanese. For example, "The soldiers who came to China have turned into ashes. The people in the country are starving. Wives cry for their husbands, daughters cry for their fathers. The peasant workers have a major riot, and the warlords and financial groups have nowhere to go." Using the skills of brushstrokes, it depicts the sins and suicide of the invaders. On the left and right sides of the stage, there is a picture of the Yellow River guards vigilantly watching the × people steal across in the freezing cold. Another picture shows the fleeing gentlemen, or the Chengdu people who have never heard the sound of cannons? Sitting in the warm pavilion at the back, eating and drinking. Servants are busy, feeding the dog that is tired of eating with chicken legs. Although it is fresh and delicious food that many people cannot taste, the dog, which is afraid of being fat in the midst of difficult times, does not even bother with it. The grand design and profound implication are a sign of "the front is tight, the rear is eating tightly." After reading it, viewers feel all kinds of emotions mixed together, and their insides are burning.

In the middle of the stage, there is a national flag, waving in the wind on a hundred-foot pole; bathed in the bright daylight.

1.  The Opening Ceremony Began with Songs

People are moving, the wind is blowing, the water is flowing shyly, the willow branches are swaying, the national flag is fluttering and waving; suddenly, melodious and solemn national music emanates from the podium; so the noisy and chaotic crowd becomes silent and reverently takes off their hats and stands at attention. "Respect" sincerely emanates from everyone's heart. The great China, the great Chinese nation, is expressed in this moment. We cannot but firmly believe in each other that "the victory of the sacred national revolutionary war is ours."

After the Central Military Academy's band finished playing the national anthem, they continued to play the "Turkish March." Although this imported music is not domestically produced, its enthusiastic, harmonious, soft, and majestic rhythm seems like a wave fighting for freedom, surging and hitting the rocky embankment that locks it. It suggests to us that this sacred war of resistance will never stop until freedom is obtained.

This great overture was played amid the applause of the crowd. Then, the amateur, telecommunications, and youth association combined choirs sang "Building the Military Song." The throats of dozens of men and women formed a huge stream of sound; making the audience hold their breath, and their ears and eyes were captured by the sound. Everything was in silence, only the song slowly spewed out from the stage: one word and one sentence poured into people's ears: "We are the soul of soldiers, we are the god of war. The great Chinese nation relies entirely on us. Destroy the common enemy of mankind and protect world peace. Look! We have the brave army, with strict walls, cutting × and returning to camp. Look! We have the brave air force, soaring in the universe, Mount Fuji collapsing. Look! We have the brave navy, riding the wind and waves, who dares to compete. We want to build a new China, we must first build a new soldier."

After the singing flew past, it was the Divine Eagle Troupe's songs such as "Air Force Song, Build a Large Air Force, Military-Civilian Cooperation, Final Victory is Ours." After the Telecommunications Choir finished singing the two songs "Go to the Front Line" and "We Need War," it was the turn of the refugee children to sing songs such as "Refugee Children's March, Little Heroes, Xu Lang'er: Defend China." They were twenty or so refugee children who had been sent to Tibet from the war zone. Wearing black coats, they were conducted by a seven-year-old child, Qu Shouheng. After he saluted the stage, his right hand waved, and the singing rose and fell with his gestures; all the audience was moved by them. Especially when they sang "We grew up in the flames of war... The Japanese warlords' cannons have refined us into little revolutionaries. We are not afraid, we lack something, we will take it from Japanese imperialism. One day, one day, we will fight back to my old home." Those who had not been exiled by the × people's artillery fire in the audience were moved by their tragic and majestic singing, and everyone shed tears. The true strength of the Chinese nation is buried in these immeasurable children. After this group of children, who were regarded as national treasures by the Nursery Association, stepped down, there were amateur choirs singing "Hot Blood, Military-Civilian Cooperation, Song of the Eight Hundred Warriors, Hongbo Song, Youth March." The Youth Choir sang "Marseillaise, Youth in China, Go Forward!, Draftee Team Song, Resist to the End," and the Female Youth Association Choir sang "Defend the Motherland, Go to the Battlefield; Guerrilla Army, Final Victory." The Tianming Choir sang "Go to the × People's Rear, Children of the Motherland, the Chinese Nation Will Not Perish," and the Central Military Academy sang "Triumph." These songs were so enthusiastic and majestic that everyone's emotions were melted into the lyrics; with the momentum of "trampling the three islands and directly attacking Tokyo."

After the singing performance was over, the band played the "French Overture"; then the whole audience roared. Tens of thousands of people's voices emitted a sound wave, and all that was heard was "Sacrifice has reached the final moment, compatriots are being slaughtered, land is being forcibly occupied, we can no longer endure it," and "Arise! People who do not want to be slaves, build our new Great Wall with our flesh and blood..." The roar resounded through the clouds. Everyone's heart was jumping. Everyone was standing and accumulating: "Charge!"

2.  Flying Generals Come from the Sky

At the moment when the singing was still lingering, two large squadrons of the air force flew in from the sky. People shouted, "One plane, three planes, nine planes, eighteen planes." So hundreds of thousands of eyes, tens of thousands of heads, and hundreds of thousands of hands all pointed towards the long sky. Applause, cheers, and engine sounds mixed into a "National Construction Symphony." Hearts in the sky, hearts on the ground, throbbing with each other, communicating with each other, and encouraging each other. Everyone's face was covered with the same joy. "Long live the military build-up! Long live the Air Force! Long live the national construction!"

The flying generals flew back and forth several times; and several other planes came flying low from somewhere else, they flew low in joy and jubilation. Their clothes, their heroic postures, were clearly distinguishable in the eyes of the crowd. People then surged into a frenzy of cheers. The flying generals kept waving to the ground, and then colorful slogans fell one after another. Flying in the wind, as if they were composed of colorful clouds.

Falling flowers from the sky are flying everywhere. Cheers on the ground are raised in arms. The sky and the ground are extremely beautiful. Some of the audience climbed tree tops and rooftops, and some climbed on wall corners and ridges, it was truly a sea of people.

After the plane flew south into the air, the people who attended the meeting, in teams, held lanterns and unlit torches, and ran to the meeting place in the beautiful melody accompanied by music and songs. They stood in a row in front of the podium, preparing to participate in a huge torch parade.

3.  The Curtain of Military Construction Was Pulled Open

More and more people gathered, and the singing became more and more exciting. Everything, everything was growing in the new birth. When it was 5:00 PM, suddenly the speaker in the venue issued a strong order, "Meeting begins!" Then the crowd was silent, and only the slow national anthem was heard. In the high and majestic ending of "One Heart, One Mind, Carry Through to the End," the meeting began as usual. The heads of various agencies all gave wonderful speeches. In the middle of the warning, the provincial party department gave the opening speech, "We are fighting to resist aggression, and we are fighting to uphold world peace. The start of the military construction movement today is the origin of our country's victory; it is also the dawn of peace in the world." Dr. Yao Le, the leader of the Xinjiang Hui people, said, "China is an entire nation, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan are originally one family: like brothers and sisters related to each other, we must use the power of sincere unity to smash the × people. Actively build the military, defeat the Japanese pirates, and revive China."

Thunderous applause came in bursts. The speeches were engraved in everyone's hearts. All forces vowed to dedicate themselves to the country.

The chairman proposed six proposals, which were passed amid the applause and cheers of hundreds of thousands of people. "1. Suggest that the central government issue a circular to the whole country to expand military construction propaganda. 2. Suggest that the central government issue a circular to the whole country to hold military construction comfort groups to go to various places to publicize the people and comfort the new recruits. 3. Suggest that the central government issue a circular to the whole country to launch a donation campaign, collect special funds, and comfort the new recruits. 4. Send a telegram to the whole country to mobilize people from all walks of life to expand the treatment of families of soldiers going on expeditions. 5. Send a telegram to the leader to pay tribute. 6. Send a telegram to comfort the soldiers on the front line."

When the meeting was completed, it was already 6:30 PM in the dim twilight.

The torch parade began.

4.  Torches Formed a Stream of Light

The starlight on the podium was dim; gradually becoming larger and larger, then it was seen that more than 100,000 candles in the whole venue were lit together. Thousands of different lanterns were shining brilliantly, like daylight.

The command to set out was released from the broadcasting tube, and all that was heard was the military music playing the March of the Volunteers, and a large team of people poured out of Shaocheng Park in a mighty and turbulent manner. The tall and short, various styles of lanterns, and the fiercely burning torches illuminated the dark square like daylight. The banner of the conference led the way, and roars erupted in the flood of people. "We want to build a strong army, navy, and air force to protect the peace of the human world and overthrow the savage aggressor bandits." "We want to avenge millions of suffering compatriots, and we can only reach it by establishing a strong army, navy, and air force." "We want to build a strong army, navy, and air force to enrich our strength in the war of resistance." Everyone clenched their fists and raised them high in the air, shouting. Everyone's face was showing an excited and angry expression. Like the anger of a bomb about to explode; that tense atmosphere.

The great procession began.

The most striking lantern was the giant lantern of the Sichuan-Kangxi Appeasement Office. Following that were the various turbidity groups, various agencies, various schools, and various styles of lanterns. When the band went up the city bridge, the applause and firecrackers at the ancestral hall thundered. Upstairs, on the roof ridges, on the road, all the space seemed to be built into walls of people, and paved with people. Only a small passageway of flesh and blood allowed the stream of torches to pass through.

"Down with Japanese ××ism"! "Build an army of 10 million"! "Train an artillery corps of 800 regiments"! "..." "We are the soul of soldiers" "We are the god of war" "..." Songs and slogans, cheers and applause, condensed into a huge iron-like sound, and formed an iron-like solidity. Everyone jumped up madly and shouted wildly, advancing in the light of the raging fire. This is the new China, striking the holy torch of the war of resistance, orienting itself in the darkness towards the bright dawn.

"Take it to Tokyo!" was a giant bomb with a horizontal inscription on the lantern. Comrades from the Political Department of the Air Commission held it high. This slogan of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" was welcomed by everyone and gave the audience great excitement; so the applause, cheers, and roars overwhelmed all the songs and slogans. And the most exciting thing was not only this. Behind the lantern of "Take it to Tokyo!" were the teams of flying generals, they were holding green small airplane lanterns, they were wearing flight suits, and they all had a wind mirror on their heads, releasing a dazzling light on the flight. The singing and footsteps were their unique uniformity. When they walked there, it was like a mad tornado, and the waves surged as they shouted; even the old women who did not speak next to them clapped their hands and said, "Good! Very good." How popular these great air forces are!

Next, there was a lantern of the "Great Wall"; a poisonous snake crawled in from Shanhaiguan, passed through North Hebei, Taiyuan, Jinan, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, and its bloody head had just entered Wuhan when it was stabbed to death by a huge sharp blade. He was like a Japanese warlord and a monkey dancing on a pole. A small snake was crawling on the body of a majestic giant elephant. A ferocious lion stood on the earth. Tanks, airplanes, cannons, anti-aircraft guns... all kinds of new weapons and lanterns were available. The two lanterns that excited the women and children the most were "The Japanese Emperor Playing with the Chamber Pot at Night" and "The Japanese Slave's Fear of Stealing Chinese Land." One was the Japanese Emperor crawling into the chamber pot with only his legs dancing outside the pot. One was a great map of China with a thief behind it reaching out to take it but daring not to. He constantly stretched out his paw, shook it, sighed, and then retreated. These strange-shaped lanterns gave the public a lot of anti-Japanese knowledge. Then came the queues of the Central Military Academy. There were cavalry soldiers, and three new-style cannons, with statues of Chairman Chiang and Premier Sun on the gun carriage. It was praised and welcomed by people along the way.

All kinds of novel lanterns demonstrated the depth and weight of military propaganda. It foretells that in the near future, China will reach a state of freedom. The procession of the parade took three hours to pass in the eyes of the viewers. Look! This great procession. This torch formed by the sacred fire of the war of resistance, it is the curtain of freedom of the Chinese nation, this curtain was unveiled in Chengdu today. "Long live military construction!" "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!"

5.  The Total Mobilization of Artists

After the vigorous military construction propaganda curtain was unveiled, all cultural figures were mobilized. The students of the Central Military Academy went to the streets to perform. There were more than 300 teams. Juggling, magic, and martial arts were performed in the park and on the streets every day. The provincial drama school performed "Qin Liangyu." The National Salvation Drama Circle jointly performed "National Roar." The Sichuan Manhua Society and the Propaganda Section of the Air Commission held a "Military Construction Art Exhibition." This was truly a total mobilization of Chengdu artists.

The 8th was the first day of the "Military Construction Art Exhibition."

After the curtain of military construction propaganda was unveiled, the weather, which had been immersed in a misty cloud for a long time, was also cleared. It was truly "Heaven helps our people." The joyful and joyful new life not only climbed on the willow tips and painted the magnolia flowers, but also painted on everyone's faces: if you don't believe it, please take a look, who is not excited by military construction. Moreover, the weather is particularly clear. The warm sun is as if it is being held in everyone's arms. The streets and alleys were all plastered with "photographs and paintings of the Japanese people's brutal killing, burning, raping, and looting." Dozens of people were vying to watch under each picture. Hating the Japanese pirates with each other; vowing to take revenge together. The entrance to Shaocheng Park was also hung with a horizontal inscription of "Military Construction Art Exhibition." The silver words on the black cloth emitted a dazzling light. It symbolized the brilliant future of our national revolution.

After passing the city bridge, there were arrow-style route signs on many trees. Following each sign to the entrance, four large books were seen standing on both sides of the door. On the top was a horizontal inscription of the art exhibition in red cloth and white words. One was "The Front Line is Tight", and the other was "The Rear is Eating Together." After reading it, you feel both happy and heartbroken.

The first exhibition room upon entering was the photography department. All the photos were very precious. There are a few that are worth mentioning; such as Guo Qin's photograph of "Premier's Former Residence, the Big Tree where the Premier Rested as a Child." After seeing this photo on the day of the war of resistance, one cannot help but feel sad. Premier Sun's life showed us the great lesson of his call to overthrow imperialism and "national liberation." Also, such as "The Japanese people's brutality, the lives of our heroic soldiers on the front lines, the slaughter of each city occupied by the Japanese people, and the bravery of our air force"; these are necessary readings for the public. The three photos of "Japanese Anti-Propaganda" are even more necessary to know about at the moment. We let everyone know how the Japanese people are oppressing our people and how they are educating our compatriots in the occupied areas. Those who sit in the rear, eating and drinking, have never thought of these things.

The second house is the painting exhibition room. The paintings were filled with the smell of blood. In the pens of each artist, they exposed the ferocity of the Japanese people, as well as the engravings and prints of Kemin and Erjun, and the war books of Shen Yiqian, and the refugee paintings of Le Dingming and Ying Yifeng, which made them feel even more sad after reading. Wu Ti wrote, "The machine rumbles, the cannons roar, and the atmosphere of great war seems fierce. Destroy the fortresses and sweep away the demons, and the Japanese army will fight fiercely in hand-to-hand combat. The sentry falls, and the reinforcements rush, and the hero's blood is spilled on Wusong. The enemy is hated, and my sect is destroyed; innocent people are killed and massacred. I write this with a heartbroken heart for the refugees, and ten thousand feet of righteous indignation fill my chest. Do not say that Tianfu is a paradise, with flowers, wine, and drunken heroes." The last two sentences are even more heartbreaking. A painting of "On the Songhua River" was written by Zhang Moyuan, a writer from Harbin. The soft green ripples and the noise of the pier make the exiles shed tears after reading it. Our beautiful rivers and mountains are still in the hands of the Japanese; this hatred and this caution must be accumulated.

The third room is the cartoon exhibition room. Laughter and scolding, grief and sadness, different feelings surged in the minds of each viewer. Several striking works include Chen Boyu's "Unite to Strive for Final Victory." Wang Shugang's "Anti-War." Shen Yiqian's "Atrocities" and "Streets of Chengdu." Xie Qusheng's "Before Departure, Rebirth, Ideal Husband, Savings of Civil Servants." Huang Shizhong's "Arise! Fight Back to Our Old Home." The most sour thing is a painting about the savings of civil servants; in the more than 1,500 restaurants in Chengdu, this kind of thing can be encountered every day. In order to invite a girlfriend, everyone is vying to pay the bill; and the heroine who is invited is "indifferent" to applying powder and rouge, letting them fight for it, as if thinking it is their duty. This blessing of Xie Jun scolds those people who do not know their duties. I wonder what the friends who are similar to these people would think if they saw it in today's severe national crisis? Another picture is "Battle of Qiujiang Bridge." It is really unreadable. It is said that the writer wrote about the war exploits of General Ma Zhanshan. Although there are several gray patterns, they gave us great courage against the Japanese.

The book exhibition was held for five days. The number of visitors was about 80 to 300 people per minute. From the angry expressions on the faces of each viewer when they left, it can be understood that the flames of resistance have been ignited in these people's hearts. "The success of military construction has stabbed into everyone's hearts."

"Military Construction Propaganda Week" is proceeding in clear air. When it closed, the sky was filled with mournful and sorrowful rain; this was exactly the time to mourn the suicide and pity of the Japanese people.

### On a Flight Between Hong Kong and Chongqing

— Jun Sui

Travel Notes of Xinjiang, Part One

I arrived in Hong Kong on July 13th of the year before last, and went to Nanyang once in early August. After the War of Resistance, I continued to live in Hong Kong. I only visited Guangzhou a few times last April, for a total of no more than a month. At the end of last September, I inspected the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, which also took a month and ten days. The rest of the time was spent in Hong Kong, which was really too expensive to live in. This time, I got an opportunity to travel to the Northwest, which was a pleasant surprise. I originally decided to fly to Chongqing on the 13th of this month, but the Eurasia plane I was taking was overloaded, and several tickets were temporarily canceled. I was also on the list of those whose tickets were canceled, so I changed my departure to the 19th. Because many friends and colleagues held farewell parties for me, I had to explain myself to friends in Hong Kong every day from the 14th to the 18th, which was really troublesome.

On the morning of the 19th, I hurriedly took a piece of luggage at 3:00 AM and went to Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. China National Aviation Corporation's Chengdu and Eurasia's 19 were scheduled to fly out on the same day. At 4:10 AM, the Eurasia plane I was on took off first. The China National Aviation Corporation plane took off at 4:30 AM, but when we arrived in Guilin to refuel at 7:45 AM, we saw that the China National Aviation Corporation plane had finished refueling and immediately took off. We took off again at 8:35 AM. At 11:40 AM, we parked safely at Chongqing Airport. The passengers of the China National Aviation Corporation plane had already left the airport. It seems that the problem of flying first and arriving later also exists when traveling by plane. I felt a little uneasy. Chongqing time is one hour behind Hong Kong time, so the actual time of arrival in Chongqing time was 10:40 AM. The flight from takeoff to refueling in Guilin took three hours and thirty-five minutes, and the flight from Guilin to Chongqing took three hours and five minutes, for a total flight time of only six hours and forty minutes. Without air routes, how could it be so fast?

When we took off, it was 4:10 AM in the middle of the night, so the lights of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the central harbors were on in every house. Because the plane had to avoid the Japanese attacks, it took advantage of the darkness to fly over their air defense lines. After the plane flew out of Kowloon Airport, when we crossed the harbors of Hong Kong and Kowloon, we looked down from the window and saw the lights of Hong Kong and Kowloon dotted like stars in the night sky, as if we were counting the stars in the Milky Way on a summer night, especially the fishing lights under the mountains of Hong Kong, where each light reflected up and down, forming two lights, connected one after the other, which was very beautiful. If the people living in Hong Kong have not flown over Hong Kong and Kowloon at night, they will never be able to imagine this excellent night scene. On weekdays, we look at the night view of Hong Kong from Kowloon, and although we are amazed, if we compare it with the night view of the two banks seen from the plane, its scenery is probably only worth one or two percent.

After the plane crossed the two banks of Hong Kong and Kowloon, it flew higher and higher. Because it was groping in the dark, there was nothing to do in the plane, and because I had not slept in the middle of the night, I leaned on the back of the chair and fell asleep. When I woke up, I took out my watch and saw that it was about 6:00 AM. Looking down, I saw only clouds, and nothing could be seen. The "cloud sea" mentioned in the travel notes of ancient people probably refers to this. Because the plane was flying very smoothly, even though it was flying above the clouds, we did not see the scenery below for about an hour.

At 7:45 AM, the plane flew very slowly, and we slowly saw the mountains and rivers below, knowing that we had arrived in Guilin. The plane flew down, and we saw the mountains of Guilin standing like high tablets facing the sky. A few days after the Double Tenth Festival in the 25th year, I also went to Guilin and played in the famous mountains and rocks of Guilin and Yangshuo, but looking up from the ground, the strange peaks are towering, and observing from each mountain, they really have the appearance of "bonsai made by God" as Mr. Wu Zhihui said, small and exquisite. Today, looking at it from the plane, thousands of peaks came to our eyes together, transformed into a grand view. It can be seen that although a mountain and a rock standing alone have their own merits, they are not as fascinating as a group united to form a great landscape. There must be a connection between the mountains and rivers and the people.

At 8:45 AM, after refueling, we took off again from Guilin and headed for Chongqing. After the plane took off, we were in the air, and it was difficult to tell what was going on within the six directions. Sitting in the plane, I was bored. At 11:40 AM, the plane slowly flew down, and we slowly began to see the fields and roads below. The mountains of Sichuan are all beautiful, and the fields circle upwards, looking down from the plane, like piles of cow dung, and some look like patterns on calico, which is extremely beautiful. After the plane stopped, there were no airline personnel to take care of the passengers. I hired a porter to carry my suitcase to the road above the airport, saw an airline car, and immediately sat down to place my luggage. After waiting for a long time, knowing that the car would not leave for more than an hour, I had to hire a sedan to go to the city to find a hotel. Unexpectedly, Chongqing was dispersing the population, but the hotels were still full, and there was no room to stay. Fortunately, I met a colleague, who accompanied me to stay at his male colleague's house, and finally, the problem of accommodation was solved.

Having just arrived in Chongqing, there is nothing to say for the time being. This time, I can only report to the readers about the experience of flying from Hong Kong to Chongqing. In the future, when I travel in various places in the Northwest and encounter things worth reporting, I will send manuscripts one after another, so that readers can know some of the situations in the Northwest.

### Record of an Interview with Mr. Wakabayashi Sei, Defected Platoon Leader of the Japanese Army

— Tian Xu

[Special Dispatch from the National Salvation Society] Late at night, in a small room within the Hengyang Garrison Headquarters, I met Mr. Wakabayashi Sei, the newly arrived defector platoon leader from the Japanese army.

Inside and outside the room, children, women, old ladies, and soldiers were gathered, all very friendly. Unlike the previous times I saw a "Eastern Barbarian," no one was holding bricks or tiles wanting to throw or hit him. "Let me ask, why do you want to hit us?" The two guests, one being Wakabayashi Sei and the other a prisoner named Takeo Makimoto—did not appear timid, base, or melancholic like those in the past stories about newly captured prisoners. They were happy and naturally chatting and laughing with everyone. Wakabayashi Sei could speak a little Chinese; when he couldn't express himself with words, he would use writing or gestures. The audience took out money to buy cigarettes, wine, and peanuts for him to eat.

Wakabayashi smoked a cigarette, tapping the tin foil, "Japanese cigarettes no longer have this." He also told us that Japan now has severely restricted civilian oil consumption and "reduced" clothing production. Movie theaters, bars, and dance halls all implement a "mandatory time system." Most civilian factories are forced to manufacture military supplies. Civilian food rice costs as much as thirty-eight yuan per stone. When asked about the tax situation, he wrote the years Showa 9, 10, and 14 on paper, and drew a diagonal line upward from Showa 9 to indicate that taxes were increasing drastically every year.

Drinking wine and eating peanuts, they seemed a little excited. Initially, the children repeatedly urged them to sing Japanese songs, but they were always too shy to open their mouths. Now, upon suggestion, they started singing a song called "Twilight Frontline": The frontline is dim and the twilight is quiet, the sound of cannons echoes far away, gazing at the homeland, tears flow.

The song was a little sad. They lowered their heads and said nothing, probably missing their homes. Everyone quickly urged them to drink a little wine. The children sang another song, and they applauded enthusiastically, breaking the momentary silence. They proposed singing folk songs and first sang a "Husband and Wife Song." We had no folk songs to answer, so we replaced it with a march.

Wakabayashi also sang "Fishing Light Song" and "Farewell, My Little Brother," with accurate lyrics. He has a deep love for art. He wanted to borrow a harmonica and a violin, but unfortunately, we couldn't find one. He had read works by Xun Lu, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, and greatly admired Xia Yan's "Under the Eaves of Shanghai."

Wakabayashi talked a lot about fascism and collective security maintaining East Asian harmony.

The atmosphere was very harmonious. The one in front of us was no longer an enemy, but had become a friend.

It was getting late, and everyone thought they must be tired after sitting in a car all day and should be allowed to sleep.

The next morning, I went to chat with them again.

Wakabayashi is twenty-five years old this year. His father is a dentist in Shanghai. He grew up in Shanghai. His mother died when he was six years old, and he returned to his home country with his father. He graduated from Ishikawa Prefecture Third Middle School in his hometown. At eighteen, he returned to Shanghai and lived on North Sichuan Road, working as a clerk at the Taiyo Sake Company. Later, he worked as a "deliveryman" at the Shanghai Japanese Soy Sauce Company. At twenty-three, he underwent a "conscription inspection" and returned to his country to enlist. Makimoto is thirty-six years old, farming for a living. Last year, he was drafted into the army for the twelfth time. He is a reservist. They both belonged to the Ninth Division. Wakabayashi was the acting platoon leader. On February 22, he voluntarily surrendered to our army near Tongcheng. Makimoto was a private first class. On January 28, he was captured by our army four or five days northeast of Yueyang.

Wakabayashi's family includes his father, brother, sister-in-law, and nephew. He is not yet married, and the war has delayed him. He was a little emotional. Makimoto has a wife and several children at home, and their livelihood is difficult. He said with great distress, "Family members of soldiers dispatched from Xue could receive a small amount of consolation money, but now I hear there is very little. I don't know how my family will live."

Their Ninth Division is all from the Ishikawa, Toyama, and Fukui areas of Hokuriku. They are now stationed in the Yueyang, Chongyang, and Tongcheng areas. Since participating in the war last year, they have been replenished twelve times, with 1,200 deaths and 4,500 injuries. They said that the front-line combat troops have been replenished ten to twelve times.

I asked them about the deployment of their chemical warfare unit. He seemed a little embarrassed. However, he told me that each regiment had a small gas squad. They currently use mostly tear gas and sneeze gas.

Wakabayashi asked us, "How many people are in Hengyang?" I told him that the whole county has about 1 million people. He said that the combined population of Ishikawa, Fukui, and Toyama prefectures is less than that. I smiled and said softly, "This shows that Japan's so-called overpopulation, and the need to immigrate abroad, is nothing but deception." He could only nod and smile bitterly.

After they ate, they were about to take a car to Guilin. It was said that the authorities, because Wakabayashi's thoughts were quite progressive, planned to send someone to guide him and use him for propaganda against Japan in the future.

Finally, I gave them a copy of the anti-aggression bi-monthly magazine. They read it in the car and were endlessly grateful. They also expressed infinite gratitude for the various preferential treatments by the "Republic of China." In the end, Wakabayashi wrote a note for me, wanting us to maintain eternal friendship. We shook hands tightly and said, "Sayonara, Sayonara!", "Goodbye, Goodbye!" They got into the car and left.

### British Prime Minister Declares Resolve to Unite Nations to Resist Aggression; Parliament Members Unanimously Support the Government

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Greenwood, leader of the Labor opposition party, first rose to speak during the debate on foreign policy in the House of Commons tonight. He said that he believed the unanimous uprising of the House had made it clear to the world that Britain harbored a universal feeling of disgust for the current European events and the human suffering caused by these events. At the same time, the British people's determination to cooperate with other countries and build a strong barrier to resist aggression had also become clear. However, the Labor Party was not "blindly supportive" of the government's measures and hoped to be understood on this point. The Labor Party was concerned with principles and policies, not personnel. If the government's plans were in harmony with the Labor Party's views, they would naturally receive its support. Chamberlain then rose to speak, and the audience responded with warm applause. His declaration on Friday represented a major departure from the foreign policy previously implemented and constructed by this country. If it is not called a new era, it can be called a new turning point in British foreign policy. "We have separated ourselves from our country's traditional thinking. The above declaration does not only refer to a border incident. If Poland is threatened, we believe that the Polish people will resist. Under these circumstances, the meaning of the declaration is that France and we will immediately give Poland assistance. Germany's guarantee no longer exists. This has also destroyed the entire confidence and forced Britain to adopt another new policy, which was first announced last Friday. I am not saying that Germany will openly challenge, but world public opinion is shocked and expresses fear, which is not an exaggeration. Regardless of the outcome, we must clarify and not mislead people about our position, which is the unanimous heart of the whole country. Today's me, and the me of last September, have not changed my view of war. I have no intention or attempt to threaten the German people, but I also do not want our people to be threatened by the outside world. I have strong hopes for the results of business negotiations. This kind of belief is too great to strike down, and it is not easy to recover. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to reconsider the situation. We are currently engaged in a kind of special work. If German policy continues to be pursued, the danger will not only befall Poland. We welcome cooperation with other countries, regardless of the internal structure of the government, as long as the purpose is non-aggression and the ambition is to oppose aggression, we can cooperate." Speaking of the Soviet Union, the Prime Minister said that the opposition party was afraid that the ideological differences between Britain and the Soviet Union would hinder the interests of the two countries. He said, "We believe that regardless of their ideological differences, this can no longer exist on this issue." I sincerely hope that the actions that have begun and have not yet been completed can change the situation. The so-called change is not to turn to the path of war, because after the war, there is no so-called victory, and it is not enough to end the dispute. What we are referring to is the hope that reason can replace force and threats, and that a peaceful and orderly path of negotiation can be opened up. Sinclair, leader of the Liberal Party, said that the guarantee given to Poland by Britain this time was necessary for the situation. If today's debate is frankly made public to the world, it will be enough to prove that all members of the House of Commons thoroughly support the government's policy this time. It is hoped that the government will resolutely and quickly implement it. It is firmly believed that the government's policy is more profound in its planning to prevent war than its planning on how to achieve victory once a war occurs. Churchill strongly criticized the argument that misunderstood the purpose of British policy as encircling Germany, and briefly stated, "If Germany feels that it has been bullied by other countries, it can openly declare it to obtain international guarantees. It is gratifying that the Prime Minister led the country this time and declared Britain's sincere determination to protect peace and freedom in Europe. Any dictator who wants to destroy the united French Republic and the British Empire is really bold. Steps to establish mutual security must continue to be promoted. Guaranteeing Poland alone is not enough. The Soviet Union is the most powerful force in safeguarding world peace, but it is also deeply affected by German ambitions. Britain took the lead in resisting aggression for the first time, and now the Nazi leader is also feeling the possibility of dealing with the war on two fronts for the first time." Lloyd George then spoke, warmly congratulating the Prime Minister for finally adopting a policy that had been debated for a long time, and not showing cowardly surrender to the aggressor, saying, "The Prime Minister's move has created a new page in history for Britain and other peoples in the world. Obtaining the promise of assistance from the Soviet Union, the world's strongest military power, is urgent and important. If a war breaks out between Poland and Germany, British assistance cannot reach Poland and must rely on the Soviet Union." Former Foreign Secretary Eden agreed with Lloyd George's views on certain military points. He said, "Half of Germany's military force is concentrated on the Polish border, and the other half can be stationed on the western border. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to carry out attacks on both borders at the same time. Moreover, today's situation is very different from that of the European War in 1914. Turkey and Egypt's attitude toward Germany is no longer what it used to be. The Prime Minister's speech can fully represent the will of the people. Now the British people unanimously support Chamberlain's policy. The move to negotiate with foreign powers has great value. I dare to assure the government that the Prime Minister's speech has expressed the correct feelings of the entire British nation."

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today, in response to various questions, that the government's decision to double the local military forces this time, so that the spirit of the current voluntary enlistment can be fully expressed, is enough to prove the country's firm determination to prepare for emergency efforts to participate in activities.

### Simon's Speech: Britain Must Use Strength to Fight Against Aggression

[Reuters, London, 4th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon declared in the debate on foreign affairs last night that any steps or actions that could make Britain stronger and more united must be strictly enforced. He said, "All convenient, comfortable, and courteous traditions and habits cannot resist what is needed now. We must do our utmost to make all of Britain's possible strength, and work hard on this important work. If necessary, Britain must use its strength to fight against aggression. Only then can I see efforts in an organization and obtain a broader and more inevitable basis for peace. If this kind of peace can be achieved, it will be obtained with the help of the united House of Commons."

### Halifax Speech: Britain and France Cooperate Openly; Condemns Hitler for Breaking Faith; Maintaining Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union Has Value

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a speech on British diplomacy in the House of Lords today. He mentioned the declaration of guarantee to Poland a few days ago and said that the British and French governments had maintained close contact during this emergency period. The two governments have always been consistent in their views on various issues, and the British government has especially received the frank cooperation of the French side. Halifax also mentioned Chamberlain's words to Poland, the scope, and purpose, saying that since Hitler delivered a speech on January 30, the belief in European peace would not be shaken by anything. In order to obtain the cooperation of the other party and achieve its goals, the British government had Minister of Commerce Stanley accept Germany's invitation to prepare to consult with Lin to assist business negotiations. The Foreign Secretary then mentioned Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia, saying, "The consequences of this kind of action are obvious and do not require my statement." The country's merger of eight million Czechs is obviously contrary to Hitler's previously declared principles. As Hitler's breach of faith, neighboring German states feel in danger, and it is natural that they fear their independence will face the same danger. The British government feels it necessary to take appropriate steps to rebuild European faith, so it has contacted several other countries. This discussion with various governments is still in progress, and reports on the final situation have not yet been released. The Foreign Secretary also said, I can unhesitatingly tell you that the British government is very clear about the importance of the Soviet government's attitude and believes that maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union is a valuable move. We must admit that some countries have a complicated relationship with the Soviet Union, but I can assure you that the relationship between the British Empire and the Soviet Union does not have this kind of difficulty. At this point, he turned to talk about the British issue of Polish Foreign Minister Beck. Halifax expressed the hope to meet with Beck frankly and discuss together all issues of interest to Britain and Poland. The Foreign Secretary reiterated the government's actions on the Polish issue and said affirmatively that some parties misunderstood the British government's move as an attempt to encircle Germany, but there is no explanation more contrary to the facts. The actual situation today is that a powerful Germany stands at the heart of Europe. If neighboring countries feel that Germany has a dangerous attempt and want to take joint action to protect themselves, the result is entirely a natural reaction and not caused by any change in British foreign policy. Our offer of restraint this time does not mean hostility to any country. We hope and firmly believe that this can increase European peace and health. Sir Snell spoke on behalf of the Labor Party, absolutely supporting the government's statement and strongly welcoming this policy change. Christ also expressed his support on behalf of the Liberal Party.

### Opinions of Various Countries

[Reuters, London, 4th] The British and French newspapers all expressed their approval of Chamberlain's announcement of Britain's new foreign policy, while the German newspapers expressed anger. Also, today's Roman newspapers tried their best to despise this policy, believing it to be an aggressive attempt to encircle "innocent Germany."

[Reuters, London, 4th] The morning papers here all focus on the historical significance of the diplomatic debate and the new political system, as well as the unanimous support of all parties, and point out that Britain has no intention of encircling Germany. The "Everyday Pioneer" newspaper urges the government to immediately invite the Soviet Union and suggest the establishment of a defensive agreement and the expansion of the scope of mutual aid.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] According to authorities in the foreign father's circle here, Chamberlain's leadership in the anti-Hitler group has saved the crisis of the European War. Senior American officials privately expressed their support for Chamberlain's statement. They said that Germany may still demand Danzig and the Polish Corridor, but it must adopt a negotiation method and not use the original force intimidation.

Gai Da Writes an Article Threatening Poland

[Reuters, Rome, 4th] Gai Da published an article in "Italian Daily" today on the Polish Foreign Minister's visit to London, saying, "The policies of democratic countries are still full of illusions and tricks." He condemned the policies of Britain and France as wrong and claimed that Italy would not wait long, "Italy's waiting, hope that France will not be mistaken about this." Gai Da also issued a warning to Poland, saying that if it cooperates with Britain and France, it is undoubtedly implementing an encirclement of Germany, urging Poland to remember the results obtained by some countries under the wings of Britain and France, such as Abyssinia, China, Spain, and Czechoslovakia. At the same time, an article was also published in the "Fascist Commentary" newspaper, saying, "Democratic countries jointly resisting Germany or Hitler is equivalent to directly opposing Italy or Mussolini."

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 4th] This morning's newspapers here all unanimously stated that although the reports of the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary are so-called guarantees, they are nothing more than adopting a policy of "encircling" Germany.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd] The declarations issued by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax today were commented on by German political figures, saying that the so-called threatened countries did not initially ask Britain to provide assistance.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] In the British House of Commons today, a member asked Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler several questions about Qingdao. The Deputy Foreign Secretary said that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, had received a notice from the Japanese Foreign Secretary on March 13, stating that the Qingdao commercial port would be reopened on March 25 under certain conditions. Foreign ships were temporarily limited to berthing in three places, but the use of wharves and warehouses was not yet allowed. He said, "In fact, the two berths of the oil wharf and the first wharf have now been officially opened, or have been used, or will be available to British ships within days. The British government welcomes the Japanese government's action and believes that this is the first step in restoring the normality of the port in the Japanese-occupied area." Butler also answered in writing to Conservative Party member Smales that British ships were not yet allowed to sail on the Pearl River, and the British government was taking all feasible measures to promote its opening as soon as possible. Then, Party member Hannah asked whether the British government had received a reply from the Japanese government after the British and French concessions in Tianjin were surrounded by obstacles and electrified wire mesh, and what measures the government would take to ensure the safety and freedom of British nationals and their employees in Tianjin, and the supply of their food. Deputy Foreign Secretary Ba replied that the restrictions around the Tianjin concession had been removed on February 8, but the obstacles remained. Regarding the supply of food, no reports of any interruption have been received. The situation there has caused some anxiety among the general public.

### Italy Gathers Troops in Southeast, Rumored to Seize Albania, Albanian Statement Vows to Protect Independence

[Reuters, Rome, 4th] According to last night's report, Italian troop transports concentrated yesterday in Bari and Brindisi (southeastern Italy) to prepare for contingencies. A total of 20,000 Italian troops are concentrated in the area. Rumors have been circulating for ten days that Italian troops intend to land in Albania, but these have been repeatedly denied by officials. According to informed sources, whatever action Italy takes, it must have the consent of the Albanian side, and Albania is willing to become a semi-protectorate of Italy. Coincidentally, a certain newspaper in the Italian capital published an article accusing Britain and France of attempting to insert three thorns into Italy's waist: the first two being Greece and Albania, which Britain and France are trying to make resist Italy, and the third being Yugoslavia, but thanks to Mussolini's efforts, the Adriatic Sea has been able to maintain peace for several years.

[Reuters, London, 4th] British officials here, while not denying reports of Italian military activity, stated that there were no reports to prove that Italy had concentrated troops in ports opposite Albania. It is claimed that the British government finds it hard to believe that Italy would take actions that would harm Albania's independence and freedom. It was also stated that if this were indeed the case, it would be a violation of the British-Italian agreement.

[Reuters, Tirana, 4th] A semi-official statement issued here declared: "Certain foreign newspapers and radio stations have today claimed that Albania urgently needs protection. This statement is unfounded. Albania will never recognize anything that violates its national independence and integrity."

### North China Backfires, Japanese Merchants Suffer Heavy Losses, Export Goods Exchanged for Piles of Waste Paper

[Shanghai Correspondence] A certain foreign merchant arrived in Shanghai from Beiping, and according to his account, the recent implementation of monetary measures to support counterfeit currency may not benefit the Japanese themselves. Before the implementation of the new currency measures prohibiting the circulation of Central Government legal tender in North China, Chinese merchants in North China had imported large amounts of Japanese loans. They were forced to accept counterfeit currency paid out by Japanese merchants, and as a result, they are now using this worthless waste paper to import Japanese loans, so the ones who profit are the Chinese merchants, and the ones who lose are the Japanese merchants, because Japanese merchants cannot circulate counterfeit currency in Japan. However, Japanese merchants, represented by Chinese, must use Central Government legal tender to pay for the price of goods when purchasing raw materials from various towns in the interior of North China for transport and export, otherwise farmers refuse to sell their agricultural products. As for the exchange rate, a few days ago it was one yuan of legal tender for one yuan and two jiao of counterfeit currency. This difference is especially large when Japanese merchants export Chinese raw materials on a large scale. Over the past few months, as far as the Japanese are concerned, the situation has become increasingly dire, so the Japanese authorities finally decided to implement new currency regulations and implement an export control plan, stipulating that only Japanese merchants are allowed to engage in export trade in North China. As far as the foreign merchant can foresee, the new currency and export control plan will ultimately not benefit the Japanese themselves. After the new currency regulations were adopted, most of the Chinese merchants in North China almost completely stopped selling raw materials to the Japanese. On the other hand, Chinese merchants have also expressed that they do not intend to import Japanese goods again, at least not as much as they have imported in the past few months. The strange thing is that after the Japanese authorities prohibited the circulation of legal tender, most Chinese merchants tried their best to collect large amounts of Japanese yen paper money. According to what the foreign merchant knows for sure, large amounts of Japanese yen paper money have been secretly transported to Shanghai and exchanged for foreign currency other than legal tender. Many Chinese merchants in North China are willing to exchange counterfeit currency for Japanese banknotes. Now, under the new currency conditions, they would rather stand still and not engage in commercial activities. The foreign merchant also recounted the rumors about Wu Peifu, saying, "I think Mr. Wu is an upright Chinese gentleman and would not serve the Japanese in this dangerous plan."

Small Commentary

### British Guarantee

Soviet public opinion criticizes Britain's guarantee to Poland, believing that Britain's expression of anti-aggression is still insufficient and not thorough enough, so Chamberlain's speech will still be ineffective. They say: 'Only by agreeing to resist aggression from any side can the Western European powers rely on the full support of the Soviet Union.'

We believe that the Soviet Union's public opinion is enough to represent the common opinion of peace-loving people around the world. We must do everything possible to promote democratic and peace-loving countries such as Britain and France to abandon all non-interference or compromise policies and establish a collective security system to replace Britain's unilateral declaration, which is the true guarantee of peace. In particular, the scope of this guarantee should include the Far East. We must know that China, which has been heroically resisting for more than twenty months, has not only gained an important voice in the international community, but has also become a decisive force for world peace. Although Soviet public opinion has noticed this, we must also awaken the attention of other countries.

### The Activity of New National Life: Children of All Walks of Life in Hong Kong Expanded the Celebration of Children's Day Yesterday, Grand Commemorations Were Held Separately in Various Districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon, Visiting Refugee Children and Entertaining Street Children was a Grand Occasion Unprecedented

Special Report from This Newspaper: The March 8th Women's Liberation Day has just passed, and the April 4th Children's Day has arrived. In the turbulent motherland, with so many children ××××× and living a displaced life today, commemorating this Children's Day has a particularly profound meaning. Yesterday, the children of Hong Kong were in a warm and solemn atmosphere. From 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM, various schools, the School Relief Society, children's groups, children's welfare societies, youth associations singing classes, Kowloon Youth Association, refugee service groups, and Form Lin Girls' Middle School held grand commemorations in various districts of Hong Kong, Central, Causeway Bay, Sheung Wan, and Yau Ma Tei. More than 10,000 children participated in the meetings. At 9:00 AM, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Overseas Chinese Education Federation gathered school children from both sides of Hong Kong and Kowloon to hold a joint expanded commemoration of Children's Day, in the Public, Entertainment, and Queen's theaters. At noon, the children's group of the School Relief Society held a commemoration at the Caritas Center in Causeway Bay. At 4:00 PM, the Children's Welfare Society held a commemoration at the second branch of the association. At 7:30 PM, the children's group of the School Relief Society and the Children's Welfare Society jointly invited refugee children and street children at Form Lin Middle School. There were also refugee service groups and small groups of the Kowloon Youth Association that held commemorations. Everything was available. This enthusiastic phenomenon reflects the fact that people from all walks of life have begun to pay attention to the conservation of the future masters of this country.

The sky was gloomy, and the wind was so bleak, piercing the skin. But before 9:00 AM, children wearing shorts were already walking proudly to the Hong Kong Entertainment and Queen's theaters and the Kowloon Public theater. More than 10,000 children attended, including students from various schools, rich and poor, and even refugee children who had dropped out of school. Although the locations were different, their will and spirit were consistent. The three commemorations were all presided over by the presidium. In front of the tens of thousands of lively children, in the spirited spirit, after the ceremony began, representatives of the presidium delivered opening speeches, Li Naihao of Guanghua at the Queen's Theater, Lin Songhui of Zhixing at the Entertainment Theater, and Zhuang Yichun of Lingdong at the Public Theater. Then, elementary school students from various schools gave free speeches, and finally Hu Weijing of Zhixing, Yang Chenghui of Overseas Chinese, and Southern Middle School delivered closing speeches. The children's throats were shouting on the stage, and countless throats were responding on the stage. The speeches of the three meetings were the same, so the children who listened showed a consistent tense and joyful mood. The recreation program, which was placed at the end, had the meaning of children's progress.

Children Enthusiastically Ran to the Commemoration

We have already written a special report on the situation at the Entertainment Theater. Now I will talk about the Queen's Theater. Just at 9:00 AM, the venue was already filled with piles of small heads, talking, laughing, and playing. The ground floor was like this, the second floor was like this, and soon the third floor was also like this. The entire Queen's Theater was suddenly transformed into a children's world.

The meeting did not begin until 9:35. The presidium appeared on stage one after another. After the ceremony was performed, Chairman Lin Songhui (graduate of Zhixing Middle School) delivered the opening speech. A seven- or eight-year-old child came forward and said in a sharp voice, "We are very happy to welcome the Children's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China, especially since the schools are all celebrating it in a unified way, which makes us excited: the society has already realized how to take care of future generations and pay attention to the rational protection of children."

He paused and continued, "How many of our little ×××××××××× are under bombing, and even more do not know how many are homeless and wandering. Our celebration today should be even more aware that our responsibility is great and heavy for the happiness of children all over the world." His hands, which were holding on, began to raise at this time, and the voice also began to rise.

Unite Everyone and Exert Great Strength

Continuing, he said, "Although we are young, as long as we can unite, we can exert great strength. For the sake of individuals, for the country, and for mankind, we will be strong in this era and fight for world peace." He got up and became full of fire. All of this is not like a child's words. The posture and attitude of this speech are not like a child, but it is obvious that he is standing on the stage. Isn't it a pupil from the Zhixing Middle School Affiliated Elementary School? He still speaks pure Mandarin, which is even more touching. This lively and heroic atmosphere reflects the new style of the children of the new era of the Republic of China.

Following, Wu Yunxiang of the Form Lan Girls' Middle School Affiliated Elementary School gave a speech. She used fluent Cantonese to express that the mission of today's children is to work hard to learn and exercise, so that we will have a healthy body and rich knowledge in the future to serve the country and bring happiness to society. I hope that all the children in the country can take the greatness of our mission and shoulder the great mission of creating a new China.

Meaningful Recreation Educates Through Entertainment

Chen Dezheng of Yangzhong and Feng Xiuzhen of Lingdao also gave speeches one after another. At the end, the refugee children of the Children's Welfare Society gave a thank-you speech, and Hu Weijing of Zhixing delivered the closing speech. The recreation program then began. The first act was free drama, and the second act was Sending Off Soldiers, which was performed by the Lingdong Middle School Affiliated Elementary School. It was a tragicomedy depicting a girl sending off her lover who was enlisting to serve the country. The woman earnestly persuaded him to change his mind, and the man resolutely sang, "I have seen through everything, and I am wholeheartedly devoted to serving the country." The story was simple, the performance was innocent, and it touched people deeply. A three-year-old child in the back could not bear to see this situation and repeatedly asked his father, "Why does that 'boy' have to go to war?" The father explained to him patiently, "Without a country, we have no home, so each of us has to be a soldier and fight to save the country and protect our homes." We wish that all parents in China would use this kind of education to educate our next generation.

The third song of the program (performed by the Chonglan Girls' Middle School Choir), New China, Blue Sky White Sun Red Flag, bugle call, one after another singing, "Good brothers and good sisters, roar with 150 million people, charge, charge desperately, kill, charge forward," the majestic singing stirred up the passion of the people in the audience. There was also the joy of spring and the bright moon night, all of which were performed by innocent and lively children. The audience inside couldn't help but laugh, and the children jumped and jumped.

The Presidium of the Conference Visited the Refugee Children in Person

The conference did not end until 12:00. After the meeting, the presidium of the conference ran to various welfare centers of the Children's Welfare Society to visit the refugee children. The little boys and girls of the Chinese nation living in the safe haven naturally felt a little touched when they saw their little compatriots who had fled from the flames. After the visit, a tea party was held before they dispersed.

The Children's Group of the Hong Kong Student Relief Society also held a celebration of Children's Day at the Caritas Center on Caritas Hill at 1:00 PM yesterday, and invited children from the second hospital of the Child Welfare Home to participate. About 2,000 children participated in the meeting. After the meeting began, Chairman Kong Xiufang delivered the opening speech, followed by a speech by Ms. Wang Xiaoying on "Children's Day in the National Crisis." Ms. Wang first described the meaning of Children's Day and that most of the poor children who wandered the streets could not yet feel the impact of Children's Day. Then she said: "We must resist the invaders, we cannot but pay attention to the children's problem, we cannot but pay close attention to the entire and universal children's problem." Finally, she solemnly said, "Saving one more child means that the country has one more combatant, one more national for the revival of China." In addition, there were speeches by Ms. He Ailing and others, as well as other recreation, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic.

Ms. He Xiangning Gave a Speech at the Refugee Children's Commemoration

The Welfare Society originally held a commemoration at noon, but because they were invited by the School Relief Society to participate in the meeting, it was changed to 4:00 PM. Hundreds of iron-like children were squeezed together. After the opening ceremony presided over by He Ailing, Director, He Xiangning said: "Dear children, I feel very touched to hold this Children's Day here today. You have all escaped from the artillery fire of the invaders, and I feel infinitely sad to think of your parents, sisters, and brothers in the occupied areas. I hope that the children will work hard to become great heroes for our sisters and brothers." None of the children in the venue were not moved. A refugee child said resolutely to the reporter, "I am both ashamed and inspired by the enthusiastic love and care of the children and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong today. We should work harder to learn and become excellent Chinese children." Saying this, he put down the pie in his hand and said as if in reply: "Yes, I should study hard, remember my parents, and work harder to learn." His eyes shone with anger. The reporter shook his hand tightly, feeling so inspired that he couldn't say anything.

The School Relief and Welfare Societies Invite Street Children

At 7:30 PM, the children's group of the School Relief Society and the refugee children of the Welfare Society invited poor children from the streets to hold a commemoration at Form Lin Middle School. A long and narrow classroom was crowded with street children in tattered clothes. Although there were some patrols and inspectors in the venue, they were all joking and quarreling unrestrainedly. The lack of education was heartbreaking. After a while, order began. The most meaningful thing was collective singing and collective games. Finally, the tea party ended.

Children from Various Schools in Kowloon Celebrated Enthusiastically

In Kowloon, in addition to the schools participating in the Education Federation holding celebrations at the Public Theater, six schools including Kowloon Tao Xiu Affiliated Elementary School, China Children's College, Kwan Wai Elementary School, Cheung Sha College, Sham Shui Po Elementary School, and Kindergarten, and Zhi Xian Affiliated Elementary School held a joint celebration at the Free Land Theater. More than 2,000 children attended the meeting, and more than 200 refugee children were invited to participate. Xie Liming Biscuit Company, Deru Tea House, Ru Ji, Dapeng, Xin Ying and other candy companies contributed kindness to the refugee children. The children from various schools also generously donated fruits and snacks, totaling one hundred and fifty-six yuan, six jiao and eight cents to help the refugee children. The meeting did not end until after 12:00. The three schools of Pui Yuk Tsui Wah and Yu Tak jointly held celebrations at Minsheng College. Everything was carried out in an orderly manner. Students from Yu School performed various recreational activities to help and sang "Save the Nation Song" and performed "National Defense Drama," and the situation was very enthusiastic.

Children in Ap Lei Chau Also Jointly Held Commemorations

In addition to the above-mentioned districts holding meetings to commemorate, students in Hong Kong Aberdeen Ap Lei Chau also solemnly commemorated Children's Day yesterday. At 8:00 AM, a joint celebration was held in a large opera shed in front of the Hung Shing Temple. After the meeting ended at 11:00 AM, a parade was held. In the evening, a recreation meeting was held at the same location, and flags were presented to raise funds to run a night school for the poor. (Please refer to the special report on page seven of this newspaper.) Also yesterday, students from various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon set out in teams to hold meetings in the urban area to present flags. A total of tens of thousands of national flags were distributed on that day, and the results of the donations were very satisfactory. [End of Article]

### Britain Attaches Importance to the Far East: News Telegraph Fees Greatly Reduced, Reduced by One Jiao and Five Cents Per Word, Implemented in the Middle of This Month

The British headquarters and other dependent states, considering the changes in the situation in the Far East and the great impact on Hong Kong's status, are extremely concerned about the situation in the Far East. As a result of the cooperation between the British government and the Telegraph Bureau, a new method will be agreed upon and implemented from the 15th of this month.

In the future, news from Hong Kong and the British Empire will be more accurate.

### Hong Kong's Prosperity is Superficial! Old Buildings in Central are Being Rebuilt, New Central Market Scheduled to Open on May 1

When we pass through Queen's Road Central or Des Voeux Road Central, we can see colorful sights. All phenomena fully indicate that the prosperity of Hong Kong is increasing day by day. The most obvious thing is that commercial shops are being demolished and rebuilt, or the facades are being renovated and decorated, tending towards prosperity. For example, the Central Market, which has been under construction for nearly a year and cost a lot of money, has now been completed and is scheduled to open on May 1. Its magnificence can be called the best in the Far East. In the vicinity, the old site of the Ma Yuk Shan Tea House, a street with eight shops, is now being rebuilt into a modern concrete building, now called the Gao Sheng Tea House, directly opposite the Central Market. The old Gao Sheng Tea House is now starting work, with the ground floor and the second floor being demolished and rebuilt with a new facade. In the future, it will be renamed Jinlong Restaurant, and an elevator will be installed, which can accommodate fourteen people up and down. The interior decoration is designed to be beautiful, roughly similar to the Yingjing Restaurant in Wan Chai. About a hundred yards away, there is also the newly built Nanhua Restaurant, which is six stories high, and the project is being accelerated. An elevator will also be installed in the future. Recently, Dexiang Tailor Shop, an old shop for decades, has also made a great determination to temporarily move to another place to operate, preparing to rebuild and replace it with a new ten-story building. In Des Voeux Road Central, the China National Goods Company is a two-story shop. Looking around Central, this is the only two-story building still standing, and there is no other place. Now workers are also being asked to speed up construction and put a modern coat on this old thing.

### Women's War Relief Association Hosts Large-Scale Theatrical Performance for Fundraising; Will Stage "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Diao Chan," Inviting Prominent Artists and Socialites to Star

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Since its establishment, the Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association, under the leadership of Mrs. Tan Fan, Liu Qingxuan, has worked diligently to raise funds and aid wounded soldiers and refugees. It has repeatedly remitted large sums of money and medical supplies to various front and rear areas in the country, strengthening the resistance effort and achieving remarkable results. It has been highly praised by people from all walks of life, and our military and political authorities have repeatedly commended it. Now, as the second phase of the war of resistance intensifies, the association aims to further assist with financial and material resources. Therefore, the women's war relief effort has become even more active. To raise funds for relief on a large scale, the association has specially invited prominent artists and socialites in Hong Kong to prepare for a large-scale theatrical performance for fundraising. After more than a month of preparation, everything is ready. The association has engaged famous playwrights to adapt the two great plays "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Diao Chan." Rehearsals are in full swing, and the performances will be held at the Lee Theatre at the end of next month. The play "Dream of the Red Chamber" is divided into six acts: (1) Lin Daiyu's First Visit to the Grand View Garden; (2) Daiyu Buries Flowers; (3) Baochai Catches Butterflies; (4) Qingwen Tears the Fan; (5) Shi Xiangyun Sleeps Drunk Amidst the Peonies; and (6) Yihong Celebrates a Birthday. Miss Guan Bixia, a famous socialite in Hong Kong, will play Lin Daiyu, Miss Mu Yun will play Baochai, Miss Jian Ming will play Shi Xiangyun, Miss Luo Qinsu will play Zijuan, Miss Li Huilan will play Qingwen, and Miss Tan Gong will play Qiao Jie. The remaining roles will be played by Hong Kong socialites. For the play "Diao Chan," Mr. Ruan Weiyang, an artist well-versed in Peking Opera and Cantonese Opera, will play Dong Zhuo, Mr. Liu Ruiqi will play Lu Bu, Miss Pang Lian'ai will play Diao Chan, Mr. Zhang Ye'ai will play Wang Yun, Mr. Li Zuojun will play Li Ru, Mr. Li Yang will play Emperor Xian of Han, and Miss Liu Ai'luan will play a maid. All are well-known socialites and drama masters in Hong Kong, and a grand and unprecedented performance is expected.

### Authorities to Hold Voluntary Registration for British-Born Chinese in Hong Kong This Month; Westerners' Registration Not Enthusiastic, Only Over a Hundred Registered as of Yesterday

The Hong Kong government, in preparation for extraordinary times, is conducting compulsory registration of British-born Westerners for conscription in wartime. The registration ordinance has been promulgated. According to our reporter's investigation, the authorities have now accepted the suggestion of representatives and will hold voluntary registration for British-born Chinese this month. Those who aspire to serve in the defense of Hong Kong can register with the government. The registration of Westerners is handled by the police authorities. This voluntary registration is different from compulsory registration; the former respects individual wishes and is not mandatory, while the latter is required by law. Those who violate the ordinance are subject to a fine of up to five hundred dollars or imprisonment for more than six months. The former does not require legal sanctions.

### Westerners' Registration Ends at the End of May

Westerners' registration ends at the end of May. The registration for Westerners runs from April 1 to the end of May, a period of two months. However, in the past few days, only over a hundred people have registered, and enthusiasm is lacking. Perhaps people think there is plenty of time and there is no need to rush. However, there are more than six thousand British Westerners in Hong Kong (according to the 1932 statistics, there were 6,684 people). If everyone rushes to register only when the deadline approaches, the staff will be overwhelmed. The police authorities, aware of this, have distributed forms to various businesses to encourage people to pay attention.

### British Women Temporarily Exempt from Registration

British women are temporarily exempt from registration. According to the registration ordinance, all British men in Hong Kong between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five, except for those in the navy, army, air force, Chinese or specially exempted by the government, must register. However, women are exempt from registration. According to inquiries yesterday, after the registration period expires, the authorities will recruit based on the registration forms to join various services. How they died, I still remember clearly.

### Innocent, Lively, Enthusiastic! Celebrating Children's Day

— By Ji Zhuo

A Quick Sketch of the Children's Day Commemoration at the Entertainment Theatre

"Long dong long dong yi long dong, today is exciting; the world used to belong to adults, now the world belongs to children."

—Although many children outside the circle of happiness are still threatened by darkness and hunger, the 20th century is the century of children, and progress is indeed being made.

The atmosphere of innocence and liveliness permeated Hong Kong and Kowloon. The celebration of Children's Day in Hong Kong yesterday was unprecedentedly enthusiastic.

The Children's Day commemoration held at the Entertainment Theatre was one of the three largest gatherings co-sponsored by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association.

At 9:00 AM, the upper floor of the Entertainment Theatre was packed with our two thousand little angels, so tightly squeezed together, like a box of unused matches. The dark earth is waiting for these boxes full of matchsticks to scatter and become kindling, to ignite a raging flame.

When the curtain opened, twenty or so little masters—representatives from various elementary schools—sat solemnly in a row. Not a single adult was on stage. This was a symbol of them starting to take charge of themselves.

The singing of the national anthem and the children's day song was very loud, and everyone's heart was moved by the great singing. After the formalities, Li Naihao, a child from the affiliated elementary school of Guanghua Middle School, delivered the opening speech. Feng Xiuzhen from the affiliated elementary school of Lingdao Girls' School, Li Ying from the affiliated elementary school of Xiangfu Middle School, and Yang Chenghui from the affiliated elementary school of Overseas Chinese Girls' School also spoke in succession. The bright calls shouted from these pure and careful hearts deeply made people feel ashamed and realize that "the younger generation is to be held in awe." Listen:

"...While we are happily celebrating Children's Day here, we should remember those homeless and unfortunate children in our motherland who are under bombardment! For the survival of China and the justice and righteousness of the whole world, our task is very important. Although we children are young, our aspirations and strength are not small, and there is no shortage of glorious and great deeds of children in history. We must strengthen ourselves in this great era."

"We cannot be decadent in our lives, we cannot be without ambition. When studying, we cannot just study books without thinking. We should study the principles of saving the country and saving humanity and immediately put them into practice."

The most moving speech was given by a representative of the child refugees from the Children's Shelter. In his fluent Mandarin, due to the surge of emotion, his voice trembled a little.

"It is very painful for us to commemorate Children's Day in this foreign land this year. Although our life in Hong Kong is still good, we will never forget that we were picked out from the flames of war. We are very grateful to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association for raising funds to set up small workshops for us. We hope to become workers who can build China."

A round of enthusiastic applause was given in the quiet air, and the entertainment began.

In the dozen or so programs performed by various schools, we feel that wise teachers generally teach active new lives. At the same time, we also regret that some teachers who are stuck in the past are binding the souls of children and turning them into "little old men" or "little old women"!

The most interesting performances were "Bombing Planes" by the affiliated elementary school of Guanghua Middle School, "Gymnastics Exercise One" by Zhonghua Middle School, and the song group from a certain elementary school. In addition, "Big Sword Dance" and "Shovel Knife Dance" by the affiliated elementary school of Guangzhong Girls' School, "Stacking Arhats" by the affiliated elementary school of Xiangfu Middle School, "Rhythmic Music" by the affiliated elementary school of Overseas Chinese Middle School, and "Triumphal Music" by the affiliated elementary school of St. Paul's Girls' School... all had their unique features. The atmosphere of the whole venue was both tense and lively. It is a pity that the song and dance of the "Selling Flowers Song" and the like, I believe that the instructors of the children's schools will definitely accept the baptism of the times in contrast!

It was past noon when the meeting ended. The sudden change in weather brought a cold wind. The vast number of children emitted heat from their sincere hearts, and separated and became active under the fierce cold wind.

Little masters: You must remember the group without Children's Day! Bless you to grow up in the great era!

### ×× Preparations Intensified; Hong Kong to Implement Arming of Merchant Ships; British Government Allocates £89,000; Taikoo and Whampoa Dockyards Undertake the Project

In order to maintain its reputation as a maritime power and to ensure that communication between the imperial headquarters and overseas countries is not seriously threatened in wartime, the United Kingdom has decided to expand its navy and build powerful warships. This plan has already been launched, so the work of various British shipyards is extremely busy. The project regarding the implementation of the wartime British merchant ship protection plan has been entrusted to the Taikoo and Kowloon dockyards in Hong Kong. This plan is a preparation for extraordinary events, especially in the midst of the current turbulent European situation, and its urgent implementation is even more necessary. It has been decided that 75% of British merchant ships will be equipped with armaments. The total cost is £89,000, which is included in the naval budget. The two dockyards have already started work. Many British merchant ships, including passenger ships, cargo ships, and oil tankers, have been armed here, most of which are equipped with four-inch guns. If a ship is required to transport goods to a combat zone, it will be equipped with equipment that can withstand the power of four-inch guns, such as the installation of steel plates. Shipyards in Singapore and Australia have also received the same instructions to undertake this project. Also,

### × Second Reinforcement; Jiangmen Engages in Another Heroic Bloody Battle; × Now Reinforced by Large Numbers from Guangzhou, Foshan, and Jiujiang; Our Valiant and Heroic Troops Determined to Defend Jiangmen; Xinhui × Aggressive and Fierce, Also Engaged in Bloody Battle

[Zhongshan Express News] The × army's invasion of Jiangmen this time harbors great ambitions. It intends to create a base in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River to control our connection between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau, so that it can either detour west to invade Zhaoqing, or retreat to eliminate our guerrilla teams in the central district to consolidate Guangzhou. Therefore, since our army captured Jiangmen on the morning of the 3rd, although the × army suffered heavy losses, it continued to reinforce in a desperate struggle. In the afternoon of the 3rd, it even continued to invade our forces, so the battle of Jiangmen broke out again, and the × army was more fierce and aggressive than before, seemingly willing to sacrifice everything to achieve its goals. Our soldiers and civilians are determined to defend Jiangmen, and their valor is particularly heroic. The city of Jiangmen × has engaged in a bloody battle again, and the news from here is recorded below.

### Second Reinforcement, Re-Invading Jiangmen

After the × army suffered a disastrous defeat, its ambition did not diminish. The × commander Que Tian repeatedly requested assistance from the southern invading × chief An Teng, attempting to struggle to the death. On the morning of the 3rd, more than a thousand × puppet troops were dispatched from Guangzhou, Foshan, and Jiujiang to Beijie to provide reinforcements. By 2:00 PM, the × army first used more than 20 aircraft to frantically bomb our army's positions in Jiangmen city and the Fanluo Dog Mountain area in the suburbs. The × warships in Beijie then densely fired artillery to cover the × army's advance along the Ningyang Railway to Tingmen. Our army was prepared and also densely fired machine guns and cannons to meet the × army. A bloody battle then began. The × army used the power of highly mechanized troops to fiercely attack our positions. The military and civilians fought to resist for several hours. In the fierce battle, all positions were destroyed. Our army retreated to the suburbs, holding onto the city suburbs, and continued to contend until about 6:00 PM, repeatedly clashing and forming a tug-of-war. The western military authorities have decided to continue to reinforce, and drive the × out of Jiangmen to shatter its conspiracy.

### Battle of Huicheng Becomes Stalemated Again

After our Jiangmen garrison retreated to the suburban positions, a part of the garrison gathered in Huicheng to continue to confront the × army. A bloody battle broke out again in Fengshan and the East Gate Railway Station area of Huicheng. The × army was aggressive and fierce, and used aircraft to bomb our positions violently. Our army fought bravely and suffered heavy casualties. Until the morning of the 4th, they were still contending near Fengshan. However, cannon fire was heard throughout the town of Xiaolan, which shows the intensity of the × army war. It was also found that the × army had added several × warships to invade Jiangmen and to assist the × army in combat along the coast of Xinhui. In addition to the six × warships in the Yinggezui waters, there are now more than 20 large and small × warships gathered in the Beijie waters.

### Jiangmen Street Fighting, City Area Decimated

After Jiangmen fell on the 1st, the × puppet troops immediately entered the urban area that day, set fire along the embankment, and committed large-scale × ×. When our Jiangmen army withdrew, it had already automatically bombed the city's major buildings and power plants. The whole city was dark at night, only to see the fire rising into the sky along the embankment. After the × puppet troops entered the city, they immediately searched everywhere. Most of the merchants and hotels had already fled, and the × puppet troops took everything they wanted. All the heavy items that could not be taken away were destroyed. The windows and doors were all damaged, and no part of the city was intact. Larger buildings, such as the Penglai Hotel, have not been completely destroyed, but have been occupied by the × army. By the 2nd, our army's main force arrived to counterattack, and Jiangmen city broke out into a fierce battle again. Our army was extremely aggressive, and the × army slightly resisted before fleeing in different directions to Waihai, Beijie, Zhutou Mountain and other places. Before leaving, they set fire again, which has not yet been extinguished. The Jiangmen urban area has been ravaged and has become a scorched earth.

### Countless × Army Losses

After several days of tug-of-war battles, the number of × army losses in Jiangmen cannot be counted. One × warship in the outer sea and river was sunk by our water mine. More than 100 × cavalrymen were wiped out by our ambush troops in Tangji. On the 1st, more than 700 rifles and three field guns were captured by us in the Beijie area. The rest were killed by our army's bayonet charge, an innumerable amount. According to intelligence from Jiujiang, more than 80 × wounded soldiers have been sent to Jiujiang in recent days. The serious losses can be seen from this.

### On the Dongjiang Front, Our Army Closes in on the × Front Line

[Huiyang Express News] After our Dongjiang army advanced steadily towards Zhencheng in recent days, the × army, due to its weak military strength, has retreated to Zhengguo, Zhonggu Mountain and other areas, and constructed fortifications, hoping to hold on firmly. In order to preserve our strength, our army will abandon the frontal attack and select a favorable terrain to closely monitor the × in that area. At the same time, the 8th Security Regiment was transferred from Boluo and advanced along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway via Zhangmutou, applying armed threats. The regiment arrived in Changping and Tangxia yesterday, and will approach the military front line within days. The × who have been occupying Wancheng and Shilong have gathered in fear of our advance.

### × Suffers Heavy Casualties Invading Xinhui and Heshan; Guangzhou × Army Is Weakly Garrisoned; City's × Troops Number Less Than 3,000; Fears of Our Counterattack, Extremely Strict Alert

[Beijiang Express News] After the outbreak of the Xinhui-Heshan war, the × suffered heavy casualties due to the heroic resistance of our civilians. Therefore, the × occupying Guangzhou city were forced to deploy troops to provide assistance. According to intelligence received by this military organization, Yue × chief An Teng Jili fears that Guangzhou × has been depleted of its troops and its military strength is weak. Our eastern army is advancing and counterattacking Guangdong city and he is terrified and has redeployed the city's × to the outskirts for defense. A part of the × 5th Division and the 18th Division, totaling about 2,000 troops, and the Kurume tank corps, the puppet army of Li Heyi, etc., are stationed in the city and suburbs, with a total of less than 3,000 troops. The strength is thin. The recent frequent transfers have been very busy. On the 30th, about 200 × troops from the Gutanigawa Company returned to Guangzhou through Zhongxin and Zhucun on the Guangzhou-Zengcheng line and were stationed in Longyan Mountain and Baiyun Mountain, strengthening the strength in the suburbs. Also, the × army sent out three or four hundred soldiers, who patrolled along the Guangzhou-Huadu, Guangzhou-Zengcheng, and Guangzhou-Humen highways, and implemented emergency alerts, prohibiting our villagers from traveling in and out to prevent our guerrillas disguised as civilians from infiltrating to attack. Their panicked situation is due to their weak military strength.

### Shipping News

The Canada Queen of the Chang and Company left Kobe for Shanghai yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 1:30 PM today and will arrive in Hong Kong at 7:00 PM tomorrow. It will leave on the 8th in the morning and go to the Philippines at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. The boat was supposed to arrive on the 7th, but due to the issue of the parts in Kobe, all the destinations have been delayed by one day.

The Yanfu of the Tai Zhang Steamship, originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday, had too much cargo to unload in Shanghai, and the vessel was slower, so the ship will be delayed until tomorrow before arriving in Hong Kong.

Tianyi of the Fuan Shipping Company has been repaired yesterday and is now sailing on the docks. According to the company, the ship will continue to travel to Hong Kong and Macau on Thursday or Friday, departing for Macau at 2 PM every day and returning to Hong Kong at 3:30 AM.

Since Jardine Matheson sold the Xian Sheng and has had no ship on the Sandakan route, the company has now leased the British vessel Ho Lu Jia to take its place. The ship is scheduled to depart on the 7th at 10 AM.

### National Blood Debt: Red Bank Suffered a Frenzied Bombing, Twenty to Thirty Bombs Dropped, Over a Hundred Casualties

On the 30th of February, eight enemy aircraft frenziedly bombed various locations in Kaiping, with Shuikou, Chikan, and Bai Sha suffering the most severe bombings. Apart from the reports about Shuikou, the situation in Bai Sha remains unclear. In Chikan, twenty to thirty bombs were dropped. The bombed locations included Guangzhen Suhang Shop and Yichang Gold Shop in the Lower Town, which were completely destroyed. Several bombs landed in the Lower Town market, in front of and across from the Dingxin Guandi Temple (formerly the Kaiping Middle School), and in the bamboo forest, causing the most severe casualties. Dozens of people who were taking shelter under the trees were killed or injured. The shops west of Pujidang in the Upper Town (near the pig market) were completely destroyed, with an unknown number of casualties. Bombs also landed in Lian Di in the Upper Town, in front of and behind the China Bookstore, and in the middle of the road east of the Kaiping Hotel in the Lower Town. Several bombs also landed at Kaiping Dingli Middle School, but only in the open space and on the campus, causing no damage to the school buildings or casualties. Three bombs landed on the vegetable fields behind the port affairs office in the Upper Town, killing and injuring over ten people. A bomb landed at a shop on Di Street, partially destroying the building. However, the villages outside the city were spared. The public's morale remains calm. It is estimated that over a hundred people were killed or injured in the entire town of Chikan. The tragic scene defies description.

Movies and Drama

### Introduction to First-Run Films: Review of Wu Zetian

— Yun

The script for "Wu Zetian," written by Song Zhidi, has been performed on stage numerous times, with excellent performances by Ying Yin and Yu Feng's troupes. The script itself has received much praise. Now, Xinhua Company has filmed it as a full-length feature, with Ke Ling as the screenwriter and Fang Peilin as the director. The film deviates slightly from Song Zhidi's script, but the plot remains largely the same, aiming to rehabilitate Wu Zetian.

Before the film begins, a title card briefly describes Wu Zetian's background and her two entries into the palace, omitting the nunnery scene from the stage version. The film opens with Wu Meiniang (i.e., Wu Zetian) entering the palace for the second time. At this point, Empress Wang informs Emperor Gaozong that Wu Meiniang has been brought into the palace. This portrayal of Empress Wang's virtue and generosity serves to highlight Wu Zetian's later cruel actions in framing her, evoking sympathy for the empress's misfortune, a very successful touch. The second part depicts Wu Meiniang's gaining favor and her initial interference in state affairs. Here, we believe that in the film, when Wu Meiniang requests to review state documents, Emperor Gaozong jokes that she is a female emperor, to which she replies, "Female emperor, female emperor, then the world is mine!" This effectively reveals her reliance on favor and the budding of her ambition to become emperor. However, realistically, at that time, despite being favored, she was merely a concubine, and there was still Empress Wang in the court. The statement "the world is mine" is an exaggeration and unrealistic. Because Wu Meiniang, as a woman capable of such grand ambition, was certainly not someone to act solely on emotion but would proceed cautiously step by step. Therefore, in the stage version, she coerces Gaozong to allow her to trim his eyebrows to win him over, and she uses his jest to plot to review state documents, using the saying "a ruler's words are not a jest" to achieve her goal through a mix of coercion and deception, which is more appropriate and reasonable.

The series of events, including celebrating the birth of the little princess, Gaozong's secret affair with Madam Han, and Wu Zetian strangling her own newborn daughter to frame the empress, are largely the same as on stage. However, there is one point that seems to be an oversight by the director: when Madam Han enters the palace to offer congratulations, she only congratulates the Emperor, ignoring her own sister Wu Meiniang, and sits next to Gaozong, causing Wu Zetian to display displeasure, making the scene very awkward. Although this is a minor detail, it seems worthwhile to mention, as who wouldn't hope for perfection?

Later, Empress Wang is deposed, Wu Meiniang is honored as the Heavenly Empress, and then Gaozong dies, all of which are very successful. Next, Wu Zetian deposes and replaces Emperor Zhongzong and ascends the throne herself, marking her zenith. Then, figures like Xue Huaiyi and the Zhang brothers appear. In Song Zhidi's script, Xue Huaiyi's background is clearly explained: Wu Meiniang knew Xue Huaiyi when she was in the nunnery, and they continued their affair even after she entered the palace. Naturally, he was the first to be favored when she became empress. Here, however, it is only mentioned in passing by people in a hotel, making the sudden appearance of this monk in the palace seem a bit abrupt. Also, in terms of casting, I believe that Li Huaiyi is more of a "dandy" than a "clown." Han Lan's portrayal as a full-blown clown, while adding some humor, is actually a distortion. As for Shangguan Wan'er's position, she is portrayed here as merely a singing and dancing girl. In reality, she was Wu Zetian's "inner minister." The other parts, such as Xu Ge's rebellion and Wu Zetian's triumphal celebration, as well as Wu's decline into old age and death, are all concise and clear, which is due to the director.

Overall, the film, despite some minor flaws, is generally very good. The opulent and splendid sets showcase Fang Peilin's expertise. The visual presentation is also quite beautiful, especially the scene where Gaozong visits the Cold Palace and the falling leaves express a sense of desolation, and the scene of Empress Wang's suicide is handled very well. The sound design is also decent, but the audio in the burning of the Mingtang and the troop movement into the palace does not adequately enhance the tension. The film's dialogue is specifically in a clear, Mandarin style, which is generally successful, although it can be a bit grating at times.

As for the actors, Gu Lanjun's portrayal of Wu Zetian is, of course, impeccable. Whether she's playing Diao Chan, Pan Jinlian, or Wu Zetian, she demonstrates a firm grasp of the strong personalities of these rebellious women. In "Wu Zetian," she is undoubtedly the first success. The second success would have to be Yin Xiucen. Seeing that Yin Xiucen is playing Gaozong on the cast list is surprising. Gaozong is an important character in the play, previously played by Gu Heling and Gu Eryi, with well-known results. Now, entrusting this role to a so-called "Fat Pig" comedian is worrying. However, watching Yin Xiucen's performance throughout the film, one cannot help but feel fortunate for the future of domestic films. He completely becomes a character actor, not just relying on his fat to elicit laughter. His portrayal of this incompetent emperor is subtle and nuanced, comparable to Louis XVI in "Empress's Scandal." Bai Hong's Shangguan Wan'er, however, has an identity issue. The clearest pronunciation in the entire film belongs to her, and her songs are extremely beautiful, which is probably why Shangguan Wan'er sings and dances in court. Other actors, such as Xia Xia as Empress Wang and Jiang Xiu as Shangguan Yi, put in a lot of effort despite having few scenes.

In short, "Wu Zetian" is worth recommending, especially in the current murky atmosphere of Hong Kong, where inexplicable films abound. To encounter a Mandarin film that can be described as "excellent" is something that enthusiasts of the eighth art and supporters of domestic films should not miss.

### Chaplin's New Film: Still a Mystery

Not long ago, news from Hollywood reported that, in retaliation for Germany's ban on his works, the comedian Charlie Chaplin was preparing to film "The Dictator." Chaplin is known to oppose sound films. Although sound films have been popular for ten years, replacing silent films, Chaplin has never spoken on screen or even acted in a sound film. However, his new film "The Dictator" is a sound film, and he will speak on screen, which has raised the question of how Chaplin will speak on screen, a hot topic of conversation in Hollywood.

The question of what Chaplin's voice sounds like through a loudspeaker has been resolved, as he has recorded his voice a few times. The mystery now lies in how he will speak on screen. If Chaplin changes his long-held aversion to silence on screen and his new film is a sound film, what kind of dialogue will he adopt? And will his debut sound film feature his usual smile? These are other questions.

According to Al Levys, who is close to Chaplin, "Chaplin will make at least three sound films in the future, but these are all accidental. After the plan is finalized, he may give up. The first words Chaplin says on screen will all be one syllable." Levys is Chaplin's business manager and knows more about Chaplin's situation than most people. In the past, Hollywood has repeatedly reported that Chaplin will shoot a sound film, but Levys has always denied it, and later it turned out that Chaplin did not have such a plan.

Chaplin often discusses sound films with friends. Some believe that Chaplin will always remain a silent film star, while others believe that he will slowly move into the realm of sound films for the sake of his career. However, any speculation is just castles in the air. It will only be certain when Chaplin's sound film begins shooting and is officially released. Therefore, although news of Chaplin filming "The Dictator" has spread in the film industry, whether it is a sound film and whether Chaplin himself will speak will only be confirmed upon release.

Chaplin only has one studio in Hollywood. Painters and carpenters are busy working there. When a film is being shot, the studio is very quiet, unlike other studios that constantly emit sound when shooting sound films. Chaplin himself is very busy planning or directing a scene. After his assistant, Card Haven, guides the work and a section is filmed, Chaplin sits alone in a canvas chair with his hands behind his head. No one disturbs him or talks to him, not even reporters, because this is when he is thinking, and no one can interrupt his thoughts. Every break between scenes is like this, and the stage is always silent. But if he really shoots a sound film, this quiet atmosphere may have to change.

### From Huiyang to Chao'an (Continued)

— Lin Guangjin

Two, Joining the Tense and Serious Ranks

My trip was originally an adventurous attempt to find work in Shao Guan. I had no confidence at all. Because of this, two different images constantly rose and fell in my mind. Sometimes I felt that I would become a grumbling and depressed wanderer, surrounded only by darkness, with no bright images. But sometimes I felt like a knight from medieval Europe, a modern-day civilian hero, full of tragic, passionate, and heroic emotions, feeling that the future was a bright and optimistic prospect.

Things often turn out unexpectedly. When I arrived in Keyuan, I unexpectedly met Mr. Li Guanli, the director of the political department of the ×× Corps. After we met, he inquired about the current situation in Huiyang, my work there, and my future intentions. He invited me to work in the political department there. I felt that it was the same as doing things anywhere, so I stopped my trip to Shaoguan. This can also be considered a lucky encounter.

On March 15th, I took off my casual clothes, put on a grass-green uniform, and began to join this new team. A fresh, forward-looking, lively, tense, and serious atmosphere surrounded me. At this time, a strange feeling occupied my heart, like a new bride's first night, both happy and afraid.

Because it was my first day on the job, I was not assigned any work. However, my colleagues were extremely busy, because they were leaving tomorrow. Because of this, I dared not chat with them too much, fearing that I would disrupt their work. I had to quietly stay aside and carefully consider their movements.

"Defend China..."

A burst of song came from the room, breaking the solemn atmosphere. Then everyone echoed softly. Although they were singing, they were unwilling to give up their work. I hope that this tense and lively situation will be maintained forever and spread to every occasion.

On the morning of the 16th, everyone got out of bed and quickly prepared their luggage and everything else, waiting for orders to advance towards Chao'an.

The clock had just struck eleven when the departure signal sounded, and we began to advance.

During the march, we received an order from Director Li, telling us to use our rest time to promote propaganda to the people on the one hand, and to give spiritual talks to the soldiers, tell stories, teach songs, and report current events on the other hand. Before doing this work, we estimated that the effect would be very low. Even Director Li dared not say that the soldiers who were running very tired would listen to you talk with great interest. However, the facts were exactly the opposite of what we imagined. With vivid and forceful expressions, and under the agitation of popular, concise, interesting, and passionately-flowing words, the soldiers listened intently. The unexpected success of this work increased our courage a thousandfold and strengthened our confidence to move forward in the face of difficulties.

We worked on the one hand and ran on the other, climbing mountains and crossing ridges. Although we were extremely tired physically, we felt infinite joy and excitement spiritually. After five days of this, we arrived at Xingning County, and on this evening, we received orders to rest for one day. We seized this opportunity and decided to perform a play the next evening, inviting all the officers and soldiers to watch it. This was to avoid relaxing our work on the one hand and to show our condolences on the other.

The anti-Japanese dramas performed that day were "××××" and "Guangzhou Has Fallen". Due to the urgency of time and the lack of props, there were naturally many shortcomings in the scenery and makeup. As for the expressions, although not very skilled, there were also many successful aspects. The most worthwhile thing to mention this time is the unity and cooperation between our officers and soldiers, such as Director Li and Secretary Long working enthusiastically backstage, and the chief of staff and Nong Nong participating in singing - chorus and solo, and the makeup actors of Sergeant Huang Hui, etc. This fully demonstrates the good phenomenon of officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates, uniting as one, which is indeed rare. This also proves the progress of our army in the process of the national liberation struggle! (To be continued)

### Xinghua Football Team's Farewell Match: Meeting Hualian in Jia Mountain, Starting at 5 PM, This Battle Is Expected to Be More Intense

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Although the Muhua football team's expedition this time was successful in the Philippines, earning high praise, it suffered setbacks in Hong Kong, losing both matches. This proves that Hong Kong football still ranks first in the Far East.

Today at 5 PM, Fanghua will go up the mountain again to fight, which is also a farewell contribution. According to general fans, today's battle will definitely be a bigger show and more intense competition than the past two matches. Because Xinghua has lost twice, it is a matter of face. In order to regain its reputation, it has no choice but to make a "desperate gamble" to seek victory, so that it can speak well to the "elders" of Nanyang when it returns.

The lineup of Xinghua is very similar to the second match, because the goal is to win and all strength must be used. However, Hualian's strength is also strong and it is definitely not easy to deal with. Although many of its strong players have not gathered because of the Eastern trip to Nanyang, the set lineup is quite effective. Both the front and rear lines use young players, while the backbone is supported by veteran players. Moreover, they believe that since South China and the expeditionary team to the Philippines have won, there is no reason why Hualian should fail. Therefore, it is also a matter of face and they are determined to fight to the death with Xinghua.

The strategy of the visiting team is that short passes are their strength and weakness. The so-called strength is that their feet are flexible and their passes are accurate. The so-called weakness is that they advance circuitously, wasting time and effort. Moreover, in the previous two matches, Xinghua only scored one goal in total, because they were not unable to find opportunities, but because they used too many short passes, it was difficult to find opportunities. If they use long passes and direct attacks, combining both methods, the effect will be greater.

Hualian's forwards can both pass and shoot, which will definitely pose a great threat to Xinghua. The three midfielders are experienced and can take care of everything. The inside backs use two "tough guys", so there is no worry about not being brave enough, only worry that the first cooperation will not be understood. Zhang Rongcai, the goalkeeper, has strong skills. Xinghua's forwards are used to going deep and then shooting. With this method of attack, it may not be easy to break his closed-door policy.

This match is Xinghua's last match in Hong Kong. They will take a ship south on the 7th. Someone suggested hosting a charity match, but there are many difficulties with this issue, and as the departure is imminent, this move may not be realized.

Tonight at 8 PM, South China will host a banquet for Xinghua's players at Guangzhou Restaurant. All Chinese and Western players from Xinghua who participated in the three matches will be invited to accompany them, so this banquet is both a farewell and a celebration.

The match will start at 5 PM at Jia Mountain. The lists of the two teams are as follows:

Xinghua

Li Botang

Chen Kaiwan Sun Chunlai

Xu Houkun Zhu Cheng Ji Youling

Cai Yuehan Guan Zong Xie Qingfu Long Liewu Wu Zhanshi

### First Division Football League: Scottish Wins Over South China Hua, 3-1, A Dull Performance with Few Spectators

Yesterday, South China Hua and Scottish played the second week of the football league at So Kon Po Stadium. Because the weather was cold and the teams' performance had lost hope of winning the championship, the victory or defeat was no longer a problem. Few fans went to watch the game, as rare as morning stars. Yesterday's performance by the two teams was also lacking in tension. About 20 minutes after the start of the first half, Liu Mao pushed Scottish player Barri with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick, which was scored by Billie. Not long after, because Kellar touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area, the referee also awarded South China a penalty kick, which was scored by Shui Yi, leveling the score. Soon after, Liu Mao missed a kick in front of the goal, allowing Binker to advance and put the ball into the net, ending the first half with a score of 2-1. After changing ends and fighting again, Xie Hong committed a foul outside the 20-yard line. Marçal took the penalty kick and shot straight into the goal with great force. Although Qi Rong's hand touched the ball, it still leaked into the net. After that, the two teams had offensive and defensive plays, but neither team scored. As a result, the game ended with a score of 3-1.

### Regarding Watching Football Games, There Should Be Three Supplementary Rules

— Zhuoyue

In late last month, in this publication, I read Mr. Luo Xia's great work "Three Rules That Football Spectators Should Have". He used Professor Thorndike's three laws of learning to discuss the three rules that football spectators should have. He spoke very logically and in great detail. After reading it, I benefited a lot and was very grateful. Therefore, I have to contribute three supplementary laws based on what Mr. Luo said.

Compatriots, I feel that there is a somewhat optimistic aspect to the sports cause of Hong Kong compatriots, which lies in everyone's enthusiastic emotions when watching football games. If this enthusiasm can be transformed, it will be easy to promote the sports cause and achieve the hope and purpose of universal development. Because everyone must have a strong interest in sports to go to watch the game. Since they have this strong interest in sports, they will also have the concept of sports training. Simply put, they may have a tendency to play ball and a motivation to participate in ball games. When everyone has this concept or tendency and motivation, if the sports environment can be slightly improved, the concept or will of everyone to implement sports training can be strengthened. So now the only lack is that everyone is bound by the environment and does not have the ability to implement sports. I honestly tell everyone that no matter what it is, if you just watch, or even have a tendency to do it, but do not have the ability to try it in practice, the benefits you get will be very few. Especially in the field of sports, in terms of watching football games, no matter how absorbed you are or even how you gesticulate and dance, you can only get temporary pleasure or sadness. To put it nicely, you can broaden your horizons, but what benefits do you get for your own body and mind? I believe that the benefits are very few. Therefore, I want to say to everyone - it is best to have this enthusiastic emotion of watching football games, but before going to watch the game, or after watching it, you must have the three rules mentioned by Mr. Xia, and in addition to these three rules, there are also more important ones, which are the three rules that I am talking about now. They are described as follows:

### The Macau Lingnan Basketball Team Returns to Macau Today

The Macau Lingnan Branch School basketball team, led by teacher Liang Jianping of the school, came to Hong Kong on the 1st of this month and competed with the reporters and Pui Ying teams. Last night, the 4th, Li Yinglin, the president of Lingnan University, hosted a dinner at the Luk Kwok Hotel. In addition to the team of sixteen people, Lingnan University faculty members Xie Zhaojie, Yu Duanliang, Xu Kangning, and Chen Rurui, the principal of the Hong Kong Lingnan Branch School, were also invited. During the banquet, President Li gave a speech, encouraging the team members to work hard. Chen Rurui then gave a speech, and finally Liang Jianping gave a speech on behalf of the team, and everyone dispersed in joy. The team will leave Hong Kong and return to Macau today.

### Tonight's Basketball Matches - Two First Division Games, Qingzhi vs. Nanhua Postponed, Hong Kong University vs. Huanan Added

Open Men's Basketball Tournament: According to the original schedule, starting at 6:30 tonight, the first game was to be Division B, Qingzhi vs. Nanhua. However, according to the person in charge of that club, this game will be postponed. At that time, the Division A game, Hong Kong University vs. Huanan, will be added. The second game is Division A, Guangda vs. Nanhua, and the last game is Division B, Lixing vs. Hongxing. Among the games, Guangda vs. Nanhua is the more interesting.

### Nanhua B Wins Championship, Yesterday Defeats Skott 4-0

(Our Newspaper Special Report) Yesterday at 3:30 PM, Nanhua and Skott played in the Division B league at  Happy Valley Field. This battle was extremely important for Nanhua. If they won, they would win the championship. If they lost, even the runner-up position would not be theirs. A draw would mean that they would tie with the 5th Battalion Artillery and the Middlesex, and another final would be required to determine who would win the trophy. Therefore, under these serious circumstances, Nanhua knew that only victory would suffice. As a result, the entire army worked together with great spirit and morale. After the start of the game, Nanhua frequently had the advantage. Ye Runbo opened the scoring first, and Chen Zhongxian contributed two goals, ending the first half with a score of 3-0. In the second half, Zhongxian scored one more goal, resulting in a major defeat of Skott by a score of 4-0. From then on, the championship seat was occupied by Nanhua. As for the runner-up, it will be determined by the final battle between the 5th Battalion Artillery and the Middlesex.

### Children's Day in Ap Lei Chau

— Cai Lusheng

A spirited celebration in the overcast and cold wind. - Hong Kong News Feature

In our motherland, which is being crazily invaded by fascist troops,

countless innocent young compatriots are either sacrificing their innocent and precious lives for no reason, or losing their lovely homes, warm families, and dear parents and siblings, suffering under heavy worries and distress.

While this battle between justice and violence is still raging, we are commemorating this "Children's Day" that belongs to the children. Thinking of the sad young compatriots who are struggling in pools of blood and weeping in oceans of tears, I really don't know how to express my grief and sympathy!

Yesterday, in the enthusiastic celebration of the April 4th Children's Day held throughout Hong Kong, one of its branches -- Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau -- also gathered students from local primary schools and hundreds of children from all walks of life, as well as the children's parents and guests, under the leadership of more than a dozen teachers who were responsible for local education, to hold a very enthusiastic celebration. The association paid special attention to entertaining the poor and out-of-school children in the local area, so the situation may have been slightly different from other places.

These days, the residents of Ap Lei Chau just happened to build a huge stage to "celebrate" the "Jade-Sealed Hong Sheng Bodhisattva's Birthday" and put on a "grand opera" called "Awakening China Troupe." The "April 4th" memorial meeting conveniently borrowed their stage to be the venue. It was a floating platform built on the water, covered with sunflowers and mats on all sides and the top, and very spacious inside, with seating for two or three thousand people under the stage. In the center of the old-fashioned stage, decorated with colorful decorations, was the flag of the Party and the State and the portrait of the Premier. Looking at it occasionally, it would give people the feeling of "old wine in new bottles."

The weather was very gloomy and cold, and the low black clouds were full of sorrow, but the number of people attending the celebration did not decrease as a result. Before the meeting started, all the seats under the stage were already full, and the students from each school also took their seats one after another. They were all innocent and lively, wearing various school uniforms: worker uniforms, army uniforms, sailor uniforms... all quite neat and tidy. But when you look at the children from outside, most of them were wearing tattered clothes and had dirty faces. Needless to say, you would know what kind of people they were.

The meeting started at ten o'clock. After a solemn ceremony, Ms. Yu Feng, the chairwoman of the presidium, gave a speech, recounting the history of Children's Day and the meaning of celebrating Children's Day, which was to promote children's happiness and seek national rejuvenation. At the same time, she alerted and told every child and child's parents about the importance of basic education in childhood, roughly saying: "...A successful person must have received excellent education as a child; conversely, a person who is a failure must have received very bad education during childhood!..." Finally, she reported a rather shocking tragedy, which was that the ×× warlord in the southern battlefield had actually… in order to save their dying soldiers.

! Then, several children's representatives gave speeches, which were very pertinent and appropriate, roughly saying that we should not forget our suffering compatriots of the same era when we are happy! It moved every listener very much.

After the speeches, the entertainment program began! First, the elementary school students from the neighborhood charitable school, wearing army uniforms, sang "The Big Sword March." Another was dressing up as farmers, workers, soldiers, and wearing hoes and broadswords, and Chongyu students with small mustaches sang "Joint Military-Civilian Resistance." There were also songs from the Fishermen's School, Li Sheng Girls' School, Hua Girls' School, and Jianguang School, as well as martial arts... etc. One of the most exciting programs was the one-act play "Little Guerrilla Team" performed by Jianguang School. Their performance skills were very skilled, and the plot was very tense and stimulating. When the ×× warlord was killed by the "Little Guerrilla Team," many of the children present enthusiastically applauded. The meeting ended at a little after eleven o'clock at noon. Then, the students from various schools who participated in the celebration, and the children from outside, a total of more than a thousand people, gathered in teams on the streets of Ap Lei Chau to parade, singing majestic and passionate songs of national salvation: "Defend China," "National General Mobilization," "March of the Volunteers," etc. The entire uncivilized territory of Ap Lei Chau was suddenly filled with the roar of our new future elite. After the parade, each child happily took the gifts prepared by the association and dispersed.

Finally, what the children in Hong Kong -- especially the many "golden branches and jade leaves" young ladies and young masters -- should understand is that Children's Day is not just about celebrating it once and being done with it. Everyone should get rid of all bad habits, practice frugality to save the country, and do their best to save the many young compatriots who are mired in misery and the little refugees who are wandering the streets.

### Starting with Tea

— Zheng Yulang

The spring scenery on the island is beautiful. In the "comfortable nest," we can't hear the sound of cannons, smell the gunpowder, and there are no × people's planes to harass us. People who enjoy themselves certainly won't let this great spring scene pass by. He (she) is also having his "Cola" enjoyment.

The season for inviting people to "spring tea" has arrived. Every night, every luxurious restaurant is busy doing spring tea business. Today is Mr. So-and-so, tomorrow is So-and-so's shop, circulating endlessly. You invite me, I invite you, everyone is busy and very busy inviting people to spring tea.

After tea and wine, when they are tired of eating abalone and shark fin, they will also talk about "state affairs."

"Why hasn't Guangzhou been counterattacked yet?"

"Why did ×× have to retreat?"

They are very anxious, they seem very concerned.

"Anxious" we are all anxious, "concerned" we are also concerned, except for the Han traitors and national traitors, everyone is anxious, everyone is concerned. But, "why?" A question, but unfortunately few people try to explore it!

Empty anxiety and lip service concern are of no avail. "Why hasn't the counterattack been launched yet?" "Why retreat?" The problem is not difficult to answer, nor does it require others to answer. We can answer it ourselves.

Under the total war of resistance, the heavy responsibility of the war of resistance rests on the shoulders of every citizen of the Republic of China. "Regardless of the north and south, regardless of men, women, old and young, everyone must be responsible for the war of resistance." We must not enjoy ourselves in the foreign concessions without contributing our efforts or money, and blame the fighters on the front line, blame the government, and shout indiscriminately. "Why hasn't the counterattack been launched yet?" "Why did ×× have to retreat?"

When watching a soccer game, the spectators will be very keen and concerned, accusing this player of not doing this and that player of not doing that, but they never think about how hard the players are kicking. If these "smart" spectators were asked to play, I don't know what they would do?

The difference between the players and the spectators in soccer is already so far, let alone fighting a war? Fighting a war is not a joke. People who don't contribute money or effort are rashly accusing the soldiers on the front line, which is really harsh.

"Why hasn't the counterattack been launched yet?" "Why did we have to retreat?" The answer is: We have not fulfilled our responsibilities.

Are you anxious for the counterattack? - Then you should quickly fulfill your responsibilities to the country.

Are you concerned about the retreat? - Then you should quickly fulfill your responsibilities to the country.

We are all responsible for the delay of the counterattack and the retreat of the places.

During the war of resistance, personal waste is the consumption of the country. Taking "spring tea" as an example, it must of course be saved. If you are anxious for the counterattack and concerned about returning to the country, you must save personal expenses for the sake of the country.

### A Record of Ballads from the Late Qing Dynasty

— Ying

The Gengzi Rebellion Ballad

Written by Li Bo. Published by the Shijie Fanbi Newspaper Office in the Renyin year of Guangxu (1901). It tells the story of the Gengzi Rebellion and is a masterpiece of late Qing ballads. The whole book has forty chapters, with a preface stating the motivation for writing: "...Now that peace has been achieved, the feelings of the people have changed drastically, and the habits of arrogance, extravagance and dissipation have returned to the hearts of the people, and the style of perfunctoriness and evasion of responsibility still prevails in the world. It is almost as if times have changed and circumstances have shifted. Therefore, the author has written the Gengzi Rebellion Ballad." It is a work of emotion, not only a poetic history.

The Boxer Rebellion Ballad

Written by Xisheng. Published in the Xinhai year of Xuantong (1911). The lithographic edition has two volumes and twenty chapters, in two books, with illustrations. The full title is "An Illustrated Secret Novel of the Boxer Rebellion." According to this, it is actually a reprint of the first half of "The Gengzi Rebellion Ballad." The pseudonym was probably changed by the bookseller.

The French Heroine Ballad

Written by the Poet of Lament. Published by the Xiaoshuo Lin Society in the Jiachen year of Guangxu (1904). It tells the story of Madame Roland. The whole book has ten chapters, in one volume. It says at the beginning: "The green pine and red sleeves are pitiful insects, their rouge and powder are worn away by their patriotic achievements. Who buys the ten thousand worth of seven-scented silk, everyone is fighting to be heroes." It also says: "The European wind and rain are boundless, and the atmosphere in the women's world is dull. Nothing can be more gratifying than the brush tip being released, and the flowers of freedom blooming newly in spring." There are also two concluding poems, one of which says: "The affairs of the vast Central Plains are sad, do you know that the people are already exhausted? The ruler and the picture have many intermittent colors, and half of the three-tiered society is attached to entertainment. I shed a handful of tears to lament the times, and a thousand people see me as crazy. Only care about the little children in the red window, and read ballads by lamplight every night."

A Sudden Return

Written by Chen Tianhua. A propaganda booklet by revolutionaries at the end of the Qing Dynasty, later included in "Miscellaneous Pickings of Manchus and Chinese" compiled by Si Hanzi. It is an anti-Manchu work that enumerates the crimes of the Manchus occupying the Han people's world for more than two hundred years, the crises of China, and urges everyone to drive out the Manchus and save themselves. Every time a section is sung, it is explained, with more prose than singing. It begins: "The earth has been in decline for hundreds of years, the beacon fires are rolling and blood is flowing. It is heartbreaking to count the events of that time, who among our compatriots will avenge our humiliation." Then, a section of prose, and then the main text begins: "Take the clapper drum and sit on the long street, sing loudly, I respect you, fellow compatriots, listen carefully, our China was originally a famous great power, unlike that small land, which is located in a remote corner..."

### In Songzhuang

— Li Qiao

A Memory of the Breakout from Xuzhou

After retreating from Yuwang Mountain, we arrived at Songzhuang. We rested at Songzhuang for two days.

Songzhuang is about thirty miles away from Taierzhuang, not far from the Suyangshan Station. There are more than a dozen sorghum huts unique to northerners, but the rooms are crowded with refugees who fled from the front line. The quiet and flat ground outside is interwoven with tall green trees, like an incomparably cool park. At night, we wrapped ourselves in a gray blanket and slept under the shade of the trees, opening our eyes that wanted to sleep but couldn't bear to sleep, watching the clear moonlight that penetrated through the gaps in the trees, and feeling a kind of poetic feeling like chewing something sweet.

At dawn, three or two × planes flew and circled overhead, but with the cover of so many trees, what could it detect? Sometimes, these stupid × planes would aimlessly drop bombs in some distant villages, and hearing the buzzing sound like thunder, we couldn't help but laugh.

"Damn it, the Japanese people's hard-earned money was tricked into bombing our fields! - Okay, let's see how much you can do!"

The sound of cannons kept coming from afar, like bursts of thunder. The sky was as clear as a blue sea, and the green wheat in the fields was lying quietly under the caress of the warm sunlight. One or two "cicadas" hid on the treetops and shouted desperately, breaking the silence of noon.

The brothers who had fought hard on Yuwang Mountain for more than twenty days and had not had a rest, loved to doze off under the shade of the trees during the day. The countryside was quiet, and no one was seen. There was only the glaring and intense sunlight, shining lonely on the threshing floor, on the wheat...

Boom! Boom! A burst of artillery fire rang out again. Climbing up from under the shade of the trees, I looked in the direction of the artillery fire. In front of me were still mountains, trees, villages, fields, wheat, and no sign of war could be seen. But in that green field, a long stretch of dark people, like ants, were flowing towards Songzhuang...

"Folks, where are you going?" Looking at the man who came forward, his face covered with panic, driving a donkey cart loaded with luggage, women, and children, his face full of sweat, we couldn't help but ask with sympathy, as if we had seen some relatives.

"I don't know!" The man stopped the donkey cart, looking at us miserably, seeming to feel a little lost.

"You don't know, where are you going? Ah, -"

We sighed at their vague and unknowable future, and as soon as our eyes turned to the endless stream of people behind, the man whipped the thin donkey carrying the heavy burden, and the donkey desperately dragged the cart, flying up a cloud of yellow dust, and rushed to catch up with the people who had gone far away.

People, constantly, walked over in a mess, and walked to the luxurious fields. Everyone was carrying a circle of only property - luggage, some carrying a bundle of sorghum stalks, and holding a piglet that refused to move forward, always grunting. The dog followed its master with its tongue hanging out. A seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl smeared a healthy red face with black soot to make it look so ugly, wrapped a torn headscarf on her head, and wore a large, tattered dress, looking like she was forty or fifty years old. The old man, with tears in his eyes, staggered and sneaked into the flood of people. The children with tender little feet who could no longer find their way followed behind their mothers who were carrying heavy burdens on their backs, crying for help, but who could save them?

Looking at this group of displaced compatriots who could not finish walking, even though the battlefield life of the past month or so had tempered my heart so hard, I couldn't help but shed tears at this time!

Ah, who made these compatriots of ours homeless? What can we repay him with except hand grenades?

### Little Neighbor (Continued)

— Du Ai

"Please speak to Mr. Lin, alright? I want to go back to the inland to do children's corps work."

"That's very ambitious. But you are still too young. Your mother won't let you go."

"Why wouldn't she let me? We are at aunt's house, it's very annoying. Mom said she wants me to go shine shoes on the street. Wouldn't going back to the inland be better?" he said anxiously.

I didn't want to discourage him, I said:

"How about you go ask your mother?"

He really ran back home happily.

However, in the evening, an annoying thing happened. A woman's incessant scolding appeared on my veranda. She said that I had corrupted her child.

After that, the short wall in between seemed to suddenly become higher, the little neighbor was rarely seen, and the singing stopped on some morning.

I knew he really took up the job of shining shoes. One day, I ran into him on the street, and he became flustered when he saw me.

"Why don't you sing anymore?"

He stared blankly and blinked his eyes, murmuring:

"I go to the pier early in the morning."

'Do you earn a lot?'

'There are too many kids doing this job, what good is it! And you always have to guard against the leather tips of the police.' He laughed sarcastically. 'It's really annoying, I want to go back to Xiqiao, to do children's corps work.' He slammed the shoe-shining box on the ground.

'Good, there will be such an opportunity eventually.' I comforted him.

At night, on the veranda, I handed him a popular reading material "The Three Sisters of Guandong."

'I won't call you Little Neighbor anymore, I'll call you Little Fist, okay? You practice your little fist, like the Three Sisters of Guandong, to drive the Japanese devils out.'

He laughed heartily, his eyes shining gold in the night. (The End)

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

Life is first, chastity and self-esteem are second. When there is no need to worry about life, one then thinks about protecting chastity and self-esteem. Ninety-nine percent of women are like this, and she is too. When she was being dragged away, her head was covered, her hands were held, she felt that a rude man was violating her body, which had never been touched by any man, a body she had always been proud of. Even her father valued his daughter's body, and would not lightly touch it. She thought that her chastity and self-esteem had almost been damaged by him; it seemed that he was intentionally damaging them, even, coming for the sake of damage. At this time, what she felt was not the threat to life as before, but the fear between the sexes. Now, towards a rude man and just now towards a thug, although they are two different things, the degree of aroused revulsion and terror is equal - even the startle of a black night cat is the same; because she is the weaker one. Therefore, she trembled, struggling backwards, making him carry a heavy load in his progress.

After a moment, the sweat dripping from his head melted the frozen white frost on the edge of his hat - turning into water and wetting his cheeks. He stopped, panting, not because of lack of physical strength, but because he realized that this was not a solution to the problem. After he put her down in a place where the snow on the road was shallow, he patted her with a comforting feeling, and smoothed her hair. She immediately pushed his hand away, in her opinion, his every move was a sin. She cursed:

'Dog man, even if I'm still a little… Get out, you dog man, you shameless thing… Get out, get out…'

As if never forgiving him, as if women never forgiving men's licentious sins.

He stepped back a little, but he refused to surrender to someone who could be subdued by himself, and came back again. (27)
